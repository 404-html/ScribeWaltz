1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.231
All right,

2
00:00:01.231 --> 00:00:06.231
we've been talking about the question as to whether or not it would be desirable

3
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:07.441
to live forever,

4
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:11.700
whether in mortality would actually be a good thing as most of us normally

5
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:16.440
presume or whether in fact as Bernard Williams argues a,
it would be undesirable.

6
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.020
And the question returned to was just let your imagination run free instead of

7
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:26.100
asking what would it be like to continue living along the kind of trajectory

8
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:30.600
that humans having the real world where you just get sicker and,
and uh,

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.910
more and more frail and incapacitated.

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.600
Ask yourself not whether immortality of that sort would be valuable,

11
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:41.400
but isn't even so much as possible to describe a life that you'd want to live

12
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:41.701
forever.

13
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:46.500
That's the question I left you with last time and yeah,

14
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:49.650
I think I already tipped the,
took my cards on this matter.

15
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.640
I'm inclined to agree with Williams.

16
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.310
I think that no matter how we try to fill in the blank,

17
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.380
so very long blank,

18
00:00:58.381 --> 00:01:02.460
the crucial point here of course is that immortality means not just living a

19
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:05.520
very long time or even an extraordinarily long time,

20
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:09.480
but literally living forever.
I think it's very difficult indeed.

21
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:13.620
I think it's impossible to think of anything you'd want to do forever.

22
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.490
And I have a friend who wants claim to me that he wanted to live forever so that

23
00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:22.290
he could have Thai food every day for the rest of,
well,
the rest of eternity.

24
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.680
I like Thai food just fine.
Uh,

25
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:30.120
but the prospect of having Thai food day after day after day after day for

26
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:32.190
thousands,
millions,
billions,

27
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.510
trillions of years no longer seems an attractive proposal.

28
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.030
It seems like it becomes some kind of a nightmare.

29
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.990
And the same way that I indicated previously,
that although I like chocolate,

30
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.960
I love chocolate.
Uh,

31
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.470
the prospect of having to eat more and more and more and more and more
chocolate,

32
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.000
eventually the idea becomes a sickening one thing of any activity.

33
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.590
Some of you may enjoy doing crossword puzzles,
uh,

34
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.230
and perhaps doing crossword puzzles a couple hours a day is enjoyable.

35
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:05.310
But imagine doing crossword puzzles every day for 10 years,

36
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.050
a thousand years,
a million years,
a billion years,
a trillion years,

37
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.100
eventually,
presumably.
So it seems to me you'd end up saying,

38
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.810
I'm really tired of crossword puzzles.
Uh,

39
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.850
sure there'll be some new particular puzzle you hadn't seen before,

40
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.330
but you sort of step up a level and say,

41
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.120
although I haven't seen this particular one before,

42
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.480
I've seen crossword puzzles before.

43
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.410
There's really nothing new under the sun here.
In fact,

44
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:41.250
that I haven't seen this particular combination of words isn't enough to make it

45
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:43.290
interesting.
Well,

46
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.610
crossword puzzles are in a very deep subject and we might want to do whether or

47
00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:52.611
not we will do better if we were engaged in something more mentally challenging

48
00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:56.940
than that.
Uh,
this may indicate something,
uh,
unusual about me,

49
00:02:56.941 --> 00:03:01.941
but I rather like math and prospect of having a lot of time to pursue math

50
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:05.210
problems have a richer and deeper sort.
Uh,

51
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.250
it seems fairly attractive yet even there when I imagine an eternity of thinking

52
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:14.830
about math or for that matter and eternity of thinking about philosophy,

53
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.650
which I obviously like even more than math,

54
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.680
the prospect seems an unattractive one.

55
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.660
I can't think of any activity I'd want to do forever.
Now,

56
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.100
of course that's a bit of a cheat because the claim isn't to spend eternity

57
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:33.310
doing math problems and nothing but math problems.

58
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.850
Right now with our 50,
80 a hundred years,

59
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.570
we don't fill our day doing only one kind of activity.

60
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.660
We fill our day with a mixture of activities

61
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.430
but doesn't really help having Thai food for dinner and a Chinese for lunch or

62
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:53.020
perhaps Chinese on Monday,

63
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:57.400
Wednesdays and Fridays and tie on Saturdays and Sundays and spending two hours

64
00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:00.970
in the afternoon doing math and three hours in the morning doing philosophy.

65
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.850
That sounds like a pretty pleasant life.
But again,

66
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:08.851
if you think of the possibility of doing that for all eternity and never getting

67
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.030
away from it ever being free from it,

68
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.240
the the positive dream of immortality I think becomes a nightmare.

69
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.260
Well,
again,
maybe I'm not just being creative enough in my imagination.

70
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.930
Different former colleague of mine once talked about the prospect of having a

71
00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:33.830
kind of a heavenly vision of,
of the divine,
uh,

72
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.220
maybe that would be desirable forever.

73
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.670
And she described it as thinking of what it's like to have a really great

74
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:44.590
conversation with a friend that you wish would never end except God's is

75
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:46.270
infinitely rich friend.

76
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:51.100
And so the conversation ends up seeming desirable forever.
Well,
again,

77
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.170
I can save the words,

78
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.970
but when I try to imagine that possibility and take it seriously,

79
00:04:57.971 --> 00:05:01.810
at least speaking personally,
it doesn't,
it doesn't hold up.

80
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.930
No friend that I've ever talked with is one that I actually would want to spend

81
00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:09.820
eternity talking to.

82
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.150
And it's of course possible to say,
well,

83
00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:17.080
just imagine a friend that you wouldn't want to talk through all eternity to.

84
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.070
But the whole point is,

85
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.130
I can't imagine what that would be like when I do my best to imagine some kind

86
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:28.390
of existence that would be desirable or attractive forever.

87
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.590
It just doesn't work.
It becomes a nightmare.
Well,
again,

88
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.790
maybe what we need to do is not so much just imagine the same cycling going

89
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:39.730
through week after week after week,
but whole careers.

90
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.800
Maybe you could spend 50 or a hundred years pursuing philosophy,
uh,

91
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:45.081
as a,

92
00:05:45.081 --> 00:05:49.630
as your career and then 50 or a hundred years pursuing math as your career in 50

93
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:54.040
or 100 years traveling around the world in 50 or a hundred years,
uh,

94
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.980
being an artist and working on your watercolors or,
or it is,

95
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.380
well,
that certainly seems like we could probably get more time out of that.

96
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.360
But again,
the crucial point to remember is that forever is literally forever.

97
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.430
There is no life that I'm able to imagine for myself.

98
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.540
That's one that I would want to take on forever.

99
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.453
<v 1>Well,</v>

100
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.800
<v 0>might say surely there could be creatures that would want to live forever.</v>

101
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:31.400
That one enjoy an eternal existence.
And I think that's probably right.

102
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.290
So scientists have learned how to do the following.

103
00:06:34.291 --> 00:06:38.360
There are certain you can take a rat and put an electrode in its brand if you

104
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:41.260
put the electrode in just the right place.
Then when,
uh,

105
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.680
the electro gets turned on,

106
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:45.950
it stimulates the pleasure center in the rat's brain and it,

107
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:50.000
and it gets a little burst of pleasure,
a pretty intense burst of pleasure.

108
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.360
And in fact,
you can,
you can take the,
the,
the wire,

109
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:58.361
the electrode and hook it up to a lever and teach the rat how to push the lever

110
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.970
and give itself a little burst of pleasure.
Now,

111
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:05.120
what happens to rats when you do this?
Well,

112
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.140
maybe unsurprisingly what they do is they,
they keep pressing the lever.

113
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.870
Indeed they are pressed the lever and they'll stop eating.
Uh,

114
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.750
they're no longer interested in sex.

115
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:19.730
They basically just give themselves as little orgasmic burst of pleasure.
Well,

116
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.360
until they die.
Now,
well of course,

117
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.550
sort of too bad the rat dies.

118
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:29.750
But if we imagine the rat not being mortal,

119
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:33.650
perhaps we've got it on I v a so it's getting its nutrients that way,

120
00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:38.651
then perhaps it's easy to imagine the rat simply pressing the lever forever,

121
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.140
getting this intense burst of pleasure and,

122
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.430
and being content to do that for all eternity.

123
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.630
So if it's so easy to imagine that for the rap,
why not for us?

124
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.750
Why not just put our own orgasmatron hat on with a little,

125
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.630
not rat lever,

126
00:07:56.631 --> 00:08:01.250
but now human lever with the electrode stimulating our own brains so that we get

127
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:06.251
this intense burst of pleasure and just imagine this intense burst of pleasure

128
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.150
going on forever.

129
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.660
What could be more desirable than that?

130
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:13.540
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

131
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.720
<v 0>except when I think about that and I invite you to think about that.</v>

132
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.250
I don't actually find that in especially attractive prospect.

133
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.590
Mind you,
it's not that I think we couldn't be,
uh,

134
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.280
stimulated to get pleasure forever.

135
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.400
It's that there's something that distinguishes humans from rats when I,

136
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:34.510
no,

137
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:39.510
no doubt I would enjoy it and no doubt you would enjoy it for a very long time.

138
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.260
But I imagine that after a period there'd be this,
well,

139
00:08:44.261 --> 00:08:49.000
humans have this ability to look down on their experiences,
right?

140
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.440
Or look,
step back from their experiences and,
and sort of assess them.

141
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.370
Even now,
as I'm sitting lecture into you,

142
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.700
part of me because of this very question that I'm raising is thinking about

143
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.150
how's the lecture going and am I going to get through what I need to get through

144
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:04.020
and so forth and so on.

145
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.880
We can reflect on our first order of base level experiences.

146
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.260
Now imagine then that you're in the,
the pleasure of making machine

147
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.630
after a while,
part of you is going to start asking,
Huh?
See,

148
00:09:19.631 --> 00:09:24.330
it feels the same as it was yesterday and the day before that and the day before

149
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:24.420
that.

150
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.650
I imagine this is how it's going to feel tomorrow and the day after that and the

151
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.050
day after that and eventually this question would start,

152
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.170
is this really all there is to life?

153
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.380
Just simple pleasure like this.

154
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.250
Think about being human is unlike the rat.

155
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.330
You're not just going to stay caught up in the moment.

156
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.870
You're going to take this metal level or higher level standpoint.

157
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.680
Look,
Don at the pleasure in wonder,
is this all there is to life?

158
00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:01.070
And I think eventually that question would gnaw at you and sour and override the

159
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:03.550
pleasure.

160
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:08.550
Eventually you'd become sort of horrified that you were in effect stuck in this

161
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.280
rat like existence.

162
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.750
Of course the human part of you is able to say there's more to you than this rat

163
00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:16.410
like existence,

164
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:21.120
but precisely the human part of you is going to rebel at the unending

165
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.770
parade of simple rat like pleasures.

166
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:30.570
So I don't think any eternity like that would be such a good thing.

167
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:33.150
Maybe it would be for a rat,
but not for a human.

168
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:38.420
Of course we could perhaps deal with that problem by making us more rat.

169
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:42.990
Like in terms of our thinking processes.

170
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.590
Perhaps the right kind of Labatt dummy would do the trick.

171
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.230
I don't actually know exactly what it would take,

172
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.740
but you just cut off and snip the relevant uh,

173
00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:57.741
nerve endings so that we're no longer able to engage in that higher order

174
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.430
thinking no longer able to raise the question.

175
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:07.700
Is this all there is no longer able to step back from the first order pleasure.

176
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:11.460
No doubt you could.

177
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.870
You could turn us into creatures like rats in that way.

178
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.470
And then I presume we would continue to enjoy it forever.

179
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.550
But the question isn't really,

180
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.200
is there something you could do to a human being so that he'd be happy or at

181
00:11:28.201 --> 00:11:31.560
least enjoying himself forever?
It's rather,

182
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:36.620
do you sitting here now thinking about that kind of life?

183
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.890
Do you want that for yourself?

184
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.720
Do you want to be lobotomized where that's the only way,

185
00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:50.670
at least that we've got so far to imagine a life that you would enjoy forever.

186
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.683
Chair,
you know,

187
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:56.140
screw me up off and maybe I'd enjoy being alive forever,

188
00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:00.820
but that doesn't mean that I now want that for myself.

189
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.720
That doesn't seem to me to be some gift you've given me.

190
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:09.810
That seems to me to be some horrible penalty you've imposed on me that you've

191
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:13.150
reduced me from being a human,

192
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:18.151
being able to engage in the full range of reflection and simply turned me into

193
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.860
something like a rat.
So again,

194
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.940
when the question is posed,
is there a kind of life that I,

195
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.880
or you would want to live forever?

196
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.440
The question I'm asking as a question to you here now,

197
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.220
is there a kind of life that you would want to live forever?

198
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:44.370
Not that if we altered you that that product would want to have forever.

199
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.930
I can't see how to do it.
Well look,
there's one other possibility.

200
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.330
Instead of imagining lobotomizing us turning us into rats,

201
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.760
suppose we just say look,
the problems really,
there's,

202
00:12:57.761 --> 00:13:00.640
the problem of course is boredom.
The problem is tedium.

203
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:05.560
The problem is that you get tired of doing that after a while,

204
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.100
a hundred years,
thousand years,
million years,
whatever it is.
He say,
yeah,

205
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.820
here's a math problem I haven't solved before,
but so what?

206
00:13:12.821 --> 00:13:17.740
I'm just done so much math.
It holds no appeal to me before.

207
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.610
Or you know,

208
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:23.050
you cycled through all the great art museums in the world and you said,
yeah,

209
00:13:23.051 --> 00:13:26.110
I've seen these Picasso's,
I've,

210
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:28.810
I've seen these Rembrandt's before.

211
00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:33.310
I've gotten the what there is to get out of them.
Isn't there anything new?

212
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:37.300
And the problem is no,
no.
We sort of,
even if it is literally new things,

213
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:41.950
they're not the new kinds of things that can still engage us afresh.

214
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:42.520
Well,

215
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.520
what's the solution to that solution to that might be a kind of Amnesia,

216
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:52.090
a kind of progressive lack of memory.

217
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.400
You know,
so here I am,
a hundred years,
thousand years around 500,000 years,

218
00:13:57.401 --> 00:14:00.280
whatever it may be,
you're getting pretty bored with life.

219
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:04.230
But if we now introduced some progressive memory,
so the,

220
00:14:04.231 --> 00:14:05.590
a progressive memory loss,

221
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.660
so that I no longer remember what I did a 100,000 years earlier.

222
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.180
And by the time I'm a million,

223
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:18.270
I no longer remember what I was doing when I was a lad of 500,000 and by the

224
00:14:18.581 --> 00:14:23.200
time I'm a million and a half,
I no longer remember what was happening.
Oh,

225
00:14:23.201 --> 00:14:25.300
back,
back.
I know I was alive perhaps.

226
00:14:25.301 --> 00:14:26.830
So maybe I don't even remember that I was alive.

227
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.340
I sort of remember the last 10 20,000 years and that's it.

228
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.250
And while we're at it,

229
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
why don't we have overhauling of your interests and desires,

230
00:14:39.101 --> 00:14:40.150
your tastes.

231
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.280
So your taste in music evolve over thousands of years and your,

232
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.350
your tastes in art or literature or you know,
you like math.
Nah,

233
00:14:48.351 --> 00:14:51.680
but then you lose your taste and math and you become the kind of person perhaps

234
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:55.190
who's interested in Chinese poetry.
Whatever it is,

235
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.540
wouldn't that do it?
If we had this side of progressive,

236
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.960
all radical alteration,
not just minimal alteration,

237
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.850
but radical alterations of my memory,
my beliefs,

238
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:09.500
my desires,
my tastes.

239
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.680
Couldn't that be a kind of existence that would be forever enjoyable and yet

240
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.060
wouldn't be a rat like existence?
I'd be engaged in,
you know,

241
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:22.880
studying Chinese poetry.
I'd be engaged in doing math.

242
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:25.790
I'd be engaged in studying astronomy,
what have you.

243
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.670
That's far better than the rats existence,

244
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:34.010
and yet at no point do I become bored because roughly I'm so different from

245
00:15:34.011 --> 00:15:37.160
period to period to period.
Well,

246
00:15:37.161 --> 00:15:40.730
I think actually you probably could tell a story where that was true,

247
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.270
especially we throw in enough doses of memory loss,

248
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:49.880
but this case should remind you of something because this case is one that we've

249
00:15:49.881 --> 00:15:54.881
actually discussed before under the label of Methuselah Methuselah memory.

250
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.230
When we were talking about personal identity,

251
00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.650
we imagined somebody much shorter lived at that time.

252
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:05.630
I think it was several hundred years,
a hundred years old,
200 years old,

253
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:09.320
300 years old,
600 700800900 years old.

254
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.950
By the time with these low was 900 years old.

255
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.460
He no longer remembered anything about his childhood.

256
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.980
And what I found when I thought about the Methuselah case was,

257
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:27.430
even though it was me at age 800 the same person as the one who's standing here

258
00:16:29.691 --> 00:16:34.190
in front of you now,
it didn't really matter.
I said,
so what?

259
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:39.170
When I thought about what I wanted in survival,

260
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:43.970
it wasn't enough that there be somebody in the distant future that be me.

261
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.680
That wasn't good enough.

262
00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:50.830
It had to be somebody with a similar enough personality.

263
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.800
You tell me,
oh,
there's gotta be somebody alive.
It'll be you.

264
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:58.820
But it'll be completely unlike you.
Different tastes.

265
00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:02.510
No memories of having taught philosophy and so forth.
I say,
oh,

266
00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:05.060
that's all rather interesting from a metaphysical point of view.

267
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.880
But speaking personally,
I don't really care.

268
00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:13.160
It's of no interest to me to survive and merely saying the mantra,

269
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:14.690
oh,
but it's me.

270
00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:18.230
Does it make it more desirable to me?

271
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.290
What I want isn't merely for somebody to be me.

272
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:24.650
I want them to be sufficiently like me.

273
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:29.750
And the problem with the Methuselah case was you go far enough out to no longer

274
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.040
sufficiently like me.

275
00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:35.330
So I don't really care that there'll be somebody out there who's still me

276
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.690
thought it was so unlike me now.

277
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:44.720
But that's after all what we just described in imagining the cycling with the

278
00:17:44.721 --> 00:17:47.270
memory loss.
Yeah.

279
00:17:47.271 --> 00:17:51.580
There'll be somebody around a hundred years from now,
500,000 years from now and,

280
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.230
and maybe there'll be me,
I don't care.

281
00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:00.500
It doesn't give me what I want when I want to survive.

282
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.680
So perhaps we should put the point in the form of a dilemma.

283
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.710
Could in mortality be something worth having forever?
Well,

284
00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:11.790
on the one hand,

285
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:17.010
if we make it be me and similar to me,

286
00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:22.220
boredom's gonna set in only way to avoid that is to lobotomize me and that's not

287
00:18:22.261 --> 00:18:24.840
desirable.
If we make,

288
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.900
if we solve the problem of boredom setting in with progressive memory loss and

289
00:18:30.211 --> 00:18:34.290
radical personality changes,
maybe boredom won't set in,

290
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:38.820
but it's not anything that I have a specialty want for myself.

291
00:18:38.821 --> 00:18:43.230
It just doesn't matter to me that it's me anymore than it would matter to me if

292
00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:44.160
they're just telling me,
oh,

293
00:18:44.161 --> 00:18:46.860
there'll be somebody else around there who liked Chinese poetry.

294
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.550
So is there a way of living forever that's attractive to me?

295
00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.610
I can't think of what it would look like.

296
00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:02.330
And so I agree with Bernard Williams when he says in mortality wouldn't be

297
00:19:02.671 --> 00:19:05.910
desirable.
It would actually be a nightmare.

298
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.790
Something you would long to free yourself from.

299
00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:11.310
Now having said that,

300
00:19:11.311 --> 00:19:16.311
of course that doesn't in any way mean that it's a good thing that we die when

301
00:19:16.951 --> 00:19:21.420
we do at 50 or 80 or a hundred from the phone.

302
00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:22.590
The fact that you know,

303
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.310
after a hundred thousand years or a million years or whatever it is,

304
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.790
eventually life would grow tiresome.
That hardly shows,

305
00:19:29.791 --> 00:19:34.791
but life has grown tiresome after 50 years or 80 years or a hundred I don't

306
00:19:35.191 --> 00:19:35.850
believe we'll,

307
00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:40.850
I'll come close to scratching the surface of what I would enjoy doing by the

308
00:19:41.371 --> 00:19:45.240
time I've died.
And I imagine the same thing's true for you.

309
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:51.230
So perhaps the best form of life would be not in mortality.

310
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:56.320
I think that would be not particularly desirable and not what we've got now

311
00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.780
where you live after a mere drop of 50 or 80 or a hundred years.

312
00:20:00.781 --> 00:20:05.781
But rather the best thing I suppose would be to be able to live as long as you

313
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:07.853
wanted.

314
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:12.510
This is the sort of thing that Julian Barnes basically imagines in the uh,

315
00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:13.350
the chapter,

316
00:20:13.351 --> 00:20:18.351
the dream that I had you take a look at Barnes sort of envisions heaven as a

317
00:20:19.621 --> 00:20:24.480
situation in which you can stick around doing what you want to do for as long as

318
00:20:24.481 --> 00:20:29.130
you want to do it.
But Barnes says and then surely you've had enough.

319
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.940
And once you,
once you've had enough,
you can put an end to it.

320
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.270
Still the fact that we can put an end to it,
that's,
that's,

321
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:40.050
that's the point we've already been flagging that in mortality would not be so

322
00:20:40.051 --> 00:20:41.250
good,
but the,

323
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:46.430
the new thought here is what wouldn't be good would be being able to live until

324
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.810
you were satisfied,

325
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:54.490
until you'd gotten what goods there were to get out of life.

326
00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:58.123
<v 2>Okay.</v>

327
00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:02.010
<v 0>What all of this suggests then,
and this is a point that I really made before,</v>

328
00:21:02.011 --> 00:21:06.030
is that the best understanding of the deprivation account doesn't say that

329
00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:10.270
what's bad is the mere fact that we're going to die if I'm writing,

330
00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:14.610
thinking in mortality would be undesirable than the fact that we're going to die

331
00:21:14.611 --> 00:21:17.310
is good because it guarantees that we won't be immortal,

332
00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:22.150
which would be a nightmare and unending nightmare
still,

333
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:26.050
even though it's not a bad thing that we will die.

334
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:31.080
It could still be a bad thing that we die when we do.

335
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.920
It could still be the case that we die too soon

336
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.700
according to the deprivation account.

337
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.760
Death is bad when it's bad because of the fact that it deprives us of the good

338
00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:51.571
things in life in so far as you would have continued to get good things in life,

339
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.710
but if life would no longer have anything good to offer you,

340
00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.010
if what you then would have had would have been something negative instead of

341
00:22:00.011 --> 00:22:01.240
something positive,

342
00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.740
then at that point dying wouldn't actually be a bad thing.

343
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.450
It would be a good thing.

344
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:12.740
Low death is bad in so far as it deprives you of a chunk of life that would have

345
00:22:13.631 --> 00:22:18.631
been good and so far is it deprives you of a future that would have been bad

346
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.800
then that's not actually bad.
It's actually good.

347
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.700
Now in stating this view this way,

348
00:22:28.701 --> 00:22:33.701
I'm obviously presupposing that we can make these kinds of at least overall

349
00:22:33.981 --> 00:22:38.960
judgements in terms of the quality of your life.
How well off you are it?

350
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.440
Is Life giving you good things or is life giving you bad things?

351
00:22:42.441 --> 00:22:47.441
Is it worth continuing to live or is it not worth continuing to live?

352
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:52.580
So I want to turn to that topic and spend,
oh,

353
00:22:52.581 --> 00:22:56.660
probably the better part of a lecture or so the rest of today and some of next

354
00:22:56.661 --> 00:23:00.020
time talking about the question of,
well,

355
00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.900
what is it for a life to go,
well,

356
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:08.200
how do we assess what makes our life a good life versus a bad life?

357
00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.170
And I don't mean morally good life.

358
00:23:12.171 --> 00:23:15.890
I mean good for the person whose life it is,

359
00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:20.980
a life that sort of you think I'm benefiting from having this life.

360
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:27.070
What are the ingredients or constituents or elements of a good life versus a bad

361
00:23:27.231 --> 00:23:30.890
life and of course,
since it's not just black and white,
good life,
a bad life,

362
00:23:30.891 --> 00:23:34.370
but various shades of gray,
better lives and worst lives.

363
00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:39.790
What's the yardstick by virtue of which we measure better and worse lives?

364
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:42.800
What goes into a good life?

365
00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.570
Now in thinking about this question is my thing at the topic is the nature of

366
00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:51.350
wellbeing and like all the other topics we've talked about in this class,

367
00:23:51.351 --> 00:23:56.150
it's a complicated subject about which one could spend a great deal of time.

368
00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.020
All we're going to do here is really just once again scratched the surface,

369
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:04.160
but the very first point that needs to be made I think is this.

370
00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:09.530
If you start listing all the things worth having in life,

371
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:14.710
it might seem as though you couldn't possibly come to any general organizing

372
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.660
principles.
I mean,
think about it,
what's worth having?
Well,
you know,

373
00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.930
jobs are worth having monies worth having.

374
00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.960
Sex is worth having chocolates worth having ice cream is worth having,

375
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.710
air conditioners are worth having.
What are some of the things worth avoiding?

376
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.850
Well being blind is worth avoiding.
Being Mug is worth avoiding.

377
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:36.020
A diarrhea is worth avoiding pains.
Worth avoiding.

378
00:24:36.021 --> 00:24:38.630
Getting unemployed is worth avoiding wars worth of work.

379
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:43.580
What kind of systematicity can we possibly bring to all of this?

380
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:48.860
Well,
the crucial,
I think first distinction is this.

381
00:24:48.861 --> 00:24:53.861
We need to separate between those things that are good because of what they lean

382
00:24:55.071 --> 00:25:00.071
to that is more strictly only because of what they lead to and those things that

383
00:25:01.341 --> 00:25:04.790
are valuable for their own sake or in their own right.

384
00:25:04.791 --> 00:25:08.090
But it takes something like a job,
you know,
jobs worth having.

385
00:25:08.091 --> 00:25:11.020
Why is a job worth having?
Well,
job's worth having because,
well,

386
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:14.480
I'm on to other things.
It gives you money.
All right?
Money's worth having.

387
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:17.670
All right.
Uh,
why is money worth having?
Well,

388
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.620
money's worth having because among other things,
you can buy a ice cream with it.

389
00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.100
All right.
Uh,
why is ice cream worth having?
Well,

390
00:25:25.101 --> 00:25:28.220
ice cream is worth having because,
ah,
when I eat ice cream,

391
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:31.700
it gives me this pleasurable sensation.
All right,

392
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.320
why is it a pleasurable sensation?
We're having a,
at this point,

393
00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:37.460
we get a different kind of answer.

394
00:25:37.461 --> 00:25:42.461
At this point we say something like pleasure is worth having for its own sake.

395
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:48.260
The other things were valuable as a means ultimately to pleasure,

396
00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.810
but pleasure was worth having for its own sake.

397
00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.050
The things that are valuable as a means,

398
00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:57.800
we can say our instrumentally valuable,

399
00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.270
the things that are worth having for their own sake.

400
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:07.390
Philosophers call intrinsically valuable and we look back at that long open

401
00:26:09.891 --> 00:26:12.740
ended list of things that were good or bad.

402
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:17.860
We'll find that most of the things on that list are instrumentally good.

403
00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:22.940
They're good because of what they lead to or for that matter instrumentally bad.

404
00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:27.200
You know why is you know disease bad?
Well,
among other things,

405
00:26:27.201 --> 00:26:31.130
it means perhaps that you know you can enjoy yourself so it deprives you of

406
00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:34.660
pleasure or perhaps it means because you're sick,
you can't hold your job.
Don,

407
00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.520
we can hold your job done and you can't get the money,
so forth and so on.

408
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.680
Ultimately,
most of the negative things on that list were instrumentally bad.

409
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.920
Most of the good things on that list were instrumentally good.

410
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.710
If we want and get any place on the question about the nature of the good life.

411
00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:58.330
Well we need to focus on is not the instrumental goods and bads but rather the

412
00:26:58.891 --> 00:27:01.380
intrinsic goods and bads.

413
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:06.620
You've got to ask yourself what's worth having for its own sake,

414
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:10.560
what's worth having in and of itself?

415
00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:12.660
Well,

416
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:17.070
one natural suggestion is a pleasure is worth having for its own sake and pain

417
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.180
is probably worth avoiding for its own sake.
So pains,

418
00:27:21.181 --> 00:27:24.510
probably intrinsically bad pleasures,
intrinsically good

419
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.611
notice by the,

420
00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:30.690
by that logically speaking there is nothing that stops the very same thing from

421
00:27:30.691 --> 00:27:35.020
being both a and actually he had other weird combinations.
Um,

422
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.850
you go to the dentist and you know,
he pokes,
you says,
does this hurt?

423
00:27:38.851 --> 00:27:42.090
Does that hurt in order to try to figure out where there's gum disease and the

424
00:27:42.091 --> 00:27:47.091
pain that he causes is intrinsically bad in and of itself.

425
00:27:47.581 --> 00:27:51.330
It's bad.
Yet for all that it's been useful there.

426
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:56.360
It's providing a means of deciding where the gum has decayed and that allows the

427
00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:02.850
dentist to sort of improve your gums,
which avoids more pain down the road.

428
00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:03.781
So the pain,

429
00:28:03.781 --> 00:28:07.980
your suffering knowledge actually instrumentally valuable,

430
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:12.000
useful as a means,
even though it's intrinsically bad.

431
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.720
Similarly,
uh,
you know,

432
00:28:15.721 --> 00:28:20.310
when I work I enjoy myself.
Uh,

433
00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:24.180
and so the pleasure I'm getting then is intrinsically good,

434
00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.010
but it's also instrumental and good.

435
00:28:26.011 --> 00:28:30.840
The fact that I am enjoying myself makes it easier for me to work harder.

436
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:33.660
Perhaps I'm more productive,
I do better at my job.

437
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:38.730
And so the pleasure is both intrinsically valuable and instrumentally valuable.

438
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.890
So there's no claiming that things have to be one or the other,

439
00:28:43.891 --> 00:28:48.420
but not both still.
And trying to get clear about the nature of wellbeing.

440
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:53.250
The crucial thing to do is to focus not on the question about instrumental

441
00:28:53.251 --> 00:28:54.084
value,

442
00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:58.650
but rather to focus on the question of intrinsic value,

443
00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:04.130
what things are worth having for their own sake,

444
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.570
whether or not those things also have instrumental value or what have you,

445
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.250
what things are worth having for their own sake,

446
00:29:14.251 --> 00:29:18.180
and what things are worth avoiding for their own sake.
Well,

447
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.440
in giving these examples,

448
00:29:19.441 --> 00:29:22.710
I've already indicated at least two things that belong on the list,

449
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:27.890
but it seems pretty plausible to think pleasures intrinsically good.

450
00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:31.620
One thing,
maybe not the only thing,

451
00:29:31.621 --> 00:29:36.621
but at least one thing that goes into a life worth having is enjoying it is

452
00:29:37.981 --> 00:29:41.500
pleasure.
And one thing that seems intrinsically bad.

453
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:45.850
One thing that seems to reduce the value of a life is pain.

454
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.000
Most of us agree then pleasures intrinsically valuable.

455
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.490
Pain is intrinsically negative.

456
00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.970
Unvaluable or has anti value.

457
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.753
<v 1>Well</v>

458
00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:03.490
<v 0>suppose we make for the moment the bold conjecture,</v>

459
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:08.470
that philosophical claim that not only is pleasure and the absence of pain,

460
00:30:08.471 --> 00:30:12.760
you know,
not only is pleasure,
one good thing and pain one bad thing.

461
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.460
Suppose that's the entire list.

462
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:20.970
Suppose we conjecture that the only thing intrinsically valuable is pleasure.

463
00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:26.920
And the only thing intrinsically bad is pain.

464
00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:34.000
That view is called hedonism.
Alright,

465
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:37.030
so hedonism is a view that many people are attracted to.

466
00:30:37.031 --> 00:30:42.031
Perhaps some of you believe it's got a very simple theory of the nature of

467
00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:43.000
wellbeing.

468
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:48.360
Being well off is a matter of experiencing pleasure and avoiding or minimizing

469
00:30:50.111 --> 00:30:53.320
the experience of pain at hedonism.

470
00:30:55.060 --> 00:31:00.010
Little later we'll turn to the question of,
well,

471
00:31:00.011 --> 00:31:02.410
if hedonism is not the right story,

472
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:06.540
what else belongs on the list?
Or is it the right story?
Well,

473
00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.960
turning that question a little bit later,

474
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:13.080
but notice that if we've got hedonism or for that matter as we'll see some other

475
00:31:13.241 --> 00:31:15.790
theories of wellbeing.
If we've got hedonism,

476
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
we were able to make the kinds of evaluations that I was helping myself to when

477
00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:26.590
I started talking in a few minutes ago about,
well,
you know,

478
00:31:26.591 --> 00:31:29.920
if what life would hold for you is bad overall,

479
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:33.430
then you're better off dying and so forth.
What's going on?

480
00:31:33.431 --> 00:31:37.960
And we make those judgments or the hedonist offers us a very simple,

481
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:42.990
straight forward answer in deciding whether you know what life holds for you is

482
00:31:45.281 --> 00:31:48.460
worth having better than nothing.

483
00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:50.650
You roughly speaking,

484
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.680
add up all the good times and subtract all the bad times and see whether the net

485
00:31:58.181 --> 00:32:02.350
balance is positive or negative.

486
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:08.420
Add up all the pleasures,
subtract all the pains.

487
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:11.060
If the balance is positive,

488
00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:15.710
you're life is worth living and the more positive the balance,

489
00:32:15.711 --> 00:32:19.370
the bigger the number,
the more your life is worth living.

490
00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:22.250
If the balance is negative though,

491
00:32:22.251 --> 00:32:24.620
think about what that would mean if the balance was negative.

492
00:32:24.621 --> 00:32:29.621
You're saying your future holds more pain overall then pleasure and and that's,

493
00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:38.660
that's a negative.
You'd be better off.
We're all,
you'd be better off dead right?

494
00:32:38.661 --> 00:32:40.130
Because if you were dead,

495
00:32:40.131 --> 00:32:44.510
you'd have neither pleasure nor pain that's going to presumably be given

496
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:47.870
mathematically.
If you gave it a number,
we'd slap a zero on that.

497
00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.870
No positive number,
no negative number,
that's a zero.

498
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.410
Obviously it's the balance of pleasure over pain is positive.

499
00:32:54.411 --> 00:32:59.270
That's better than zero,
but if the balance of pain over pleasure,
you know,

500
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.780
if the paint is more pain than pleasure so that the balance is negative,

501
00:33:02.781 --> 00:33:06.020
that's worse than zero.
That's a life not worth having.

502
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.740
That's what the hedonist says.
Now,

503
00:33:09.741 --> 00:33:13.370
there's different ways of working out the details of the,
of the hedonist view.

504
00:33:13.371 --> 00:33:18.371
It's not after all as though all pleasures count equally or all pains count

505
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:20.300
equally,

506
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:25.300
the pain of stubbing your toe obviously doesn't call it for nearly as much as

507
00:33:25.641 --> 00:33:27.890
the pain of a Migraine,

508
00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:31.520
which doesn't count nearly as much as the pain of being tortured.

509
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:36.470
And so we might need to sort of work out various more complicated formulas here

510
00:33:36.471 --> 00:33:41.471
where we multiply the pain times its duration and take into account its

511
00:33:42.681 --> 00:33:46.610
intensity,
get sort of the sheer quantity of pain that way.

512
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.690
And similarly,

513
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:51.920
pleasures can be longer lasting or more intense.

514
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.660
You can imagine how some of those details might go and then some of the

515
00:33:56.661 --> 00:33:58.850
questions get rather tricky.
But for our purposes,

516
00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.570
we don't really need to worry about the details.

517
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.940
The thought is roughly weigh up the pleasures and pains in some appropriate way.

518
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:11.300
Add up the pleasures,
add up the pains,

519
00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:15.410
see whether the grand total of pleasures is greater than the grand totals of

520
00:34:15.411 --> 00:34:18.980
pain.
The more positive the number,
the better your life.

521
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.790
Now armed with an approach like this,

522
00:34:22.791 --> 00:34:27.590
we can do more than just evaluate entire lives.
Well,

523
00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.560
one thing we can do is just that we can evaluate entire lives.
You know,

524
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:35.620
there you are at at at the pearly gates and you look back on your life and you

525
00:34:36.681 --> 00:34:41.120
could in principle add up all the pleasures,
add up all the pains,

526
00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.850
subtract the paints from the pleasures and ask yourself,

527
00:34:43.910 --> 00:34:45.680
how good a life did I have?

528
00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:50.420
How well off was I having lived that life?

529
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:54.020
And perhaps then you could imagine alternative lives.

530
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:59.290
If only I had chosen Joby comma doctor instead of having chosen to become a

531
00:35:00.321 --> 00:35:05.090
lawyer,
how much better off or worse off would I have been?

532
00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:10.220
Or if I had just started to become an artist or a scholar or a beach bomb or a

533
00:35:10.221 --> 00:35:14.510
farmer,
how much better off or worse off would I have been?

534
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:18.050
How much greater or smaller with the,
with the number go,

535
00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.770
despite my talking about numbers,
of course,

536
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:26.890
there's no particular assumption that we can really give precise numbers to this

537
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.600
and we certainly don't think that,
in fact,

538
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:34.720
most of us are in the position to actually crank out any kind of accurate

539
00:35:35.931 --> 00:35:36.470
number.

540
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:41.470
Most of us don't know enough to know with a high degree of accuracy how things

541
00:35:41.731 --> 00:35:45.740
would have gone.
Had I decided to become a,
you know,

542
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:48.030
a farmer instead of a philosopher.

543
00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:52.980
Still the hedonist isn't saying from a practical point of view,

544
00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:57.060
we can necessarily do this,
but in theory,
in principle,

545
00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:01.350
this is what we're wondering about.
When we face choices,

546
00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:06.510
we can ask ourselves,
what would our life look like?
Would it be better or worse?

547
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:11.540
And the the yard stick that we're at least doing our best to apply is one of

548
00:36:12.181 --> 00:36:15.090
measuring up the pleasure and subtracting the pain.

549
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:19.140
And of course the hedonist will also hasten to point out that just because we

550
00:36:19.141 --> 00:36:22.080
can't do this perfectly or infallibly,

551
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:25.290
that doesn't mean we can't make educated guesses.
Right?
You're,

552
00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:30.380
you're trying to decide should you go to Yale for college or shouldn't you go to

553
00:36:32.611 --> 00:36:37.611
Ohio state or Harvard or wherever else you got into and you ask yourself,

554
00:36:38.851 --> 00:36:43.851
well you sort of try to project your future and you ask where do I think I'd be

555
00:36:44.011 --> 00:36:47.910
better off?
Which of these branches that are available to me,

556
00:36:47.911 --> 00:36:50.190
sort of the branches of my life story,

557
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:55.400
which is the one in which the future from here on out holds more pleasure and

558
00:36:55.981 --> 00:36:57.570
holds less pain.

559
00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:01.770
That's how the hedonist says we should think about it and notice by the,

560
00:37:01.771 --> 00:37:06.771
by that when we make choices about our future from the hedonist point of view,

561
00:37:07.411 --> 00:37:11.760
at least there's no particular need to draw a whole lot on the past because you

562
00:37:11.761 --> 00:37:13.260
know sort of what's done is done.

563
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:18.260
You're not going to alter how much pleasure you enjoyed previously,

564
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.640
how much suffering you've undergone previously.
What's open is the future,

565
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.140
and so we're able to evaluate not just lives as a whole.

566
00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:30.000
Looking back at the pearly gates,

567
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:34.140
we're able to evaluate lives from here on out,

568
00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:40.490
which of the various futures that are open to me are likely to give me the

569
00:37:42.511 --> 00:37:46.890
better life,
leave me better off,
measured in terms of pleasure or pain,

570
00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:51.810
and we do our best.
However good or bad that may be.

571
00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:56.130
We do our best to make such comparative evaluations.

572
00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:57.540
Of course,

573
00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:02.490
we can do more than just evaluate the entire rest of my life.

574
00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:07.050
We can evaluate the next year or the next six months or for that matter,

575
00:38:07.051 --> 00:38:11.190
just this evening.
I can talk about,
well,
what should I do tonight?
You know,

576
00:38:11.191 --> 00:38:14.460
should I,
should I stay home and work on my paper?
Should I,

577
00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:19.470
should I go to the party?
Where will I be better off tonight?
Yeah,
well,

578
00:38:19.471 --> 00:38:21.660
you know,
it looks,
I'll probably join myself more at the party.

579
00:38:21.661 --> 00:38:24.660
Then I will working on the paper and the paper's not due for a while and so

580
00:38:24.661 --> 00:38:25.494
forth.

581
00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.790
We make evaluations not just of entire lives,

582
00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:33.390
but of chunks of lives.

583
00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:40.330
All right?
That's what we can do if we accept hedonism,

584
00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:42.880
but haven't yet asked,

585
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:48.030
should we accept hedonism now it will not come as news to me if I were to learn

586
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:51.220
that several of you,

587
00:38:51.221 --> 00:38:55.960
maybe even many of you in this class except hedonism,

588
00:38:55.990 --> 00:39:00.970
it's a very popular view,
not just among philosophers,
where it's a view of,

589
00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:03.550
it's been around as long as it's been philosophy,

590
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.620
but sort of I'm long people in the street.

591
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:11.940
It's a very tempting view to think what makes life worth having and the only

592
00:39:13.841 --> 00:39:18.790
thing worth having for its own sake is having pleasure and avoiding pain,

593
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:22.210
but for all that,
despite the popularity of that view,

594
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:25.300
I'm inclined to think it must be wrong.

595
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:29.950
It's not that I think pleasure isn't good and pain isn't bad.

596
00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:35.070
Where he needs and goes wrong is when they say it's the only thing that matters.

597
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:42.330
I'm inclined to think there's more to the best kind of life than just having

598
00:39:44.141 --> 00:39:46.390
pleasure and avoiding pain.
Now,

599
00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:51.690
I already revealed that when I was talking about the rat lever machine,

600
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:57.910
I said,
hook me up to that machine and I'll enjoy myself,

601
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.810
but I don't want that for myself.
Why?

602
00:40:01.811 --> 00:40:06.811
Because there's more to life than just pleasure and the absence of pain or,

603
00:40:07.661 --> 00:40:12.661
so it seems to me still we might say at the rat lever is not the only kind of

604
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.690
pleasures there are.
There's all these pleasures of,
you know,

605
00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:22.720
experiencing art and seeing a beautiful sunset and I don't know about you,

606
00:40:22.721 --> 00:40:25.810
but at least when I imagined the rat lever thing,
it's just sort of simple,

607
00:40:25.811 --> 00:40:27.880
undifferentiated pleasure.

608
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:33.030
So that really won't do the trick and giving us the best quality pleasures of

609
00:40:33.521 --> 00:40:35.830
the kinds of humans most crave,

610
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:42.310
the pleasures of friendship and discussion and and,
and sexual intimacy.

611
00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:44.230
These pleasures,

612
00:40:44.231 --> 00:40:49.231
the rat lever machine wasn't giving us so couldn't hedonism still be true?

613
00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.720
Couldn't it still be the case that as long as we take into account the

614
00:40:52.721 --> 00:40:57.100
importance of getting the right kinds of pleasures,
then really pleasure?

615
00:40:57.101 --> 00:40:59.290
Is what it's all about and all that.
It's about,
no,

616
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:01.600
I think that's still not right,
but indeed,

617
00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:06.690
we'll need to move to something fancier than the rat lever machine here.

618
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.960
The relevant thought experiment was suggested by Robert Nozick,

619
00:41:10.961 --> 00:41:12.790
a philosopher who died a few years ago,

620
00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:17.880
taught for many years at Harvard Nozick invited us to imagine an experience

621
00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:21.880
machine.

622
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:26.260
So suppose that the scientists have discovered a way,

623
00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:29.770
not just to stimulate the particular little pleasure center of the brain,

624
00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:34.980
but basically to give you completely realistic virtual reality so that when you

625
00:41:40.161 --> 00:41:42.410
are hooked up to the machine,

626
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:47.500
it seems to you exactly the same on the inside as it would seem to you if you

627
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:54.710
really were,
and I'll fill in the blank.
You know,

628
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:59.890
you could have the identical experience of climbing Mount Everest,

629
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:03.710
let's say,
uh,
you know,

630
00:42:03.711 --> 00:42:07.310
so that you'll feel the wind bracing your course.

631
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.500
You don't really feel any wind.
Strictly speaking,

632
00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.410
that's not true because you're not up on Mount Everest.
There is no wind.

633
00:42:12.411 --> 00:42:13.790
What's really going on is you're,

634
00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:18.840
you're floating in the psychologist tank in their lab with thought with the

635
00:42:19.881 --> 00:42:21.930
electrodes hooked up to your brain.
But,

636
00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:26.940
but you don't know that you are floating in the tank hooked up to the machine.

637
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:33.460
You believe you are climbing Mount Everest.

638
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.550
You feel they're thrilled having made it to the top and the,

639
00:42:37.551 --> 00:42:42.030
when bracingly you know,
striking your Chin and,

640
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:43.580
and you feel the,
you know,

641
00:42:43.581 --> 00:42:48.020
the satisfaction and you've got the memories of having almost died.
You know,

642
00:42:48.021 --> 00:42:49.850
when the rope broke before.

643
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:54.560
It's not like being at the Imax.

644
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:57.920
The crucial point when you're at the Imax is,
although you know,

645
00:42:57.921 --> 00:43:02.810
it's very realistic,
part of you is aware that you're just in the theater,

646
00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:07.370
but on the experience machine,
you don't know,

647
00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:12.350
you're just in the lab.
When you're on the experience machine,

648
00:43:12.351 --> 00:43:13.610
you got your,

649
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:18.630
your brain is being stimulated in such a way that you've got the identical

650
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:24.250
experience on the inside to what it would feel like if you really were doing

651
00:43:25.581 --> 00:43:26.510
these things.

652
00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:30.800
So imagine a life on the experience machine.

653
00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:35.980
Imagine plugging into tape says something about how old this example is that we

654
00:43:36.211 --> 00:43:39.680
talked about plugging in the tapes.
You know,
imagine plugging in the,
you know,

655
00:43:39.681 --> 00:43:39.811
the,

656
00:43:39.811 --> 00:43:44.811
the DVD or whatever it is with all of the best possible experiences.

657
00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.230
Whatever you think those are here you might have matching different people

658
00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:53.960
disagreeing about,
oh,
but you know,
throwing something.
But you know,

659
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:57.560
if what you want to do is write the great American novel,

660
00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:01.760
then you got the experience of,
of staying up late at night,

661
00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.180
not knowing how to make the plot work up,

662
00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:08.900
crushing pieces of paper and throwing them away and crushing your computer.

663
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:11.430
Whatever it is you do as you're writing the great American novel or,
or,

664
00:44:11.431 --> 00:44:14.360
or you want to be,
you know,
finding the cure for cancer.

665
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:18.170
So you've got to exactly the experience you would have if you are working in

666
00:44:18.171 --> 00:44:20.900
your lab,
having them brilliant breakthrough.

667
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:24.950
When you finally realize what the combination is that will make a rabbit

668
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:29.210
antibody,
whatever it is,
or if you want to be,

669
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.620
uh,
you know,

670
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:36.300
all the most beautiful sunsets and the most exotic locales you got exactly the

671
00:44:36.301 --> 00:44:40.980
experience you would have if you were doing all these things.

672
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.560
That's life on the experience machine.
You're not doing any of it.

673
00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:51.150
You're floating in the lab,
but the experiences are identical.

674
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.600
Now ask yourself then,

675
00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.200
would you want to spend your life hooked up to the experience machine?

676
00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:05.110
Ask Yourself,

677
00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:10.140
how would you feel if you discovered now that you have been living your life,

678
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:18.160
hooked up to an experience machine?
Now got up,
make a footnote here.

679
00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:23.340
This perfectly glorious philosophical example has been ruined in recent years by

680
00:45:25.841 --> 00:45:30.580
the movie the Matrix.
Because whenever I tell this story now,
people start saying,

681
00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:31.450
oh,
well,
you know,

682
00:45:31.451 --> 00:45:36.300
the evil machines are busy using your body is a battery or whatever it was,
uh,

683
00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:37.600
in,
in the movie.
Right?

684
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:41.270
And what if people are just nefariously feasting on my liver?
You know,

685
00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:45.860
I'm having these little expense.
Don't imagine any of that.
Yeah,

686
00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:49.840
it's not that the evil scientist is just,
you know,

687
00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:55.020
deliberately deceiving you so as to conduct his nefarious experiments,

688
00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.090
nothing like that.
And similarly,
while we're at it,

689
00:45:58.091 --> 00:46:01.870
this is not a matrix like worry,
you know,
if you're worried about yeah,

690
00:46:01.871 --> 00:46:04.900
but what's happening to world poverty while I'm doing all this?

691
00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.750
Just imagine that everybody's hooked up to experience machines,

692
00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:11.470
but everybody's got the best possible tapes.

693
00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.170
Now you ask yourself,

694
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:20.090
what am I asking you to ask yourself is would you want to spend your life hooked

695
00:46:20.091 --> 00:46:23.030
up to the experience machine not talking about,

696
00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:27.290
wouldn't it be interesting to try it out for a week or a month or even a year

697
00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:32.980
and indeed the question strictly speaking isn't even would lie on the experience

698
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.960
machine be better then it is now.

699
00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:40.220
<v 2>Okay.</v>

700
00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:43.100
<v 0>Although it would make me very,
very sad to discover this.</v>

701
00:46:43.101 --> 00:46:47.930
I suppose it's possible some of you have such bad lives that moving onto the

702
00:46:47.931 --> 00:46:49.910
experience machine would be a step up.

703
00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:51.270
<v 2>Okay.</v>

704
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:52.380
<v 0>That's not the question.</v>

705
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:57.800
The question is does life on the experience of machine give you everything worth

706
00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:05.070
having in life?
Everything worth having in life?

707
00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:10.220
Is it the best possible form of human existence according to the hedonist?

708
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:18.630
The answer's got to be.
It has to be.
Yes.

709
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:23.750
Life on the experience machine is perfect as long as you've got the right tape

710
00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:29.650
plugged in.
So you've got the best possible balance,
wonderful pleasures,

711
00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:32.200
and wonderful,
fantastic experiences.

712
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:37.440
Since that's all there is to human wellbeing by hypothesis,

713
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:42.510
the machine is giving us that there couldn't possibly be anything more,

714
00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:45.490
there couldn't possibly be anything missing.

715
00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.013
<v 2>But</v>

716
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:51.200
<v 0>when I think about the question,</v>

717
00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:55.730
what I want to spend my life hooked up to an experience machine,

718
00:47:55.731 --> 00:47:58.010
the answer is no.

719
00:47:59.300 --> 00:47:59.880
<v 2>Okay?</v>

720
00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:04.200
<v 0>And I imagine that for most of you,
when you ask yourself,</v>

721
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:08.670
would you want your entire life to be spent hooked up to an experience machine?

722
00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:10.530
Your answer is no.

723
00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.640
But if the answer is no,

724
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.760
then that means hedonism has gotta be wrong.

725
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:19.440
<v 2>Okay.</v>

726
00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:24.300
<v 0>If life on the experience machine is not everything,</v>

727
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:29.870
then there's more to the best possible life then getting the insides right.

728
00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:36.900
The experience machine gets the pleasures right,
gets the experiences right,

729
00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:41.070
gets the mental states right.
It gets the insights right,

730
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:47.100
but if life on the experience machine isn't all that's worth wanting out of

731
00:48:47.101 --> 00:48:47.850
life,

732
00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:52.850
then there's more to the best possible life then getting the insides right.

733
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:58.680
What we've got to turn to next time then is the question,
what else might it be?

734
00:48:59.220 --> 00:48:59.520
Okay.
