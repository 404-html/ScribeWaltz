00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.010
Last time I invited you to think about life on the experience of machine where

2
00:00:05.011 --> 00:00:08.940
the scientists so busy stimulating your brain in such a ways to give you an

3
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:13.800
exact replica from the insides of what it would be like.

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.420
You're having an identical experiences.

5
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:18.450
So the ones you would have if you were really doing well,
whatever it is,

6
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:21.000
it's worth doing.
You know,
climbing the Alps off,

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.240
writing the great American novel,
uh,
raising a great family that you know,

8
00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.410
that loves you being creative,
whatever it is,
you think it's worth.

9
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:33.300
Having the experience machine gives you all the experiential side of those

10
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:35.460
things,
but you're not really doing those things.

11
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:40.050
You're actually just floating in the scientist's lab and we ask ourselves,

12
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.020
would you want to live a life on the experience machine?

13
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:47.790
Would you be happy or would you be unhappy to discover that you actually have

14
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:50.550
been living a life on the experience machine?

15
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.320
Most of us,
when we think about this,
find ourselves wanting to say no,

16
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:57.950
we wouldn't want to have a life on the experience machine.
I,

17
00:00:57.951 --> 00:01:00.960
I've been discussing this sort of example for many,

18
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:05.850
many years and there's always a group of people who think,
yes,

19
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:09.930
life on the experience machine is perfect as long as we've got the right tape

20
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:13.980
plane.
But the vast majority always says no.

21
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.240
There's something missing from that life.
It's,

22
00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:19.140
it's not the ideal of human existence.

23
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:23.220
It's not the best possible life we can imagine ourselves having.

24
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.710
That means if we think something's missing,

25
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:27.960
we didn't have to ask ourselves what's missing?

26
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:29.850
What's wrong with the experience machine?

27
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.470
The one thing we can conclude immediately is if you think life on the experience

28
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.480
machine is missing something that the hedonist and views like hedonism must be

29
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:42.180
wrong in so far as they say,

30
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:47.181
that all that matters for the best possible life is wellbeing for wellbeing is

31
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.730
getting the right kinds of experiences,
getting the right kinds of mental states,

32
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.280
because by hypothesis,

33
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.030
the experience machine gets the mental states right,

34
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.590
gets the insides right.
So if something's missing from that life,

35
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:05.700
there's more to the best kind of life than just having the right mental states

36
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:10.290
than just getting the insides right.
Well,
we ask ourselves then,
well,

37
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:11.160
what's missing?

38
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.660
I think different people will answer that in different ways and if we had more

39
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:20.040
time we could spell out rival theories of wellbeing,

40
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:24.120
which could be interestingly sort of a distinguish one from another in terms of

41
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.950
how they answered the question,

42
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.100
what's missing from the experience machine on the one hand and why are the

43
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:35.160
things that are missing from the experience machine worth having different

44
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:39.930
theories of wellbeing might answer that in different ways instead of trying to

45
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:43.800
pursue those alternative theories in a systematic fashion.

46
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.360
Let me just gesture towards some of the things that seem to be missing from that

47
00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:51.120
kind of life.
Well,
first of all,
most perhaps,

48
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:56.121
obviously if you're just spending your life floating in the scientist's lab,

49
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.980
you're not actually accomplishing anything.

50
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.960
You're not actually getting the things out of life you thought you were getting.

51
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.030
You want it to be climbing the mountain,

52
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.810
but you're not actually climbing a mountain.
You're just floating there.

53
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.570
You want it to be writing the great American novel,

54
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.380
but you're not writing the great American novel.
You're just floating there.

55
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.990
You want it to be finding a cure for cancer,

56
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.010
but you're not actually finding a cure for cancer.
You want it to be loved,

57
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.500
but you're not actually loved.

58
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.070
You're just floating there and nobody other than the scientist even knows that

59
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:32.600
you exist.
So there's a,

60
00:03:32.601 --> 00:03:35.230
a variety of things you wanted.

61
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.320
You wanted to know your place in the universe,

62
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.150
but you don't even have that kind of knowledge either because you think you're

63
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.750
writing novels,
finding the cure for cancer,
climbing Mount Everest,

64
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.720
you completely deceived about all of those things.

65
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.800
So you don't have the kind of self knowledge that many of us value.
Well,

66
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.390
as they say,

67
00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.070
different theories would try to systematize these examples in different ways,

68
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.910
uh,
that we don't have any kinds of accomplishments.
We don't have knowledge,

69
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:05.920
we're not in the right kinds of loving relationships.

70
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.050
Different theories might have different explanations as to are these things

71
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:14.680
valuable because we want them or do we walk them because we recognize their

72
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:19.600
valuable rather than trying to pursue those questions and indeed trying to work

73
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:23.770
out the details of these dudes to be complicated as well.
Uh,
take,

74
00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:27.460
take the example of accomplishment.
Well,
we all think accomplishments important,

75
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.750
but it's not as though any old accomplishment is important.
Uh,

76
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.070
if somebody sets himself or,

77
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:37.300
so it seems to me at least if somebody sets their self the goal of making the

78
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:40.240
biggest rubber band ball,
uh,

79
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.270
in the eastern United States,
uh,

80
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:46.570
I suppose there's a sense of the word that that's an accomplishment if they've

81
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:50.320
got it.
But it doesn't strike me as the kind of accomplishment which makes for a

82
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.420
particularly valuable life.

83
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.590
So they might have to distinguish between any old accomplishment and genuinely

84
00:04:56.591 --> 00:05:00.670
valuable accomplishments.
But again,
just put those details aside.

85
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.160
We can say that there are certain things that are good above and beyond

86
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:09.460
experiences,
the right kinds of accomplishments,

87
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:11.440
the right kind of knowledge after all,

88
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.230
not every bit of knowledge is equally valuable.

89
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.760
It's one thing to know your place in the universe.

90
00:05:16.761 --> 00:05:18.850
So to know the fundamental laws of physics,

91
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
it's another thing to know what was the average rainfall in Bangkok in 1984,

92
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.690
not clear.
That kind of knowledge gives a whole lot of value to your life.
So,

93
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.560
so we need the right kinds of accomplishments and the right kind of knowledge

94
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:36.970
and the right kinds of relationships.
But imagine you've worked that out.

95
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.250
The crucial point is that it takes more to have the best kind of life than just

96
00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:47.200
getting the insides right.
It also requires getting the outside's right,

97
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.200
whatever that comes to having in your life.

98
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:55.201
Not just experiences but the right kinds of goods or accomplishments or whatever

99
00:05:55.871 --> 00:05:58.310
term we use for it.
Now they say,

100
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:01.550
instead of pursuing the questions of how exactly that theory should go,

101
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.770
notice that if we had that theory,

102
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.950
we could still evaluate in principle whatever the practical difficulties might

103
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:12.770
be.
In principle,
we could still evaluate rival lives.

104
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:17.771
We could talk about adding up all the positive experiences along with all the

105
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.250
ask is of how many goods,
how many accomplishments of the of the right sort.

106
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.000
We're in that life and that's on the positive side of the ledger and against

107
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:33.260
that,
we would then have to subtract the sum total of the negative experiences,

108
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.230
all the failures and deceptions or what have you.

109
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:39.110
Those would count against the overall value of your life.

110
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.380
We could still say it's how good your life is as a matter of adding up the goods

111
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.670
and subtracting the bads,

112
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.740
but we now have a somewhat broader or more encompassing or inclusive list of

113
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:56.270
goods and more broad and encompassing list of Bads,
not just experience,

114
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:59.480
but also these various other accomplishments,
whatever.

115
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.600
Exactly that list comes to so we could still evaluate rival lives.

116
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:10.421
My life would have gone better if I had I chosen to become a farmer instead of

117
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:15.440
chosen to become a doctor or my life would have gone better for this period of

118
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:18.200
10 years,
but then would have become worse or what have you,

119
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.210
or when we ask ourselves how will things go for me over the next couple of weeks

120
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:27.110
if I,
if I go on vacation versus staying back here,

121
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.160
we add up the goods,
subtract the bads,

122
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.900
whatever our favorite list is and we come to the our best educated guess about

123
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:40.820
the rival evaluations of not just lives as a whole but chunks of lives.

124
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.460
Now what are those totals come to?
Well,

125
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:49.050
you might think it's an empirical question and in fact I am,

126
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.340
I'm inclined to think it's an empirical question varying from person to person,

127
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:56.060
but it's worth taking a moment to flag the fact that there are people,

128
00:07:56.061 --> 00:08:00.800
there are philosophers who think we can generalize across all humans.

129
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.950
You might say that optimists are people who think that for everybody,

130
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.890
in every case,
in every circumstance,

131
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.590
the totals always positive.

132
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.260
Life's always worth living.

133
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.450
It's always better than non existence.

134
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.600
That's what the optimist thinks,
not just for themselves individually,

135
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.280
but for everybody.
That totals always positive against that.

136
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.390
I suppose you've got pet pessimists,
pessimists to say no,
no.

137
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.610
Although life perhaps has some good things,

138
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.630
the overall grand balance is negative for everybody.

139
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:43.070
In every circumstance.
We'd all be better off dead or perhaps more accurately,

140
00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:46.580
still all be better off never having been born in the first place.

141
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:51.110
That's what the pessimists say.
And,
and in between the optimists,
on the one hand,

142
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:55.960
the pessimists on the other,
you've got moderates,
uh,
who say,
look,

143
00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.000
it varies in and,
and for some people they'll let the balance is positive.

144
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.730
For some people,
perhaps the balance has negative,

145
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:06.150
whether for their life as a whole or for certain stretches of their lives.

146
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:11.310
We then have to get down to facts about cases.
Try to describe the instance,

147
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:16.080
perhaps somebody who's in the terminal stages of some illness,

148
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.790
whether they're in a great deal of pain and the various other external goods of

149
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:24.450
life,
they can't because they're bedridden.
They can own longer,
accomplish things,

150
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.620
perhaps their families abandoned them.
W whatever the details might be,

151
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.680
we could describe lives and say whether or not their life was good as a whole.

152
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.660
The what,
what,
what sort of their future holds out for them,
uh,
is negative.

153
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.250
That's what the,
the moderate would say.
It varies from case to case.

154
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.330
Well,
however we settled that issue.

155
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:53.480
Notice there's still one other assumption that all these,
uh,

156
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.110
positions have still still have in common.
We've,

157
00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:02.450
we've expanded our list of goods so that nobody's going to deny that among the

158
00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:08.151
goods of life are our pleasure and other positive experiences and among the bads

159
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.830
of life,
our pain and other negative experiences.

160
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.900
But we've expanded the list of goods.

161
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:17.880
So it includes external goods and not only experiential or internal goods.

162
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:24.110
Still the views that I've been sketching all still have the following assumption

163
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:25.074
in common.

164
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:30.290
How good it is to be alive is a matter of adding up all of the call it the

165
00:10:32.251 --> 00:10:34.350
contents of life,

166
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.420
add up your experiences and your accomplishments and the the particular,

167
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.710
the particular details of your life as what the story's about.

168
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.650
It's it's as though we've been assuming and tech I have been assuming up to this

169
00:10:49.651 --> 00:10:54.651
moment that being alive per se has no value.

170
00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:01.610
It's life itself is a container which we feel with various goods or bads and and

171
00:11:04.981 --> 00:11:06.960
deciding how valuable it is,

172
00:11:06.961 --> 00:11:11.580
how good it is for me to be alive as a matter of adding up the value of the

173
00:11:11.581 --> 00:11:13.260
contents of the life,

174
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.950
but the container itself is a mirror container.

175
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.940
It has no value in and of itself.
We could say that.

176
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.970
What I've been presupposing up to this point is the neutral container theory of

177
00:11:27.361 --> 00:11:32.361
the value of life hedonisms a version of the neutral container theory.

178
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.320
How valuable,
how well off you are,
how valuable your life is.

179
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.950
Is a is a function of the contents,
the pleasure in the pain.

180
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.080
We've expanded the list of goods that can go within your life.

181
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:51.260
But for all that we still been acting as though the neutral container theories,

182
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:56.050
the right approach.
But against this there are those who think no,

183
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:59.950
and in addition to thinking about the value of the content of life,

184
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:05.250
we have to remember so these people claim that life itself is worth having.

185
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:07.420
There's,

186
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.420
there's a benefit to me above and beyond the question of what's going on with in

187
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:17.500
my life.
Am I loved?
Am I accomplishing things?
Am I having nice experiences,

188
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:20.710
are not above and beyond the question of the contents of my life.

189
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.040
We have to remember that the mere fact that I'm alive gives my life some value.

190
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.110
So these are valuable container theories.

191
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:35.980
Now think about what it would mean to accept a valuable container theory.

192
00:12:35.981 --> 00:12:40.981
You're saying that being alive per se has some positive value.

193
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:42.850
Oh,
actually,

194
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:47.230
first remark is probably wouldn't be completely accurate to say to describe

195
00:12:47.231 --> 00:12:52.150
these views.
I was saying it's been alive per se.

196
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.340
After all,
a blade of grass is alive and,

197
00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.600
and I presume that even fans of the,

198
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:03.490
what we might call malleable container theories don't think that,
oh,

199
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:06.940
wouldn't it be wonderful if as long as I was alive in the way that a blade of

200
00:13:06.941 --> 00:13:10.870
grass is alive,
life may have value in and of itself.

201
00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:15.820
But if not mere life,
what we want is the life of,
of a human.

202
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.480
We want a life in which we're,
we're accomplishing things.

203
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:23.980
There's agency and the life of knowing things cause you didn't have to be a

204
00:13:23.981 --> 00:13:25.420
knower in order to have knowledge.

205
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.580
The life of somebody who can have an emotional side.

206
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:33.160
So it's something like the life of a person.

207
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.650
When we say when there are people who are inclined to say that being alive per

208
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.090
say is valuable,

209
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.400
presumably what they mean is being alive as a person per se is valuable.

210
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:49.030
All right.
Note that point.
Keep it in mind for simplicity.

211
00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:53.500
I'll talk about these abuses.
Are they say life per se is valuable?

212
00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.640
Actually,
I suppose there could be a more extreme view still.

213
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.870
I,
it seems implausible to me,
but I suppose it's worth noticing.

214
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.150
There are people who think no being alive per se,
right?

215
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.230
Even though there I am and my and my,

216
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.430
my brain has been so thoroughly destroyed that I'm no longer able to know

217
00:14:15.431 --> 00:14:18.550
anything,
no longer able to relate emotionally to anybody,

218
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.120
no longer able to accomplish anything.
There I am just in a,

219
00:14:22.121 --> 00:14:25.870
in a persistent vegetative state,
but at least I'm alive.

220
00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.860
You could imagine somebody who has that view.
We've got to say,

221
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:31.720
I find that a pretty implausible view,

222
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.720
so I'm going to restrict myself at least when I think about it,

223
00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:39.970
to versions that say it's the life of a person per say.

224
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.980
That's valuable.
Now,

225
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:47.130
now notice that if we accept this view to decide how well off I am or somebody

226
00:14:50.351 --> 00:14:51.320
else is,

227
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:56.480
you can't just add up the contents of the life.

228
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.980
You can't just add up all the pleasures and subtract the pains or add up all the

229
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:04.580
accomplishments and subtract the failures or add up all the knowledge and

230
00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:07.070
subtract the the ignorance and deception.

231
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:12.510
Doing that in terms of the contents gives you a subtotal,

232
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:18.120
but that sub subtotal is no longer the entire story because we also have to add

233
00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:21.860
in if we accept a valuable container theory,

234
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:27.040
we also have to add in some extra positive points to take account of the fat

235
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.320
that well,

236
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.560
at least you're alive or have the life of a person or whatever it is that you

237
00:15:33.561 --> 00:15:35.570
think is valuable in and of itself.

238
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.830
So first we get the content subtitle subtotal,

239
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:45.450
then we add some extra points for the mere fact that you're alive.

240
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:51.060
Now notice that since we're adding extra positive facts,

241
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.360
extra positive points for the fact that you're alive.

242
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:56.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

243
00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:00.480
<v 0>Even if the contents subtotal is negative,</v>

244
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.860
the grand total could still be positive.

245
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:10.780
I suppose being alive per se is worth plus a hundred points just to make up some

246
00:16:11.731 --> 00:16:12.564
number.

247
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:18.200
Even if your content sub total was negative 10 that doesn't mean you're not

248
00:16:19.591 --> 00:16:23.370
better off a lot because negative 10 plus the extra hundred points for the mere

249
00:16:23.371 --> 00:16:28.371
fact that you're alive still going to give you a positive total plus 90

250
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:31.483
<v 1>yeah,</v>

251
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.120
<v 0>so the,
the,</v>

252
00:16:33.121 --> 00:16:38.121
the point of thinking about the possibility of accepting a valuable container

253
00:16:38.261 --> 00:16:42.760
theory is to remind us that in deciding,
you know,

254
00:16:42.761 --> 00:16:47.080
you're better off dead has,
has death deprived me of something good or not.

255
00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:52.260
It's important to not just focus on the contents but to also remember to add

256
00:16:53.951 --> 00:16:58.951
some positive points above and beyond just the content subtotal to take into

257
00:16:59.891 --> 00:17:03.880
account the value of the sheer fact that you're alive.

258
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:08.650
If you're a fan of the neutral container theory,

259
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:13.090
you won't have anything extra to add.
Cause life per se is just a zero.

260
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.310
It's strictly a matter of the contents.

261
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:19.780
But if you accept to valuable container theory,
you have to add something more.

262
00:17:19.781 --> 00:17:21.430
And so even if you might say,

263
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.990
the way my life is going in terms of its contents is bad,

264
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:30.100
being alive per se might still be a good thing.

265
00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:35.380
I have to add some extra points.
How much extra?
Well,

266
00:17:35.381 --> 00:17:36.640
here we're going to have of course,

267
00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:41.730
more modest and more bold versions of the valuable container theory.

268
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:47.350
Let me just distinguish two broad types,

269
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:54.410
what we might call modest versions of the valuable container theory.

270
00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:00.930
Say,
although being alive per se is good.

271
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.160
If the contents of your life get bad enough,

272
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:13.160
that can outweigh the value of being alive so that the grand total is negative.

273
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:22.370
Modest container theories that is say there's value to being alive,

274
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:29.270
but it can in principle be outweighed whether it gets outweighed easily or

275
00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:31.651
whether it's very,

276
00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:35.400
very difficult and the contents have to be horrible to outweigh it depending on

277
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:39.360
how much value you think being alive per se has.

278
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:43.350
So those are modest theories,
positive value for life,

279
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.260
but it can be outweighed against that.

280
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:51.290
You could imagine somebody who thinks being alive per se is so incredibly

281
00:18:51.871 --> 00:18:56.871
valuable that no matter how horrible the contents are,

282
00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:02.700
the grand total will always be positive.
It's,

283
00:19:02.701 --> 00:19:06.360
it's as though being lives,
it is infinitely valuable.

284
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.060
In comparison to questions about the contents.

285
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:14.390
We could call this the fantastic valuable container theory as opposed to the

286
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:19.050
modest valuable container theory.

287
00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.970
I suppose that label gives away where I want to come down on this.

288
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.500
I find the the fantastic valuable container theory.

289
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.740
Fantastic in the sense of sort of incredible.
I can't,

290
00:19:32.741 --> 00:19:37.250
I can't bring myself to believe it,
which

291
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:43.750
I have some sympathies for valuable container theories were also have some

292
00:19:43.751 --> 00:19:46.600
sympathy for neutral container theories.

293
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.980
Sometimes I'm drawn towards the neutral view.
Sometimes I'm drawn to her.

294
00:19:51.981 --> 00:19:54.640
The thought that being alive per se is good for you,

295
00:19:55.750 --> 00:20:00.070
but even in those moments when I'm drawn towards valuable container theories,

296
00:20:00.071 --> 00:20:01.570
it's always the modest version.

297
00:20:01.571 --> 00:20:04.960
I don't find myself drawn towards the fantastic version.

298
00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.590
Now,
if we,
if we,
if we make these distinctions,
then again,

299
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.840
remembering that the question we've been asking ourselves is,
you know,

300
00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.630
so why is death bad?

301
00:20:16.631 --> 00:20:20.860
The deprivation account says death is bad for you in so far as,

302
00:20:20.861 --> 00:20:24.760
or it's bad for you when,
what?

303
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:29.290
By virtue of dying now what you've been deprived of his,
you know,

304
00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:32.840
another chunk of life that would have been good for you to have.

305
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:39.330
And what we now see is that to see whether that could be the case or not,

306
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.920
we've got to get clear in our own minds about whether we believe in a neutral

307
00:20:43.921 --> 00:20:45.390
container theory,
uh,

308
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.480
a positive valuable theory or and among those between a fantastic and a modest

309
00:20:51.101 --> 00:20:56.050
container theory.
If we are neutral lists,

310
00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:01.200
we're going to say the question is what would the contents of my life have been,

311
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:05.980
you know,
for the next year,
10 years,
whatever.

312
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:07.750
If that would have been worth having,

313
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.320
then if as the next chunk of my life would have been worth having,

314
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:16.321
then it's bad for me that I die now instead of living for the next 10 years.

315
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.970
On the other hand,
if the balance from here on out would have been negative,

316
00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:27.330
then it's good for me that I died now instead of being kept alive with a life

317
00:21:27.341 --> 00:21:29.890
not worth living.
That's how the neutralist put it.

318
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.520
If we are valuable containers,
theorists,

319
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.060
we think the answer's got to be,
well look at the contents,

320
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.550
but don't forget to add some extra points.

321
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:45.070
Even if the next five years for you would have been in terms of the contents,

322
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.290
you know modestly bad.

323
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:51.520
Perhaps the value of at least being alive at all outweighs it so it still would

324
00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:53.860
have been better for you to be alive.

325
00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.970
But if the contents get bad enough then you'd be better off dead.

326
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.150
Noticing that on the modest view,

327
00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:05.860
if we ask ourselves would it had been good to be immortal,

328
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:10.550
the answer is going to depend on not just whether we accept Bernard Williams,

329
00:22:10.551 --> 00:22:15.310
his claim that immortality will be bad for you because we now realize that what

330
00:22:15.311 --> 00:22:20.311
Williams was talking about was the contents of an immortal life and that's no

331
00:22:20.981 --> 00:22:25.630
longer an adequate view.
At least it's no longer a complete story.

332
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.720
If we are valuable container theorists,
we could say,

333
00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.720
you could imagine somebody saying,
Oh yes,
you're right Williams,

334
00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.730
the contents get negative,

335
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.300
but that's still outweighed by the mere fact that you're alive.

336
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.670
So unbalanced being a mortal is a good thing.

337
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.720
Whether that's right or not depends on just how bad would it be to be immortal

338
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.600
because of course,
if you're a modest,

339
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:53.170
if you accept the modest version of the valuable container theory,

340
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.630
then if the contents get bad enough,

341
00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.490
that can outweigh the positive value of life against that.

342
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:05.970
Fans of the fantastic valuable container theory can say it doesn't really matter

343
00:23:06.161 --> 00:23:07.540
whether it Williams is right,

344
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:12.990
even if being a mortar will become horrendously boring and tedious or worse,

345
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.880
doesn't matter.

346
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.230
The value of being alive per se outweighs that.

347
00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:25.410
So you're always better off being alive so more life would always be better,

348
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.880
no matter how horrible the contents might be.

349
00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.910
So being immortal really would be a good thing for you.

350
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.370
Death always is a bad thing.

351
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:37.540
That's what you can say if you accept the fantastic container theory.

352
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.810
I don't find a fantastic container theory of myself.

353
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.850
I don't find it particularly attractive.

354
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:48.080
I'm inclined to think not only that,

355
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:54.790
not only that the contents of life would be bad eventually for all of us if we

356
00:23:56.571 --> 00:24:01.070
were mortal,
but that would be bad enough to outweigh whatever value,

357
00:24:01.071 --> 00:24:05.570
whatever positive value being alive per se may have for us.

358
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:10.630
So I'm inclined to think eventually in mortality would always be bad over

359
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:14.300
<v 2>all
right.</v>

360
00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:19.860
<v 0>But let me remind you that saying that does not rule out the possibility of</v>

361
00:24:19.961 --> 00:24:24.400
consistently going on to say that even though it's a good thing that we die

362
00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:29.490
because eventually in mortality would be horrible for all that death could still

363
00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.610
come too soon.

364
00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:39.450
It could still be the case that we die before life has turned bad.

365
00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.221
We die.

366
00:24:42.221 --> 00:24:46.960
While it's still the case that Lilly in another 10 years or 20 years or for that

367
00:24:46.961 --> 00:24:51.961
matter of 500 years would still or could still have been good for us.

368
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.320
It's compatible with thinking that immortality,

369
00:24:55.321 --> 00:25:00.310
it would be bad to think that in fact,
death comes too soon.

370
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.910
<v 2>But of course</v>

371
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.760
<v 0>we now have a return of the division between moderates,
optimists,</v>

372
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.640
and pessimists might say,

373
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:16.680
optimists are those now,
this more chasing version of optimism.

374
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.880
Optimists say,

375
00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:23.030
even if in mortality would be bad eventually after a million years or 10 million

376
00:25:23.881 --> 00:25:25.430
years or what have you,
you know,

377
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:28.890
that next chunk of life would have been good for all of us.

378
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.470
So that death,

379
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.860
they're optimist in this strange sense and I think life would have been good,

380
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:36.150
which means of course,

381
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:41.240
that that we die is bad for us because we all die too soon.

382
00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.990
That's what the optimists might say against that.

383
00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.150
The pessimists might say,
boy,

384
00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:51.450
death comes not a moment too soon for any of us.

385
00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:55.350
The next chunk of life is always not worth having.

386
00:25:55.351 --> 00:25:57.270
Always worse than nothing.

387
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.940
And in between these two extremes are the moderates who say,

388
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.320
for some of us,

389
00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:09.440
death comes too soon for some of us death and does not come too soon.

390
00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.070
There's a quote,
I want to read it.
It's,
it's actually out of,
out of place now.

391
00:26:17.071 --> 00:26:19.150
I should have read it,
uh,
you know,

392
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.250
a lecture or two ago when I started talking about immortality,

393
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.890
but I misplaced it.
So I found it this morning.

394
00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:29.250
So before we just leave the subject of and mortality,

395
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:34.430
let me conclude with some words of wisdom from a former Miss USA contestant.

396
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.490
She was asked the question,
you know,
would you want to live forever?

397
00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:39.870
And she responded,

398
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.130
I would not live forever because we should live forever.

399
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:48.450
Because if he were supposed to live forever,
then we would live forever.

400
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.830
But we cannot live forever,
which is why I would not live forever.

401
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.850
Isn't that nice?
All right.

402
00:26:56.851 --> 00:27:01.851
So I've been talking for actually now a couple of weeks I suppose about the

403
00:27:03.901 --> 00:27:06.780
central badness of death.

404
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.170
Why is it the death is bad for me.

405
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:15.150
And the answer I've proposed is the deprivation account,

406
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:19.740
this central bad thing about the fact that I'm going to die is the fact that

407
00:27:19.741 --> 00:27:23.550
because I'll be dead,
I'll be deprived of the good things in life.

408
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.240
And we've now seen that that's a bit crude,
right?
We have to not talk,

409
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.460
just talk about the good things in life.

410
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:34.380
But the good of life itself and we have to notice that perhaps on certain views

411
00:27:34.381 --> 00:27:35.490
for certain cases.

412
00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:40.020
It's not really the case that when I die I'm being deprived of a good life

413
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:43.710
because my,
the next chunk or perhaps from there on out it would have been bad,

414
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.740
but still details and complications of the sort we've been considering aside the

415
00:27:50.011 --> 00:27:55.011
fundamental badness of death is that it deprives me of life worth having.

416
00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:02.040
But although I'd been at pains to say that this is the fundamental bad thing

417
00:28:02.041 --> 00:28:02.874
about death,

418
00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:06.750
I think it's arguable that I think that one could make the case that this isn't

419
00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:09.600
the only bad thing about death.

420
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:13.980
Even if we're focusing on why his death bad for me,

421
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.880
there are other features of death as we experience it that are separable from

422
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:29.331
the deprivation account that at least add to the way that death occurs for us,

423
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:33.990
where we didn't have to ask the question,

424
00:28:33.991 --> 00:28:37.440
does this add to the badness of death or,

425
00:28:37.441 --> 00:28:41.460
or conceivably for some of these things,
perhaps it,
it mitigates it,
it,

426
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.740
it minimizes it in in one way or another.

427
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.530
So I want to do is take at least a couple of minutes,
uh,

428
00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:51.660
and pursue some of these extra features as well.

429
00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.370
Here's an example.

430
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:59.150
It's not merely the fact that it's not merely true that that you're going to

431
00:28:59.491 --> 00:29:00.324
die.

432
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:04.770
It's inevitable that you're going to die there.

433
00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:09.320
No avoiding the fact that you're going to die.
And I look,
you know,

434
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.020
you're all going to college,
but it wasn't inevitable that you go to college.

435
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.430
Had you,
had you chosen not to,
you could have avoided going to college,

436
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:22.710
but it doesn't matter what you choose,
you can't avoid dying.

437
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.920
So it's not just merely the case that in fact we are all going to die.

438
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:32.640
It's unnecessary truth that we're all going to die.

439
00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:37.140
So we might ask,
what about this inevitability of death?

440
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.960
Does that make things worse?

441
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:45.490
And here I wanted to distinguish between the individual question about the

442
00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:47.890
inevitability of death and the universal question.

443
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.220
So just start by thinking about the fact that it's unavoidable,

444
00:29:51.221 --> 00:29:52.990
that you're going to die.

445
00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:59.040
Does the unavoidability of death make it better or worse?

446
00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.600
And the interesting thing is I think you can see,

447
00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:06.120
you can get a feel for both possible answers here.

448
00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:11.190
On the one hand,
you could imagine somebody who says,
look,

449
00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.100
it's bad enough that I'm going to die,

450
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:19.190
but the fact that there's nothing I could do about it just makes it worse.

451
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:25.830
It's like adding insult to injury that I'm powerless in the face of death.

452
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.480
I cannot escape the grim reaper.

453
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:35.750
This sheer powerlessness about the central fact about the nature of my existence

454
00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:40.290
is an extra insult added to the injury.

455
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:42.020
<v 2>Okay?</v>

456
00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:46.010
<v 0>Against that.
However,
there are those people who'd want to say,
no.
Actually,</v>

457
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:51.250
the inevitability of my death reduces the badness.

458
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:57.050
Y'All know there especially,
you know,
don't cry over spilled milk,
right?

459
00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:00.440
That what's done is done.
You can't change it.

460
00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:04.970
What you can't change,
sort of lose it when you,

461
00:31:04.971 --> 00:31:07.520
when you focus on the fact that you can't change it,

462
00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:10.220
it loses some of its grip to upset you.

463
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.520
Well,
if that's right.

464
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:19.760
And if we then realize that there's nothing I can do about the fact that I'm

465
00:31:20.071 --> 00:31:24.510
going to die,
then perhaps some of the sting,

466
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:29.220
some of the bite,
uh,
is,
is eliminated.
It's as though you try,

467
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:34.170
try getting upset about the fact that that two plus two equals four.

468
00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:35.910
You know,
try,

469
00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:40.970
try feeling upset at your powerlessness to change the fact that two plus two

470
00:31:42.511 --> 00:31:47.220
equals four.
You know,
it's supposed to,
you,
you wanted to plus two to equal five,

471
00:31:47.221 --> 00:31:49.770
you know,
can,
can,
can you work up,
you know,

472
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:54.750
anger and regret and dismay over that.
Most of us,

473
00:31:54.751 --> 00:31:59.751
of course can't because when we see that something is just necessary,

474
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:06.130
we,
we,
it,
it reduces the,
the,

475
00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.250
the sting of it.

476
00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:13.070
The philosopher Spinoza thought that if we could only recognize the fact that

477
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.160
what he at least took to me,

478
00:32:14.161 --> 00:32:19.161
the fact that everything that happens in life is necessary,

479
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.990
then we'd get a kind of emotional distance from it.
Are no longer upset us.

480
00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:29.730
We could no longer be disappointed because to be disappointed in something

481
00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:33.060
presupposes that it could have been some other way.

482
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.370
And spinosa thought,
if you see that it couldn't go any other way,

483
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.530
then you be sad about it.
Well,

484
00:32:42.531 --> 00:32:47.450
if we see that our death is inevitable and we really internalize that fact,

485
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.380
perhaps that would reduce the badness of it.
Oh,
maybe that's right.

486
00:32:51.381 --> 00:32:52.820
But going back to the firsthand,

487
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.590
I don't know how many of you read Dostoyevsky's a,
a short novel,

488
00:32:57.591 --> 00:33:02.050
the underground man,
the underground man is upset about the,

489
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:02.990
if I remember correctly,

490
00:33:02.991 --> 00:33:07.580
he's upset about the fact that two plus two equals four and there's nothing that

491
00:33:07.581 --> 00:33:11.630
he can do about it.
He started,
he curses,
existence,

492
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.040
curses God,

493
00:33:13.041 --> 00:33:18.041
that having made him so impotent that he can't change the fact that two plus two

494
00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:24.210
equals four and,
and another philosopher Descartes,

495
00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:28.430
and thinking about Dodd's omnipotence thought that it wouldn't be good enough if

496
00:33:28.431 --> 00:33:33.140
God as omnipotent couldn't change the facts of mathematics.

497
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:37.430
And so he imagines that God as that Putin could have made two plus two equals

498
00:33:37.431 --> 00:33:39.950
five.
And so it's a kind of,

499
00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:44.951
so it is indeed a fact of our powerlessness that we're stuck with the

500
00:33:45.351 --> 00:33:47.000
necessities.
God isn't stuck with them.

501
00:33:47.001 --> 00:33:51.020
And so just to escape takes that thought and runs with it and says,
yeah,

502
00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:56.030
it doesn't help to say that it's inevitable.
It makes it worse.

503
00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.590
You know,
there's both sides.
And as I say,

504
00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:02.540
I myself can in different moods get pulled in both ways.

505
00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:07.160
What about the fact that not only is it inevitable that I'm going to die,

506
00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:10.820
it's inevitable that we're all going to die.

507
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:16.270
Does the universality of death make things better or worse?

508
00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:22.340
And again,
you can,
you can sort of feel,
feel the pool both ways.

509
00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:26.810
On the one hand you say,
look,
it's bad that I'm going to die,

510
00:34:26.811 --> 00:34:30.980
but I'm not a monster.
Makes me feel even worse than everybody else's stuck,

511
00:34:30.981 --> 00:34:34.100
dying.
Or perhaps we should say dying too soon.

512
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.710
In light of our discussion about in mortality,

513
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.210
it's a pity that most everybody,
or perhaps everybody dies too soon.

514
00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:45.290
That makes it even worse.
On the other hand,
you know,
let's be honest here,

515
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:49.370
you know,
we also know the expression misery loves company.
Uh,

516
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.370
and there's at least some comfort to be had,

517
00:34:52.371 --> 00:34:56.000
isn't there in the realization that this,
this,

518
00:34:56.001 --> 00:34:58.160
this thing isn't just true for me.

519
00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:03.220
It's not like the universe has singled me out for the deprivation of dying too

520
00:35:05.871 --> 00:35:10.250
soon.
Uh,
it's something that it does to everybody.

521
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:14.540
So perhaps there's some comfort in the inevitability of death.

522
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.560
Well,
here's a different aspect of death.

523
00:35:18.561 --> 00:35:23.561
We're thinking about what about the variability of death after all,

524
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:27.300
it's not just the case that we all die and,

525
00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.120
and I'll stop saying die too soon.

526
00:35:29.121 --> 00:35:32.570
Let's just suppose we understand that clause to be implied in what I'm saying.

527
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:35.240
It's not just the case that we all die.

528
00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:41.240
There's a deal of variation in how much life we get.

529
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:46.830
Some of us make it to the ripe old age of 80,
90,
a hundred or more.

530
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:52.290
Others of us die at 20 or 15 or 10 or younger.

531
00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:54.380
<v 2>Okay.</v>

532
00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.870
<v 0>Even if death were inevitable,</v>

533
00:35:56.990 --> 00:36:01.280
it wouldn't have to come in different size packages.
That is,

534
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:03.140
it wouldn't have to have variability.

535
00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:06.500
We could imagine a world in which everybody dies.

536
00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.960
Everybody dies at the age of a hundred.

537
00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:15.480
Does it make things worse or better that there's this kind of variability

538
00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:23.030
from a moral point of view?
I suppose it's fairly straight forward.

539
00:36:23.031 --> 00:36:26.440
Just suggest it makes things worse.
After all,

540
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:31.470
most of us are inclined to think that any quality is morally objectionable.

541
00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.710
It's bad that through no fault of their own,

542
00:36:35.711 --> 00:36:39.880
some people are poor and other people are rich,
while other people are rich.

543
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.820
If any is morally objectionable,

544
00:36:42.821 --> 00:36:47.800
then it's very likely we're gonna think it's Mora morally horrendous that

545
00:36:47.801 --> 00:36:50.590
there's this crucial inequality.

546
00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:55.830
Some of us die at the age of five while others get to live to 90

547
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:02.470
but in keeping with the focus of our discussion about the badness of death,

548
00:37:02.471 --> 00:37:07.471
they want to put aside the moral question and think about how good or bad for me

549
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:12.780
is it that there's variability in death?

550
00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:19.180
Well,
we might say,
let's,
let's look at it from,
from two basic perspectives.

551
00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:24.330
Those who get less than the average lifespan and those who get more than the

552
00:37:25.241 --> 00:37:29.680
average lifespan.
From the point of view of somebody who gets less,

553
00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:34.600
this is obviously a bad thing.
It's bad enough that I'm going to die too soon.

554
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.420
Said I wasn't going to keep saying that remark and Ari,
I'm saying it anyway.

555
00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:39.040
It's bad enough that I'm going to die,

556
00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:45.120
but what's even worse is I'm going to get even less than the average amount of

557
00:37:46.391 --> 00:37:50.860
life.
That's clearly an extra bad,
but we might then wonder,

558
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:55.880
look for every person who gets less than the average amount of life.
Yeah,

559
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:59.770
at least supposed to take the media and take the amount of life.
That's exactly.

560
00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:02.500
50% of the people get more.
50% of people get less.

561
00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:05.290
For every person who has less than the median amount of life,

562
00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:10.420
there's another person who has more than the median amount of life.

563
00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:12.940
That person gets to say,
Hey,
well,
you know,

564
00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:15.370
it's a pity they didn't go on to die or die too soon,

565
00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:19.030
but at least I'm getting more than the average.
That's a plus.

566
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:25.490
So perhaps these two aspects balanced themselves out.
You know,

567
00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.600
there are people who were basically screwed by the fact that they get less than

568
00:38:29.601 --> 00:38:33.350
the average amount and people who are benefited by getting more than the average

569
00:38:33.351 --> 00:38:36.970
amount.
So perhaps in terms the individual badness of death,

570
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
that's a wash maybe except seems to me it's a further fact about human

571
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:48.090
psychology that we care more about being short changed then we do about being as

572
00:38:50.051 --> 00:38:52.150
we might put it over compensated.

573
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:58.780
I rather suspect that people who have less than the average of something,

574
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:04.230
it hurts them more than it benefits the people who have more than average of

575
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:12.490
something.
And if that's right,
and that seems likely to be the case,

576
00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:17.490
especially for something like death,
the,
the,
the,

577
00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:23.010
the extra bad of the fact that there's variability and so some people get less

578
00:39:24.131 --> 00:39:26.110
than average.
That extra bad,

579
00:39:26.111 --> 00:39:31.111
I suspect outweighs the extra benefit of some people having more than average.

580
00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:38.210
Well,
consider a different feature.
We've had inevitability,

581
00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.060
we had variability,
variability.

582
00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:44.660
What about on predictability?

583
00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:48.350
Not only is it inevitable that you're going to die,

584
00:39:48.351 --> 00:39:51.500
not only do some people live longer than others,

585
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:56.650
you don't know how much more time you got.

586
00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.400
Now you might think,
well,
we didn't.
We already discuss that when we started.

587
00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:03.710
Think about variability,
but in fact,
very logically speaking,

588
00:40:03.711 --> 00:40:07.430
at least variability,
although it's a requirement for unpredictability,

589
00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.130
doesn't guarantee unpredictability.

590
00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:15.220
You could have variability with complete predictability.

591
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:19.520
I imagine that when everybody's born,
you know on on their wrist,

592
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:25.170
everybody's born with a natural birth mark that indicates the precise year,

593
00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.390
day,
and time in which they're going to die.

594
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:35.430
We could imagine a world like this where it's inevitable.

595
00:40:35.431 --> 00:40:39.690
Everybody has got some date on it,
and for all the Ed for that matter,

596
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:42.870
there could still be variability.
Some people live 80 years,

597
00:40:42.871 --> 00:40:44.190
some people live 20 years,

598
00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:49.370
but there's no unpredictability because of the the birthmark.

599
00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:54.980
Everybody knows exactly how much longer they've got.

600
00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:01.820
Well,
so in our world,
we don't have that in our world.

601
00:41:01.821 --> 00:41:05.960
Not only do we have variability,
we've got unpredictability.

602
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:10.760
Does that make things better or does that make things worse?

603
00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:16.090
Would it be better to know when you were going to die?

604
00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.353
Well,

605
00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:23.980
one way in which unpredictability at least has the potential of making things

606
00:41:24.471 --> 00:41:25.100
worse.

607
00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:30.100
Is this because you don't know how much more time you got.

608
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:35.060
You can make a based on statistics,

609
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:38.120
but in others we saw this wild unpredictability.
You know,

610
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:41.420
you can take up the average lifespan in the United States is whatever it is,

611
00:41:41.421 --> 00:41:45.590
82 years.
Uh,
so I probably have you guys on your 20 you know,

612
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:49.460
20 roughly another 60 years ago.
And as you're busy calculator and all this,

613
00:41:49.461 --> 00:41:52.660
you're walking across chapel street and get hit by a truck and you die,
right?

614
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:57.560
Because of unpredictability,
you can't really know.

615
00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.080
And because you can't really know,

616
00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:05.750
it's difficult to make the right kinds of plans.

617
00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:07.490
And in particular,

618
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:11.690
it's hard to know how to pace yourself.

619
00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:14.030
You know,
you just,

620
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:18.830
you decide to go off to medical school,

621
00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:23.270
become a doctor.
And so not only do you put the time into college,

622
00:42:23.271 --> 00:42:26.690
you put the time in the medical school and you put the time into your residency

623
00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.030
and you put your time into your internship.

624
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:32.930
And that's a very long commitment.

625
00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:38.260
It's a longterm plan which can go wrong if you get sick and die in your early

626
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:45.020
twenties
well that's another dramatic example,

627
00:42:45.021 --> 00:42:49.530
but the same sort of thing in principle can happen to all of us.
You,
you,

628
00:42:49.531 --> 00:42:54.531
you make a life plan what you want to accomplish in your life and well obviously

629
00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:00.740
enough,
some of us will die too soon,
not just in terms of,

630
00:43:00.741 --> 00:43:04.010
oh well life still could have had good things but too soon in terms of you

631
00:43:04.011 --> 00:43:07.670
didn't get where you wanted to get in terms of your life plan.

632
00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:12.350
If only you'd known you were only going to have 20 more years instead of 50 more

633
00:43:12.351 --> 00:43:16.910
years,
you would have picked a different kind of life for yourself.

634
00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.120
The unpredictability makes it worse

635
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:25.040
and indeed less.
Obviously it can work the other way as well.

636
00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:30.100
You make a life plan and then you know you don't die yet.

637
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:34.440
You,
you continue to stick around and the,

638
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:38.120
and then your life sort of has this feeling of at least we can imagine this

639
00:43:38.121 --> 00:43:42.020
happening,
being sort of anticlimactic.
You sort of,

640
00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.970
you peaked too soon.

641
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:48.440
If only you known you had another 50 years and you weren't going to die young,

642
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.560
you got your James Deane going to burn out fast and die young.

643
00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:56.680
If only you'd realize you were going to live to the ripe old age of 97 you would

644
00:43:56.721 --> 00:43:58.640
have picked a different life for yourself.

645
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:03.390
Now in thinking about these points in effects,

646
00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:07.130
I'm suggesting that the value of your life,

647
00:44:07.131 --> 00:44:09.800
so you know we previously were talking about different theories of wellbeing and

648
00:44:09.801 --> 00:44:11.030
what makes for a best kind of life.

649
00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:14.690
Here we have yet another kind of feature that we haven't talked about.

650
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:19.750
We might think of it as the overall shape of your life matters.

651
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:26.440
The what we could also call the narrative arc of your life matters.

652
00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:33.780
Let me,
let me illustrate the point with some very,
very simple graphs.

653
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.670
These are not meant to be realistic,

654
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:40.700
but they'll give you the idea so we all know the the Horatio Alger story,

655
00:44:41.191 --> 00:44:41.670
right?

656
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:46.670
Somebody starts out poor and makes his way through hard work and dedication and

657
00:44:48.001 --> 00:44:51.300
effort to to riches and success,

658
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:56.850
rags to riches.
That's,
that's a wonderful,
inspiring life.
Let's,

659
00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:59.820
let's draw the graph of that life.

660
00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:03.960
So here's how well off you are.
Here's time.

661
00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:08.130
You start with nothing and you end up incredibly well off.

662
00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:12.630
That's a great life.
That's the Horatio Alger life.

663
00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:13.913
Ha.

664
00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:16.420
<v 1>Great Life.</v>

665
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:20.410
<v 0>All right,
now consider the following story.</v>

666
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:22.440
Here's axes again.

667
00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:23.940
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

668
00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.040
<v 0>said the rags to riches life.</v>

669
00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:29.070
Imagine the riches to rags.

670
00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:33.900
Life starts off with everything ends up with nothing.

671
00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:36.900
That's the Algers Horatio's story.

672
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:43.070
<v 1>It's the reverse.
Now,</v>

673
00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:49.960
<v 0>I doubt if there's anybody here who is indifferent between the choices,</v>

674
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.360
the different with regard to the choice between these two lives.

675
00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:59.600
I imagine that everybody here prefers this life.

676
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.070
<v 1>Okay,</v>

677
00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:04.520
<v 0>but notice that in terms of the contents of the life,</v>

678
00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:08.840
at least the local contents,
it's a bit hard to see why that would be the case,

679
00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:09.860
right?
You know,

680
00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.330
you've got equal periods of suffering and doing slightly better and slightly

681
00:46:14.331 --> 00:46:19.331
better and slightly better equal periods of success and suffering.

682
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:21.860
You know,
for every bad period here,

683
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:25.580
there's a corresponding bad period here for every good period here,

684
00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:29.690
there's a corresponding good period here in terms of the contents of your life

685
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:30.411
being crude.

686
00:46:30.411 --> 00:46:34.910
But you see the point in terms of the contents of your life equally good and

687
00:46:34.911 --> 00:46:39.350
even if we accept the valuable container theory and so we say,
Huh,

688
00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:43.130
you know,
being alive per se is worth something as well.
Well,

689
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:48.350
you're alive for equal periods of time.
So the extra points get added either way.

690
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:54.230
Might say,
look,
if we're,
if we're not indifferent between these two lives,

691
00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:59.410
that's because we think the overall shape of your life matters as well.

692
00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:06.030
The narrative arc as I put it,

693
00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:11.210
the story bad to good is the kind of story we want for ourselves.

694
00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:16.820
While the story good to bad is the kind of story we don't want for ourselves.

695
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:22.110
Interesting question.
Why is that?

696
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:28.170
And you know this of course should remind us of the puzzle about Lucretia's.

697
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:33.320
Why do we care more about future nonexistence then pass not existence.

698
00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:36.310
You know when the bad is behind us,

699
00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:40.420
that seems less bothersome than when the bad is in front of us.

700
00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:45.840
You may remember the story from Derek Parfitt about having the painful operation

701
00:47:46.001 --> 00:47:48.420
wasn't going to be in the future.
It wasn't going well.

702
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:52.030
Did it take place earlier today?
You don't remember.
We're not indifferent.

703
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.690
We want the bad behind us,
not the bad in front of us.

704
00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.440
So whatever the explanation is,

705
00:47:59.441 --> 00:48:04.441
we care about the overall shape and trajectory of our life.

706
00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:07.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

707
00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:08.690
<v 0>Now that being the case,</v>

708
00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:13.780
we have to worry then that because of the unpredictability of death that our

709
00:48:15.891 --> 00:48:18.800
lives may not have the ideal shape.

710
00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:26.680
Lot of us might feel that a life like this where we peak,

711
00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:32.150
but then we sort of,
you know,
stick around,
you know,

712
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:37.500
is it Elle can at least fail to be as desirable in which we sort of end with a

713
00:48:37.671 --> 00:48:41.500
bang.
If you start thinking about narrative arcs,
imagine a novel,
right?
It's,

714
00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:45.950
it's one thing to have.
It's not to say that the bay,
if you,

715
00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:49.430
if you want your life to be like the plot of a great story,

716
00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:51.170
it's not as though you think,
all right,

717
00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:56.180
the denouement must occur at the very last page.
So,

718
00:48:56.181 --> 00:49:00.620
okay,
to sort of stick around for a while.
But if,
if the,

719
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:05.650
if the high point of the story occurs in chapter two and then there's another 67

720
00:49:06.651 --> 00:49:08.210
chapters after that,

721
00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:13.240
you think this was not a well constructed novel and in so far as we care about

722
00:49:14.271 --> 00:49:16.490
the overall shape of our lives,

723
00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:21.670
we might worry about wanting it to have the right shape overall.

724
00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:28.180
Where and when do you want to peak as it were in terms of your accomplishments?

725
00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:30.980
Well,
that matters to us,

726
00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:34.580
but the trouble is without predictability,

727
00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:39.970
you don't know where to put the peak because if you try to aim for peaking

728
00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:45.680
later,
you might not make it to that.
If you put it too soon,

729
00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:50.540
you might stick around for longer than that and then the peak has come too soon.

730
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.970
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

731
00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:57.970
<v 0>All of this suggests then that the unpredictability of our death adds an extra</v>

732
00:50:00.291 --> 00:50:01.760
negative element.

733
00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:07.180
It makes it harder to plan what the best way to live my life would be.

734
00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:13.570
And from that perspective it looks as though it would be better to know how much

735
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:15.740
time you've got left,

736
00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:20.140
but then we have to ask,
so I'll throw the question out.

737
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:24.170
We'll call it a day start with his next time.
Then we have to ask,

738
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:27.470
would it really be better to know?

739
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.230
Would you want the birthmark?

740
