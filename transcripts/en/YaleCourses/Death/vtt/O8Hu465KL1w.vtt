1
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.230
At the end of last class,
I quoted some words from Kurt Vonnegut,

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.740
uh,
kind of,
uh,

3
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.290
death deathbed prayer confession that he'd written in one of his novels in which

4
00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:14.740
the basic gist of the,
uh,

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.880
prayer is to express gratitude of Howard whatever the content of your life,

6
00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:22.970
the fact that at least you've been able to live at all as he put it,

7
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.790
most mud isn't lucky enough to sit up.

8
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.930
He feels lucky to have been some of the city and up mud.

9
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.490
He loved everything he saw.
When I read that quote,

10
00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:38.850
I did not know that Kurt Vonnegut had died the night before.
Um,

11
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:40.220
immediately after the class ended,

12
00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:44.120
a visitor to the class brought this fact to my attention.

13
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.560
So I can't pass without commenting on that death.

14
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.040
And just remark that I hope that till the very end,

15
00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:55.940
Kurt Vonnegut who lived till he was 84,
uh,

16
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.880
realized how lucky he was to be some of the city not mud.

17
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.610
All right.
The question I want to turn to now is this.

18
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.030
So we've been going over the various facts about the nature of life and death.

19
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:15.420
And the question then is how should we live in light of the fact that we're

20
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:16.350
going to die?

21
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.600
Previously we've talked about what emotional response we should have to that.

22
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.440
And I've argued as I've just reminded us that,
uh,

23
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.700
although perhaps the most common reaction is one of fear or terror at death,

24
00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:33.720
it may in fact be that we should be grateful and consider ourselves lucky that

25
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:37.290
we're able to have had life as well life at all.

26
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.660
But how then should we live in light of the fact that we're going to die?

27
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.030
And the immediate answer that comes to mind,
it seems almost like a joke.
Uh,

28
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.440
I want to say,
well,
we should be careful.
Um,
given that one kid,
we can die,

29
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:56.280
that we will die.
They used to be a TV show,
a cop show called Hill street blues.

30
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.660
The show began every day with the sergeant sort of going over the various crimes

31
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:05.070
and investigations that,
uh,
we're going to sort of fill up,
uh,
the days,

32
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.230
the days episode.
And he'd always end as he sent off his police,
uh,
his,
the cops,

33
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:13.680
he,
and by saying,
be careful,
be careful out there,

34
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.770
but the particular kind of care that I have in mind isn't just this sheer fact

35
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:20.940
that,
you know,
if you're not careful,
you'll,

36
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.300
you won't notice that the cars coming down the street and you'll get hit by the

37
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:25.410
car and that'll be the end.

38
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.880
The fact that we're going to die intuitively seems to require a particular kind

39
00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:34.620
of care because as we might put it,
you only go around once,

40
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.260
right?
Uh,
you don't get,
you don't get to do it again.

41
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.470
And so it seems as though the fact that we're mortal,

42
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:45.471
the fact that we've got a finite lifespan requires us to face the fact that

43
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.440
intuitively we can blow it.
We could do it wrong.

44
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.300
Now the,

45
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.010
the nit picky part of me wants to point out that it can't be mortality per se,

46
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.920
that has this implication.
Even if we lived forever,

47
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.100
we could still do it wrong.
After all,

48
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.120
whatever it is you filled your life with,
with an immortal,
infinite life,

49
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.130
they're still going to be that particular pattern of actions and activities that

50
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:13.000
you engage in.

51
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.560
And that particular pattern could still be one that wasn't the best pattern that

52
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:20.320
was available to you.
So the,

53
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.690
the possibility of having blown it,

54
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.050
of having lived the wrong kind of life is a possibility that's going to be true

55
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:32.950
of us.
Whether or not we're mortal,
and yet for all that,

56
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.010
it seems as though mortality adds an extra risk and extra danger of blowing it.

57
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.390
Look,

58
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.540
it's supposed to be lived forever and just have a kind of simplistic example.

59
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.280
You might say,
imagine somebody who spends his eternity counting the integers,

60
00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:51.100
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six.

61
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.360
Well that might not be as valuable as an eternity spent doing something else.

62
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:59.230
Let's say,
uh,
doing more complicated math,

63
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.120
but still if you've spent a million years or a billion years counting the

64
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:07.450
integers and then realized that was sort of pointless,

65
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:11.560
you could always start over by doing more interesting,
more deep,

66
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.840
more worthwhile math.

67
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.150
The immortality gives you a chance of starting over,

68
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.610
gives you the possibility of do overs.

69
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.370
We might then worry that what's especially bad about death,

70
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.200
the fact that we're mortal is that it robs us of the chance of do overs.

71
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:34.570
But of course that's not quite right either.
I mean,

72
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:38.950
even if you don't live forever,
you live 80 years or 100 years,

73
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:43.951
you have the chance to reappraise your life at the age of 20 or 30 or 50 and

74
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:45.970
decide you need to change course.

75
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.470
So it's not exactly as though the possibility of do overs disappears by death

76
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.840
itself via death itself.

77
00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.890
Still the thought that death comes when it does seems to push us in the

78
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:02.980
direction of thinking.

79
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:07.981
We've still got to be very careful because of course getting that we're mortal,

80
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.620
we have only a limited period of time in which to do the do overs.

81
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.110
There are,

82
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.620
there are two kinds of mistakes really that we might catch ourselves in.

83
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.830
We might discover on the one hand that we made some bad choices in terms of what

84
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:28.750
we were aiming for and on the other hand we might find even if we made the right

85
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:30.250
choices in terms of our goals,

86
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.310
we flubbed it in terms of actually accomplishing what we were trying to

87
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:40.090
accomplish and so we've got,
we literally have to start over again and try again.

88
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.820
So there's two kinds of care that we have to take.

89
00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:50.821
We have to be careful in our aims and we have to be careful in our execution of

90
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:54.730
our aims because we have as it were,

91
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:59.060
a rather limited amount of time to do it over.
Now again,

92
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.450
the nit picky part of me wants to say strictly speaking,

93
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:06.080
it's not the fact that we are mortal per se.

94
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.260
That all by itself means we have to be especially careful after all.

95
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.540
Suppose there just weren't all that many things worth doing and suppose they

96
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:20.120
weren't all that complicated,

97
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.730
all that difficult to do well.

98
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.820
So those are the only five things worth doing.

99
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:30.140
And even if you couldn't necessarily do every single one of them right the first

100
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:35.141
time out at most it would take two or three tries and buy a try.

101
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:38.570
I mean maybe an hour or two.

102
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.700
Well that'd be a pretty impoverished world that could only offer us that much.

103
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:48.620
But after all,
if that was the way the world works and we had a hundred years,

104
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.790
we wouldn't really have to worry all that much about being careful.

105
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.090
We'd have plenty of time to aim for each of the five things worth having and

106
00:06:59.931 --> 00:07:03.860
plenty of time to get each one of the five things right.

107
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.700
A hundred years of life would be more than enough.

108
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.140
We wouldn't have to be careful.

109
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.200
So it's not just the fact that we're mortal that requires us to be careful.

110
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.520
It's the fact that we have a relatively short span of life relative to how much

111
00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:29.771
there is worth aiming for and how complicated and difficult it can be to get

112
00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:34.100
those things and get them right.

113
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:43.060
It's because of the fact that there's so much to do and doing it properly that

114
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:46.850
we have to be careful.

115
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.770
We just don't have enough time to sort of flail around and try a little of this,

116
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:52.880
try a little of that.

117
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.940
Somebody who lives like that may well find that the things they aimed for war,

118
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.910
really the best choices.

119
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.950
You don't have to decide that these things weren't worth having at all given the

120
00:08:06.951 --> 00:08:09.860
relatively short period of time we've got.

121
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:15.220
We've got the extra burden of deciding what are the things most worth going

122
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.980
after and we have to face the prospect that chance that we will look back and

123
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:25.850
discover that we didn't make the best choices there.

124
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:30.170
We aimed for the wrong things,
not necessarily things that weren't worth having,

125
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.680
but given the limited number of things where we were going to be able to fill

126
00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:37.250
our lives with in that sense the wrong choices.

127
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.830
And we may discover as well that we were not sufficiently careful,

128
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:47.750
attentive in how we tried to achieve these things because it's not as though,

129
00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:51.500
although given the way life is,
you've got the chance for do overs,

130
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.320
you don't have time for a whole lot of do overs.

131
00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:00.710
And so what death forces us to do is to be careful and analogy that comes to

132
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:04.750
mind here is a,
an artist who goes up,

133
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:09.180
musician who goes into a recording studio and look,

134
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.150
he can start trying to record his songs to cut an album.
Uh,

135
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:18.000
and he may only have a certain number of songs in his repertoire.

136
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:23.510
And so if he's got a long enough period of time a month in the recording studio,

137
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:29.030
he's got plenty of time where she's got plenty of time to sing a couple of

138
00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:32.670
songs.
Maybe these wouldn't be the best things to record.

139
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:37.080
Let's give it a try and we'll see.
Didn't get it right the first take.

140
00:09:37.081 --> 00:09:40.590
Let's record it again.
Let's try it a third time.
Let's try it a fourth time.

141
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.080
If you've got enough time,

142
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.760
it's less pressing to get clear before you start.

143
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:49.050
Or as you're going along,

144
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.200
what are the songs I should try to record and can I get it on one take or at

145
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:59.010
most two,
but if instead of having a month in the recording studio,

146
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:04.130
you've got only a week in the studio or a day in the studio,

147
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.860
suddenly everything's much more pressing.

148
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.400
Time is much more precious.

149
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:17.270
You've got to decide early on just which are the songs that it makes sense to

150
00:10:18.301 --> 00:10:20.460
record and yeah,
there were some other songs,

151
00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:24.480
but these seem to be the better choices and when you record them,

152
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.620
you can't be as careless and inattentive as you try to get them down.

153
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:33.390
You've got to try to get it right the first time or at worst the second time.

154
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.400
That's it seems to me the situation we find ourselves in,

155
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.680
not just given the fact that we die,

156
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:45.681
but we might say given how incredibly rich the world is,

157
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.230
how many things it offers us,

158
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:54.360
how many choices we have in terms of what's worth going after,

159
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:59.490
but for many of these things,
given how difficult they are to accomplish,

160
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.120
although we've got the chance for do overs,

161
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.600
both in terms of changing our mind about what we should be aiming at and trying

162
00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:11.550
again for the things we have aimed debt,

163
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.070
we've got to be careful.

164
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:19.170
The fact about our death requires paying attention.

165
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:23.220
It requires care.
Well,
having said that,

166
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.040
of course they needed question that has,
all right,
so,
so I'm paying attention,

167
00:11:26.041 --> 00:11:30.810
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm trying to be careful.
What should I do with my life?

168
00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:34.050
How,
how shall I,
what should I fill it with?

169
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:38.280
We've previously in the class talked about the possibility that being alive per

170
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:40.260
se may have some value,

171
00:11:40.261 --> 00:11:44.970
but w above and beyond whatever standard we take on that certainly also the case

172
00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:49.971
that part of what adds to the value of our lives are the contents of our lives

173
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.490
and so we need to ask,
well,

174
00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:59.491
what kinds of contents should we try to fill our lives with?

175
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.010
Now I won't try to answer that to to ask the question,

176
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:11.011
what are the things really worth going after in life is to come up to the edge

177
00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:16.990
of asking,
well,
just what is the meaning of life?

178
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:22.020
What's really worth going after and although that is indeed an important perhaps

179
00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:25.480
the important question,

180
00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:30.430
it's the question I think for a different class and so having come close to the

181
00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:34.390
edge of that question,
I'm going to now back away from it,

182
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:40.330
but still it seems we might say in broad strokes there are two different

183
00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:45.331
strategies that we could adopt and it's worth at least pause and to think about

184
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:46.960
these two strategies.

185
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.060
Strategy Number One says,

186
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:57.100
given that you've only got a finite amount of time,

187
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.220
actually the basic underlying thought,
hi,
both strategies,

188
00:13:00.221 --> 00:13:05.221
it's just this haven't gotten much time pack as much as you can into life pack

189
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:09.040
as much as,
as much as you can in.

190
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:13.690
But there are two basic strategies about how to put that idea to practice.

191
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.580
And strategy number one says,

192
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:23.450
given the dangers of failure,

193
00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.210
if you aim to ambitiously,

194
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.960
you should settle for the kinds of goals that you're virtually guaranteed that

195
00:13:33.291 --> 00:13:36.900
you'll accomplish.
The pleasure is a food

196
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.630
company,
sex,
ice cream.

197
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.010
Uh,
one of the paper topics a asks you to reflect on the philosophy,
eat,
drink,

198
00:13:49.011 --> 00:13:52.970
and be merry for tomorrow.
You Die.
Well,
that's one of the strategies.
All right,

199
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.460
we're going to be dead tomorrow.

200
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:58.880
And so while we're here,

201
00:13:58.881 --> 00:14:03.881
let's try to pack in as much as we can by going for the things that we've got a

202
00:14:04.881 --> 00:14:07.850
very high chance of actually accomplishing.

203
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:14.300
Strategy number two says,
well,
that's all well and good.

204
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:19.130
You've got a pretty high chance of succeeding at that.

205
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.780
The trouble with strategy.

206
00:14:20.781 --> 00:14:25.250
Number one is the goods that you can achieve,

207
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.240
the sort of shore thing.
Goods are small,

208
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.950
they're rather small potatoes as things go.

209
00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:39.340
Some of the most valuable goods in life are things that don't come so readily.

210
00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:44.090
Don't come with guarantees of achieving them.

211
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:49.630
You might want to write a novel compose a symphony or for that matter,

212
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.890
res marry and a family.

213
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.450
Some of these things,
strat fans,

214
00:14:56.451 --> 00:15:01.451
a strategy number to argue these things are the most valuable things that life

215
00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:08.261
can offer us so that a life filled with these larger goods is a more valuable

216
00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:14.900
life than a life filled with the small potatoes.
Goods,

217
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.710
I suppose fans of the eat,
drink and be merry strategy.

218
00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:21.170
Don't like to call those small potatoes goods,

219
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.250
but that's the kind of language that might be offered by fans.

220
00:15:24.251 --> 00:15:25.460
A strategy number two,

221
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.880
and it seems to me that as a clean about which life,

222
00:15:31.881 --> 00:15:36.170
if only you had it,
if you had a guarantee,
you know,
if God were going to say,

223
00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:38.660
look,
which life do you want?
I promise you'll get it.

224
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:43.690
The life filled with food and drink or the life filled with accomplishment.

225
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:46.860
<v 2>Okay.</v>

226
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.880
<v 0>Perhaps most of us would say,
well,
it's the life filled with accomplishment.</v>

227
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.220
That's the more valuable life.

228
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.510
The trouble of course is the life with the greater accomplishments.

229
00:15:57.511 --> 00:16:02.511
The like aiming for greater accomplishments is also a life with a greater chance

230
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.050
of failure.

231
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:10.430
You aim for writing the great American novel and 10 years later you still

232
00:16:10.621 --> 00:16:15.450
haven't finished it in 20 years later you decide you don't have it in you to

233
00:16:15.451 --> 00:16:17.640
write the great American novel.

234
00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.020
<v 2>Okay.</v>

235
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.560
<v 0>You try to produce a business and it goes under.</v>

236
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.480
<v 2>Okay,</v>

237
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.870
<v 0>so what's the right strategy to take?</v>

238
00:16:28.871 --> 00:16:32.890
I suppose many of us would be inclined to say,
well,
the third strategy,

239
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.970
there's a third strategy.
That's the obvious league right thing to do,

240
00:16:36.971 --> 00:16:39.880
which is get the right mixture,

241
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.860
aim for a certain number of,
what should we call it?

242
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:50.240
Large potatoes gave for a certain number of the large accomplishments because if

243
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:54.470
you do manage to get them,
your life will have more value,

244
00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:00.220
but also throw in a certain sprinkling of the smaller things where you're at

245
00:17:01.791 --> 00:17:04.850
least assured of having gotten something out of life.
Well,

246
00:17:04.851 --> 00:17:07.250
that's all well and good as well,

247
00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.570
but adjust now brings us to the next question.

248
00:17:11.571 --> 00:17:15.710
What is the right mixture after all?

249
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:21.140
Well,
I'm not going to try to answer that one either,
but again,

250
00:17:21.141 --> 00:17:24.350
those of you who choose the topic that eat,
drink and be merry question.

251
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.520
Basically I'm inviting you in that topic to reflect on that question.

252
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:34.040
Here's a different thought.
The entire,
as they said,

253
00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:37.130
the underlying thought behind the the,
you know,

254
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.630
go for the big things.
Go for the small things,
was pack it all in.

255
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.500
The underlying thoughts seem to be,
well,
look you,

256
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.770
as long as you've got a life that's got valuable contents,

257
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.650
the more the better.
We might say,

258
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.520
here's common ground between the two strategies.

259
00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.900
The more the better.
Now,
previously we've,

260
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.460
I've argued that in mortality would not actually be a good thing.

261
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:10.670
Eventually rich and incredible as the world is eventually the goods of life

262
00:18:13.111 --> 00:18:17.610
would run out and immortality would be dreadful.
But having said that,

263
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.800
that's not to suggest that we,

264
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:23.550
most of us come remotely close to that condition.

265
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.370
For most of us,
it's certainly true that you know,

266
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:33.110
dying at 30 deprives you of goods that would have come to you if only you'd live

267
00:18:33.851 --> 00:18:38.700
to 40 and dying at 40 deprives you of goods that would have come to you if only

268
00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:43.701
you'd live to 50 or 60 or 80 so one thing that we're inclined to agree is know

269
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:49.560
other things being equal,
the longer your life,
the better.
So

270
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:55.030
here's a life 50 years long

271
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:03.140
and suppose you live it with a certain amount of value in your life,

272
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.840
a hundred value points,
whatever that is,
whatever,

273
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.470
whatever the however our units of measuring just how good our life is,

274
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.600
we say,
look,

275
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:17.810
better to have a life at that value instead of going through 50 years went for a

276
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.390
hundred years.
Fair enough.
We might say we all agree,

277
00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:27.930
don't we?
That quantity of life a good thing.

278
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:29.820
And that does seem plausible,

279
00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.380
but at the same time a want to immediately say quantity of life may matter,

280
00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:36.780
but it's not the only thing that matters.

281
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:42.380
Quality of life matters as well and again that points fairly uncontroversial.

282
00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:51.450
You had to choose between your life at 50 years at a hundred value points.

283
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.270
<v 2>Okay.</v>

284
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.470
<v 0>Or 50 years.</v>

285
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:00.970
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

286
00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:05.970
<v 0>whatever that is 130 value points you'd rather have the second life.</v>

287
00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:11.320
The length of life isn't the only thing we care about.

288
00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:15.100
The overall quality of your life is something we care about as well.

289
00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.960
And this of course is another topic that we've talked about previously.

290
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.980
Just what is it that goes into making a life better than another.

291
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:28.330
So we now sort of see summing it up yet got to pay attention to quality,

292
00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:31.690
got to pay attention to quantity or duration.

293
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.740
Of course he's not just corrected myself as,

294
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:38.440
because you might say if you want to think about it mathematically,

295
00:20:38.441 --> 00:20:41.170
it all is just a matter of quantity.

296
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.770
As long as when we measure quantity,

297
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:49.660
we bear in mind we need to measure not just the,
the length of the life,

298
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.760
but the height of the box.

299
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:57.690
So the area of the box here is 50 times a hundred units.

300
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.330
So whatever that is,
that's a 5,000

301
00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:03.973
<v 2>yeah.</v>

302
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.160
<v 0>Going to get another giggle here.
Right.
You know,</v>

303
00:21:06.161 --> 00:21:07.870
we sort of imagine a little units,
it's a,
you know,

304
00:21:07.871 --> 00:21:10.930
it's a quality one unit of quantity,

305
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.310
one unit of quality for a year.
So it's a quality year unit,

306
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.280
whatever it is,
5,000 units

307
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.333
<v 2>here,</v>

308
00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.080
<v 0>6,500</v>

309
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.870
right?
Say,
look,

310
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:33.910
we can capture the thought that the duration of your life matters.

311
00:21:33.911 --> 00:21:37.840
The quality of your life matters by,
by multiplying the two together.

312
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.180
And without getting hung up on the numbers,
there's no,

313
00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:44.350
there was anything kind of precision here.
The underlying thoughts,
fairly clear.

314
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.280
The area of the box represents the overall quality,

315
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:55.590
the overall quantity that you've managed to cram into your life and your 50

316
00:21:56.111 --> 00:21:59.110
years.
And we could,
we could start measuring different kinds of lives.

317
00:21:59.111 --> 00:22:02.050
We might start worrying about,
well look,

318
00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:06.610
suppose I could live 50 years at 130 or I could live,
you know,

319
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:10.360
whatever it is,
a hundred years at some other number that's a little bit less.

320
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:14.440
You might say,
oh,
less quality but longer quality,
longer duration,

321
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:19.270
more valuable life filled in that last box.

322
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.280
We see how it goes.

323
00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:28.350
But the question we need to ask is if we've got this more rich sense of

324
00:22:28.351 --> 00:22:29.280
quantity,

325
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.870
where we multiplied the duration of the lifetime is the how good a life you're

326
00:22:33.871 --> 00:22:35.100
having while you've got it.

327
00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:40.820
Does that give adequate place to what we think is valuable?

328
00:22:42.331 --> 00:22:45.720
Does that give adequate place to quality in life?

329
00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.700
Let me draw some different boxes,

330
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.460
some different possible lives to choose between.

331
00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:09.693
<v 2>Get the,</v>

332
00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:17.430
<v 0>suppose you had a nice long life,
hundred and 50 years.</v>

333
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.750
Again,
just for the sake of concreteness,

334
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.510
we sign it 50 quality points.

335
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:35.840
So the area
7,500

336
00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.810
let's suppose you got a feel for this.

337
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:47.230
Let's suppose that the best life lived on earth so far was worth a 10

338
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:56.020
so this is an incredible life to be at 50 and you get it for 150 years.

339
00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.810
Very nice life.

340
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:07.520
<v 2>Now compare it
with this life.</v>

341
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:17.080
<v 0>Supposedly this life isn't really all that good in terms of how well off you are</v>

342
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.360
at any given time.
It's plus one

343
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:27.460
zero would be a life not worth having though no worse than nonexistence negative

344
00:24:27.771 --> 00:24:30.560
numbers would be lives.
Presumably that would be,
you know,
you better off dead.

345
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:35.890
This life is just barely worth having plus one,

346
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:42.710
but it's a very,
very,
very long life.

347
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.680
So long that I couldn't draw it to scale.
That's why we've got the dot.
Dot.

348
00:24:45.681 --> 00:24:46.514
DOTS in the middle.

349
00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:53.150
Suppose it goes on for 30,000 years.

350
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.090
Well,
the math here is pretty easy.

351
00:24:57.091 --> 00:25:01.230
30,000 Times one is 30,000 in terms of the area.

352
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.540
<v 2>Okay,
so</v>

353
00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:11.080
<v 0>trying to choose between these two lives,
life</v>

354
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:15.080
<v 2>a
or life be</v>

355
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:23.590
<v 0>in terms of quantity or enriched notion of quantity where you measure the length</v>

356
00:25:23.631 --> 00:25:25.250
of the lifetimes,
the height of the box.

357
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:30.790
Life B's got more quantity of what matters

358
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:37.750
30,000 versus 7,500 and yet most of us,

359
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.840
when we think about this choice,

360
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:47.770
do not find B to B a preferable life.

361
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:54.400
Even though the quantity of value sort of just suppose we could measure quantity

362
00:25:56.511 --> 00:25:59.120
of whatever the goods are that we've got crammed into our life.

363
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:01.940
Well this has Mary Mary,
Mary,

364
00:26:01.941 --> 00:26:05.660
small amount stretched over a very long time to quantities larger,

365
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:09.050
but life a seems preferable.

366
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:10.840
<v 2>Okay.</v>

367
00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.810
<v 0>Now for any,
Ellie,
you know,
this may not be true for everybody,</v>

368
00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:16.780
but for those of us who share that thought,

369
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:22.390
we might say quantity isn't all it's about.

370
00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:28.150
Or when we tried to take quality into account,

371
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.570
it wasn't so much that we couldn't measure it.

372
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:37.710
It's that if you reduce the importance of quality into sort of folded into

373
00:26:41.051 --> 00:26:46.051
quantity so that what it's all about is the total amount that you're getting or

374
00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:50.820
the total amounts bigger and be the ne,
if you don't think B's a better life,

375
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:55.560
that suggest that totals are what it's all about.

376
00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:01.410
Well,
what else might we then choose between with regard to a and B?

377
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:01.870
Well,

378
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:06.870
natural response is to say even though life a is shorter,

379
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:08.910
<v 2>okay,</v>

380
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.120
<v 0>it attains a kind of peak,
uh,</v>

381
00:27:12.121 --> 00:27:17.121
kind of height that isn't approached any place in life be

382
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:24.250
and perhaps then in a valuating lives and choosing between rival lives.

383
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.940
We can't just look for the quantity of good.

384
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:32.270
We have to look at the peaks,
we have to look at the heights.

385
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.340
In choosing between lives.

386
00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:39.460
It's important to think not just about how much did you pack in total,

387
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:46.630
but what were the greatest goods that you had or accomplished in your life

388
00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.360
and perhaps then we should conclude quality.

389
00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.880
Can Trump quantity

390
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:04.610
perhaps with the right quality in place quantity becomes of secondary

391
00:28:08.281 --> 00:28:10.620
importance.
Yeah.

392
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.680
It might be that if we could have a longer life where we achieved great things

393
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:20.610
rather than a shorter life where we achieved great things better to have the

394
00:28:20.611 --> 00:28:23.430
longer life quantity might matter too.

395
00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:28.410
As long as we think the qualities,
what matters the most,

396
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:36.160
what a more radical version of the theory would say actually qualities.

397
00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.870
All that matters.
The peaks are all that matter.

398
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:47.500
That at any rate is the position that gets expressed by Holderlin

399
00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.580
in the poem to a par K to faiths.

400
00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:57.190
That was in one of the essays I've had you read,
but let me,

401
00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.020
let me read that now to the park aid.

402
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:05.430
A single summer grant me great powers and a single autumn for fully ripened song

403
00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.570
that sated with the sweetness of my plane.

404
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.210
My heart may more willingly die.

405
00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.860
The soul that living did not attain it's divine right,

406
00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.530
cannot repose in the Netherworld,

407
00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.670
but once what I am bent on,
what is holy,

408
00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.680
my poetry is accomplished,

409
00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:30.040
be welcomed then stillness of the shadows world.

410
00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:34.780
I shall be satisfied though my layer will not accompany me down there.

411
00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.910
Once I lived like the gods and more is not needed.

412
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:41.470
Hold,
hold.

413
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:45.910
Your lender is saying he doesn't care about quantity at all.

414
00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.250
If he can accomplish something,
great.

415
00:29:48.251 --> 00:29:52.450
If he can ascend to the heights and do something great with his poetry,

416
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.680
that's enough.
Once he's lived like the gods,

417
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:58.750
more is not needed.

418
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.890
So in thinking about what we want to do with our lives,

419
00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:10.891
it's not enough to have the kind of theory that we've begun to sketch in

420
00:30:11.381 --> 00:30:16.381
previous weeks where we think about what are the various things worth having in

421
00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.673
a life.

422
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.720
You also have to address this question of quality versus quantity.

423
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:28.290
Is quality only important in so far as it gets folded into producing greater

424
00:30:30.551 --> 00:30:35.551
quantity or does quality matter in its own right as something that's worth going

425
00:30:36.581 --> 00:30:41.581
for even when it means a smaller quantity and if quality does matter,

426
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.170
does quantity matter as well or is indeed quality?

427
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:52.380
All that matters is Holderlin right when he says once I've lived like the gods

428
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.000
more is not needed

429
00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:04.610
now Holderlin I imagine in thinking about why that kind of life is the best kind

430
00:31:06.811 --> 00:31:08.910
of life he could aspire to

431
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:16.730
is thinking in park about the lasting contribution that his poetry makes.

432
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:24.330
There's a sense in which when we think about having done things like that,

433
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:29.510
we feel that we attain a kind of immortality we live on through our works.

434
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:40.040
And so the next question I want to turn to and sort of thinking about strategies

435
00:31:40.681 --> 00:31:45.681
of how to live in light of the fact of in terms of facing our mortality is well

436
00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:51.570
maybe a kind of immortality is worth going after.

437
00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:54.330
<v 1>No.</v>

438
00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:58.680
<v 0>Or maybe at the very least we can take a kind of comfort in thinking that we</v>

439
00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:02.490
have or can attain a kind of immortality.

440
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:07.760
I emphasize the word kind of course because strictly speaking if you live on

441
00:32:09.751 --> 00:32:10.620
through your works,

442
00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:15.890
it's not as though you are literally living on it's semi immortality or quasar

443
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:18.780
immortality.

444
00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.910
I suppose people who don't believe that it would prefer to call it pseudo in

445
00:32:22.911 --> 00:32:26.610
mortality.
Actually this reminds me of a joke.

446
00:32:26.611 --> 00:32:29.920
So here's a woody Allen joke.
Uh,

447
00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.450
I don't want to be immortal through my work.

448
00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.820
I want to be a mortal through not dying.

449
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:43.160
Well as know previously,
I've argued that genuine immortality,

450
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:46.160
unending life would not be a good thing,

451
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:53.350
but still many of us aspire to this kind of semi immortality and actually it can

452
00:32:56.181 --> 00:32:58.970
take,
I think,
again,
two broad forms.

453
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:02.900
Sometimes people want to say there's a sense in which,

454
00:33:02.901 --> 00:33:07.130
although it's not as though you're literally living on,

455
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:12.790
there's something like that going on in so far as a part of you continues.

456
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.260
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

457
00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:20.230
<v 0>If I have children,
then literally some of my,
you know,</v>

458
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.700
in my case there's a male,
you know,
one of my cells continues.

459
00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:25.550
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

460
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:30.410
<v 0>And then their cells continue in their children and their selves continue in</v>

461
00:33:30.411 --> 00:33:31.244
their children.

462
00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.990
Do you think of an Amoeba splitting and splitting and splitting and splitting?

463
00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:39.890
Again,
parts of the original Amoeba couldn't be there for many,
many,

464
00:33:39.891 --> 00:33:41.060
many generations.

465
00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:46.240
Some people take comfort in the thought that literally speaking up cart of them

466
00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:52.010
will continue,
if not through cells,

467
00:33:52.011 --> 00:33:56.450
through my offspring.
Perhaps at least my Adams get recycled,

468
00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:01.340
get used again,
and so I get absorbed into the universe,

469
00:34:01.341 --> 00:34:05.570
but I never disappear.
Some people take comfort in that thought.

470
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:11.710
The German philosopher Schopenhauer thought that this should reduce somewhat the

471
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:17.870
sting of death,
he said,
but it will be asked,

472
00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:23.590
how is the permanence of mere dust of crude matter to be regarded as a

473
00:34:24.021 --> 00:34:27.980
continuance of our true inner nature and the answers,
Oh,

474
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:32.210
do you know this dust?
Then do you know what it is and what it can do?

475
00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.660
Learn to know it before you despise it.

476
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:41.260
This matter now lying there as dust and ashes will soon form into crystals.

477
00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:45.350
When dissolved in water,
it will shine as metal.

478
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.750
It will then emit electric sparks.

479
00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:52.780
It will indeed of its own accord form itself into plant and animal and from its

480
00:34:53.781 --> 00:34:58.220
mysterious womb,
it will develop that life I bought.

481
00:34:58.221 --> 00:35:03.221
The loss of which you in your narrowness of mind are so nervous and anxious.

482
00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.273
<v 2>Okay,</v>

483
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:09.290
<v 0>well that's a very moving passage,
but I have to say I don't buy it.</v>

484
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:14.830
I don't find any comfort at all in the thought that my atoms will still be

485
00:35:15.381 --> 00:35:18.920
around getting reused into something else.

486
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.780
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

487
00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:25.780
<v 0>so this first kind of semi in mortality where you take comfort in the thought</v>

488
00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:31.571
that literally there are parts of you that will continue.

489
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.230
This strikes me as a kind of desperate,
striving,

490
00:35:36.231 --> 00:35:41.160
desperate reaching for straws,
perhaps in Schopenhauer his case,

491
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.950
leading him to delude himself into thinking,
oh,

492
00:35:43.951 --> 00:35:46.740
it's not so bad that I'm going to die and going to die soon.

493
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:50.730
At least my atoms will still be around.
It doesn't work for me.

494
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.720
There's a second sort of approach though,

495
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.800
where it's not so much that you're supposed to be comforted by the thought that

496
00:35:58.801 --> 00:36:02.880
your parts will continue to last after you,

497
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:08.090
but that your accomplishments will continue to last after you Holderlin writes

498
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:16.380
poetry,
which we're still reading.
Some 200 years later,

499
00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.780
you can write a novel,

500
00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:24.460
which can be read for 20 or 50 or a hundred or more years.

501
00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:29.700
You might make some contribution to math or philosophy or science and 50 or a

502
00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.100
hundred years later,

503
00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:36.970
people could still be talking about that philosophical argument or that

504
00:36:36.971 --> 00:36:38.470
mathematical result.

505
00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:41.990
You might have other kinds of accomplishments.

506
00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:47.010
You might build a building that will last after you

507
00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.610
stone cutters.
A,

508
00:36:51.611 --> 00:36:56.410
I've read interviews with stone cutters who take a kind of pride and comfort in

509
00:36:56.411 --> 00:36:58.840
the thought that long after they're gone,

510
00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:03.130
the buildings that they helped build will still be there.

511
00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:08.700
You might try to build a company that will last after you die or for that matter

512
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:15.390
you might take pleasure and comfort in the accomplishment of having raised a

513
00:37:16.001 --> 00:37:17.080
family here.

514
00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:22.140
Not so much the thought that you know some of yourselves are in your offspring,

515
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:27.390
but rather the thought that to have raised another decent human being is a

516
00:37:28.811 --> 00:37:30.640
nontrivial accomplishment.

517
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:35.890
Something worth having done with your life and that accomplishment continues

518
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:39.610
after you are gone.
Well,

519
00:37:39.611 --> 00:37:44.611
what should we think about this second group of approaches to attaining semi

520
00:37:46.211 --> 00:37:48.420
immortality?
I,

521
00:37:48.421 --> 00:37:52.240
I've got to say that I'm of two minds when I think about them.

522
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:54.560
I'm like the,
you know,

523
00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:58.870
the dust and the Adam's stuff where I just think you're diluting yourself.

524
00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:04.050
I find myself drawn to this second set of thoughts.

525
00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:10.590
I find myself tempted by the thought that there's something worth doing about

526
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:18.820
producing something that continues for a while,

527
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.980
that it's significant.
And even if my life here on earth is a short one,

528
00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:29.130
if something that I've accomplished continues my life is the better for it.

529
00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:37.090
That's Holderlin thought,
I suppose.
And

530
00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:38.240
<v 2>okay.</v>

531
00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.630
<v 0>It,
it's a view that appeals to me.</v>

532
00:38:41.631 --> 00:38:46.631
I suppose it explains in part why I write philosophy in the hopes that the

533
00:38:47.931 --> 00:38:51.740
things I write might still be red 20 years after I die,

534
00:38:51.741 --> 00:38:55.130
or 50 years or if I'm so lucky a hundred years after I die.

535
00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:57.043
<v 2>Okay.</v>

536
00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:59.270
<v 0>Well,
in certain moods,</v>

537
00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.180
perhaps in most moods I'm drawn by that thought.

538
00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:06.260
But in other moods I've got to confess,
I'm skeptical of it.

539
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:09.740
I remind myself of Schopenhauer writing,

540
00:39:09.741 --> 00:39:11.990
his little passage has owed to dust.

541
00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:17.320
And I find myself saying just like Schopenhauer was so desperate that he deludes

542
00:39:18.321 --> 00:39:21.200
himself into thinking,
oh,
it doesn't matter that I'm about to turn into dust.

543
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:24.560
Dust is really,
really important.
Uh,

544
00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:30.010
I'm just diluting myself as well when I think there's something grander,

545
00:39:30.351 --> 00:39:31.550
something significant,

546
00:39:31.551 --> 00:39:35.810
something valuable about having made an accomplishment,

547
00:39:35.811 --> 00:39:40.460
having achieved something that continues beyond me.
So an in certain moods,

548
00:39:40.461 --> 00:39:45.170
at least I find myself thinking that I've just diluted myself.

549
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:46.560
<v 2>Okay.</v>

550
00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.560
<v 0>But that's the only certain moods and at least most of the time I find myself in</v>

551
00:39:52.711 --> 00:39:57.540
agreement with Holderlin.
Not necessarily in thinking,
you know,

552
00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.800
quantity doesn't matter at all to have written,
you know,

553
00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:06.180
one great work is all you need and more great works,

554
00:40:06.181 --> 00:40:08.970
doesn't add anything that strikes me is going too far,

555
00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:13.650
but at least to have done something significant that abides.

556
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:18.980
That does seem to me to add to the value and significance of my life.

557
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:22.930
<v 2>Well,
yeah,</v>

558
00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.840
<v 0>let me mention an entire different approach.
I'm going to get very,</v>

559
00:40:26.841 --> 00:40:28.940
very short shrift to this last approach,

560
00:40:28.941 --> 00:40:32.960
but it's probably worth mentioning as well the,

561
00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:38.260
the entire assumption of all the lines of thought that I've been discussing.

562
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:40.810
<v 2>Okay.</v>

563
00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:43.930
<v 0>So far today having common,</v>

564
00:40:43.931 --> 00:40:46.570
the underlying belief

565
00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:48.923
<v 2>that</v>

566
00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:52.630
<v 0>the way to deal with the fact that we live</v>

567
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:53.890
<v 2>okay</v>

568
00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:55.510
<v 0>and then we're dead,</v>

569
00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:01.320
is to try to make the life that you've got as good as possible,

570
00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:09.400
as valuable as possible to pack as much into it as you can,

571
00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.580
even though there's room for disagreement about what's the best strategy for

572
00:41:12.581 --> 00:41:13.414
doing that.

573
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.910
<v 2>Okay.</v>

574
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:19.910
<v 0>The picture is one in which we say we can't do anything about the loss.</v>

575
00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.020
<v 2>Okay.</v>

576
00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:28.430
<v 0>The loss of life.
So the the right response is to,</v>

577
00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:30.250
<v 2>okay,</v>

578
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:35.250
<v 0>make the life that we've got is valuable as it can be to see it as valuable as</v>

579
00:41:36.741 --> 00:41:37.574
it can be,

580
00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.980
but there's a rather different approach that,
that,

581
00:41:42.981 --> 00:41:47.030
that that alternative approach says,
yes,

582
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.440
we're going to lose life and,
and that's horrible,

583
00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:58.020
but it's only a horrible in so far as you think of life as something that it's

584
00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:03.370
bad to lose.
After all,

585
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:08.430
if we were to decide that life wasn't really a valuable gift,

586
00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.120
if it wasn't really something worth embracing it and something that we could

587
00:42:13.121 --> 00:42:15.700
turn into something full of value,

588
00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.840
then it's loss wouldn't actually be a loss.

589
00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.790
That's a part we've seen before,
right?

590
00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:26.110
The central badness of death is explained in the deprivation account.

591
00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:30.760
You are deprived of the fact that you could have had more life that would have

592
00:42:30.761 --> 00:42:32.680
been worth having overall,

593
00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.870
but if life isn't worth having overall,

594
00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:42.400
then it's lost.
It's not a bad thing but a good thing.

595
00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.750
The trick then isn't to make life as valuable as it couldn't be,

596
00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:51.810
but rather to come to recognize that I'm balanced.

597
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:55.780
Life isn't positive but negative.

598
00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:01.620
I know that when I'm about to say has a kind of classics illustrated simplicity

599
00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:04.750
to it and it's a bit of an over exaggeration,

600
00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:09.900
but in gross terms we might say the first general outlook that life is good and

601
00:43:11.981 --> 00:43:16.981
so the loss of it is bad and so the answer is make as much of it as we can.

602
00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:21.520
While we've got it might say that is in broad strokes,

603
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.380
the western outlook.

604
00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:25.943
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

605
00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:29.250
<v 0>and in broad strokes,
the notion that life</v>

606
00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:36.360
isn't really as good as we take it to be buddies in fact bad overall.

607
00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:39.700
Perhaps it's oversimplification to call it the eastern outlook,

608
00:43:39.701 --> 00:43:43.360
but at least it's an outlook that gets more expression typically in eastern

609
00:43:43.361 --> 00:43:44.740
thought than in western thought.

610
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:48.760
For most example of this.

611
00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:50.980
Second Outlook is I suppose Buddhism

612
00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:54.700
four noble truth in Buddhism.

613
00:43:54.701 --> 00:43:59.170
The first noble truth is that life is suffering.

614
00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:05.580
Buddhists believe if you think hard about the underlying nature of life,

615
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:15.030
you'll see that every place there is loss,

616
00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:19.840
there is suffering,
there's disease,
there's death,

617
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:21.550
there's pain,

618
00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:28.050
sure there are things that we want and if we're lucky we get them but then we

619
00:44:29.351 --> 00:44:34.351
lose them and that just adds to the suffering and the pain and the misery.

620
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:38.700
I'm balanced.

621
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.330
Life isn't good first noble truth,

622
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:47.810
life is suffering and so armed with this estimation,

623
00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:54.110
what Buddhist try to do is to free you from attachment to these goods so that

624
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:58.680
when you lose them

625
00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:05.430
the loss is minimized and indeed Buddhist try to free you from what they take to

626
00:45:06.461 --> 00:45:09.790
be the illusion of there being itself.

627
00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:13.420
There is no need to lose anything.

628
00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:19.740
Death is terrifying in so far as I worry about about it being the dissolution of

629
00:45:20.381 --> 00:45:24.670
myself.
If there is no self,
there's nothing to dissolve.

630
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:27.500
<v 1>Okay.</v>

631
00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:32.480
<v 0>It all makes sense.
And I have tremendous respect for Buddhism.</v>

632
00:45:32.481 --> 00:45:37.481
It all makes sense given the thought that life is suffering.

633
00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:43.230
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

634
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:46.710
<v 0>But for better or for worse,
I'm a child of the West.</v>

635
00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:52.550
I'm a child of the book of Genesis where God looks on the world and says it's

636
00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:56.190
good.
For me at least,

637
00:45:56.370 --> 00:46:01.370
the strategy of minimize your loss by viewing the world as negative is not one

638
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.920
that I can be at rest with.
For me,

639
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:12.780
life can be good.
And so the s the choices for me,

640
00:46:12.781 --> 00:46:17.781
and I suppose for most of us remain among the strategy strategies with which I

641
00:46:18.421 --> 00:46:19.254
began.

642
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:24.620
How is it that we can most make our lives valuable?

643
00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:30.740
What is it that we can do that will allow us with Holderlin to say once we lived

644
00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:33.390
like the gods.
