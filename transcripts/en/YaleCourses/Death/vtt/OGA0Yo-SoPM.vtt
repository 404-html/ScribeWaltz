1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.700
Let me start by reviewing the problem that we were considering last week.

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:06.690
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.640
<v 0>We were raising a difficulty for the personality theory of personal identity</v>

4
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:15.750
according to which the key to being the same person is having the very same

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.860
ongoing,
evolving personality and,

6
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.880
and the difficulty was brace basically the problem of duplication that it seemed

7
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.940
as though we could have more than one,

8
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.230
call it an individual more than one body that had the very same set of memories,

9
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:35.880
beliefs and so forth.
And then we'd have to ask ourselves,
well,

10
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:39.390
what should the personality theory say about a case like that?

11
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.160
So imagine that over the weekend,
uh,

12
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.200
the mad scientist copied my memories,

13
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:52.500
beliefs,
desires,
fears,
ambitions,
goals,
intentions,

14
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.360
and imprinted that on somebody else's brain.

15
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.420
They did it last night at midnight this morning we woke up and we have to ask

16
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:07.650
ourselves,
who's Shelly Kagan?

17
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.480
Who's the person that was lecturing to you last week?
Well,

18
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.500
it doesn't seem plausible in terms of the personality theory to say that he's

19
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:22.920
Shelly Kagan and the one here today.
You know,
suppose the other one's in,

20
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.650
in Michigan,
right?
If the one in Michigan,
Shelly Kagan,

21
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:28.660
but this one's not after all though.
It's true.

22
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.510
He's got Shelly Kagan's memories.
Yeah.

23
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.320
He woke up thinking he was Charlotte Kagan.

24
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.400
Just like I woke up thinking I was Shelly Kagan.

25
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.270
He woke up thinking about what he was going to lecture on it in class today.

26
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:42.420
Just like I woke up thinking about what I was going to lecture in class today.

27
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.260
He remembered last week's lecture just like I remembered last week's lecture.

28
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.333
Well,

29
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.380
no clear reason to say for the personality theory to say that he's Shelly Kagan

30
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.680
and I'm not,
after all,

31
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.280
I've got the very same set of memories,
beliefs,
desires that he has,

32
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.920
but equally true and more surprisingly from the personality theory point of
view,

33
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.170
there's no reason to say that I'm Shelly Kagan and he's not,
after all,

34
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.620
he's got all the same memories,
beliefs and desires that I do

35
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.080
doesn't seem plausible to say we're both Shelly Kagan because now we'd have to

36
00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:22.570
then say Shelly Kagan's in two places at the same time.

37
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.880
So the only alternative seems to me to say that neither of us is Shelly Kagan.

38
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

39
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.800
<v 0>But if neither of us is Shelly Kagan,</v>

40
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:36.801
then the simple original personality theory was false because according to that

41
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:40.380
theory,
having the personality is what it took to be.
Shelly Kagan,

42
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.740
we both have it yet.
Neither of us is Shelly Kagan.

43
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.510
Personality theory must be false,

44
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.750
so we revise the personality theory to say the secret to personal identity is

45
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:56.811
having the same personality provided that there's no branching provided.

46
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.210
There's no splitting provided is only one best competitor not to equally good

47
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:07.900
candidates.
Given the no branching view,

48
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.790
the no branching rule we can say in the ordinary case law,
you know,

49
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.070
look,
there really wasn't anybody in printed with my,

50
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.350
with my memories and desires in Michigan.

51
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.790
I'm the only one around in the earth right now with with Shelly Kagan's memories

52
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:26.791
and desires since there's no competitor and I've got the personality I Michella

53
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.490
Kagan,
I'm the very same person that was here lecturing to you last week.

54
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.680
That's what the personality theory,

55
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:35.770
it gives us the answer we're looking for in the ordinary case.

56
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.720
But in the science fiction story where there's a duplicate,

57
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.560
it says if there's branching,
the no branch in rule comes in.

58
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.330
Neither of them is Shelly Kagan.
All right,

59
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.880
so that's the best way for the personality theory to get revised to deal with

60
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:55.550
this problem.
The trouble was it seems for no branching rules.

61
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.960
Seems very counter intuitive.
So think about it here,

62
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.740
right now I'm standing in front of you saying,
I'm Shelly Kagan,

63
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.240
the guy who was lecturing to you last week,
I believe.
I'm Shelly Kagan,

64
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.350
the guy who was lecturing to you last week.
Am I Shelly Kagan?
Well,

65
00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.380
I've got Shelly Kagan's personality.
So far,
so good.

66
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.610
Now all we have to decide is what is the branching rules satisfied are violated.

67
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.050
So all we have to know is,

68
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.250
is there somebody else somewhere in the universe who's got all my memories and

69
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:28.030
beliefs and desires?
Well,
how in the world could I know that

70
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.390
whether I,
this person talking to you right now is Shelly Kagan.

71
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.540
Depends on whether there is some duplicate with all my memories in Michigan or

72
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:43.540
not.
Seems very counterintuitive.

73
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.100
So although the personality with no branching rule avoids the problem of what to

74
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:56.860
say about duplicates by saying when there's branching,
neither of them.

75
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:57.694
Shelly Kagan,

76
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.470
the branching rule itself seems very counterintuitive.

77
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.650
We feel as though whether somebody is me or not should depend upon internal

78
00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:11.260
facts about me in the earlier stages or this stage and that stage,

79
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.270
not about what's happening elsewhere outside extrinsic to these things.

80
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.790
Now do you know,
so if you're not willing to accept the no branch rule,

81
00:05:22.791 --> 00:05:26.390
if it strikes you as a bizarre thing to throw into personal identity,

82
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.800
maybe you need to reject the personality theory.
Now,
during all of this,

83
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.480
the fans of the body view typically are laughing.

84
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.120
They say,
you know,
this just goes to show what a dumb theory.

85
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.070
The personality theory is.

86
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.680
The whole problem with the personality theory is that personality is a bit like

87
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.310
a software.
It's like programs,
right?
It's,
it's,
it's the,

88
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:56.360
it's the various programs you run on your computer along with the various data

89
00:05:56.361 --> 00:05:59.030
files that have saved on your hard drive and so forth,

90
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.950
and those can be duplicated.
You have copy after copy after copy.

91
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:05.930
You could have two copies of my personality.

92
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:10.890
You can have a hundred or a thousand.
The problem with the,
you know,

93
00:06:10.891 --> 00:06:15.891
what drove the personality theory into the no branching rule implausible is,

94
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:20.930
it may be was the fact that your personality is like software and it can be

95
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:21.764
copied.

96
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.570
That's why they say we should believe in the body view.

97
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.910
We accept the body view.

98
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.970
We avoid the duplication problem because unlike software,

99
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:39.380
which we complicate,
which can be literally copied as many as you want,
identical,

100
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.440
the body can't split,

101
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.570
human bodies can't divide or branch.

102
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.640
There's no way that there's another body that the body,

103
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:56.900
I'm Thursday became two bodies.
The body that was here on Thursday didn't,

104
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.980
couldn't become two bodies.
So we avoid all the problem.
That's,

105
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:06.100
that's at least the kind of claim that fans of the body view often make in the

106
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:09.320
face of this difficulty for the personality theory.

107
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:11.310
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

108
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.380
<v 0>well now we need to ask,
is it really true?</v>

109
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.440
Is it really true that bodies don't face a duplication problem?

110
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.740
Is it really true that human bodies don't and couldn't split look crucial

111
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:30.660
warriors of course couldn't.
Personalities don't actually split either,

112
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:31.290
right?

113
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.950
Although I've been giving science fiction examples in which the mad scientist

114
00:07:34.951 --> 00:07:37.380
duplicates my memories and beliefs and desires.

115
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.630
They are all been science fiction examples.

116
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:45.110
If I can use science fiction to talk about the possibility of splitting and use

117
00:07:45.511 --> 00:07:47.280
that against the personality theory,

118
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:52.380
I'm entitled to use science fiction examples to talk about the possibility of

119
00:07:52.381 --> 00:07:57.381
bodies splitting and ask what kind of problem that would raise for the body

120
00:07:57.451 --> 00:07:58.284
theory.

121
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:03.980
Now we are familiar with some low level examples of bodies splitting Amoebas

122
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.230
split,
right?
You got all a single Amoeba.
It's going along at a certain point.

123
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.250
Let's draw our AMOEBA splitting,
right?

124
00:08:17.251 --> 00:08:21.960
You've got an Amoeba split going along at a certain point,

125
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:28.290
start to look like that
and it looks like that

126
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:33.950
and then boom,
you got,
well,
it splits.

127
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.780
There's nothing in sort of biology per se that rules out cell division.

128
00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:44.990
Indeed on the contrary,
right?
We know cells can split.

129
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.190
Now human bodies,
unlike Amoebas,
don't do that,

130
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.000
but maybe there's nothing in biology that rules out the possibility.

131
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:53.750
It's opposed.

132
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:58.750
We open up the Yale daily tomorrow and we see that the Yale Center for Amoebic

133
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.560
Studies has made this tremendous breakthrough and has discovered how to,

134
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:04.861
you know,

135
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:09.861
through the right kind of injection or whatever cause a human body to replicate

136
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.170
and split in an Amoeba like fashion.

137
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:14.960
<v 1>Okay,</v>

138
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.960
<v 0>well then we have to face the problem of what to say in this case of bodily</v>

139
00:09:20.091 --> 00:09:22.880
branching.
Well set up pursuing that example.

140
00:09:22.881 --> 00:09:27.881
Let me give you a slightly different example that's been discussed a fair bit in

141
00:09:27.891 --> 00:09:29.240
the philosophical literature.

142
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.840
This is actually a case that one of the students in the class asked about,

143
00:09:37.841 --> 00:09:40.720
you know,
I think it was last week if it wasn't even earlier and he said,

144
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.590
great question,
let's come back to it.
So here at long last,

145
00:09:44.591 --> 00:09:46.990
I'm making good on my promissory note.

146
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:50.440
I'm going to come back to the example that was raised before.

147
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.160
You'll recall that when we talked about the body of you,
I said,

148
00:09:54.161 --> 00:09:59.161
the best version of the body view doesn't require the entire body to be the same

149
00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:03.450
body,
but the brain follow the brain.

150
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.230
And Indiana doesn't seem as though we have to require the entire brain,

151
00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:12.060
just enough of the brain,
however much that turns out to house,

152
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:14.130
personality,
memories and so forth.

153
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.150
And then I said,

154
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:22.950
suppose it was possible that one hemisphere of your brain is enough if there's

155
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:24.930
enough redundancy in the brain.

156
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

157
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.570
<v 0>So that even if your right hemisphere got destroyed,
your left hemisphere,</v>

158
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:35.480
you still have all the same memories,
desires,
beliefs.
Good enough.
Okay,

159
00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.400
so now we worry about the following case.
So I gave you a bunch of examples,

160
00:10:39.401 --> 00:10:39.701
right?

161
00:10:39.701 --> 00:10:44.450
Where there are brains being transplanted into torsos of others too,

162
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.980
I suppose gruesome as it was.
I was in,
um,
you know,

163
00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:52.981
this weekend I'm in some horrible accident and my torso gets destroyed and they

164
00:10:53.741 --> 00:10:56.290
keep my brain on life support,

165
00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.820
oxygenating it just long enough to do some radical surgery.

166
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.200
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

167
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.000
<v 0>Into some spare torsos where the torso come from.
Well,</v>

168
00:11:06.001 --> 00:11:07.340
you had some living people,

169
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:12.050
but they had very rare brain diseases and their brain suddenly liquified.

170
00:11:12.051 --> 00:11:16.790
So now we've got some spare torsos.
All right,

171
00:11:16.791 --> 00:11:18.200
so here we've got

172
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:27.800
Shelly Kagan.
Body gets destroyed.

173
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.330
Here's my brain

174
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:41.380
over here we've got
Jones,

175
00:11:41.381 --> 00:11:42.214
his torso,

176
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.760
and over here we've got Smith's torso.

177
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.420
Suppose we take

178
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.130
call this one the left hemisphere,

179
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.380
and we stick it in here
into Jones,
his torso.

180
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.410
We take this other hemisphere of Mike,
Right half of my brain,

181
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.180
<v 1>okay,</v>

182
00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.190
<v 0>we stick it into Smith's torso.</v>

183
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:30.300
Connect all the wires,
all the neurons,
the operations,
a smashing success.

184
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.520
Both things wake up.

185
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.960
So here's John Jones,

186
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:41.930
his torso with the left half of us ks,

187
00:12:41.931 --> 00:12:46.570
Brain Smith's torso with the right half of best case brain,

188
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.771
they wake up.

189
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.620
We need some way to refer to these people so we can start talking about who they

190
00:12:54.621 --> 00:12:58.730
are.
Let me just call this top one.

191
00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.610
Jones his torso with the left half of Shelly Kagan,
his brain.

192
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.500
It's called him lefty

193
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.950
Smith's torso with the right half of Shelly Kagan's brain.

194
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.180
It's called them righty.

195
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.293
<v 1>Okay.</v>

196
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.740
<v 0>Operations is a success.
Lefty and righty both.
Wake up,</v>

197
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.730
they both think they're Shelly Kagan,
so forth and so on.

198
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.860
We ask ourselves,
according to the body view,

199
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.110
which one is Shelly Kagan,
what are the possibilities?

200
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.620
We could say lefty is Shelly Kagan and Riley is not right.

201
00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:42.700
He's an imposter,

202
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:48.580
but there's nothing in the body view to give us a reason to make that choice.

203
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.340
It's true that left,
he's got half a Shelly Kagan's brain and that's good enough.

204
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.370
But it's also true that right,

205
00:13:57.371 --> 00:14:00.370
he's got half of Shelly Kagan's brain and that seemed good enough.

206
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.290
So there's no reason to say that lefties,
Shelly Kagan and right,
he isn't.

207
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:09.640
And similarly of course there's nothing in the body view to make us say that

208
00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:12.340
writing Shelly Kagan and lefty isn't,

209
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.520
well,
it's not one and not the other one.
Are they remaining all possibilities?

210
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:22.870
We could,
I suppose try to say they're both Shelly Kagan

211
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.620
and so Shelly Kagan continues.
That is to say his body continues.

212
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.390
That is to say his brain continues.

213
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.800
That is to say nothing of his brain continues merrily on its way,

214
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.220
except now in two places.
And so from now on,

215
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:39.960
Shelly Kagan,

216
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:45.170
that single person is in two different places at the same time.

217
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.100
You know,
lefty goes to California,

218
00:14:50.101 --> 00:14:53.810
writing moves to Vermont from now on.

219
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.330
Shelly Kagan's by coastal

220
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:02.360
doesn't seem right.
So what else can the body theory say?

221
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:06.170
Well the body theory could say neither of them are Shelly Kagan.

222
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:10.700
Shelly Kagan died in that gruesome horrible accident.

223
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.890
Although it's true that we now have two people,
lefty and Righty,

224
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:20.240
each of whom has half and Shelly Kagan's brain and all of Shelly Kagan's

225
00:15:20.241 --> 00:15:23.450
memories for whatever that's worth.
Neither of them is Shelly Kagan.

226
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:27.260
We could say that as well.
But if we end,

227
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:31.970
that seems the least on palatable of the alternatives.
But if we say that,

228
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.600
then we've given up on the body view because the body view after all said to be

229
00:15:37.821 --> 00:15:42.821
Shelly Kagan is to have enough of Shelly Kagan's brain and in this case both of

230
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.020
lefties and righties seem to have enough of Shelly Kagan's brain.

231
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:54.780
What's the body theorist to do?
As far as I can see.

232
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.840
The best option for the body theorist at this point is to add no surprises here.

233
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:02.520
Uh,
no branching rule.

234
00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.840
The body theorists would say the key to personal identities having the same body

235
00:16:10.171 --> 00:16:11.520
too at the same brain to it.

236
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.340
I'm not for the brain to keep the third personality going,

237
00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:19.020
provided that there's no branching,
no splitting,

238
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.480
no perfect competitors.
Only one

239
00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:28.900
if the body view ad the no branching principal,

240
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:34.180
then we can say look,
in the case of this sort of splitting,

241
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:39.270
this example is known in the philosophical literature as fishermen like nuclear

242
00:16:39.341 --> 00:16:43.450
fission when a big Adam splits into two.
So in the fusion case,

243
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.110
the body says the body theorist says,
and the fission case,

244
00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.170
there's splitting this branching.

245
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:55.290
So neither of them is going to end up being Shelly Kagan but in the ordinary hum

246
00:16:55.591 --> 00:16:59.260
drum case,
no,
here I am,
my body.

247
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.670
Why am I Shelly Kagan?

248
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:05.380
Because the brain in front of you can't see it,
but it's in front of you.

249
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:09.520
The brain in front of you is the very same brain as the brain.

250
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.450
You know that you had in front of you on Thursday.
Follow the body in particular,

251
00:17:13.451 --> 00:17:17.140
follow the brain.
So in the ordinary case,
no splitting.

252
00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.810
Follow the brain in the special case where they're splitting,

253
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.570
even if they follow the brain,
not good enough.

254
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.620
So the

255
00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:30.890
<v 1>okay</v>

256
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:35.360
<v 0>body theorist can avoid the problem of fision.</v>

257
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:39.830
Avoid the problem of duplication by adding the no branching rule.

258
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.080
But of course,
no,

259
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.160
no branching rule didn't seem very intuitive.
You know,

260
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.210
whether or not I'm Shelly Kagan,
the guy that was lecturing to you on Thursday,

261
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.650
depends on whether unbeknownst to me over the weekend somebody removed,

262
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:59.610
half of my brain's stuck in some other torso sealed me all back up.

263
00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.870
How could that matter?

264
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.900
Well,
if you don't find a no branching rule plausible,

265
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.650
you're in trouble as a body theorist.
In fact.

266
00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:21.120
So what we see is the body theory isn't exactly the same problem.

267
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.890
Exactly the same situation as the personality theory.

268
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.263
Indeed.

269
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.500
The fision example is a very nice case of how you could have,

270
00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.000
<v 1>yeah,</v>

271
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.070
<v 0>splitting for the personality theory.</v>

272
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.930
Right here before the accident was Shelly Kagan,
somebody who had my beliefs,

273
00:18:39.931 --> 00:18:42.210
desires,
memories,
goals,
and so forth.

274
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.080
After the accident we've got two people,

275
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:49.440
lefty and righty or two entities,
lefty and Righty,

276
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.930
both of whom Shelly have Shelly Kagan's,
memories,
beliefs,
desires,

277
00:18:54.931 --> 00:18:55.920
goals and so forth.

278
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:02.570
Splitting the brain shows how you could in fact have splitting of personality.

279
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:08.690
So the very same case raises the very same problem for both the body view and

280
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:15.150
the personality view.
And the only solution that I can see,
oh,

281
00:19:15.151 --> 00:19:19.050
he's the best solution that I can see is to accept the no branching rule.

282
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.210
If you don't like to know branching rule,

283
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.580
it's not clear what your alternatives are.

284
00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:25.630
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

285
00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:27.910
<v 0>Or at least it is clear what your alternatives are.</v>

286
00:19:27.911 --> 00:19:30.640
It's not clear which alternative it would be any better.

287
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.600
Now during all of this problem for the personality theory problems for the body

288
00:19:39.251 --> 00:19:40.570
view during all this,

289
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.870
the soul theorist is having a field day.
Alright?

290
00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:49.840
This soul theorist is saying,
look,
you guys,

291
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:55.810
you got into all this trouble with splitting and so forth and so on and needing

292
00:19:55.811 --> 00:20:00.811
to add the no branch in rule silly and implausible is that seems you got into

293
00:20:01.571 --> 00:20:05.320
all that trouble cause of the problem of splitting because personalities can be

294
00:20:05.321 --> 00:20:06.670
split,
bodies can be split.

295
00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:11.470
If only you had seen the light and stuck to the sole theory of personal

296
00:20:11.471 --> 00:20:14.620
identity,
all of these problems could be avoided.

297
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:16.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>

298
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.980
<v 0>Now as you know,
I don't believe in souls,</v>

299
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.660
but forget that issue for the moment.
Let's just ask the question.

300
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.520
Is it true that the sole theory of only the worst souls,

301
00:20:28.521 --> 00:20:33.290
is it true that the sole theory would at least have the following advantage it

302
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.860
avoid these problems of duplication and vision?
Well,

303
00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:39.323
let's ask,

304
00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:45.220
what should a soul theorist say about the vision case?

305
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.760
So here's the gruesome accident.

306
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.180
My brain gets split apart.

307
00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.670
One part gets put into Jones,
his torso.

308
00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:01.590
One Park gets put into Smith's torso after the operation,

309
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.530
lefty wakes up thinking he's Shelly Kagan.

310
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:09.030
Smith wakes up thinking he's Shelly Kagan lefties got part of Jelly Kagan's

311
00:21:09.031 --> 00:21:12.450
brain smiths.
Oh rather,
right?
He's got part of Shelly Kagan's brain.

312
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:18.690
What should the sole theorist say about the case of vision?

313
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:20.990
Well,
again,

314
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:25.640
remember the sole theory says the Kenan being the same person is having the

315
00:21:25.641 --> 00:21:27.470
soul.
You know,

316
00:21:27.471 --> 00:21:31.490
why am I the person that was lecturing to you on Thursday because it's the very

317
00:21:31.491 --> 00:21:33.710
same soul animating my body or what have you.

318
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:36.120
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

319
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:41.120
<v 0>so what does the soul theorists say about the fusion case?</v>

320
00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.940
Not quite sure because we have to turn to a metaphysical question that we've

321
00:21:47.941 --> 00:21:50.760
touched upon before.
Namely,

322
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.820
can souls split

323
00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:00.760
after all we've done the problem that vision raises for the personality theory

324
00:22:00.981 --> 00:22:04.550
in a,
in a nutshell is it personalities can split,
they can branch.

325
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.750
The problem for the body view that vision raises in a nutshell is that bodies

326
00:22:08.751 --> 00:22:10.280
can split.
They can branch.

327
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.420
We need to ask about the metaphysics of the soul.

328
00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:16.880
Can Souls Split?

329
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.430
And I don't know the answer to that of course.

330
00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.750
So let's consider both possibilities.
Possibility number one,

331
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.650
souls just like bodies,
just like personalities can split.

332
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.180
So it was,
that's what happened.
So there was a single soul here,

333
00:22:35.181 --> 00:22:39.900
Shelly Kagan's soul,
but in the middle of this gruesome operation,
gruesome,

334
00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.060
accurate,
and fall by this amazing operation.
Shelly Kagan's soul split.

335
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:51.050
So there's one of the s k soles over here and there's one of the Ska souls

336
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.750
and the other cases as well.

337
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.840
Each one of lefty and righty has one of the pieces of the split,

338
00:23:05.761 --> 00:23:10.230
Shelly Kagan soul.
All right,
so now we ask ourselves,

339
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:15.300
according to the sole theory,
which one is Shelly Kagan?
Well,

340
00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:19.110
you by this point you can run through all the possibilities yourself,
right?

341
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.770
We could say,
well,
it's lefty and not writing,

342
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.950
but there's nothing in the sole theory that's supports that claim they've
gotten.

343
00:23:27.951 --> 00:23:30.990
They each have an equally good,
however good it may be.

344
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.830
They've got an equally good piece of the original Shelly Kagan's soul.

345
00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.630
Cause no reason to say that lefty is Shelly Kagan it right?
He isn't.

346
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.020
No good reason to say,
righty.
Shelly Kagan and lefty isn't,

347
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:45.440
well,

348
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.430
would it be better to say they're both Shelly Kagan as long as you got a piece

349
00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:54.200
of Shelly Kagan's soul of the original soul.
Then you just are Shelly Kagan.

350
00:23:55.130 --> 00:24:00.130
Which case left righty are both Shelly Kagan and Shelly Kagan is now by coastal

351
00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.400
one in California,
one in Vermont.

352
00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

353
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:09.770
<v 0>One part of him that doesn't seem very satisfying.</v>

354
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.800
What's the alternative?
The alternative,

355
00:24:12.801 --> 00:24:17.801
it seems for the sole theorist is to say neither of them is Shelly Kagan.

356
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.560
Neither of them is Shelly Kagan.
Then Shelly Kagan died,

357
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.800
but how can we say that if we accept the sole theory,

358
00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:31.090
they both have pieces of Shelly Kagan sole,
the sole split.

359
00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.593
<v 1>Okay,</v>

360
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:38.500
<v 0>well maybe what the soul theorists would have to do at this point is except that</v>

361
00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:44.250
the no branching rule,
ah,

362
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:48.990
says the soul theorist follow the soul and less the sole splits,

363
00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:51.600
in which case neither of them Miss Shelly Kagan.

364
00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.013
<v 1>Okay,</v>

365
00:24:56.050 --> 00:25:01.050
<v 0>well trouble is we didn't find the no branch in rule very plausible.</v>

366
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.010
It seems counter intuitive,

367
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:07.150
but at this point you begin to wonder,

368
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.940
maybe we just need to learn to live with it.

369
00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:15.780
If the personality theory needs the no branching rule and the body theory needs

370
00:25:16.121 --> 00:25:20.440
to know branching rule and the sole theory needs the no branch in rule,

371
00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:26.040
maybe we'll just stuck with the no branching rule whether or not we like it.

372
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.330
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

373
00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:29.710
<v 0>and if we're stuck with it,</v>

374
00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:33.460
then of course it's not an objection against any one of the theories that it

375
00:25:33.461 --> 00:25:35.140
uses it.
Well.

376
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.550
This was all what we would say as sole theorist if we think souls can split,

377
00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.060
but we need to consider the possibility that soul can't split,

378
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:49.950
namely the sole theorist has an alternative available to it that available to

379
00:25:50.471 --> 00:25:52.630
him that the other theories don't have.

380
00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:59.700
Suppose Shelly Kagan's soul cannot split.

381
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.320
What does that mean?
It means when my brain gets split,

382
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:11.590
my soul is going to end up in lefty or righty,

383
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.450
but not in both.
Solo can't split,

384
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:21.510
can't end up with pieces of the soul or the remnants of the soul in both the

385
00:26:21.761 --> 00:26:24.130
souls.
That unified simple thing.
Now.

386
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.090
I don't actually know whether it's true.
That's simple.

387
00:26:28.091 --> 00:26:31.000
Things can't split metaphysically.

388
00:26:31.001 --> 00:26:34.080
I'm not sure where that's a possibility or not,
but let's just suppose,
look,

389
00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.760
Plato argued to soul was simple.

390
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.400
He didn't actually convince me of that,

391
00:26:39.401 --> 00:26:44.250
but supposedly thought souls are simple and we think simple things can't split.

392
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.680
It would follow.
Then it falls can't split.

393
00:26:46.681 --> 00:26:48.840
Supposedly we accept all that metaphysics.

394
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.860
Then the question is just which one is Shelly Kagan?
Well,

395
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:57.420
it depends which one ended up with Shelly Kagan's soul.

396
00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:03.060
We can't say they both have a piece.
One of them will have it.

397
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.680
The other one won't
and you want to know which ones?

398
00:27:07.681 --> 00:27:12.660
Shelly Kagan,
the one that actually ends up with Shelly Kagan soul.

399
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.260
If lefty ends up with Shelly Kagan's soul,

400
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:20.400
then lefty is Shelly Kagan and righties and imposter.

401
00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:21.810
<v 1>Okay.</v>

402
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.030
<v 0>He thinks he Shelly Kagan,</v>

403
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.630
but he's not because he doesn't have Shelly Kagan soul.
Lefty has it

404
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.200
if right.
He's got Shelly Kagan's soul.

405
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:35.040
Then righty is Shelly Kagan and lefties the imposter.

406
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:39.063
<v 1>Now</v>

407
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.780
<v 0>looking at the situation from the outside,</v>

408
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:47.870
we might be unable to tell which one is really Shelly Kagan because we won't be

409
00:27:50.911 --> 00:27:53.760
able to tell.
Looking at it from the outside,

410
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.600
which one really has Shelly Kagan soul,

411
00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:00.810
although it will be true,
which everyone really does have.

412
00:28:00.811 --> 00:28:04.380
Shelly Kagan soul is Shelly Kagan,
but we don't know which one that is.

413
00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.880
Interestingly,
and somewhat more surprisingly,

414
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.670
looking at it from the inside,

415
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.950
we won't be able to tell either lefty.

416
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:20.880
We'll say gimme a break.
Of course.
I'm Shelly Kagan.
Oh,
of course.

417
00:28:20.881 --> 00:28:24.120
I've got Shelly Kagan's soul.
Of course,
I'm the one,

418
00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:31.000
but righty.
We'll also say gimme a break.
Of course.
I'm Shelly Kagan.

419
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.190
Of course.
I've got Shelly Kagan soul.

420
00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:37.630
Of course I'm the one is souls can't split.

421
00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.540
One of them is mistaken,

422
00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:44.380
but there's no way for them to know which one is the one that's deceived.

423
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:52.710
No,
that may not be a problem that you're unwilling to swallow.
Right?

424
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:57.950
As we've seen all the views here have their difficulties.

425
00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.480
Maybe that's the difficulty.
You're prepared to accept.

426
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:04.540
What's the right answer in vision?

427
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:09.340
It depends on who's got Shelly Kagan's soul.
No way to tell,

428
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:12.910
but still,
that's the answer to the metaphysical question question.

429
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.943
<v 1>What</v>

430
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.750
<v 0>question was what if neither of these</v>

431
00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.830
have Shelly Kagan soul?
Then they're both imposters.

432
00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.560
That's a little bit like the pace we worried about when we started thinking

433
00:29:29.561 --> 00:29:31.090
about the soul view,
right?

434
00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:36.210
What if last night God destroyed my soul and put in a new soul man,

435
00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.470
Charlie Kagan died.
If

436
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.950
Shelly Kagan's soul does not migrate to lefty or Righty,
neither,

437
00:29:47.951 --> 00:29:50.370
the Michelli Kagan according to the sole theory,

438
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.880
what happened to Shelly Kagan?
Well,
if the sole got destroyed,
Shelly Kagan died.

439
00:29:57.090 --> 00:29:58.940
If the sole didn't get destroyed,

440
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.640
maybe somebody else that we weren't even looking at is Shelly Kagan.

441
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:09.180
So as I say,

442
00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:14.330
this sole theory can at least give us an answer that avoid the no branching rule

443
00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:18.990
is souls are simples and simples can't split.

444
00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:24.260
There was no possibility of having two things with the relevant soul.

445
00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:30.420
So we don't need to add in in this sort of ad hoc fashion,

446
00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.950
the no branching rule.

447
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:33.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

448
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:37.230
<v 0>That's an advantage for the sole theory.
If only we believed in souls.</v>

449
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.210
It is an advantage,

450
00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:44.150
but I need to point out that there's another disadvantage that the fishing case

451
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:46.700
raises for the sole theory.

452
00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:53.740
So let's just suppose that metaphysically God tells us that it's lefty that has

453
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:56.640
Shelly Kagan's soul.

454
00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.000
Then of course it's lefty.
That is Shelly Kagan.

455
00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.490
Righty is an imposter,

456
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:07.640
righty believes he's Shelly Kagan.

457
00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:11.930
He has all the memories of Shelly Kagan,
all the desires or Shelly Kagan,

458
00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:16.050
but he's not showy Kagan because he doesn't have Shelly Kagan soul left.

459
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:17.140
He happens to have it.

460
00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:19.773
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

461
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.300
<v 0>that's a nice answer to the problem of vision.</v>

462
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:27.390
But notice the problem raises for the argument for believing in a soul in the

463
00:31:28.841 --> 00:31:29.800
first place.

464
00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.990
Way Back at the start of the semester when we asked why believe in souls,

465
00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:40.260
one important argument was you need a really family of arguments was you need to

466
00:31:42.851 --> 00:31:47.500
believe in souls in order to explain why bodies are animated,

467
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:50.950
why people are rational,
how'd they can have personalities,

468
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.590
how they can be creative and so forth.

469
00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.330
In order to explain consciousness and self awareness,
whatever it was,

470
00:31:58.331 --> 00:32:02.560
filling your favorite,
your favorite blank,
you'll fill in the blank.

471
00:32:02.561 --> 00:32:07.000
And your favorite way the claim was you needed to believe in souls.

472
00:32:07.001 --> 00:32:08.680
Know to explain all that.

473
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:10.840
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

474
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.690
<v 0>but if that's right,
what's going on in Riley's case,</v>

475
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:19.040
righty is aware,
right?
Is Conscious,
right?

476
00:32:19.041 --> 00:32:23.800
He is creative,
right?
He has free will,
right?
He makes plans,
right?

477
00:32:23.801 --> 00:32:25.000
He's got personality.

478
00:32:25.001 --> 00:32:30.001
Righty is rational righties body is animated according to the sole theory

479
00:32:31.841 --> 00:32:35.320
argument for salt,
whether call me the argument for souls.

480
00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:39.920
He needed to believe in souls and order new.
Explain how you could have a person

481
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.731
but now,
right,

482
00:32:43.731 --> 00:32:47.630
he's a person without a soul cause we just hypothesized all Shelly Kagan soul up

483
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:48.464
there.

484
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.030
So at the very same moment,

485
00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:58.270
that positive in the non splitting of souls seems to solve the fision problem of

486
00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:01.160
duplication.

487
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:06.370
It Yank the rug out from underneath the sole theorist by undermining one of the

488
00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:10.850
types of arguments for believing in the soul in the first place.

489
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:17.400
After all,
if Riney can be our person,

490
00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:22.410
admittedly not Shelly Kagan,
but a person conscious,
creative,

491
00:33:22.411 --> 00:33:26.430
rational,
so far aware without a soul,

492
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:30.240
then maybe same thing's true for us,

493
00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.550
which is the question is what the physicalist says.

494
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.050
Let me mention one other possibility cause it's quite intriguing.

495
00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:43.180
It's the Saul theorist answers that last objection by saying eight ever gone to

496
00:33:44.851 --> 00:33:48.110
happen?
Yeah.

497
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.050
It would be a problem for believing in souls if right.

498
00:33:51.051 --> 00:33:53.090
He could wake up without one,

499
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:58.130
but since we stipulated that Shelly Kagan soul is going to end up in lefty,

500
00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:00.230
righty is not going to wake up.

501
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:02.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

502
00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:06.820
<v 0>Alternatively,
it might've been that righty woke up,
but lefty doesn't wake up,</v>

503
00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:10.310
doesn't survive the operation.

504
00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.453
<v 1>Okay.</v>

505
00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:17.650
<v 0>Suppose we did the sort of brain transfers all the time and the following thing</v>

506
00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:22.630
always happened.
Transfer the entire brain.
Patient wakes up,

507
00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:26.860
transfer one hemisphere,
patient wakes up,

508
00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:29.680
transfer both hemispheres.

509
00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:35.070
One patient or the other wakes up but never both.

510
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.560
If that happened,

511
00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.870
we'd have a great new argument for the existence of a soul.

512
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:47.820
What could possibly explain why either hemisphere,

513
00:34:47.821 --> 00:34:52.360
that brain would normally be enough as long as we don't transfer both when we

514
00:34:52.361 --> 00:34:54.910
transfer both one hemisphere might work sometimes,

515
00:34:54.911 --> 00:34:56.980
sometimes the other hemisphere,
but never both.

516
00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:02.010
What could possibly explain that soul's could explain that if souls can't split,

517
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:08.410
it can only follow one half of the brain and that's why we'll never,

518
00:35:08.411 --> 00:35:11.860
we'll get some just get one half,
sometimes the other half,
but never both halfs.

519
00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:17.970
So there's a kind of empirical argument for the existence of the soul if we

520
00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:26.020
found those kinds of results.

521
00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.800
Of course that's a big F,
you know?
Please don't go away thinking that.

522
00:35:29.801 --> 00:35:32.350
What I've just said is here's a new argument for the soul.

523
00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:36.760
We don't do brain transfers,
let alone half a half a brain.

524
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:41.880
We don't have any experiments that suggest one half wakes up but not the other

525
00:35:41.881 --> 00:35:42.300
half.

526
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:47.300
All I'm saying is that if some day we found that at that point we'd have an

527
00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:50.070
argument for the soul.

528
00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:01.150
Well again,
let me put back the put away the sole theory again,

529
00:36:01.151 --> 00:36:03.730
I was exploring it because it's interesting to think about its implications,

530
00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.530
but since I don't believe in souls,

531
00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:09.280
I want to choose between the body view and the personality view.

532
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:15.600
Both of them as we saw in the face of fision needs to accept a no branching

533
00:36:18.011 --> 00:36:18.844
rule.

534
00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:23.550
If they're gonna survive this thinking about this case at all,

535
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:27.940
we need to throw in a no branching rule whether or not you find the no branch in

536
00:36:27.941 --> 00:36:31.470
rule,
hard to believe.
If both views are stuck with it,

537
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.760
well then we're stuck with it.

538
00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:39.900
So let's try to choose between the personality theory with the no branch in rule

539
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:44.760
and the body theory with the no branch in rule.

540
00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.960
Which of these should we accept?

541
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:54.570
Which of these is the better theory of personal identity?

542
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:58.750
<v 1>Answer,
I'm not sure.</v>

543
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:03.090
<v 0>Over the course of my philosophical career,</v>

544
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:07.320
I have moved back and forth between them.

545
00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:14.180
There are certainly a long period of time in which I found the personality

546
00:37:14.181 --> 00:37:19.181
theory that is personality theory with the no branching rule to be the better

547
00:37:19.761 --> 00:37:21.950
and more plausible theory.

548
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:27.080
And it certainly has any number of advocates on the contemporary philosophical

549
00:37:27.081 --> 00:37:32.050
scene.
But at other times in my philosophical career,

550
00:37:32.051 --> 00:37:37.051
I have found the body theory that is to say the body theory with the no

551
00:37:37.451 --> 00:37:41.620
branching rule to be the more plausible theory.

552
00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:46.990
And it is certainly the case that the body theory has its advocates among

553
00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:48.970
contemporary philosophers.

554
00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:50.680
<v 1>Okay</v>

555
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.010
<v 0>for what it's worth and I don't actually think that when I'm about to say is</v>

556
00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.300
worth all that much.

557
00:37:55.301 --> 00:38:00.301
I'm going to share with you my own pet belief these days.

558
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:03.910
I'm inclined to go with the body theory.

559
00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:07.980
I'm inclined to think that the key to personal identities,

560
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:11.950
having the same body as long as there's no branching,

561
00:38:11.951 --> 00:38:13.210
as long as there's no splitting,

562
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:14.933
<v 1>but</v>

563
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.350
<v 0>certainly open to you to decide that you think no,
no.
The personality theories,</v>

564
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:20.370
the stronger view.

565
00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:22.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

566
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.680
<v 0>I can't settle the question.</v>

567
00:38:24.681 --> 00:38:29.030
I don't have any more philosophical arguments up my sleeve on this issue,

568
00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:34.960
but I do have another point that's worth considering.

569
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:42.420
Although I'm inclined to think that the body theory may be the best view about

570
00:38:44.441 --> 00:38:47.140
what's the key to personal identity.

571
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:53.220
I'm also inclined to think it doesn't really matter.

572
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:57.583
<v 1>Okay.</v>

573
00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:02.820
<v 0>We've been posing the following question we've been asking what does it take for</v>

574
00:39:02.821 --> 00:39:06.510
it to be true that I survive?

575
00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:08.520
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

576
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.510
<v 0>and it may be that what we should conclude is whatever.</v>

577
00:39:12.511 --> 00:39:14.520
The best answer to that question is,

578
00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:18.840
it's not the question we should really have been thinking about.

579
00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:23.910
We weren't going to be in a position to see that until we went through all the

580
00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.770
stuff we've been going over for the last couple of weeks.

581
00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:30.420
But now that we're here,
we're in a position perhaps to raise the question,

582
00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:36.200
should we be asking what it takes to survive or should we be asking about what

583
00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:43.340
matters in survival now and posing this question,

584
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:49.230
I'm obviously presupposing that we can draw a distinction between the question,

585
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:53.040
do I survive?
Is somebody that existed in the future,

586
00:39:53.041 --> 00:39:56.700
whatever me and the question,
what is,

587
00:39:56.730 --> 00:40:00.510
what was it that I wanted when I wanted to survive?

588
00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:04.950
What was it that mattered in ordinary survival?

589
00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:06.803
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

590
00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:11.930
<v 0>and it might be that these things can actually come apart to see this.</v>

591
00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.450
Suppose we start by thinking again about the soul view.

592
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:19.860
Suppose there are souls,
I don't believe in them,

593
00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:24.890
but let's imagine suppose there are souls and compose that souls are the key to

594
00:40:25.651 --> 00:40:29.460
personal identity.
So somebody is me,

595
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:33.260
if they've got my soul or to put it more straight forwardly you know,

596
00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:37.110
next week the person that's me is the person with my soul.

597
00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.170
I survive as long as there's somebody around with my soul,

598
00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:45.570
hundred years from now,
am I still around?
Well,
if my soul still around,

599
00:40:45.571 --> 00:40:50.010
that's me.
That's what the sole theory says,
and suppose it's the truth.

600
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.433
<v 1>Okay.</v>

601
00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:54.660
<v 0>Now consider the following possibility.</v>

602
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:58.260
Suppose that people can be reincarnated.

603
00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:03.720
That is to say at the death of their body,
their soul takes over,

604
00:41:03.721 --> 00:41:07.890
animates and habits gets connected to a new body that's being born.

605
00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:14.810
But unlike the kind of reincarnation cases that get talked about in popular

606
00:41:15.211 --> 00:41:18.870
culture and various religions where at least under the right circumstances,

607
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:21.060
you can remember your prior lives.

608
00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:25.530
Let's imagine that when the soul is reincarnated,

609
00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:29.070
it's scrubbed,
completely clean,

610
00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:33.950
no traces whatsoever of the life,

611
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:36.680
no way to retrieve it,

612
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:41.950
no karmic similarities of personality or anything just starts over like a blank

613
00:41:43.131 --> 00:41:47.450
slate like,
like on blackboard that's been completely erased.

614
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:51.050
We now have the very same blackboard and how we start writing new things on it.

615
00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:55.520
I imagine that that's the way reincarnation worked.

616
00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:01.480
So somebody asked you,
will you still be around in a thousand years?

617
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:02.620
The answer's gonna be yes,

618
00:42:02.621 --> 00:42:06.130
because my soul will be reincarnated in a thousand years.

619
00:42:06.131 --> 00:42:09.940
There'll be somebody that has the very same soul that's animating my body right

620
00:42:09.941 --> 00:42:10.774
now.
Of course,

621
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:15.070
that's soul won't remember being Shelly Kagan won't have any memories of its

622
00:42:15.071 --> 00:42:18.880
prior life.
It won't be like Shelly Kagan in any way.

623
00:42:18.881 --> 00:42:23.200
In terms of Shelly Kagan's desires or ambitions or goals or fears,

624
00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:25.510
it won't be that.

625
00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:30.570
We can sort of see why that personality emerges through Karmic cause and effect

626
00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:34.870
in any ways that are a function of what my,
I was liken my life.

627
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:38.200
It'll be Shelly Kagan because it's Shelly Kagan's soul,

628
00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:42.850
but with no overlap of personality,
memories,

629
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:47.730
anything.
Then I want to say,
who cares?

630
00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:54.050
The fact that I will survive under those circumstances doesn't give me anything

631
00:42:54.721 --> 00:42:56.460
that matters to me.

632
00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.040
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

633
00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:03.040
<v 0>It's no comfort to me to be told I will survive because after all,</v>

634
00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.540
the soul is the key to personal identity.

635
00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:12.680
If there's no similar personality,
no memories,
no beliefs,

636
00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.460
no retrievable memories of past lives,

637
00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.210
then who cares that it's me.

638
00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.020
If you can feel the force of that thought,

639
00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:26.350
then you're seeing how the question will I survive,

640
00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:30.670
can be separated out from the question,
what matters?

641
00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:32.530
What do we care about?

642
00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:36.850
Bear survival of my soul,

643
00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:41.050
even though that is the key to personal identity,

644
00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:46.110
if it is bare survival of my soul doesn't give me what I want,

645
00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:52.970
it's it's no more comforting or satisfying than if you said no.

646
00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:59.540
You know this knuckle bone after you die who go on to do knuckle bone surgery

647
00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:06.240
and implant that knuckle bone in somebody else's body and that knuckle bone is

648
00:44:06.311 --> 00:44:07.720
gone to survive.
I said,
oh,

649
00:44:07.721 --> 00:44:12.010
that's very interesting that that knuckle bone will be around a hundred or a

650
00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:14.350
thousand years from now,
but who cares?

651
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:21.630
And if the knuckle bone theory of personal identity gets proposed and somebody

652
00:44:21.631 --> 00:44:25.980
says,
Oh yes,
but you see that person now would that knuckle boom will be you?

653
00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.760
Because the key to personal identities having the very same knuckle bone,

654
00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.240
I say all so it's me.
Who Cares?

655
00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:34.950
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

656
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:39.950
<v 0>bare knuckle bones survival does not give me what matters.</v>

657
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:45.960
Now the knuckle bone theory of personal identity is a very stupid theory.

658
00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:48.240
In contrast,

659
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:53.220
the sole theory of personal survival is not a stupid theory,

660
00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.410
but for all that,

661
00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:59.040
it doesn't give me what I want.

662
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:05.030
When you think about the possibility of bear survival of the scrubbed clean

663
00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.220
array soul,

664
00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:13.110
you see that survival wasn't really everything you wanted,

665
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:16.410
what you wanted,
at least what I want,

666
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:18.810
I invite you to ask yourself whether you want the same thing.

667
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:23.160
What I want is not just survival,

668
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:27.000
but survival with the same personality.

669
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:34.190
So even if the sole theory is the correct theory of personality,

670
00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:39.170
it's not enough to get me what matters.
What matters isn't just survival.

671
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:42.260
It's survival with the same personality.

672
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:44.343
<v 1>Okay?</v>

673
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:45.740
<v 0>Let's consider the body view.</v>

674
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:53.970
Suppose that the body theory of personal identity is correct,

675
00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:58.890
and to be me,
it's gotta be somebody there that's got my body.

676
00:45:58.891 --> 00:46:01.830
Let's suppose the brain version of the theory is the best version.

677
00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:07.010
And so next year there's gonna be somebody that's got my brain.

678
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:13.590
But let's imagine that the brain has been scrubbed clean.

679
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:18.570
All memory traces have been completely erased.

680
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:23.870
We're talking complete irreversible amnesia,

681
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:29.600
complete a ratio of the brain's hard drive.

682
00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:34.970
No traces of desires and memories and intentions to be and beliefs to eventually

683
00:46:36.901 --> 00:46:37.561
be recovered.

684
00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:42.300
If only we have the right surgery or procedure or psychotherapy,

685
00:46:42.301 --> 00:46:46.320
what have you,
it's gone now.

686
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:50.820
That thing that wakes up after this complete irreversible amnesia,

687
00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:55.620
we'll no doubt eventually develop a personality set of beliefs,
memories.

688
00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:58.270
Nobody knows who it is.
So they called,
you know,

689
00:46:58.271 --> 00:47:01.800
I find it wandering on the streets.
They call it John Doe.

690
00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:06.480
John Doe will eventually have a bunch of beliefs about how the world works.

691
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:07.650
Make some plans,

692
00:47:07.651 --> 00:47:11.820
get some memories according to the body theory.

693
00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.590
That's me.

694
00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:16.663
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

695
00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:19.420
<v 0>And if the body here is correct,
well by Golly,
it is me.</v>

696
00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:25.640
And all I can say in response to that is it's me,
but who cares?

697
00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:27.140
So what?

698
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:33.430
I'm not comforted by the thought that I will still be around 50 years from now.

699
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:40.180
If the thing that's me doesn't have my personality

700
00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:43.981
mirror,

701
00:47:43.981 --> 00:47:48.981
bodily survival isn't enough to give me what I want.

702
00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:55.080
I want more than mere bodily survival.

703
00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:00.440
I want to survive with this same personality.

704
00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:03.090
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

705
00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:07.170
<v 0>So even if the body theory of personal identity is the right theory,</v>

706
00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.510
what I want to say in response to that is,

707
00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:13.650
so what if the really crucial question is not,

708
00:48:13.651 --> 00:48:14.940
do I survive,

709
00:48:14.941 --> 00:48:19.860
but do I have what I wanted when I wanted to survive?

710
00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.370
The answer is the body theory doesn't give it.

711
00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:26.540
I don't just want to survive.

712
00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:30.110
I want to survive with the same personality.

713
00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:37.520
Should we conclude therefore that the key to the important question,

714
00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.330
namely what matters?

715
00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:47.850
The answer to that question should we conclude,
is same personality.

716
00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:50.760
That's the question we'll have to take up next time.
