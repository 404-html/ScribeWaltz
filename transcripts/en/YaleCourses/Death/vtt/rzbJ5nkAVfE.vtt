1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.980
We've distinguished three different views as to the secret are key to personal

2
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:09.870
identity across time.
There's the soul view,

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.160
the body view and the personality view.
Putting aside for the most part,

4
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:16.590
this whole view because I've argued it to our no souls,

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.680
although occasionally I'd bring it out just for the sake of comparison and

6
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:20.514
contrast.

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.930
Main question we want to ask ourselves is how to choose between the body view

8
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.040
and the personality view.
The body view says follow the body.

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.640
If somebody around in the future has got my body,
that's me.

10
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.470
The personality view says follow the personality.
That is the set of beliefs,

11
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.770
desires,
memories,
goals,
ambitions and so forth.

12
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.480
Somebody around in the future that's got my memories,
my beliefs,
my desires.

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.290
That's me.
How should we choose between these two views?

14
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.900
As I mentioned the end of last lecture but I want to do is offer us a set of

15
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:58.410
thought experiments that they've gotta be thought experience because in in real

16
00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:01.890
life bodies and personalities go hand in hand,

17
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.070
but by doing some science fiction experiments we can take them apart and ask

18
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:10.080
ourselves,
well,
which one do I think is me?

19
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.820
When my body goes one way and my personality goes another way?
Where do I go?

20
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.850
And as I again,
just to remind you,

21
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.090
in order to get the intuition is actually flowing.

22
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:23.690
What I'm going to do once I've separated the Ma,

23
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.440
the body and the personality in this way is torture one of the end products and

24
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:33.270
so I'm going to be asking you to sort of put yourself in the first person.

25
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.480
Imagine this is happening to you and ask yourself which one do I want to be

26
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:42.150
tortured or which one do I want to not be tortured?

27
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.390
Because that will give you some kind of evidence as to which one you take to be

28
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.473
you.

29
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.130
And think about this and that kind of special first person,

30
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.150
ego concerned way that comes naturally to us.

31
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.950
Just bracket any moral concerns you may have about,
about torturing.

32
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.400
Other people are agreeing that somebody else should be tortured for,
for our,

33
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.650
for our purposes.
As you know right now,
you know,

34
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:11.430
if I brought up a volunteer from the class and I'm asking you,
you know,

35
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.810
here's you,
there's the other volunteer,
which one do you want to be tortured?

36
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.310
We let that one be tortured.
Don't let it happen to me.
That's how we know,

37
00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:22.260
you know,
this is me speaking.
All right,

38
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.270
so that's the question I'm going to ask you.
I'll,

39
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:27.060
I'll probably slip into talking about this experiment as though it's being done

40
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:31.650
to me,
but to get it vivid,
you should think of it,
uh,
as,

41
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.750
as though it's being done to you.

42
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.950
And I'll mention just in passing that,
uh,
these,

43
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.670
these thought experiments that are about to give it,

44
00:02:39.671 --> 00:02:43.020
I'm going to get a pair of them are coming from Bernard Williams.

45
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:46.980
He was a a British philosopher.
All right,

46
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.770
so case number one here.
Here you are,

47
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.110
the mad scientist has has kidnapped you.
And he says,

48
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.460
I've been working on mine transfer machines.

49
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.260
And what I'm going to do is,
you know,

50
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.320
I've got you and I've also kidnapped somebody else over here.
Yep,

51
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.333
Linda.

52
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.653
<v 1>Okay.</v>

53
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.230
<v 0>And I'm going to hook you up to my machines and,</v>

54
00:03:15.231 --> 00:03:20.150
and swap your minds.
And what that means is I'm going,

55
00:03:20.151 --> 00:03:23.840
I sort of read off the memories and the beliefs and the desires from your,

56
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.280
from your brain and read off the memories and desires and beliefs from Linda's

57
00:03:28.281 --> 00:03:29.090
brain.

58
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.800
And then I'm going to electronically transfer Linda's memories and beliefs and

59
00:03:33.801 --> 00:03:36.620
so forth over here and in plant the Monta,

60
00:03:36.621 --> 00:03:41.380
this brain and take your memories and beliefs and so forth and implant them

61
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.290
Monta Linda's brain.
And so,
you know,
first we'll put you to sleep and what we do,

62
00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:47.750
all of this procedure.
And then when you wake up,

63
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.340
you will wake up in Linda's body.
There'll be,

64
00:03:52.341 --> 00:03:55.460
there'll be something here that,
that,
you know,
you'll,

65
00:03:55.461 --> 00:03:58.810
you'll wake up and you'll say,
you know,
what am I doing?
This new body?
What,

66
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:02.570
what happened to my beard?
Uh,
you know,
uh,
uh,
how come,

67
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.890
<v 2>how come I'm speaking in this high female</v>

68
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.180
<v 0>boy?
Whatever it is.
But you'll,
yeah,
you'll think to yourself,
well,
you know,</v>

69
00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:11.130
here I am Shelly Kagan.

70
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.150
I seem to be inhabiting a Linda's body.

71
00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:17.520
Don't know how that happened.
Oh yes,

72
00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:21.540
the mad scientist kidnapped me and he transferred are transferred to us.

73
00:04:21.541 --> 00:04:24.690
You know,
he swapped us,
he swapped our bodies,
swapped our minds.

74
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.250
I guess the whole thing works.

75
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.240
So the mad scientist explains all of this to you,

76
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.390
but in order to sort of give it a little kicker,
because he's also an evil,

77
00:04:33.391 --> 00:04:37.530
mad side that may be evil already,
but cause he's an evil,
mad scientist,
he says,

78
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.480
and then when I'm done,
so over here we've got Shelley's body,

79
00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:45.360
but you know,
Linda's personality,
uh,
you know,
so Linda thinking,

80
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:48.690
what am I doing and what am I doing in Charlotte,
his body?
How did I go to Butte?

81
00:04:48.691 --> 00:04:50.850
Right?
Um,
so over here,

82
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.620
Linda in Shelley's body over here,
Shelley and Linda's body.

83
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.390
I'm going to torture one of these,
but because I'm a generous,
evil,

84
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:04.500
mad scientist,
I want to ask you which one should I torture?

85
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.870
Now,
when I think about this,
and again,

86
00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:09.170
I'm inviting you to think about this in the first person,

87
00:05:09.171 --> 00:05:11.280
is all this is happening to you.
When I think about this,

88
00:05:11.281 --> 00:05:14.420
I say torture the one over here.
No,

89
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.960
I'm going to be over here in Linda's body.

90
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.580
Horrified at what's been going on,
horrified that she's being tortured,

91
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.280
but at least it's not happening to me.

92
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.940
That's the intuition I've got.
When I think about this case,

93
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.720
when the mad scientist asks me,
which one are these two,

94
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.790
should I torture?

95
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.230
I say torture this one

96
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.080
because if I were to say torture this one and then he does it,

97
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.810
think about what's going to happen.
I'll be thinking,
I'm Shelly Kagan.

98
00:05:47.811 --> 00:05:48.710
All this is what a horrible thing.

99
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.150
<v 2>Where did I stop the bay naked?</v>

100
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.390
I don't want that to happen to me.

101
00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.110
<v 0>If this one's being tortured,
nobody thinking to himself,
Oh,</v>

102
00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:05.250
I'm Shelly Kagan in horrible pain,
so I want this one to be tortured.
All right.

103
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.880
That's the intuition I've got about the case.
Now,

104
00:06:08.881 --> 00:06:10.020
if you've got that same intuition,

105
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.440
think about the implications of that intuition.

106
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.480
You're saying that I,
Shelly Kagan ended up over here,

107
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.600
but that's not my body.
This is Linda's body.

108
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.140
Shelly Kagan's old body is over here,

109
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.970
but this is the one that's me because this is the one that I don't want to have

110
00:06:30.971 --> 00:06:35.560
tortured,
so the body isn't the key to personal identity.

111
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.430
Personality is the key to personal identity.

112
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.060
This has got my personality,

113
00:06:43.061 --> 00:06:46.090
my memories of growing up in Chicago,

114
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.070
becoming a philosopher.

115
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.310
Now you know my thoughts about what I want to have happen to my children,

116
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.250
my fears about how I'm going to explain what's going on to my wife,

117
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.850
whatever it is.
This is the Shelly Kagan personality over here.

118
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:03.010
This is me that follows them that this intuition suggests that what I find

119
00:07:03.011 --> 00:07:08.011
intuitively plausible is the personality theory of personal identity.

120
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.690
That's total different story.
Both of these stories as they say,

121
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:15.740
come from Bernie Williams.

122
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:18.030
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.460
<v 0>Bernoy and says,
Hey,
here's another example we can think about.</v>

124
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.680
Mad scientist again,
kidnaps,
you know,
you kidnaps Linda

125
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.610
and he says,
Shelley,
I got some news for you.
I tell you,

126
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.160
say I'm switching between you and Shell and me,
you know,
says Shelley,

127
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:35.570
I've got some news for you.

128
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.980
I'm going to torture you and said,
no,
no,

129
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:43.880
please don't do it to me.
Please,
please don't torture me.
He says,
well,
you know,

130
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:47.270
I'm in the mad scientist businesses is what I do.
I'm going to torture you,

131
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.360
but because I'm a generous,
mad scientist,

132
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.030
before I torture you,

133
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.990
what I'm going to do is give you amnesia.

134
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.460
I'm going to completely scrubbed,

135
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:06.461
clean your brain so that you won't remember that your Shelly Kagan,

136
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.550
you won't have any memories of growing up in Chicago.

137
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.850
You won't have any memories of deciding to become a philosopher.

138
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.370
You won't remember getting married or having children and you won't remember the

139
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.920
all.
You won't have any desire.
The whole thing.
Wipe clean,
complete,

140
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.990
perfect Amnesia before I taught you.
You don't,
you feel better.
No,

141
00:08:26.991 --> 00:08:30.170
I don't feel better.
I'm still going to be tortured.

142
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.210
And now we've added sort of insult to injury.

143
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:37.070
I've got Amnesia as well as being tortured.
No comfort there.

144
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:38.540
Well he says,
look,

145
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:43.540
I'll make the deal sweeter for you after I give you Amnesia before I torture

146
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:46.124
you,

147
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:52.330
I will drive you insane and make you believe that your Linda,

148
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.230
I've been studying Linda,
you know,
there she is.

149
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.340
I've been reading her psychology by looking at her brain waves and so forth and

150
00:08:59.341 --> 00:08:59.940
so on.

151
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.940
And so I'm going to delude you into thinking that you're Linda.

152
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.740
I'm going to make you think,
oh,
I'll go.
You want to talk about it?
Oh,
I'm Linda.

153
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.510
And,
and,

154
00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:14.610
and you'll have the memories of Linda of growing up in Pennsylvania and you'll

155
00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:16.800
remember Linda's family and like,
Linda,

156
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:20.400
you'll want to be an author or whatever it is the lender wants to be.

157
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.380
And then I'll talk to you.
Are you happy now?
No,
I'm not happy now.

158
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.750
First of all,
I'm being tortured.
I was given Amnesia.

159
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.930
Now you've driven me crazy and make me diluted me into thinking that I'm Linda.

160
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.860
No comfort there.
He says,
okay,

161
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.100
last attempt to mate,
you're not being very reasonable.
He says,

162
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.540
last attempt I'm going to after I drive you crazy,

163
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:46.110
make you think you're Linda.
I'm going to do the corresponding thing for Linda.

164
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.850
I'm going to give her Amnesia and then I'm going to drive her crazy and make her

165
00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:55.260
think that she,
Shelly,
give her all of your memories and beliefs and desires.

166
00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:01.470
Now is it okay that I'm going to torture you know it.

167
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.600
It hardly makes it,
you know it was bad enough.

168
00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:06.690
I was being tortured and given Amnesia and driven insane.

169
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.870
It doesn't really make it any better that you're also going to give Amnesia and

170
00:10:09.871 --> 00:10:13.680
drive insane.
Somebody else.
Don't torture me

171
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.140
if you've got to torture somebody.
I say in my non ethical mood,

172
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.820
if you've got a torture,
somebody do it to her,
don't do it.
To me,

173
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.080
when I think about this second case,
that's my intuition.

174
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.390
Nothing about the implications of this second case for the theory of personal

175
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:39.100
identity.
If I don't want me,

176
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.990
if I don't want this thing over here to be tortured,

177
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.580
that must be,
because I think it's me,
but if it's me,

178
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.520
what's the key to personal identity?
Well,

179
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.970
not personality because after all,

180
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.500
this doesn't end up with Shelly Kagan's personality before the torture.

181
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.960
Shelly Kagan's personalities over there.

182
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.353
<v 1>Okay,</v>

183
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.940
<v 0>this is Shelly Kagan's body and that suggest if I don't want to be,</v>

184
00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:09.570
I don't want this to be tortured.

185
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.710
It's because I believe in the body theory of personal identity.

186
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.880
Follow the body,
not follow the personality.

187
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:22.260
Even though he swapped our personalities,
it's still me.
He's torturing.

188
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:27.430
That's the intuition I've got.
When I think about Bernard Williams,

189
00:11:27.431 --> 00:11:28.780
his second case.

190
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:30.490
<v 1>Okay.</v>

191
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:34.450
<v 0>Now we're in a bit of a pickle here from the philosophical point of view because</v>

192
00:11:34.451 --> 00:11:38.920
when we thought about the first case,
the intuition seem to be

193
00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.610
personalities.
The key to personal identity.

194
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.030
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

195
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:48.750
<v 0>but when we thought about the second case,
the intuition,
it seems to be,
Huh?</v>

196
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:53.920
Body is the key to personal identity.
That's bad.

197
00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:54.400
Right?

198
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.320
Two different cases give us two different diametrically opposed answers on the

199
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:01.450
very same question.
One sec

200
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.190
and it's worth still,
oh,
of course.
You know,

201
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.160
if you don't share the intuitions that I just,
you know,

202
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.430
I was being honest with you.
Those really are my intuitions.

203
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.720
When I think about these cases,
if you're with me,

204
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.360
you're in a philosophical problem.
If you're not with me,
if you,

205
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:20.840
if you didn't have the same intuitions that maybe you don't have a problem,
but,

206
00:12:20.841 --> 00:12:25.841
but I've got a problem and it's worse still because it's not really,

207
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:27.880
if we're careful and think about it,

208
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.200
it's not really as though we have two different cases and intuitively we want to

209
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:34.360
give different answers to those two different cases.

210
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.800
Really all we've got there is just one case.

211
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.860
It's the very same case,

212
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:47.010
that very same story that I told two different times in both cases before the

213
00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:53.320
torturing ends to go,
goes in,

214
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.860
there's Shelly Kagan's body over here with Linda's personality and there's

215
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:04.021
Linda's body over here with Shelly Kagan's personality and we're asking which

216
00:13:04.931 --> 00:13:08.740
one do you want to be tortured?
It's the very same setup.

217
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.600
I just emphasize different elements in a way to sort of manipulate your

218
00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:17.500
intuitions,
but it's the very same case.

219
00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:21.650
It can't be that in one of them follow the body and the other one followup

220
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.600
personality,

221
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:28.080
so it's very hard to know what moral should we draw the the appeal to intuition,

222
00:13:28.631 --> 00:13:31.570
thinking about these cases doesn't seem to take us very far.

223
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.070
There was a question back there.
Yeah.

224
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:03.940
Nice suggestion for the suggestion was this.

225
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:08.600
When the mad scientist put my personality I Shelly Kagan personality on until

226
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.820
Linda,
his body,

227
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:15.150
he had to modify Linda's brain and in modifying Linda's brain,

228
00:14:15.311 --> 00:14:16.630
this was the question that was just raised,

229
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:21.810
hasn't he actually made that brain more like Shelly Kagan's brain then Linda's

230
00:14:23.081 --> 00:14:26.950
brain and if that's right,
shouldn't we say member?

231
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:32.010
The best form of the body view I argued previously was the brain version.

232
00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.020
So if this is really Shelly Kagan's brain over here,

233
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.270
then this isn't a problem for the body view.

234
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:44.260
We were deceived when we said the body view said,
this is Shelly Kagan.

235
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.180
Really the body view to it.

236
00:14:46.181 --> 00:14:50.140
The best version of the body of you that is the brain version now has to say,

237
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.030
oh we Shelley's brain and put it here.

238
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.170
Well if you're prepared to say that,
then indeed you will be able to say,
yeah,

239
00:14:57.171 --> 00:14:59.360
that's the,
it's the,
it's the body view.

240
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.920
The body of view says don't do it to this one rather don't do to this one.

241
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:04.970
Cause this is Shelly Kagan.

242
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:11.020
I don't actually find myself though inclined to agree with you that this has

243
00:15:11.721 --> 00:15:13.580
become Shelly Kagan's brain.

244
00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:20.420
If you ask me,
where's Shelly Kagan's legs,
there's still here.

245
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.660
Where's Shelly Kagan's heart?
There's still here.

246
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.260
Where's Shelly Kagan's brain?
It's still here,
right?

247
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:31.400
It's not as though what the scientists did was open up my skull.

248
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.580
Take the brain out.
At least if you,
that's the way you were imagining that.

249
00:15:34.581 --> 00:15:36.890
Don't imagine that this is all electronic transfer.

250
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.710
Is that as how he took the brain out and literally moved that hunk of tissue

251
00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:43.670
over here.

252
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.480
All he's done is reprogram Linda's brain analogy here.

253
00:15:51.591 --> 00:15:52.460
My Cup might be helpful.

254
00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:57.461
Think of the difference between the computer and the programs and files saved on

255
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.130
the computer personalities.

256
00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:05.390
A little bit like a program that's running on the computer though we have to

257
00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:10.220
have not just the generic program but this specific data files and databases and

258
00:16:10.221 --> 00:16:11.054
so forth.

259
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:17.500
What the mad scientist did in effect was wipe out the hard drive put in the

260
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:23.450
other programs from the Shelly Kagan computer,

261
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.370
but it's still in the very same computer.
It's the still,

262
00:16:26.371 --> 00:16:30.560
it's still the same central processing unit or so.
It seems to me.

263
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.920
Of course it's true that now in a certain way Linda's brain will be similar to

264
00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:42.431
the way that Shelly Kagan's brain had been before in terms of how the,

265
00:16:42.951 --> 00:16:43.671
you know,
as it were,

266
00:16:43.671 --> 00:16:48.671
the floppy drives are set up but still wears literally speaking.

267
00:16:50.271 --> 00:16:54.980
Shelly Kagan's brain.
I want to say it's over there.
Not over here.

268
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.840
There was another question.
Comment.
Yeah.

269
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.320
<v 1>This counting of the body,
brain,
heart,</v>

270
00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.460
everything is over here.
Then

271
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:10.920
I would want the body,
I meant to get the story is that until we see,

272
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:12.910
because your personality is not going to feel the pain.

273
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:18.730
<v 0>I'm not quite sure what the question is.
So the thought is,
look over here.</v>

274
00:17:18.731 --> 00:17:22.300
We've got Shelly Kagan's body with Linda's personality.

275
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:28.270
If we torture in this one,
this thing,
whoever it is,

276
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:33.160
is going to think to itself.
I'm Linda,
I'm in horrible pain.

277
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:38.020
I wish it stopped.
I wonder whether I'll ever see Linda's husband again.

278
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:39.003
<v 1>All right.</v>

279
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:45.260
<v 0>Over here we've got Linda's body,
Shelly Kagan's personality.</v>

280
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:49.860
If we torture this one,
of course.
Yeah,
to torture.
Yet you cause pain,

281
00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:52.800
the bodies,
but the pain gets felt in,
you know,
in the mind.

282
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.130
So over here we've got something that's going to think to itself.

283
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.550
I'm Shelly Kagan,
I'm in horrible pain.

284
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.850
I wonder whether I'll ever see Shelly Kagan's wife again.

285
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:09.550
Yes,
of course.
We're torturing bodies by torturing the bodies.

286
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.800
We caused pain to the mines.

287
00:18:11.801 --> 00:18:14.710
The personalities who have beliefs about who's hurting.

288
00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.480
What I'm inviting you to think about is which one?

289
00:18:19.481 --> 00:18:22.570
If you had to choose between these two gruesome scenarios,

290
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.220
which one would you rather save?
Which one would you rather protect?

291
00:18:27.221 --> 00:18:29.230
Which do you care more about?

292
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:34.950
Making sure that your lump of flesh doesn't have its neurons hurt or making sure

293
00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:40.300
that the person who's thinking to yourself,
I'm Shelly Kagan or you know,

294
00:18:40.301 --> 00:18:43.480
whatever your name is.
All right.
Yeah I'm in pain.

295
00:18:43.481 --> 00:18:46.930
You don't want to be thinking I Shelly Kagan,
I'm in pain.
Or if your name is,

296
00:18:46.931 --> 00:18:49.750
you know Mary,
I'm Mary,
I'm in pain.

297
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.120
That's what we're trying to get straight on here.
No,

298
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:57.310
the trouble though is that you're telling the very same story two different

299
00:18:57.311 --> 00:19:00.880
times and I find myself sometimes being pulled this way.

300
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.290
Sometimes he's being pulled that way.

301
00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:08.730
So I can't use thinking about the Williams cases as a method of deciding what do

302
00:19:11.861 --> 00:19:16.861
I really believe the body view or the personality view I find myself is spin the

303
00:19:18.521 --> 00:19:20.980
story one way and I follow the body.

304
00:19:20.981 --> 00:19:24.250
You spin the story and other way and I follow the personality.

305
00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:28.480
If we're gonna have a way to decide between these two theories,

306
00:19:28.481 --> 00:19:31.570
it seems as though we need some other kinds of arguments.

307
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:35.320
At least I need some of the kinds of arguments cause cause of the intuitions

308
00:19:35.321 --> 00:19:36.640
I've got about the cases.

309
00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:43.020
So let me turn to a different approach to solving the question.

310
00:19:43.421 --> 00:19:45.220
Answering the question.
Which one should we believe?

311
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.520
It starts by raising a certain philosophical objection to the personality

312
00:19:53.951 --> 00:19:58.240
theory.
It's going to say,
look,
the personality theory,

313
00:19:58.241 --> 00:20:03.241
your personal identity has an implication that we cannot possibly accept.

314
00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.620
So we have to reject the view and then become body theorist.

315
00:20:08.621 --> 00:20:13.600
If there are no souls,
here's,
here's the objection.
A common enough objection.

316
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:18.070
It's probably occurred to some of you coordinate the personality theory.

317
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:22.340
Whether somebody is me,
depends on whether he's got,
yeah,

318
00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.810
my beliefs.
You know,
for example,
the belief that I'm Shelly Kagan,

319
00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.450
professor of philosophy at Yale University.

320
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:30.460
<v 1>Okay,</v>

321
00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.400
<v 0>well I'm sort of not a special interesting fellow sauce.</v>

322
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.650
Let's make it more dramatic and think about Napoleon.

323
00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.990
You've probably read about this thing again.

324
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:47.240
Every now and then there are sort of crazy people who think they're Napoleon.

325
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:53.220
So imagine that there's right now somebody in an insane asylum in Michigan.

326
00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.520
You know who,
who's got the thought?
I am Napoleon.

327
00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.053
Well,

328
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.770
the objection says clearly this guy is just insane,
right?

329
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.690
He is not Napoleon.

330
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:14.990
He's David Smith who grew up in Detroit or whatever.

331
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.340
He just insanely believes he's Napoleon.

332
00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.440
Yet the personality theory,

333
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.040
the objection says would tell us that he is Napoleon.

334
00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:28.620
It's because he's got the beliefs of Napoleon.

335
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.540
He's gotten Napoleon's personality.

336
00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.740
Since that's obviously the wrong thing to say about the case,

337
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.440
we should reject the personality view

338
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:41.440
for Knoxville quick.

339
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:47.700
The personality view doesn't say anybody who has any elements at all of my

340
00:21:51.131 --> 00:21:53.110
personality is me.

341
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:57.550
One Belief in Commons,
obviously not enough.

342
00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.690
We all believe the earth is round.
That's not enough to make somebody else in me.

343
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.380
Of course,
the belief I am Napoleon is a much rarer belief.

344
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:12.580
I presume that none of you have that belief.
I certainly don't have that belief.

345
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.720
Napoleon had it and and David Smith in Michigan's got it,

346
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.870
but so what one belief,

347
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.720
even one very unusual beliefs,

348
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:27.840
not enough to make somebody Napoleon according to the personality theory,

349
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.880
to be Napoleon,

350
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.470
you've got to have the very same overall personality,

351
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.850
which is a very big,

352
00:22:36.851 --> 00:22:41.851
complicated set of beliefs and desires and ambitions and memories.

353
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.600
David Smith doesn't have that.

354
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:51.810
David Smith in the insane asylum and Michigan does not remember conquering

355
00:22:52.781 --> 00:22:56.350
Europe.
He doesn't remember being crowned emperor.

356
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.770
He doesn't remember being defeated by the British.

357
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.930
He doesn't have any of those memories,

358
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.340
probably doesn't even speak French.
Napoleon spoke French.

359
00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.250
He doesn't have Napoleon's personality,

360
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.590
so the David Smith case isn't really bothersome.

361
00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.370
It's not really a counter example to the personality theory.

362
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.430
Personality theory says to be Napoleon,

363
00:23:27.431 --> 00:23:30.880
you've got to have Napoleon's personality,
but David Smith doesn't.

364
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:33.940
So of course we can all agree.
David Smith,

365
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.550
despite thinking he's Napoleon is not Napoleon.

366
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.520
No problem here for the personality theory,

367
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.800
but we could tweak the case.
We could revise the case.

368
00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:49.550
Some photo of the personality theory could say,
okay,

369
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:54.670
imagine that this guy in Michigan does have Napoleon's personality.

370
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:07.780
He's got the memories of being crowned emperor and being defeated,

371
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.000
conquering Europe.

372
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:15.140
He's got all of those memories and remember,

373
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.900
we want him to have Napoleon's personality.

374
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:21.410
He doesn't have any David Smith memories.

375
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.370
It doesn't have any memories of growing up in Detroit.

376
00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.640
How could Napoleon have memories of growing up in Detroit?

377
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:30.560
The polling grew up in France.

378
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.673
<v 1>Okay.</v>

379
00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.780
<v 0>The objection then says,
even if,</v>

380
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:40.363
<v 1>yeah,</v>

381
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:44.630
<v 0>this guy had all of Napoleon's memories,
beliefs,
desires,</v>

382
00:24:44.631 --> 00:24:47.240
personality still wouldn't be Napoleon.

383
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:50.090
So the personality theory has got to go,

384
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:57.880
well,
when I think about this example,
I think now we've got it right?
That is,

385
00:24:57.881 --> 00:25:01.390
that is what the personality theory has to say about that case.

386
00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:06.640
But I'm not so confident anymore that it's the wrong thing to say.

387
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:11.860
So think of this as it were from the point of view of Napoleon,
right?

388
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:16.810
So there was Napoleon in the 18 hundreds conquering Europe,

389
00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:18.370
uh,
and uh,

390
00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:23.460
and being crowned emperor being defeated by the British being,

391
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.550
being sent to exile on Elba.
Right?

392
00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:32.660
And I forget where Napoleon actually dies,
but you know,
he's got memories of,

393
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:37.540
of getting sick and ill and,
and,
and the light begins to fade and he sort of,

394
00:25:37.541 --> 00:25:41.710
you know,
well goes unconscious
and then,

395
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.150
well,
let's,
let's at least try to describe it this way.

396
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:51.210
He wakes up and he wakes up in Michigan.

397
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.940
He thinks to himself,
I low just three Napoleon,

398
00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:03.250
fuck am I doing in Michigan?
I don't,
I don't speak French,

399
00:26:03.251 --> 00:26:07.570
so I'm going to drop that.
Right.
But yeah,
the last thing I remember,

400
00:26:07.571 --> 00:26:08.410
I was,

401
00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:12.730
I was going to bed for my fatal illness.

402
00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.260
I know I'm the aisle of Elba.
What?
How did I get over here?

403
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:21.880
I wonder if there's any chance of reassembling my army and reconquering the
world

404
00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:26.350
if he had all of that.

405
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:31.960
It's not so clear to me that it would be the wrong thing to say that by Dali.

406
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.390
This is Napoleon.
I mean,

407
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:39.100
it would be totally bizarre.
Things like this don't happen,

408
00:26:39.101 --> 00:26:42.670
but of course we're doing science fiction stories here.
So we'd say to ourselves,

409
00:26:42.671 --> 00:26:47.671
wouldn't somehow Napoleon has been reborn or reincarnated taking over by some

410
00:26:51.691 --> 00:26:56.691
sort of process of possession the body of the former David Smith,

411
00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:01.340
but now it's Napoleon.
I find myself thinking,
you know,

412
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:04.650
maybe that would be the right thing to say.
Yeah.

413
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:17.470
<v 3>Okay.</v>

414
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:22.330
<v 0>All right.
So the,
the,
the,
the,
the thought was,
look,
this guy over here,</v>

415
00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:27.420
David Smith's body with Napoleon's personality,
and let's,

416
00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:28.450
let's be clear about this.

417
00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:33.540
There is no underlying David Smith personality still there to have the counter

418
00:27:33.831 --> 00:27:35.960
example or the example that we're after.
It's,

419
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
it can't be that he's got mixed together memories of growing up in France and

420
00:27:41.051 --> 00:27:45.490
memories of growing up in Detroit.
He never thinks to himself,
I'm David Smith.

421
00:27:45.491 --> 00:27:48.580
How did I become Napoleon?
You got that junk.

422
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.440
You don't have Napoleon's personality.

423
00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.530
He's just gotten a Polina personality through and through.

424
00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:58.780
Well,
the,
the,
the,
the question then was maybe that's not,

425
00:27:58.781 --> 00:28:00.490
so after all,

426
00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:05.170
he doesn't really have Napoleon's experiences.
Did he?

427
00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:09.220
Napoleon had the experience of being crowned emperor,

428
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.850
but this guy didn't have the experience of being crowned emperor.

429
00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:18.030
Maybe what we should say is he thinks he remembers the experience of being

430
00:28:18.461 --> 00:28:22.750
crowned emperor,
but it's a fake memory.

431
00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.470
It's a illusion or a delusion,

432
00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:31.330
but he didn't really have the genuine memory to have the genuine memory.

433
00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:34.870
He has to have been crowned emperor and he wasn't crowned emperor.

434
00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.070
Napoleon was crowned emperor.
Well that's what we could say,

435
00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.220
but we can't say that until we decide.

436
00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:46.180
He's not Napoleon after all,

437
00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:48.220
if the personality theories right,

438
00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:54.300
since he does have all of these memories or semi memories or quasi memories or

439
00:28:56.261 --> 00:29:00.760
whatever we should call them,
if that's the key,

440
00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:04.990
then it needs Napoleon.
So He is remembering being crowned emperor.

441
00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:10.300
If you want to say no,
no,
no.
Those memories are illusions.

442
00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.570
It must be because you don't think he really Napoleon,

443
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:18.160
in which case what you're discovering is you don't really believe the

444
00:29:18.161 --> 00:29:22.000
personality theory.
Why isn't he Napoleon?
It's not his body.

445
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:26.360
You know the body of the Napoleon is not this body and to being a,

446
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:30.460
and you got to have Napoleon's body looked possible position,
right?

447
00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:31.503
That's the,

448
00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:38.340
that's the thought that the body theorists are trying to elicit in you when they

449
00:29:38.681 --> 00:29:42.460
offer these Napoleon ESC counter examples.

450
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.690
You could match the personality as much as you want,

451
00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:50.380
but it's still not Napoleon.
Don't you agree?

452
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:54.460
That's what they say and if you do agree that shows,

453
00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:56.380
you don't really accept the personality theory.

454
00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.170
I'm not going to try to settle this here.

455
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:03.470
You know who should we believe that personality theory or the body theory,

456
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:09.350
I'm trying to invite you to think about the implications and the differences

457
00:30:09.351 --> 00:30:10.490
between these views.

458
00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:14.390
So is to get clear in your own mind about which of these you accept

459
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:20.720
in many moods.
At least when I think about not the simple,

460
00:30:20.721 --> 00:30:23.960
the ordinary David Smith case with a single belief or two,

461
00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.870
but the full bodied has a bad term,

462
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:31.970
the full blown Napoleon case with all the memories,
all the boys,
you know,

463
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.270
suppose David Smith there things I remember,

464
00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.460
I remember,
I can't say it in French accent.
I remember plain,

465
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:45.230
you know as a lad in France buried my little toy Sabre,

466
00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.770
you know,
some memory that Napoleon never wrote down in his diaries.

467
00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:53.720
And we go and we,
when we dig up in in France and there is the saber,
right?

468
00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:57.170
This guy remembers things that Napoleon would remember,

469
00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.290
find myself thinking.
Maybe that's Napoleon.

470
00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.590
Imagine a slightly different version of this case.
Napoleon dies

471
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.910
<v 1>on his death bed,</v>

472
00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:15.780
wakes up in heaven saying

473
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.200
<v 0>juice.
We end up holding on.</v>

474
00:31:18.201 --> 00:31:23.201
I was the emperor Europe up and now I have come to my dude reward.

475
00:31:24.141 --> 00:31:27.870
I am here and have him.
Well,

476
00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:32.010
seems like what we'd want to says.
Yeah,
that's Napoleon
the,

477
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.710
and even if it doesn't have Napoleon's body,

478
00:31:34.711 --> 00:31:37.980
Napoleon's corpse is rotted in France.

479
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.800
God gives Napoleon some new angelic body.

480
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.260
Seems straight forward.
If it's got the polio,
Ian's memories,
beliefs,
desires,

481
00:31:50.261 --> 00:31:54.340
goals and so forth and so on.
When we say it's Napoleon,

482
00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:57.623
<v 1>imagine,</v>

483
00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:02.250
imagine that back to this earth,

484
00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.460
<v 0>this Napoleon type of case happened all the time.</v>

485
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.730
We might have a term for this sort of thing.
Possession.
All right.

486
00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.000
Every now and then people get,

487
00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:19.100
people's bodies get possessed.

488
00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:24.290
They become this other person who's now personality has taken over.

489
00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:30.520
This happened frequently enough instead of just a little science fiction story,

490
00:32:31.011 --> 00:32:35.470
like with the David Smith case,
maybe we'd say,
yeah,
possessions,

491
00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.190
one of these things that need to be explained.
I know.

492
00:32:37.191 --> 00:32:40.160
How is it the personality travels will maybe there'll be some sort of physical

493
00:32:40.161 --> 00:32:43.520
explanation for it
still.

494
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:47.300
Maybe we'd say yet the people had been taken over,
they become somebody else.

495
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:54.290
So speaking,
personally,
I don't find the Napoleon objection.

496
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:59.360
A telling one doesn't give me reason to reject the personality theory,

497
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:06.980
but we can now tweak the worry in a slightly different way.

498
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:09.021
Okay,

499
00:33:09.021 --> 00:33:13.580
so here was Napoleon back in France with his memories and his beliefs and so

500
00:33:13.581 --> 00:33:14.420
forth and so on.

501
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.170
That's bed goes to sleep,
goes unconscious,
whatever it is.

502
00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:26.450
I told you a story in which he wakes up or his personality wakes up,

503
00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.670
whoever we should put it in Michigan.

504
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:34.350
But if it could happen in Michigan,
I suppose it could also happen in New York.

505
00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.270
And if it could happen in New York and it could happen in Michigan,

506
00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:44.630
I suppose it could happen in New York and Michigan.

507
00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:47.723
<v 1>Okay.</v>

508
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:52.990
<v 0>So right now let's imagine two people with Napoleon's personalities,</v>

509
00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:01.580
complete personalities.
One of them in Michigan,

510
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.030
one of them in New York.
Whoa.

511
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:08.090
What should we say now?

512
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.660
What is the personality theory going to say about this case?

513
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:16.810
So I don't know how to draw a personalities very well on the board.

514
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.640
So I'll draw a little stick figures of bodies.

515
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.440
But I mean these to be the personality.
So here we've got,
you know,

516
00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.070
the,
the continuing evolving over time.

517
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:30.590
This is all taking place in France,

518
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.500
the personality of Napoleon in France.

519
00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.490
You know,
there's the deathbed scene

520
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:47.950
now up here we had somebody with Napoleon's personality continuing.

521
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.230
Of course he's going to change.
It's got to evolve.

522
00:34:51.231 --> 00:34:54.980
Just like the actual historical Napoleon kept having new beliefs and new
desires.

523
00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:58.160
If it's really wasn't Napoleon in Michigan Hilton,

524
00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:01.910
he'll start having some new desires and beliefs.
You know about Michigan,

525
00:35:01.911 --> 00:35:04.610
which perhaps Napoleon never gave any thought to it all.
Who knows?

526
00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.510
So this is Michigan over here.

527
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.210
And I said I was willing to entertain the possibility

528
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:20.330
that this is all Napoleon

529
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:23.030
Napoleon.
If you think of it,

530
00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:28.070
the polling is a person extended through space and time according to personality

531
00:35:28.521 --> 00:35:30.770
view.
What makes somebody in the future,

532
00:35:30.771 --> 00:35:35.030
the same person as somebody in the past is if it's part of the same ongoing

533
00:35:35.031 --> 00:35:35.930
personality.

534
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.850
So maybe that's what we got going on in the Michigan case.

535
00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:46.310
Now we imagine now a new version of the worry,

536
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:51.530
somebody with Napoleon's personality over here in New York.

537
00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.930
Now,
if the Michigan guy hadn't been there,

538
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:01.510
but I wouldn't have done,

539
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.760
if I believe in the personality theory or when I believe in the personality

540
00:36:06.761 --> 00:36:07.594
theory and say,
look,

541
00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:12.460
Napoleon reincarnated in New York,

542
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:17.190
that's what the personality theory should say,
and I said,

543
00:36:17.191 --> 00:36:21.570
it doesn't seem like a crazy thing to say if we only had the guy in New York.

544
00:36:21.571 --> 00:36:24.870
Just like it wasn't a crazy thing to say if we only had the guy in Michigan.

545
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.810
The trouble is,
imagine the case

546
00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:34.020
where we've got one guy who's got off Napoleon's personality in Michigan,

547
00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.080
one guy,
he's got all of Napoleon's personality in New York.

548
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.450
Now what should we say?

549
00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:46.990
What are the choices here?
Well,

550
00:36:46.991 --> 00:36:51.991
I suppose one possibility would be to say the guy in New York is Napoleon.

551
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:55.780
The guy in Michigan isn't,

552
00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.440
he's just an insane guy who's gotten Napoleon's personality.

553
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:05.550
You could say that the reason that it seems difficult to say though is because

554
00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:12.230
it seems like it would be just as plausible to say the reverse,
say no,
no,

555
00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:15.250
no,
no.
It's not the New York fellow who's Napoleon.

556
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.720
It's the Michigan Fellow who's Napoleon.

557
00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.290
Well,
we couldn't say that,

558
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:29.710
but the difficulty is there seems to be no good reason to favor the Michigan

559
00:37:31.491 --> 00:37:33.170
fellow over the New York fellow.

560
00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.740
Just like there was no good reason to favor the New York fellow over the

561
00:37:36.741 --> 00:37:41.741
Michigan fellow saying that one of them's Napoleon and the other one isn't.

562
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:45.620
Seems very hard to believe.

563
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:50.900
Well then what's the alternative?
Well,

564
00:37:50.901 --> 00:37:55.600
I suppose another possibility is to say,
well,

565
00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.200
he said other possibility worth mentioning.

566
00:37:59.020 --> 00:37:59.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

567
00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:02.450
<v 0>Is to say they're both Napoleon</v>

568
00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:07.220
somehow bizarrely enough,

569
00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:11.660
Napoleon split in to two,

570
00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:14.160
<v 1>but</v>

571
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.870
<v 0>when splitting into two,
he split into tryign to two bodies,</v>

572
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.080
but they are both Napoleon.

573
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:26.790
Very important to understand how bizarre this proposal would be.

574
00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:27.960
The claim is not.

575
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:33.050
Now we've got to Napoleon's who of course not identical to each other.

576
00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:37.600
No,
no.
We've got a single Napoleon,

577
00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:41.080
I'm Napoleon who was in one place.

578
00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:42.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

579
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:47.400
<v 0>In France and is now simultaneously in two places in the U S</v>

580
00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.850
wow.
That seems very hard to believe it.

581
00:38:56.070 --> 00:39:00.860
It seems to just violate one of our fundamental notions about how people work.

582
00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.240
Metaphysically speaking.

583
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:07.070
People can't be in two places at the same time.

584
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.060
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

585
00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:14.180
<v 0>well maybe that's mythical does that maybe that metaphysical claim I just made</v>

586
00:39:14.181 --> 00:39:18.470
should be abandoned.
Maybe we should say,
oh,
under normal circumstances,

587
00:39:18.471 --> 00:39:20.810
people can't be in two places at the same time.

588
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:25.700
But if you had something like this,
by Golly,
this guy would be Michigan.

589
00:39:25.701 --> 00:39:28.880
Dude is Napoleon and he's the very same person.

590
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.750
That very same person as New York Dude,

591
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:38.420
New York Dude and Michigan Dude are a single person.

592
00:39:38.421 --> 00:39:43.421
Napoleon who is by located doesn't happen.

593
00:39:43.941 --> 00:39:47.480
But if it did happen,
it could happen.
Well maybe that's what we should say.

594
00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:52.130
But again,
all I can tell you is I find that too big a price to pay.

595
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:54.680
People can't.

596
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.610
<v 1>Okay</v>

597
00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:57.240
<v 0>be in two places.</v>

598
00:39:57.570 --> 00:40:02.570
It's one thing to say people are spacetime worms extended through space and

599
00:40:03.121 --> 00:40:04.080
extended through time.

600
00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:09.320
It's another thing to say that they are y shaped spacetime worms seems to

601
00:40:09.331 --> 00:40:13.200
violate one of the fundamental metaphysical things about how people work.

602
00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.940
All right Ma,
I got to remind you,

603
00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:21.230
none of the options here are all that attractive.
So when I say that,

604
00:40:21.231 --> 00:40:21.961
you don't want to say that.

605
00:40:21.961 --> 00:40:24.210
You don't want to say that we're going to run out of possibilities.

606
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:26.880
So maybe this is what you'll want to say.
All right.

607
00:40:26.881 --> 00:40:28.800
Saying that Napoleon is in Michigan,

608
00:40:28.801 --> 00:40:32.130
but not New York doesn't seem very attractive.
Say,
and he's in New York,

609
00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.530
but not Michigan,
doesn't seem very attractive.

610
00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:39.590
Saying he's in both places at the very same time doesn't seem very attractive.

611
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:46.100
But what are the possibilities are there if he's not one but not the other,

612
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:48.290
and if he's not both,

613
00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:53.180
the only other possibility is that he's neither

614
00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.380
given this situation.

615
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:04.500
Neither of these guys is Napoleon.

616
00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:12.270
We've got separate people.

617
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.630
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

618
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:15.860
<v 0>there's the person,</v>

619
00:41:15.861 --> 00:41:20.861
Napoleon spacetime warm that I came to an end in France and there's some,

620
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:22.740
<v 1>okay,</v>

621
00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.870
<v 0>spacetime more.
I'm taking place in Michigan,</v>

622
00:41:24.871 --> 00:41:27.690
so I'm a spacetime person where I'm taking place in New York,

623
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:30.840
but neither of them are Napoleon.

624
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:39.010
That seems to me to be the least on a tractive of the options we've got

625
00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:41.624
available.

626
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.910
But notice that if we save this,

627
00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:51.030
if we say neither of these guys,

628
00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:53.820
despite having Napoleon's personality,

629
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:56.850
neither of these guys is Napoleon,

630
00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:03.960
then the personality theory of personal identity is false.

631
00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:06.250
It's rejected.

632
00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:10.420
We're giving up on it because the personality theory,

633
00:42:10.421 --> 00:42:11.830
after all said,

634
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.990
if you got Napoleon's personality,
you're a Napoleon.

635
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:22.360
But now we've got people that are not in Napoleon,

636
00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.820
but they've gotten Napoleon's personality.

637
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:30.510
So the personality theory follow the personality is wrong if we say neither of

638
00:42:34.871 --> 00:42:37.090
these guys is Napoleon,

639
00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:43.770
but that does seem to be the least unacceptable of the options.

640
00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.770
At least that's how it seems to me.

641
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:52.090
So the personality theories got to be rejected.

642
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:54.520
Now I think that's right.

643
00:42:54.521 --> 00:42:57.490
I think in fact the personality theory got to be rejected,

644
00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:01.840
but that doesn't mean we couldn't revise it.

645
00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:08.010
We could try to change it in a way that keeps much of the spirit of the

646
00:43:09.131 --> 00:43:13.360
personality theory,
but avoids,
you know,

647
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:15.100
some of the problems we've just been looking at.

648
00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:24.310
Here's what I think is the best revision available to fans of the personality

649
00:43:27.951 --> 00:43:31.430
theory
they should say.

650
00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:36.850
We were simplifying unduly.

651
00:43:37.221 --> 00:43:38.840
We were simplifying and getting it wrong.

652
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:42.440
When we said follow the personality,

653
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:46.310
if you got Napoleon's personality,
that's enough to make you Napoleon.

654
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:49.190
That's not true.

655
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:54.790
We need to throw in an extra clause to deal with branching,

656
00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:59.960
splitting cases of this sort that I've just been talking about.

657
00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:05.740
We need to say if there's somebody in the future who's got my personality,

658
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.690
that person is me.

659
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:17.050
As long as there's only one person around in the future who's got my

660
00:44:19.881 --> 00:44:20.750
personality.

661
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:25.220
If you have multiple examples,

662
00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:26.960
duplications,

663
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:31.650
splittings end branchings nobody,

664
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:34.470
none of them is me.

665
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:39.030
So where are the original personality theory said?

666
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:42.990
Same personality.
That's good enough for being the same person.

667
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:48.380
The new version throws in a no competitors clause throws in a no branching

668
00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:56.730
clause.
It says same personalities good enough.

669
00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:01.410
As long as there's no branching.
If there is branching,

670
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.350
neither of the branches is me.

671
00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:11.300
Now if we say that

672
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:16.280
if we throw in the no branching clause,

673
00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.320
then we're able to say,

674
00:45:18.321 --> 00:45:23.321
look in the original story I was telling you where there was the Michigan guy

675
00:45:23.811 --> 00:45:27.110
who hadn't Napoleon's personality but no New York guy,

676
00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:31.100
that really would be Napoleon.

677
00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.173
<v 1>Okay.</v>

678
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:38.670
<v 0>Because it would have the same personality with no competitor.</v>

679
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:44.450
Similarly had we had somebody with Napoleon's personality in New York and nobody

680
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:47.250
with the personality in Michigan,

681
00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:52.940
that guy would have been Napoleon cause we would have had the same personality

682
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.180
with no branching with no competitor.

683
00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:03.440
But in the case where we've got branching where we've got somebody with

684
00:46:03.661 --> 00:46:07.830
Napoleon's personality both in Michigan and New York,

685
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:13.640
that violates the no branching rule and we just have to say nobody's Napoleon in

686
00:46:13.981 --> 00:46:14.814
that case.

687
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:22.100
And I say that seems to me to be the best revision of the personality theory

688
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:26.310
available to to them.

689
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:32.780
So we now need to ask is can we possibly believe that revision?

690
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:39.980
Can we possibly accept the no branching rule?

691
00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:46.070
The no branching rule seems rather bizarre in its own right.

692
00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:55.370
Thinking about the ordinary familiar cases that we try to,

693
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:56.790
we're trying to make sense of.

694
00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:02.740
I am the same person as the person that was lecturing to you last time according

695
00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:06.900
to the personality theory or the revised personality theory.

696
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:12.080
That's because I've got the same personality guy last time thought he was Shelly

697
00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:16.040
Kagan believed he was professor of philosophy.
I think I'm Charlotte Gagan.

698
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:18.030
I believe I'm the professor of philosophy.

699
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:19.860
He's got all sorts of memories of his childhood.

700
00:47:19.861 --> 00:47:22.860
I've got the same memories he's got desires about finishing his book.

701
00:47:22.861 --> 00:47:27.060
I've got those desires about finishing my book.
Same personality.
It's me.

702
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:31.840
That's what the personality theory says.
So I conclude,
hey,
it's me.

703
00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:35.530
I know you were all worried whether I'd survive over the break,
you know,

704
00:47:35.531 --> 00:47:40.360
a couple of days came back.
It's still me.
I made it through Wednesday.

705
00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:42.813
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

706
00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:46.980
<v 0>Or did I,
oh,
perhaps I should ask or did he,</v>

707
00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:52.650
yeah,
there was somebody there on Tuesday and yeah,

708
00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:56.660
there's somebody here on Thursday and yeah,
this person here now,

709
00:47:56.661 --> 00:48:00.090
he's got the same personality as the guy who was there on Tuesday.

710
00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:04.080
But according to the no branching rule,

711
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:09.230
we can't yet conclude that I'm the same person as the person that was lecturing

712
00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.730
to you on Tuesday.

713
00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:17.300
We can't conclude that until we know that there aren't any competitors,

714
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:23.960
but there isn't anybody else right now who also has the same personality.

715
00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:30.720
If I'm the only one around today who's got Shelly Kagan's personality,

716
00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.620
that I'm the same person as the person who was lecturing to you on Tuesday.

717
00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:39.780
But if unbeknownst to me,
and I presume unbeknownst to you,

718
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:44.870
there is somebody in Michigan right now who's got Shelly Kagan's personality,

719
00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:50.730
then we have to say,
Ha,
turns out I'm not Shelly Kagan after all.

720
00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:54.660
Neither is he.
Neither of us are Shelly Kagan.
Shelly Kagan died.

721
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:58.980
So Am I Shelly Kagan or am I not?

722
00:48:58.981 --> 00:49:03.981
Shelly Kagan can't tell until we know what's going on in Michigan.

723
00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:11.190
Whoa.
That seems very,

724
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:16.430
very hard to believe whether I am the same person as the person who was

725
00:49:19.861 --> 00:49:22.230
lecturing to you on Tuesday,

726
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:27.690
presumably should turn on facts about the all that guy who was lecturing to you

727
00:49:27.691 --> 00:49:31.410
on Tuesday and facts about this guy who's lecturing to you today.

728
00:49:31.411 --> 00:49:35.850
On Thursday and maybe some facts about the relationship between that guy and

729
00:49:35.851 --> 00:49:40.230
this guy or that stage and this stage if we prefer to talk about it.

730
00:49:40.231 --> 00:49:45.231
That way we can see how whether it's the same person or not has to turn on the

731
00:49:45.451 --> 00:49:47.430
relations between the stages,

732
00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:53.250
but how could it possibly turn on what's happening in Michigan?

733
00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:58.770
How can whether or not I am the same guy as the guy who was lecturing to you on

734
00:49:58.771 --> 00:50:03.771
Tuesday depend on what's happening in Pennsylvania or Australia or Mars

735
00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:10.560
to you,
some philosophical jargon.

736
00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:19.300
The nature of identity seems like it should depend only on intrinsic facts about

737
00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:26.260
me or perhaps relational facts about the relations between my,

738
00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:33.580
but it shouldn't depend on extrinsic external facts about what's happening

739
00:50:34.851 --> 00:50:36.080
someplace else,

740
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:42.370
but if we accept the no branching rule were saying whether or not we've got

741
00:50:42.861 --> 00:50:47.861
identity depends on what's happening elsewhere with the no branching rule,

742
00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:55.090
identity ceases to be a strictly internal affair.

743
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:58.940
It becomes in part and external affair.

744
00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:04.490
That's very,
very hard to believe,

745
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.510
and if you're not prepared to believe it,

746
00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:12.500
it looks as though you've got to give up on the personality view.

747
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:18.730
Last thought during all of these problems for the personality theorists,

748
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:21.410
the body theorist,

749
00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:25.830
the fans of the body theorist is standing there laughing.
Ha,

750
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:29.960
you pour fools.
Look at all the problems you've got.

751
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.700
Adopting the personality theory,

752
00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:36.080
see how easy it is to duplicate personalities leading to these totally

753
00:51:36.081 --> 00:51:38.120
implausible,
no branching rules.

754
00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:42.470
We can avoid all of that if we become body theorists,

755
00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:47.570
but we'll ask ourselves next time is whether or not the body theorist is in a

756
00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:48.530
better situation.
