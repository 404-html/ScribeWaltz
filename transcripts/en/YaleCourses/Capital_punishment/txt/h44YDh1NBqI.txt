Speaker 1:          00:11          Professor Wireless. Sandy's is a professor of criminal justice at the Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana for a number of years now. She's worked as a part of the capitol jury project and professors. Sandy's thank you so much for joining us. And could I ask you to start by just telling us what the Capitol jury project has been doing and how long it's been doing it?

Speaker 2:          00:35          Sure. Um, thank you for inviting me. I'm, I've been a part of the capitol jury project since it started in 1991. Um, it began with funding from the National Science Foundation at that time, um, and it has continued to receive funding from the National Science Foundation over and three separate occasions. Uh, the project began with 14 separate states being involved in that first phase of the project. Um, and it involved having professors of both law and social science across the countries working together with a core set of questions that we interview, uh, face to face interviews with capitol jurors and the, the interviews chronicle the jurors entire experience with they're having served on a capital case. So from the very first time that they may have heard about the crime to when they were selected for a jury, how they were selected for the jury to the guilt phase, the guilt deliberations, penalty phase, penalty deliberations, and even after the trial, any, you know, experiences that they had. And today in that phase, we've now had interviews with 1,198 or across the country. Um, um, these interviews, as I said, our face to face interviews and they take on average about three and a half to four hours to complete.

Speaker 1:          02:10          And do you interview jurors who have said on both cases where the death penalty was imposed as well as swim life imprisonment was imposed?

Speaker 2:          02:19          Yes. As part of our sampling protocol in each one of the jurisdictions, we, uh, selected samples specifically trying to get equal numbers. Sometimes it's a little bit easier to get one type of case versus the other, but for the most part we ended up with right around 55% who had served on death penalty cases and 45% would serve down life cases.

Speaker 1:          02:42          And you and your colleagues who are academics throughout. And as you said, lawyers, law professors throughout the country have published a number of articles, uh, on what your findings, so Ben from, from these interviews, is that correct?

Speaker 2:          02:57          That is correct. I think there's, you know, some 50 odd articles, uh, probably close to a dozen dissertations at this point. So it's been an ongoing program of research. Yes.

Speaker 1:          03:09          Could you tell us, I mean, if you've done any research on when jurors start making up their mind about punishment and capital cases? Okay,

Speaker 2:          03:19          sure. That was one of the very first articles that colleagues, and I should know that the principal investigator on the project is Professor William Bowers. And one of the first articles that he and I, and I believe it was Ben Steiner, Larry Steiner road, was looking at foreclosed and partiality. And it really became evident to us, um, that the jurors were really making their decisions very early on in the case. And, and what I mean by that is that we ask that your ears at the end of the penalty phase at the, excuse me, by the end, at the end of the guilt phase, before you started the penalty phase, did you then think that the defendant should be given a sentence of death? Do you think they should be given a sentence of life or were you uncertain? And as you can see in the first slide, what we found is that basically 50% of the jurors remained undecided as to what they believe the appropriate penalty should be at that particular time. And additional approximately 30% said that, um, death was the appropriate penalty at that time. And an additional 20% said that they believe that life was the appropriate penalty at that time. And so what that really said to us was that even though we have this bifurcation of proceedings where the guild and penalty phases, they're supposed to be separate, um, while they may be separate physically, psychologically, that's not always the case. And that jurors are really talking about thinking about, um, the penalty long before the penalty phase of the trial

Speaker 1:          04:50          and of course contrary to the instructions so that they receive from the judge, which is not to make up their mind about punishment until after the penalty phase and even then not to make up their mind until after the closing arguments and the instruction of the court. But you're finding that much earlier in the process. Jurists are, are reaching tentative conclusions about the sentence in the case.

Speaker 2:          05:13          Definitely. And I think part of that comes in because of the jury selection process as well. Um, jurors are being asked very early on obviously about their views on the death penalty and the extent to which they could vote for it. And so to all of a sudden come in and start with issues related to the death penalty and then stop and say, okay, now you can't really consider it. Um, Eh, during the guilt phase is really difficult. Um, these are people obviously who for the most part are not trained in the law. Um, they don't necessarily understand the, you know, the differences, the slight little differences of what may be required at different times of the trial and to all of sudden ask for where they stand on the death and their ability to vote or to ability to consider the penalty and then say it's irrelevant I think is a little difficult. When you hear, you know, the evidence presented in the guilt phase,

Speaker 1:          06:08          have you found anything about people's preferences for the duff going into death penalty trials? Um,

Speaker 2:          06:16          well one of the things that we asked all of these jurors, um, was a specific question asking whether they thought that the death penalty was the only acceptable punishment, uh, whether they saw thought it was an acceptable punishment or unacceptable as a punishment for a variety of different kinds of murders. It might be death eligible. And what you can see here in the next slide is, um, we asked specifically, um, what percent of these jurors indicated that they thought that death would be the only acceptable punishment. And for the one question about murder by someone previously convicted of murder, you can see that it's almost 72% of these jurors said, and these are jurors who had served. So they'd been found qualified to serve on a death penalty case. Almost 72% of them said that they thought that death was the only acceptable punishment for a person. Um, previously convicted of murder. Similarly, 57% thought that death was the only acceptable punishment for a planned premeditated murder and the like. And so for many of these jurors, um, what you're seeing is that death is seen as really the only acceptable punishment for several of the kinds of crimes that are death eligible and end up being these capital cases.

Speaker 1:          07:31          And these are jurors who said, who actually served. So the jury selection process did not identify these people as being biased in favor of the death pump, even though they clearly were.

Speaker 2:          07:44          Yes. I mean, these were all jurors who had actually served on capital cases. They clearly had made it through the death qualification, life qualification process. Um, one of the things that we've done also is to look a little bit more at some of the, the questioning of jurors in capital cases. And this has been done more recently focus primarily actually in Kentucky. Um, where we did a slight little variation where we asked an additional question trying to look at the Morgan type question and whether somebody could consider a sentence of life.

Speaker 1:          08:20          Let me just interrupt you there for a second. For the four, are those watching and Morgan, you mean Morgan Versus Illinois? The case that said a person could be disqualified if they felt so strongly in favor of the death penalty that they couldn't fairly consider life imprisonment.

Speaker 2:          08:38          Correct. That that's Morgan. I was referring to. Thank you. Thank you. And um, when we asked the jurors that one of the things that we did in Kentucky was to look at their responses to that kind of general question. And then what we did was to compare it to the actual, they're descriptions of how they made their decisions. And what you find is that there's a disconnect that you're sometimes believe that they could be fair. You know, it could be fair, they could be impartial, they would not be, you know, they would not necessarily just vote for death. At least that's how they see it at the outset. And yet part of it is once they are exposed to some of the facts of the cases, what you find is that they are incapable of considering anything other than a sentence of death. And so we're looking at these differences in terms of at the outset, these traditional automatic death penalty voters, people who juring jury selection.

Speaker 2:          09:33          You could ask and somebody could consider and they could think about it and be very honest and sincere in their responses. But to the extent that attorneys are not allowed to ask pretty expansive kinds of questions, jurors aren't necessarily don't know what kinds of situations they may be faced with. And so they can say very honestly, during jury selection, of course I could consider a variety of different penalties. And yet when they are exposed to the particulars of the facts of these capital cases, they realize that death might be the only acceptable punishment that they can see.

Speaker 1:          10:09          Let me ask you this. Have you looked into jury instructions? Lawyers think jury instructions are important, but one sitting in a courtroom kind of wonders if anybody understands the jury instructions. Uh, have you looked into that?

Speaker 2:          10:21          That is one of the other areas that we've addressed as part of the Capitol jury project. And one of the professors who was involved in the initial phases of the jury project was, um, and then by the name of Professor James Logan Buell, who had done some work in North Carolina, um, looking at instructions in capital cases. And so we ended up adopting some of his questions, which was really basically looking at how jurors understand whether they have to be unanimous on mitigation and the like. Um, and as you can see in this next slide, um, what we have here is that, uh, almost, you know, 45%, 44.6% of the jurors fail to understand that they can consider anything in mitigation. And this is going to the average across all states. A 66.5% did not know that they did not have to be unanimous on mitigation. Um,

Speaker 1:          11:20          let me just back up there and just say, the Supreme Court has held that jurors do not have to be unanimous on mitigation, that any juror can say, I think it's a mitigating factor even though the other 11 or two can say that. And the other 10, uh, each juror makes an individual decision and do not have to be unanimous on mitigation. You're telling me that jurors don't understand that?

Speaker 2:          11:44          Definitely not. We had almost two thirds of the jurors indicated as much. Um, we also had almost a half, 49% of the jurors said that they did not know that mitigations did not need to be found beyond reasonable doubt. They come in and believe in that that's the standard. Um, and less, but still almost a third were unaware of the fact that aggravators had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. And so there's a pretty consistent pattern here of jurors not being able to understand the instructions. But there's, there's also been a lot of additional research outside of the Capitol Jury Project that I think speaks to this issue as well, which is, you know, research done. A lot of it has been done on college campuses and looking at ways in which you might be able to increase comprehension. It's one thing to say that jurors don't understand the instructions.

Speaker 2:          12:33          It's another thing to say, well, is it possible to improve the comprehension of the instructions? And there've been two sort of different types of programs of research done in this area. One is, uh, working with linguists, so having lawyers and judges and everybody, you know, all parties involved work with a linguist and other social scientists to try to rework the instructions in a way that obviously is keeping to the legal requirements, but also making them more understandable. And what you can find under those circumstances is you can't improve the comprehension. Um, there are studies that have found comprehension improved up to, you know, 70 some I think there was one that was over 90% of comprehension. So, so that is possible. There's also been another avenue of research. Um, that has done the same thing in some respect, but instead of just asking these kinds of questions, which I think are really important and indicative of comprehension, this other avenue has presented people with, um, these vignettes.

Speaker 2:          13:38          So instead of just saying, can they sort of understand the particular instruction, are they applying it correctly? So for example, you could give a vignette of, you know, two to three sentences of a jury. Um, is dis, you know, was discussing mitigation. One of the jurors believes that the person's history of child abuse was a mitigator. The 11 other jurors do not agree with that. They therefore do not discuss, uh, the defendant's child abuse has, has the jury operated in accordance with the law. So it's a way to test not just comprehension, but the application, which really is what's critical here as well.

Speaker 1:          14:23          So we may be putting a little more trust in juries, uh, then perhaps we should, in terms of how well they understand, uh, what's going on in terms of the biases they bring into the process. Um, is that what you're finding?

Speaker 2:          14:39          You know, I, I'm a firm believer in, I think that jurors do the best that they can, but I think there's a lot more that the courts could do to help them. Um, I think that by not explaining the instructions or perhaps not writing the instructions in a way that's really conducive to two jurors, I think is really doing a disservice. I think. I think there are steps that could be taken, um, that would help the process. So I think jurors like anybody who's going to come in with certain biases. Um, and I think the benefit or the potential benefit is to be able to explain to them how those biases operating to sort of help them and be able to determine, allow the attorneys to determine whether there's such expansive kinds of biases that this would really impact the fairness of the trial. Or is it through the process of instructions where you could try to guide the jurors in ways that they can really understand what is being asked of them under these circumstances.

Speaker 1:          15:43          And do you have any sense of the extent to which courts are trying to do that? I mean our summon a state trying to do it or other national efforts to try to make jury instructions easier to understand and to apply or do you know,

Speaker 2:          15:59          you know, you hear periodically of different jurisdictions where they have really attempted to improve the instructions. Um, I think, um, I I know that here in Indiana there, you know, have tried to improve instructions. I know in other jurisdictions, I know more recently, um, I believe it's in Massachusetts, they've really looked at eyewitness testimony, obviously not capital cases, but the different jurisdictions have really, you know, our, our beginning, they've done understood I think for quite some time, but there's some jurisdictions and some judges I would say who are more likely to take the lead. Um, there's the center for jury studies that has been doing a little bit of work in this area as well. Um, and I, so I don't know of one state where I could say to you, you know, this is a state that has really done a lot to improve their instructions.

Speaker 2:          16:50          Um, I think where, and I've heard of instructions being changed. Oftentimes, I don't know that there are these kinds of studies that I'm talking about that occur at the outset. I think what ends up happening is that they go in and the committees will revise the instructions and you know, they'll probably be improved. Um, but then you'll have a social scientists going after and test it and say, well, wait a second. You know, your comprehension may have improved from 40% to 60%. Um, is that enough? Are there ways that we could have improved it even more? So? I'm not familiar. There may be, but I'm not familiar with jurisdictions that have really adopted that kind of model.

Speaker 1:          17:30          So what do we know for sure is that this is certainly something that needs to be done. If jurors are going to be able to do their job the way they're supposed to.

Speaker 2:          17:40          I believe that. Yes. And you know, one of the things that I, I've looked at independent of these kinds of studies that I've just talked about, is trying to, why is it that the jurors do not understand the instructions? Um, I can tell you that anytime I've read an instruction, I'm confused. I inevitably call a lawyer and say, what exactly do they mean by this? There are many different ways in which the instructions could be misinterpreted. And so one of the things that I did just one day decided I would just run through the instructions. Um, I was giving a talk in Kentucky and decided that I would run the instructions through word and see what word would tell us was the comprehension level and the level of understanding for that. And if you've ever written an article or you know any kind of paper and word you can ask it to just tell you what the level is, the grade level of the, the document.

Speaker 2:          18:36          Um, as anybody on a university campus, when you submit materials for conducting research, oftentimes when they're being reviewed, they say you should, you know, be writing them at a certain grade level. And so I decided to sort of throw those through a, read them through word. Um, and you can see on this next slide that I just took the actual quotes from word. When they say this, these are the tests that they run and they have the flesh reading ease, which you know, goes from zero to 100. It's a hundred point scale and they, their target, there's from 60 to 70, and then they have the grade level index, which is just our standard grade level. You know, if you, and they say we recommend that you should be writing your document documents at a seventh to eighth grade level. And so when I ran some of these instructions through from Kentucky and all I did was take their pattern instructions, um, and I, I tried to make them as simple as possible.

Speaker 2:          19:32          So I only had one, let's say aggravating circumstance, one mitigating circumstance and tried to make them pretty straight forward. Um, whichever ones they were listed, but just try to make it pretty direct. Um, and you'll see here the first, um, even so says instruction too, but here's one that's looking at mitigating circumstances. And when I read, you know, conducted the head were run the readability statistics. You can see that the flesh reading e so that's the one from the scale from you know, a hundred point scale that was at 42 that's supposed to be, they suggest words as it should be between 60 and 70 and the grade level was 14.2 so you're talking about at least a sophomore level of college that you're expecting for your jurors. When you look at aggravating circumstances, the ease level goes down a little 30.8 but the grade level also goes down a little.

Speaker 2:          20:26          So it's more difficult to re to re. Um, but it's also a little bit more understanding, greater understanding of the grade level. Only need a high school education, but it's that last one that gets me in Kentucky where you'd look at your authorized sentences. Um, and again, this is just the pattern and the test results. They're reading it ease is 15.7 on a hundred point scale. That's supposed to be between 60 and 70. And the grade level is 23.8. And so it's beyond college. It's a beyond a phd. It's a phd and a JD. I mean it's, it's a really, as you might imagine, a really high threshold to expect jurors to be able to understand what's being asked of them. And so to me it's no great surprise that they may revert back to what they think is the right way, but what they think oftentimes may not be, especially when we are talking about issues related to mitigation, because I think what happens is jurors come into court with this understanding of your, you have 12 jurors. It has to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt and everybody has to agree, well that may be true for your standard case. It may be true for the guilt phase, it may be true for your aggravators, but it's not true for your mitigators. And so if jurors don't understand that and they're not told that in a way that they can understand it, they may be dismissing very compelling mitigation because they think they cannot really consider it.

Speaker 1:          22:05          Sandy, this is a fascinating information. It gives us an awful lot to think about and I am most grateful to you for sharing your knowledge and your time with us here.

Speaker 2:          22:16          It's been my pleasure. Thank you very much.
