Speaker 1:          00:12          Victim impact evidence. One of the more controversial areas of capital punishment at the penalty phase of a capital trial. The prosecution can in most states, put on evidence from the victim's family or members of the community to talk about what the impact on the community has been. And on the survivors, the supreme court first said in booth versus Maryland that this evidence was not admissible, but just a short time later after a change in some members of the court held in Payne versus Tennessee, that such evidence was admissible. And now in almost all the states that have the death penalty, victim impact evidence is admissible. I've asked five students from Yale law school to come here and discuss the various aspects of victim impact evidence, uh, with us today. I want to introduce Megan walked suppressed who is from Chicago, who's with us as well as Emma Kaufman from Carlisle, Pennsylvania to my immediate right is Jamil Giovanni from, uh, Toronto, uh, to my left if familiar, Morgan from Los Angeles. Uh, and finally Virginia, uh, mccline bit who was from Iowa. So, uh, I want to thank all of them, uh, for joining us here today to talk about this subject. And Jamil, let me just start with you. What is, what, what is the victim impact evidence? What does the jury do with it?

Speaker 2:          01:32          Well, the jury's going to use that information to sort of get the full picture of the, the harm caused by the crime in particular, the impact on the family, whether it's financial, emotional, psychological, um, trying to get a larger picture of what happened as a result of the crime committed by the defendant. And

Speaker 1:          01:51          what does the dream do with that? I mean, how does it weigh it? It's deciding it's got aggravating circumstances, mitigating circumstances. What is, so what does it do with it?

Speaker 2:          01:59          I mean, I think theoretically it goes to the jury's understanding of the victim who was lost and the extent of the harm committed. So it gives the jury a better sense of who it was that was affected by the crime, which goes to the gravity of the crime. Megan, do you have any different, well, I think it also serves a purpose within the courtroom for the victims themselves. I mean it's introduced after the Mig or alongside the mitigating evidence stage in which you get a much fuller picture of the defendant's life and why they're deserving of the jury sympathy. And so it feels like a way of counteracting that vision of the defendant in defense of the perceived harm by the victim and the victim's family shooting

Speaker 1:          02:37          part of why this evidence is admissible, the balance out, the mitigating evidence about the defendant with the seven and it's about the person whose life was taken.

Speaker 2:          02:46          Um, I mean I think that's theoretically one of the rationales for it, again, to get a full, a full picture of the crime. Um, I think a lot of people would say that that is prejudicial that in, um, in the penalty phase looking at

Speaker 3:          03:00          the defendant and it's about that person and their life and so extra information about the, uh, the victim just serves to confuse what's happening in the courtroom.

Speaker 1:          03:09          Collaborate on that just a little bit. Are you saying maybe the seven it should be admitted or, or it should be. One of the questions we have of course is not only if it's going to be admitted, which the Supreme Court has pretty much decided, but the scope of the evidence once it comes in, how much, how much evidence is going to be allowed.

Speaker 3:          03:25          Right? Yeah. I think, I think you have to be very careful about how the evidence is presented. And so, um, because it can have extraordinarily prejudicial effects for the defendant. And I think that, um, often, I mean, when you're looking at a capital case, you're always going to be dealing with someone who's, who's died. Like there's always going to be someone who's Dad. And so, um, that's obviously hugely harmful for the community. But when you, when you bring in all of these people who aren't, who are talking about their loss, there's a risk that the defendant isn't going to get a fair trial.

Speaker 1:          03:54          Do you remember what are, what are your thoughts about this in terms of it is a fair trial risk by this cause this evidence be too emotional or, uh, what, what's your take on it?

Speaker 4:          04:04          Yeah, absolutely. I think there's a, there's a risk at hand here when you have people kind of pulling at the heartstrings of a jury. Uh, they might make decisions that are more motivated by emotional appeal as opposed to fairness or as opposed to what is the kind of reasonable application of the law. Uh, but ultimately, uh, I think there's the, the, the important thing is the restorative aspect that I think it can give to victims and making sure they get to play a part in the, in the, in the trial and making sure that their, their, uh, their experience through the crime is being weighed by people and that they are some fairness to their process and some closure for them as well

Speaker 1:          04:39          before we're done to scope. I mean, is there anybody that thinks this evidence just shouldn't be admitted that the court got it wrong and, and, and Payne versus Tennessee? Emma?

Speaker 2:          04:47          Yeah. I think it's, I think justice Stevens wrote in his dissent to the opinion that allowed it in that we're just entering unchartered sees of irrelevance. I think that was how he put it. My impression is that what you're supposed to be thinking about during the penalty phase of a capital trial is the defendant's crime and whether or not the defendant's life has mitigating aspects to the sentence, right. So I just think we're going beyond the scope entirely of what is at issue in the penalty phase, Megan. Well, I think that there's a, there's a real risk that it sets the jury up to believe that the only way to do proper or to properly honor the life of the victim and, and to show respect for the victim is to give the death penalty when that those two, whether or not to choose death for the defendant and whether or not one honors and appreciates the loss of the victim seem to be two different determinations that get conflated or confused by the admission of victim impact statements and evidence.

Speaker 1:          05:46          Let's spend just a moment. I'm talking about the scope, uh, of this evidence. Some courts have allowed just very brief statements being made by, uh, witnesses about the person, uh, who's no longer in large to the victim of the crime. Uh, others have allowed a very elaborate even characterizations of the crime, the family talking about what punishment they want imposed a in the materials we cite to justice Stevens, a descending opinion. And in one case in which you put a videotape, uh, on the website, uh, with regard to a 20 minute videotape, a about a person, is there any limit to, is there any limit to this evidence?

Speaker 5:          06:24          Well, I think that's part of the problem that was wrong with sort of the pain decision in general. The court didn't really set any standards or guidance for courts to um, applying, deciding what should be the scope of this evidence. And so now you have cases where there's video tapes, maybe 40 minutes long, extremely long composition by Enya or something along those lines where it's, the evidence is extremely emotionally evocative. And so there's really an issue I would say with scope and the courts haven't really across the board I'm found a sufficient way of sort of challenging this type of evidence and ensuring that there's not disparities between courtrooms and defendants given the quality of the victim impact evidence that's presented. And certainly January she stayed too

Speaker 1:          07:04          taking different approaches. I mean some states like Oklahoma is allowed all sorts of evidence to come in, whereas Georgia requires a hearing before where the witnesses testify and only very limited presentations.

Speaker 3:          07:16          Right. And I think, I think that again gets to the problem with, um, the death penalty being arbitrary and capricious as administered in different states. That if you are going to allow this kind of evidence, and I think it has to be, um, pretty severely constrained in terms of what you can offer. Um, and I think it's, it's just really difficult because as Megan said, it's, um, you know, it's, it's something for the victim and their family to be able to express the grief at the loss. And, um, but that's really not, and that's, that's something that needs to happen. It's just not clear to me that where that needs to happen is that the penalty phase of a capital trial when the issue was really the individual defendant and their individual sentence and they're being prosecuted by the state for what they did that was contrary to the laws of the state. And so it's hard because I think you have to draw a pretty fine distinction between what the purpose of the penalty phases and even though part of it is honoring the loss of the victim and their family, that's, that's really not the main purpose,

Speaker 1:          08:07          Chris, to the quality of this evidence is going to vary some depending upon how articulate the members of the victim's family or you may have people from a prominent family may have someone who has no family at all. So there's no one to testify. Uh, Justice Betterman the Georgia Supreme Court Express some concern, uh, about, uh, two classes of victims are, are we concerned about that journal?

Speaker 4:          08:27          Uh, well I think we're concerned about that. And so far as there are inequalities and disparities in American society and so you're going to have different levels of education, diff, how different degrees in which people can be eloquent and articulate their experience through a crime and the impact is left on them and their families. I don't think that a trial is where we necessarily need to be concerned, uh, about trying to equalize this. People are going to, we are being, we're essentially asking us are we going to make a qualitative decision about how well we think someone communicates, articulates. And I don't think that's really the goal here. The goal is to create an opportunity for people who have been affected to speak about how they've been affected. I think there's a great point I believe made by Justice Scalia where he talks about how there's going to be differences between one defense attorney, another. There's going to be different than the one prosecutor and other, there's always going to be these qualitative differences in how well someone can be articulate and how all they can be an advocate. And I think that, um, you know, we should, that's a natural part of the, the legal system and uh, we, I don't think being too preoccupied with that is really the, the point here that every victim is going to come from a different angle with different things to say and we need to respect and honor that can come in different forms.

Speaker 1:          09:36          So say this is just the vagaries of the system in any crime, it may be that the witnesses or articulate or not witnesses to testify the lawyers may be a of different

Speaker 4:          09:46          quality and so forth, comfortable with those kinds of inequalities that I think that's a conversation we need to be having our school large and our, yeah, and our larger social issues and not, not when it comes to a trial,

Speaker 2:          09:56          Emma, I mean I agree with Jamil that we need to be having a broader conversation about embedded inequalities. But it seems to me that if the goal in sentencing is to determine what's appropriate for the crime that was done, that there's something wrong with a hierarchy of victim hood in which those people who know more people who are more eloquent, who are more well connected, are going to have more of an emotional impact on a jury than those people who aren't. Right. Ultimately, the impression you're giving is that murdering someone who is more prominent in society is more problematic or more offensive than murdering someone who doesn't have family members to come testify on their behalf. Anyone else want to comment on that, Megan? Oh, well I think that there's some worry, some intersections with, for example, the results in McCleskey v Camp of the empirical study of, of when the death penalty is granted. And so you,

Speaker 1:          10:48          right, and in that case you're talking about, just so everybody knows what we're talking about, the case racial discrimination and the racial disparities and the Dustin,

Speaker 2:          10:55          right. So, yeah, so through very extensive empirical work, they found that the way to increase the likelihood of receiving the death penalty is basically to be an African American individual whom earners a white individual and, and the way in which that the kinds of effects of what lives are considered valuable and what lives are considered the death of which people is considered a particularly heinous crime. I think given the broader structural problems our society has intersect with real in really uncomfortable ways with a face frame, uh, phase of the trial devoted to measuring the severity of that impact. Well, back to my earlier question about the scope of this. What, what should the scope be? I mean, should we allow, I mean, uh, extensive testimony with these video tapes and so forth or, or, or is there a principle way to decide how much evidence to allow? I think that's a very difficult question. I don't think that there have been many courts that have really addressed that head on.

Speaker 5:          11:53          But I do think that I agree somewhat with the purse a bar as relates to the victim impact videos. I think it's very hard to sort of standardize the quality of victim, um, videos as technology advances, as there's differences in resources. Um, and I also think that the, uh, approach adopted by the Georgia Supreme Court, I believe, um, to go through written testimonies and allow victims to present their testimony through a written statement, but then go through an excise those parts that are maybe very prejudicial towards a defendant referring to the defendant, let's say in a disparaging way. Keeping the focus on impact might be one way of channeling, um, the evidence that's presented to the court and trying to keep away a testimony that might unduly inflame the jury. So I do believe that statement should play a role. Um, but victim impact videos, I don't think that there's a, a principled way of channeling those types of videos and perhaps outside of maybe a hard time limit, but then you still couldn't really control the quality. Um, so I would say that's probably one approach

Speaker 1:          12:50          for any of those videos are, are, are quite often admitted and are pretty much standard, uh, practice, uh, in that state. The Supreme Court really has been looked at this since the time of pain, which in which the, at least just so Connor said, this was a brief glimpse at the victim's life, but at least we see in some states now, it's a much more elaborate a glimpse than just a, a brief claps.

Speaker 2:          13:14          Jenny. Yeah, I really agree with what Julia said, that it's, um, I think to the extent that you're going to allow it, it has to be fairly circumscribed and controlled. Um, and I think the court should know in advance what's going to be stuck said. And essentially the only way to do that is through a written statement. I think that again, these victims and their families have had hugely traumatic experiences and I just, it's um, if you, if you got into a situation where someone said something that was the court eventually said was more prejudicial than probative or whatever, it's just, it's very hard for, um, it's very easy for just one comment to tape taint the whole, the whole trial or the whole penalty phase. And so, um, definitely I think the videos are really problematic, especially with, you know, the soft music in the background and it's just, it's really, I mean, these are very moving things and they should be, it's just, I don't think that they belong in the courtroom

Speaker 1:          14:06          in, in one of the cases it's in the materials George Battles case, uh, the prison guards, this was a fellow who was accused and convicted of killing a prison guard at the penitentiary in Atlanta and guards testified at the penalty phase that, uh, it would be bad for morale if battle was not given the duck pond good for morale if he was given the death penalty. Uh, should that type

Speaker 2:          14:31          of evidence be admitted, Megan? Well, that gets a little bit trickier because there are all ready provisions within our criminal laws that make the severity of punishment associated with killing a public officer such as a policeman, a higher of a, the penalty is higher than to kill an ordinary citizen. Um, in part because of the criminal justice system is meant to be the action of the state against the individual and the collective against the individual rather than just the victim against the defendant. And so in the, for me, the trickiness in that case is because they're making an appeal to the broader social or institutional effects of the crime and they're basically saying this impedes our ability to carry out a public service in the same way that the death of a police officer impedes the ability of police officers to carry out a public service. And so while I would find such, I mean I'm uncomfortable with the admission of that testimony. I think it does push up against this larger contrast between who exactly is pursuing the defendant and the trial and who, whose justice are we seeking the victims or the states in a, in a way that perhaps the, the more personalized victim impact statements don't, they don't, they don't push up against the public function of the trial. In the same way,

Speaker 1:          15:54          the fact that the victim was a police officer or was a, a guard at a prison is often an aggravating circumstance. So that's already in the mix there. But then the question becomes, can members of the police department members of the, uh, the guards a group at the prison, can they say this will affect our morale if, if, if, uh, or, or you will show your support for the police? Uh, if you give the death polling in this particular case, Emma,

Speaker 2:          16:25          I would think not right. I would think that was extremely prejudicial. Um, and the question that raises for me, if we're going to admit it, is why then it wouldn't mean that we're also admitting testimony from the family members of the person who's going to be executed about the potential effects of the execution on the family. Cause that's another class of prospective victims here that we don't talk about very much. And that kind of testimony doesn't come in very much, but there are cases in which people say, you know, you're going to execute my father that will have long term effects on me. So should we be letting that and if we're going to be letting in police officer's saying, this will perspectively affect my morale in a certain way.

Speaker 1:          17:03          What was his defense lawyer to do? What, what let's say hypothetically, what if they're negative, uh, characteristics? Uh, of the, let's say the person who was the victim and the crime was actually somebody who may have been involved in illegal activities or may have done other things that would not reflect favorably on them. Is that going to be introduced as part of this evidence? Jenny?

Speaker 2:          17:27          So, so I think that's one of the reasons that I find victim impact evidence so problematic is because the 14th amendment guarantees the right to due process and a big portion of what our country believes that due processes is adversarial testing. And there's just no way that you can really attack the credibility of a victim in this case because the person, I mean, the person has died, they've been the victim of a, of a horrible

Speaker 3:          17:50          crime. And so I don't think that if, if I were a defense lawyer, I would feel, um, that it was extraordinarily risky to try and attack that kind of evidence. I think very quickly you're going to look, um, petty or like you're playing games or like you're not respecting the fact that this is a horrible loss and so, and it is a horrible loss and that should be respected. And so, um, I don't think there's any way to effectively cross examine the testimony. I don't think, I don't, yeah, I just, I don't think it can be subjected to the kind of adversarial testing that we think is essential to due process.

Speaker 1:          18:19          So if you're the defense lawyer, you're probably, even if you know that not going to put that evidence on right. Am I right?

Speaker 3:          18:26          Yeah, that seems like an impossible choice. I would, I would think you would always choose no.

Speaker 1:          18:30          Right. So that was one of the concerns. Justice Powell had a course in the booth case was that, uh, the really may not be much back and forth with regard to this kind of evidence. Well. Any final thoughts that anyone wants to, uh, sure, sure.

Speaker 4:          18:47          Yeah. Uh, you going back to the previous question, we're talking about crimes happening in a social context and I often think about the case being brought against George Zimmerman about the death of Trayvon Martin. And think about the importance of a victim impact evidence being brought into that trial as it goes on. And the need to make sure that the voices of people who have been affected by the death of this young man are going to be heard. And I think that that's an example that I think challenges some of our assumptions about who is the defendant and who is a victim. And in this situation, I think that there is a lot of justice that can be given to communities, young people, uh, black communities that have been denied justice for long periods of time by letting their voice and their, their experience be part of this trial. And I think that's an example where I think we're going to see, uh, Vic, if we see victim impact evidence abroad into that trial, I think we're going to see a, a lot of, um, a lot of people who've been denied justice in the past feel like the America, the, the criminal justice system in America is starting to do them a favor a or work in their favor I should say. Um, and I, I look forward to seeing the conversations around that.

Speaker 1:          19:55          Of course, that's a very high profile case. What about the day to day case?

Speaker 5:          20:00          I mean, in cases that we don't hear about on the national news and, and, and, and there were just what's going on in communities all across the country. I think that victim impact evidence introduces or perhaps exacerbate some structural disparities that we already have existing within our criminal justice system around access to counsel and competent counsel. Perhaps counsel notes that the victim impact evidence will be prejudicial, but it doesn't raise that objection in the trial. And so now we have individuals sentenced to death because of the quality of victim impact evidence. Um, and that I think is an impermissible risk and that's something that we worry about when we are imposing the death penalty to the extent that the society continues to do so. And so, although I agree with Jamil on incorporating the views and perspectives of the community and ensuring their voice, the voice of the victims in this process, I think we have to be very concerned about how we

Speaker 2:          20:48          are embedding within to the process. I'm more structural disparities that we as a society have not decided to rectify. Jenny, would you add anything to that? Um, I would just add I agree with Jimmy Earl. I think his point is well taken, but I think that we need to be really careful and remember that in individual trials we still have an individual system of adjudication. Ultimately it's about the individual who committed the crime allegedly. And um, and you know, what happened around that. So I think that cultural context is important, but I think that we can't allow that to get it get in the way of the individual defendant having a fair trial. Um, and there might be other contexts where it's more appropriate to have those conversations, which are essential, but maybe not at the penalty phase of a capital trial.

Speaker 1:          21:30          Chris, most people on death row are there for crimes against white people, overwhelmingly even in states that have large African American populations, Georgia for example, 80% of the people on death row there for murder. So of white people. Uh, does that, is that a factor or Emma?

Speaker 2:          21:46          Yeah, I mean I think, I think the things we're getting at here today in Jameel's comments and in these facts about race are that these are much broader structural issues, right? And there's a desire, I think in what you're talking about for a more restorative model of dealing with a crime and for a more restorative model of dealing with the history of racism in the United States. Right? We want to have a bigger conversation about where this country is and it gets condensed into the penalty phase of a capital murder trial, which feels like an odd place to do justice to pat to the past or to racial injustice. Um, but yeah, I think if you start to look at the numbers, you start to look at jury composition and people of color being excluded from juries. You start to look at the McClaskey study and the number of people who are being convicted solely because the aggravating factor is that they are African American. You start to just have fundamental questions about whether we're really talking about a justice system

Speaker 1:          22:38          and if this larger conversation isn't going on or doesn't come to some resolution, which seems like it's been going on for centuries. Uh, what do we do with the individual case, Megan? Oh Wow.

Speaker 2:          22:50          Huh.

Speaker 6:          22:51          MMM.

Speaker 2:          22:55          I think that we, we very much lead a space or some kind of social recognition of the harm associated with murder. Um, that, uh, a lot of what Virginia has been saying about the deep need for victim's families to, to gain public appreciation for their, for their suffering.

Speaker 6:          23:20          Okay.

Speaker 2:          23:21          But it doesn't fit into the adversarial trial. It doesn't, it's not fair to any individual defendant to compress all of those wide variety of issues into the penalty phase. And so in, I mean, in the meantime I suppose my preferred solution is to exclude most of this evidence absent maybe some written statements but also to work on developing forms of restorative justice or alternative procedures that don't determine whether a person lives or dies, but nevertheless provide this opportunity for social recognition of the arm. The very profound harm that has happened in any death penalty case.

Speaker 1:          24:04          Well is this discussion is brought out, this is a credibly a contentious issue and there is questions about who should it come in at all, what's the limit? We've just touched on some of those things. We could talk about him a lot longer. Uh, but uh, this is how long we'll talk about them today. I want to thank everyone for coming and being a part of this discussion and I hope that it's helpful as we think through this question, uh, because eventually the supreme court probably will look at this question again and decide some of these things we've talked about particularly about the scope, uh, or that by that I mean what evidence is going to be admitted. Uh, how extensive, it can be characterizations the sort of opinions like in the battle case that we discussed. So thank you all very much, uh, most grateful to you for your contributions to our discussion.
