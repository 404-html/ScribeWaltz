Speaker 1:          00:11          Our guest is Steve Singer, who's a professor at the university. Uh, ally Ola University College of law. Steve Singer graduated from Harvard law school, went to the public defender service in the district of Columbia where he was a public defender, uh, for a number of years, and then went to Louisiana where he joined the Louisiana capital assistance project. And for four or five years, excuse me, was doing capital cases in Louisiana. Uh, he went to the law school, but then when Katrina hit in 2005, uh, took a leave of absence and went to, uh, build a new public defender office in New Orleans. And I want to talk with Steve Today, uh, about both the building, if that public defender office and capital, uh, representation, uh, in Louisiana. Steve, thanks for joining us. My pleasure. Would you just describe to us what was the representation for poor people accused of crimes? Like in New Orleans, Orleans parish, the city of New Orleans, uh, before Hurricane Katrina hit the city in 2005.

Speaker 2:          01:17          Um, well, what you had was, um, and I, I'm originally from Chicago and what you had is what I would describe as a very classic patronage system. Um, the judges ran the public defender's office. They didn't do it directly. They were the local criminal court judges appointed a board, um, of like three to five to seven members who then ran, who then ran up the indigent defender office. But the board members were selected by the judges and they were basically private criminal defense lawyers who were friends with the judges and contributed to their campaigns, their judicial campaigns, and got other people to contribute to their judicial campaigns. And so then they were on the board and they were then able to hire their friends and the judges friends as public defenders, um, and the indigent defense system, if you were to defy, devise a system, um, um, that was set basically to screw the clients.

Speaker 2:          02:18          That's what you had. What you had was you had public defenders who were part time and on salary. So they were part time in the sense that they had, they had private criminal defense practices and then they had a part time, salaried position as a public defender. And what you'd have is one or you'd have like two or two to four public defenders assigned per judge per courtroom. And they would split it up whatever they, the way they negotiated with their judge. So you might have one lawyer take Mondays and Wednesdays, the other wire take Tuesdays and Thursdays and then maybe they'd alternate Fridays or they do a system where they'd have one, they'd be on one week as a public defender and then they'd be off for two weeks and the next public defender would take the next week and then the next week. Um, and what that meant for the clients was since you, since they were on salary, it didn't matter whether they spent two hours or two minutes on a case, they got paid the same.

Speaker 2:          03:17          So obviously the financial incentive was to spend as little time as possible on your indigent public defender cases so that you could spend more time on your private pain cases. Um, and so this obviously worked to the great detriment of the clients because they got as little time as possible. Um, and, and one of the things you have to say about the lawyers is some of these lawyers were, they're not, they weren't necessarily bad people, but they were stuck in a really bad system because at the time, for example, New Orleans, the public school system was terrible. So if you give, if you give a person a choice while you can spend the right amount, you can spend more time on this criminal, on this public defender indigent case, or you can spend less time of it and you can earn some more money and send your kids to private school to a good, decent school and get your kids a decent education. Well, that's no kind of choice at all, obviously for people. Um, so it wasn't necessarily that the individual lawyers were bad people, but they were stuck in a system that really was set up to make sure that as little time as possible with spent on indigent defense client.

Speaker 1:          04:25          And what kind of support did they have in terms of office space and investigators and other things that are deemed pretty essential to representing people accused of crimes?

Speaker 2:          04:35          They had nothing because remember, it's a patronage system. And so when a patronage system, any money, any, any sick, any, every penny that goes somewhere other than to a person is wasted money. Because when you spend money on people, they then can contribute back to your campaigns and they can get their friends and family and other people to contribute to your campaigns. But computers, office space, Xerox machines, experts, um, investigators, all of these other things other than lawyers, they don't, they don't, they don't contribute to judicial campaigns. They don't send the money back a percentage of the money back. They don't kick it back. So as a consequence, they had nothing. The judges gave them for free one room in the courthouse because of course the judges didn't want any money going to office space either. But it was like one room. There were no private offices, no place to meet privately with clients or family members or witnesses.

Speaker 2:          05:33          Um, they had four computers. Two of which were hooked up to the Internet by dial up connections. They had one xerox machine that only worked some of the time. Um, they never had to file any motions cause the judges weren't require them to file motions. Cause again that would be wasted money that wasn't going to people's salary, lawyer salaries that could then come back to the judges. So they had, um, in the, I went through the books and the year before Katrina for approximately 12,000 cases, um, all told they spent in that entire year on 12,000 cases, they spent $9,000 on experts. Wow. No doing capital work, spend $9,000 in a cup in an hour and a half. Right in the morning.

Speaker 1:          06:23          Now were these lawyers also doing capital cases?

Speaker 2:          06:28          The office Yasso office had a capital unit as well. Umm, those lawyers were generally full time. Um, but when I took over the office, the capital lawyers, the eight, the National Aba standards are like one to two capital cases per lawyer per year. Um, and the Louisiana state standards were a little bit more generous. They were like two to four capital cases per lawyer per year. Um, these lawyers had on average around 15 to 18 capital cases. Some were over 20 capital cases, um, for an individual lawyer at a time.

Speaker 1:          07:06          Let, let me ask you this. What was the situation after Katrina hit in terms of people who had cases pending in the courts?

Speaker 2:          07:14          Okay. What happened after Katrina was the public defender's office was funded largely based on fines and fees on everyone who was found guilty of any criminal offense, which in Louisiana included traffic offenses. So by and large traffic offenses, um, um, funded the public defender's office, obviously once Katrina hit, there were no street lights. There were no stop signs, there were no cars, there were no people. There was no police and law enforcement doing traffic enforcement at least. Um, and so the funding completely dried up, which meant the public defender's office basically went down to, uh, I think one had five lawyers in one administrative person. And what happened to the clients was one of the things that the pre-katrina office did not have was they didn't have any sort of case management system. So they didn't know who their clients were. They would just walk into the courtroom and whoever showed up in the courtroom that day, they represented. So when Katrina scattered everybody, they had no list of people. So, so all of the defendants just got, they got transferred to jails throughout Louisiana and some even to other states throughout the south. And they were just lost in the system. They were nameless, faceless, um, and they basically suffered miserably

Speaker 1:          08:29          because if I understand it, the jail, they're in New Orleans, what's called the Orleans parish prison flooded, right? So the inmates who were in there had to be taken and distributed all across Louisiana. And as you said, even some out of state.

Speaker 2:          08:42          Right. And it was truly horrible. It completely flooded. And you can look back at the pictures post Katrina, there's the broad street overpass that goes over the expressway, right by the jail. And basically you had inmates swam, you know, waited and got through all of the muck to this bridge overpass where it was dry and they generally spent from three to seven days in basically hot blazing sun, 95 to 100 degree temperatures with no food and no water surrounded by a bunch of guards who had some food and some water, but would not share it with the inmates. Then they got transferred to um, um, what was called what was called Hunt Correctional Center, which was the classification prison where most inmates would go before getting sent to various prisons. Um, and they were all, they were, all of the Orleans parish inmates were put in one big outside Penn that was fenced in in a field.

Speaker 2:          09:38          Um, which meant also you had, you had juveniles, you had young kids, you had people charged with disorderly conduct or drunk and or carrying an open container and very minor offenses all mixed in with people charged with murder, rape, armed robbery, very violent people. And you had, you had, you had strong men with young boys, young kids, and they were all mixed in, in one big pen. It, and it was so dangerous. The guards wouldn't even go in. What they would do at feeding time was the guards would just stand outside the fence and they would toss over the fence, sandwiches and bottles of water. And of course, what happened in that environment is if you are big and strong, you got food and water. If you were weak or meek or mild mannered, you didn't get anything and you got beat up. Um, and you've got, and you suffered.

Speaker 2:          10:30          I mean, just, I mean, we're talking unspeakable abuse. And also eventually some of these inmates then got dispersed to jails throughout rural Louisiana. Most of, obviously the Orleans parish inmates. You're talking in our African American men and they got sent to rural Louisiana where there were large, largely where it's largely white. Um, and uh, they suffered horrible, horrible abuse at the hands of prison guards at these local jail facilities. And then also the prison guards would let other prisoners, uh, other inmates, um, abused them, beat them. I mean, literally like just horrible being beaten up, raped, just horrible abuse.

Speaker 1:          11:14          And there were no records regarding these people so that you didn't know whether somebody perhaps should have been released the next day, but they could be lost out in one of these jail somewhere. Right,

Speaker 2:          11:24          right, right. There were no, there were no records of the public defender's office didn't have records. Um, and so they were really nameless and faceless and right. And one of the, of course, um, things that was really typical of the Louisiana justice system was, you know, if during Katrina, if you were charged with a really serious offense, like murder or rape, and as a consequence of Katrina and the flood, the evidence was lost. Well, if, if, if after a year or two, if you spent a year or two with no, and just sort of moving throughout the system and then eventually at the end you've got released because there was no evidence. Well, you kind of made out like a bandit. On the other hand, if you were charged with a very minor offense, like disorderly conduct or an open container and we're in for like a day or two or five days right before Katrina hit and you spent six months, six or eight months in the system getting abused and raped and beaten up, you of course really got the short end of the stick.

Speaker 2:          12:20          And so of course the people who were, who were charged with very minor offenses who we would all agree we're least deserving of any bad treatment, they got the worst of it. And then of course the most violent, dangerous people, they sort of made out like bandits. Tell us what you did to try to re or what you did in fact go to restructure the public defender office in New Orleans. Um, well what we did was, uh, um, there were, uh, there was a small group of people who sort of immediately app after the storm, um, sort of recognize this as an opportunity. Um, there was some people in the capital field guy by the name of Ben Cone, um, um, who does capital litigation. Um, and then the chief judge of the court at the time who was Calvin Johnson, who had been a public defender and been a good advocate even on the bench for indigent defense.

Speaker 2:          13:15          Um, and it decided the perk decision on ineffective assistance of counsel due to case loads back in the early nineties. Um, they wreck, we recognize this as an opportunity. Um, and the biggest opportunity was because all of the funding dried up, the public defender's office had to lay off all or almost all of the lawyers, which meant because it had been a patronage system. Once the money dried up, the judges no longer had an interest in it. And once all the lawyers were laid off, you didn't have a vested group interested in keeping the old system and their jobs and keeping things the way they were. And so we, we took this opportunity, um, and basically we, because the funding dried up, we got some help from, I had a friend, a Harvard law school classmate who was in charge of funding at the Soros Foundation, and we put them together with the chief judge, Calvin Johnson.

Speaker 2:          14:11          Um, and we're able to leverage some emergency funding into reforming the office. And initially, um, really Calvin Johnson did a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of getting the judges to, um, the old board. Everybody had sort of moved and left New Orleans. And so we got the judges to appoint a new board that was really interested in reform. Um, and uh, um, it had Derwyn Bunton who I think you've spoken to and Denny Leboeuf on it. It had somebody from two lane and from Loyola, Pam Metsker and Dane Seal Lino and some local lawyers who were interested in reform. And then, uh, uh, and I got hired on as the person on the ground to reshape the public defender's office because as Calvin Johnson put it, he came, came to me and the Dean and he asked the Dean to loan me out from, from Loyola law school to fix it because he was like, well, Steve's the only one who has actually been a public defender in a good functioning public defender's office. And who knows? Who knows what one of these things look, looks like. Um, and because I had been at, uh, the public defender service in Washington DC.

Speaker 1:          15:18          And what were the, what were the fundamental changes, uh, that, that resulted

Speaker 2:          15:23          the, the, the, the biggest change? And I would say the absolute most important thing and sort of, I guess what I would call sort of the dirty little secret about public defense and industry indigent defense is the most important thing is not the structural things are sort of the, the way things look structurally or the system. Um, but the most important thing is the people. You have to have dedicated people as you yourself know from doing capital defense in the south you can have low salaries and small resources, but if you have really dedicated, committed, energetic, smart people, lawyers, you can go a long way. Of course, good lawyers and good dedicated people will do better in a good system and a good structure then in a bad structure. But if you have bad people who aren't interested, it doesn't matter how good a system or structure you have, it doesn't matter what the funding looks like, it won't be good. So the first thing I quite frankly did was I just started hiring people. I just started hiring good young, energetic people, um, to fill up all the spots. And as I got more money, I made sure I immediately hired people to fill up that money. So that it, so that, that, so that the, so that the judges and the other political powers couldn't force some of the old, um, old people back into the system.

Speaker 1:          16:47          So then when you hire people full time, right.

Speaker 2:          16:50          That was one of the first changes we made was we went, we, we, we immediately eliminated the park time system. Everyone was full time. They had to be a full time public defender. We raised their salaries to, to, to match the district attorney's office salaries so that they can have a good living wage. Um, and we created a real salary structure instead of this just flat part time, $35,000 fee. So you got more money as you got experience. Um, we, we hired investigators re I got Rick. One of the first things I did was I was the investigators that they had were basically former cops just double dipping in the system. And so we've got rid of all of the investigators and hired new investigators. I hired some investigators from the public defender's office in DC to then hire to create like an intern investigative program.

Speaker 2:          17:39          Um, we hired a, we ha we got together, we got hired social workers, we've got office space. You know, one of the biggest first things to do was we got office space, um, computers, laptop computers that they could take into court and plug in. They didn't have any of these basics. Um, there was no voicemail system. They had no phone systems. So we had to get a phone system with voicemail. We got office space with offices for meeting with clients, um, and with witnesses and with family members. Um, right. They, the way they used to take messages was that it was just one phone line and they would call in and people would just pin a message, a secretary. We just pin a message to a message board. Um, so we got a real voice mail system. Um, just things that you would, the normal accoutrements of a regular law office.

Speaker 1:          18:29          And then the way you approached representing clients, you said before they didn't even have files, but now you took a different approach as I am.

Speaker 2:          18:37          Right. We created a case management system. The other thing that, that, that was very symptomatic of the system was in Louisiana. Um, you would get arrested and then your bond would be determined at a first appearance. Uh, but then the district attorney's office had anywhere from 45 to 60 days if you were in jail up to 150 days if you bonded out to file charges. And that the public defender's office didn't represent anybody during this pre charging time. So it could be anywhere from two to three months if you were in jail up to six months, if you were out of jail before you ever got a public defender, a lawyer assigned to your case. Um, and of course if you're after six months, if you had an alibi or if there was evidence it was gone. It was long gone by that time. If there was evidence to prove your innocence. Um, so one of the first things we started started doing, we went full time, a full time lawyers and to a system of vertical representation. What do they mean by the time the players right away, at first appearance.

Speaker 1:          19:42          And then by vertical you mean those lawyer stay with the client all the way

Speaker 2:          19:46          lawyer that they would get assigned a lawyer at first appearance and that lawyer would stay with them throughout the case, through all the stages of the case, all the way till through trial and sentencing rather than the old system where whatever lawyer was in the courtroom at the time, on the day you walked in. That's what lawyer handled your case that day. Whether it was the same lawyer or a different lawyer than you had before.

Speaker 1:          20:09          And how, how did this was a huge change then for New Orleans? I mean before the lawyers that almost acted like clerks, they were in the courtroom and they handled, as you said, whatever came in. If lawyers who were following clients, uh, they're now going to different courtrooms. So it's not quite as smooth an operation as it had been. Right,

Speaker 2:          20:28          right. Of course. Um, the sold patronage because the system had been, the pre-katrina system had been set up by the judges. It worked extraordinarily well for the judges because the lawyers just came to the courtroom and lay, as you said, they were just like having, they were just like the clerk or the court reporter or the deputy, they were just part of the accoutrements, the judge in the courtroom and they were just, and they were just facility. They were going to have a lawyer, a name for the sixth amendment purposes on the transcript and on the docket so that the judge could move. I could move the docket. Once we went to this system of vertical representation, of course the lawyers were running around from courtroom to courtroom and we're also going to the jail to see their clients, which was a tremendous novelty, um, um, for the judges.

Speaker 2:          21:12          And they of course did not like the system because it meant things took longer. They could not get on and off the bench just quickly. Um, they used to generally leave the bench by certainly well before noon, um, most days unless they had a trial. And so their reaction to that was to try and use the contempt power, um, to lock people to, to lock lawyers up to, uh, in order to try and force things back the way they wanted them. Um, one of the first things I did, uh, when I started hiring lawyers is I made a commitment to all the lawyers, um, that if they ever got in trouble with any of the judges I would, I wanted to keep, I want it to keep all the heat on management and off of the individual lawyers because the individual lawyers were the ones standing next to the clients and had to represent the clients.

Speaker 2:          22:02          I and the other administrators. We had no clients. So I wanted all of the judges in political anger focused on management and off of the individual lawyers. And I want to just the individual lawyers to say, look, here's Steve singers number or here's Christine Layman's number. They're the ones in charge, call them. And so as a consequence, I would go to court whenever anyone had to go to jail. I made sure I was the one who went to jail, not the individual lawyers. So one we could keep the individual lawyers working on the cases and also so that the judges wouldn't take it out on them and the clients.

Speaker 1:          22:37          And, and, and you were held in contempt and taken into custody a number of times where you're not?

Speaker 2:          22:43          Oh, yes, many, many times. Um, I was probably cited for contempt, maybe somewhere between 10 and 20 times. I'm held in contempt probably eight to 10 times in, locked in, locked up and put in jail. Um, probably eight to 10 or 12 times. Um, uh, especially during the first year or two that I, that I was there. Um, you know, but, but we were, but we were ready for that. And because of my background in Capital Litigation, um, we, we had people set up with the right pleadings to file and the right documents to fought to file, um, that it was never for very long. And one of the, one of the things I had learned from, uh, basically from you and from Clive doing capital work was the beauty of sort of contempt, um, was I could pick, we could pick and choose when to fight and when nine to fight we could pick and choose our battles.

Speaker 2:          23:38          So, and if you and the judges were terrible, we're terrible lawyers. They weren't very good at litigators because never had to really let a gate, cause they were judges. They got to rule. Um, which meant, um, out of all the Times I was held in contempt and throw it, not one ever stuck. I never lost one of these in all the times I was cited for contempt and held, held in contempt, you know, 20 times over a couple of years. I never, ultimately, I never lost a single one of them because if you pick and choose carefully where you fight your battles, you pick and choose on ground that you can win

Speaker 1:          24:13          and you would take these to the appellate courts and they would vacate the contempts. Right,

Speaker 2:          24:18          right. Nate would vacate the contempt. The procedures were, one of the things was I just learned a lot about the minutia of contempt procedures and, and, and they were very, they were complicated enough that the judges could rarely follow them precisely and correctly in order to do it right. And you'd go and you'd win. I mean, like a good example of that for example, was, um, in one case a lawyer was too ill to do a trial. So the judge made me do the trial and I of course knew nothing about the case. And so I told the judge I wasn't going to do anything cause I didn't know anything about the case. I couldn't do anything intelligently. And so the judge started voire deer and had the prosecutor do, do her voire deer and then told me, okay, it was my turn to do my voir dire.

Speaker 2:          25:01          And I told the judge back in chambers, I said, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna do anything. I'm just going to stand up and say I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen, I can't ask any questions cause I don't know anything about the case. Um, and she and the judge, the judge, you know, said, well, we're going to go out there and you're going to go do voire deer. And she ordered me out there and of course I said it did exactly what I said and she stopped the trial and got an excuse the jury and then held me in contempt. But of course she was holding me in contempt for not asking any questions in voir dire. Well, obviously that was not going to stand up because if you don't want to, if a lawyer doesn't want to ask any questions in war deer, there's nothing that says that you can have with the lawyer has to ask questions. So they would, they would fight on sort of foolish grounds like that. Um, where, where I could always win.

Speaker 1:          25:46          Well, let me ask you this. How would you say, uh, since 2005 with this new office, with a new approach to handling cases, uh, where is indigent defense the representation of poor people accused of crimes in New Orleans today?

Speaker 2:          26:01          I think it's each certainly vastly, vastly improved from where it was right before Katrina. And certainly after Katrina, but, but it's much better than it was before Katrina. Just to give you an idea, the total funding for the office pre Katrina was about 1.75 to maybe $2 million, maybe some years. It was 2.1 million per year. Um, by the time I left in 2009, it was, it was 6.2 million. Um, and subsequently get went up from that. Um, and a lot of people have heard in the news about recent cuts, um, to the public defender's budget, but those cuts were cuts back from 9 million back to about six and a half or 7 million. So you're still talking a good three or four times what it was in terms of resources, um, what it was pre Katrina. And then of course the resources are being used much better.

Speaker 2:          27:00          You have fulltime, you have everyone at all. Lawyers are full time, you have no part time. Um, you have, uh, you have, you have, you have a good supervisory structure, um, with experienced lawyers in supervisory positions in good young, energetic lawyers being hired. The hiring isn't just local from the local private criminal defense bar who contributes to judges campaigns. Instead they hire nationally from the top law schools all around the country. Um, just like a good law office would. Um, and uh, um, and they have, they have, they have several social workers on staff. They have a whole, they have a whole pre-charge unit that deals with clients sort of in this pre-charge phase with their bond, um, and getting work and getting, getting situated back into the community. Um, so it's significantly better now. Some of the progress has slowed down as sort of state budgets with the recession and the end of the federal stimulus.

Speaker 2:          27:57          Some of the fast advancement that we had in the first three or four years, things have sort of leveled off, but I think there are still well positioned and well situated to take advantage once the economy revives and state budgets revive to take advantage and keep progressing forward. And one of the things I try and tell people is I came from the public defender service in Washington DC, which is regarded as a great public defenders office. But even the public defender service in DC wasn't what it wasn't in 1975 what it is now. It takes, it takes 20, 30, 40 years to really build, um, a good, a really good solid office like that. And so I think you have to take the long view and so there'll be some ups and downs and they're probably in a little bit of a leveling off or a down period now. But I expect that, um, there, there will be well positioned to take advantage and keep moving forward, I think over the long haul. I hope so.

Speaker 1:          28:51          Let, let me ask you this professor's singer, could we switch topics just a bit and let me ask you to talk about a person facing the death penalty in Louisiana. Louisiana is still sentence a number of people to death. It has a number of people on its death row. Um, what, what is the quality representation in Louisiana for people facing the death penalty?

Speaker 2:          29:12          It is, it is very uneven. It's very uneven. Uh, the state operates, uh, a number of spa. The state public defender Board operates a number of, um, capital programs that are, that are basically regional capital programs. There's one up in Shreveport for in Caddo parish for sort of the northwest part of the state. There's one in baton rouge for the central part of the state. There's one down in New Orleans for the, uh, sort of southeast region of the state. And then there's my old office Clive's Clive's old office LCAC Louisiana Capital Assistance Center. That's sort of a jet super regional office that goes around. And it, it sort of depends who you get. There are some, there are some very good high quality lawyers. Um, certainly the people at Lcac, um, Richard Bark, Christine laymen, um, uh, Elizabeth Co, the lawyers, the lawyers that that office are really quite good and if you're lucky enough to get them on your case, um, um, or people are, or them working with other local lawyers on your case, you can get quite good representation, which of course as you know, generally results in no death penalty. Um, if you have decent lawyer ring, um, and there are a number of lawyers carry Coocha in the southeast, the New Orleans office. Um, he's a very good, good capital lawyer and he runs a pretty, uh, a very good shop, um, then, but elsewhere in the state, if you're not fortunate to get one, a lawyer, you know, one of these really good lawyers, if you get just a local lawyer or one of the weaker cap, it'll programs in the state, then you're in, then you're in really dire straits, then you're in trouble.

Speaker 1:          31:00          And occasionally it does this still happen. I know. And Jason Reeves case, it was first handled by one of these regional offices that you mentioned and was a hung jury at the guilt phase. Uh, but then the local public defender who protested that he had so many cases, but against his will was forced onto the case and occurs. That pretty much decided the case right there. Reeves was sentenced to death. Uh, does that still happen?

Speaker 2:          31:28          That still does happen and it especially happens in it where Jason Reeves happened in Lake Charles up in Caddo parish in Shreveport. Um, sort of in the northern and western parts of the state. Um, they try and keep out the, the best lawyers who are generally not surprisingly are in the big metropolitan regions of Baton Rouge and, uh, and New Orleans, which I did most generally the most desirable places to live in where there's a lot of good legal talent. Um, and so that sort of thing still does happen and there's a lot of resistance. Um, I would say especially now in Caddo parish, up in Shreveport, up in the northwest corner of the state to anyone from down in the New Orleans Baton Rouge area coming up there. And uh, that generally determines your fate. Yeah. Jason Reeves was a really stark example. They saw what happened with good lawyering, so they decided to change that. And of course that changed the outcome.

Speaker 1:          32:26          And unfortunately you were saying that still happens in some places and particularly in Shreveport.

Speaker 2:          32:31          Yeah, I would say particularly in Shreveport and the north, north, the further north and west you get, the closer you get to the Texas border to Houston and Dallas outside of sort of the western part of the state. Um, that's still a real problem where they are extremely resistant, um, to people like the Richard Barks and, and Christine Layman's and the really good capital lawyers. You know, for example, um, previously one of the big death penalty jurisdictions in the state, one of the four big, the four big ones where Jefferson parish, Louisiana, which was the white flight area from New Orleans, Baton Rouge, east Baton Rouge, um, Caddo parish up in Shreveport and calc issue Paris, which was late. Charles Jefferson was one of the worst, um, Lcac Richard Bark and Clive Stafford Smith and Ben cone. They basically made Jefferson parish a project. Jefferson parish now never break. They don't bring their, not interested in bringing capital cases anymore. They just don't even charge the death penalty anymore. The local prosecutor, not officially, but unofficially, is basically said, it's not worth it. We'll just take the life without parole. And they've shut down the death penalty in one of the four biggest jurisdictions. So it shows you what good lawyering can do. Um, but then obviously the opposite is true elsewhere in the state.

Speaker 1:          33:50          And we've seen that in some other places that are talked about in the materials that people have for the course, which is other places like Philadelphia and places that have started capital defender offices. And the difference that that has made with regard to representation,

Speaker 2:          34:04          it, it's, it's unbelievable. I mean, one of the things I'd like to say say is that other than one volunteer, since I've been in Louisiana since 1999, um, there's was one volunteer a couple of years ago and then there was less smart in 2002 and no, in, you're talking, so in the past 14, 15 years, there have been two executions in a deep south, southern high death penalty state. There've been two executions. And the reason for that is basically during the, during the mid to late 1990s and early two thousands, you add a small, you're talking about basically five lawyers. You're talking to Clive Stafford Smith, Denny Leboeuf, nick trying to Costa Neil Walker and Ben comb five very committed lawyers for working hard shutdown the death penalty in the state of Louisiana essentially. Well, Jay a spa, it's um, it's amazing what a small group of really smart, talented, committed lawyers can do. Um, even in a death penalty hotbed location like, like Louisiana.

Speaker 1:          35:18          And, and this is both at the trial level, but also in the appeals process that

Speaker 2:          35:24          you had. You had, you had three or four, you had, you had, you had people like Denny Leboeuf and Clive Stafford Smith and Neil Walker do and myself doing trial work. And then you had people like nick trying to Costa and Ben Cohen and Denny doing appeals and post conviction and that end handling it all the way through and that basically shut it down. Um, and now that a lot of those people have left, were worried what things are going to look like five or 10 years down the road that they won't look like the last 10 or 15 years. But it is remarkable. Um, I mean, nothing makes your article on how the death penalty is for not for the worst crimes, but for the worst lawyers. True. Then if you look at Louisiana from the early 1990s to the present, professor, singer, thank you very much for your time and for your insights. We are most grateful. My pleasure.
