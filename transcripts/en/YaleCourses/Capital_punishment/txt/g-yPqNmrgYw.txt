Speaker 1:          00:11          Most people facing the death penalty don't pick their lawyer. They may be fortunate to have a lawyer who is a caring, competent, hardworking person with a enough of a caseload or reasonable workload that they can provide the representation that's required in a death penalty case. On the other hand, a poor person accused of a crime involving the death pony may be assigned a lawyer who's completely incompetent, uh, who has 300 400 cases and can't possibly spend the time that's required to defend a capital case. They may be assigned a lawyer who doesn't know the law regarding capital punishment. So that law might as well not exist for this particular client. So we'll take a look at the quality of representation provided to people, uh, in death penalty cases, uh, because often the lawyer assigned to a case is the determining factor on whether somebody gets the death penalty or not.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Uh, some states have capital defender offices. Uh, Colorado has had one for a long time. It has only two or three people usually on death row at any time, because that office has been so effective in representing people and preventing imposition of the death pony in those cases. On the other hand, you have states like Texas and Alabama that have no public defender system, even not to mention a capital defender office. So if you're facing the death plenty in one of those states, and there are a number of them all across the country, uh, it may be that the lawyer is the lawyer from private practice. It may be the lawyer doesn't have an investigator. Uh, it may be the court doesn't provide funding for experts or other, uh, essential, uh, aspects of defending a case. Uh, and the result is that person is to put it mildly at a tremendous disadvantage, uh, facing the death penalty.

Speaker 1:          02:05          A number of examples of this are provided@asecondclassjustice.com. Um, in this segment, we're gonna look at a few examples and explore the reasons why people, uh, can be condemned to die despite a grossly incompetent legal representation. Uh, generally the right to counsel is determined not before trial. Does this person have a competent lawyer who's going to represent them at the trial but is determined after the trial when the question is raised looking backwards at the trial, did the person have effective assistance of counsel? And we'll talk about how the court has defined that, uh, in a way that makes it possible to say a person was not defined effective assistance of counsel even when it's questionable, whether even when a demonstrably, uh, is, is not true. Uh, generally that's the way. There's some exceptions. There have been lawsuits filed, uh, to improve representation in, uh, criminal cases by, uh, dealing with case loads or other systemic problems.

Speaker 1:          03:13          But for the most part in capital cases, particularly what we're going to see is an after the fact looked back at the representation that someone had. And I want to use the case out of Oklahoma of James Fisher, uh, as an example. Uh, he was tried in 1983 and represented by a lawyer who not only represented James Fisher, but tried 24 other cases during the month of September. Hard to imagine that one lawyer could try 24 cases. He put on no evidence and said only nine words during the sentencing phase of James Fisher's trial. Uh, the case went to the Oklahoma Court of criminal appeals, which said it was deeply disturbed by the representation that Fisher had received, but nonetheless, it wasn't disturbed enough, uh, that it gave him a new trial. It upheld both the conviction and the death penalty. Uh, in the case, uh, many years later, 2002, the United States courts of the United States Court of appeals finds that the lawyer failed to investigate what was a close case in terms of weather.

Speaker 1:          04:19          Fisher was actually the person who committed this crime or not, that the lawyer was grossly inept and disloyal to Fisher, uh, by, uh, the hostility, uh, that he showed towards his client and his client's case. So now, many years, 1983, the trial, 2002, the United States appellate court is saying Fisher gets a new trial. Uh, 2005, he has his second trial. This time, Fisher gets a lawyer who was drinking heavily, uh, and uh, uh, abusing cocaine. Uh, at one point the lawyer threatened Fisher, actually asked the deputies to take off the handcuffs so he and Fisher could have a fist fight. Uh, this is about as bad as it gets. An attorney client relations, uh, no investigation whatsoever. Fishers is sends to death, yet again, a 2009 this time the Oklahoma Court of criminal appeals says no, this was ineffective lawyering, ineffective at the guilt phase.

Speaker 1:          05:19          And the court said Fisher was prejudice because the prosecution's case was not very strong and other words, Fisher. Now in 2009, having been synced to death, has spent over 20 years, most of it on death row. And there's never been a constitutional determination of whether he's actually guilty of the crime or not. Because his first lawyer did nothing for him and his second lawyer did nothing for him. He did not have a, uh, a fighting chance of presenting his case and contesting new government's case at either one of these trials. In 2010. The prosecution agrees that Fisher can be released only if he would admit guilt and agree to be banished from Oklahoma forever. Uh, if you're James Fisher and you've had the two trials that he's had, the trial were, the lawyer only said nine words at the penalty phase, the trial where the lawyer tried to get in a fist fight with him and was drinking and abusing cocaine, um, it's awfully hard to turn that deal down.

Speaker 1:          06:23          Uh, we see this in a number of death penalty cases to get reversed where when they come back, the prosecution wants to save face, but knows it probably can't get a conviction the defendant wants out, but knows there's some risk that they may be convicted again and regardless they're going to stay in jail for some period of time before the new trial. So they end up taking this sort of, uh, deal, uh, where they agree to plead guilty sometimes of pleading guilty while maintaining their innocence, uh, in exchange for time served basically, uh, and they're set free. Uh, this case is a disgrace. It's a disgrace that the trial judge didn't stop it at the first trial, that the trial judge didn't stop it at the second trial, and that it took this many years for James Fisher's right to counsel, uh, to be vindicated. Uh, but it's not that unusual.

Speaker 1:          07:20          Uh, Gregory Wilson since to death, uh, in Kentucky was represented by a lawyer who practiced out of his home. Um, you may say a lawyer could practice out of his home, although this was back in the days before a laptop computers and the kind of technological advantages we have today that make it possible for lawyer to practice out of his or her home. Uh, in this case, uh, the lawyers home had a big Budweiser beer sign, uh, up on the wall in the living room. Uh, Wilson found out, Wilson found out that just a short time before the police had gone to this office or home of the lawyer and had taken up the floor in the living room and taking out eight bags of stolen property. But what really was the final Straw for Gregory Wilson was when he called the telephone number. The lawyer gave him in the answered Kelly's Keck.

Speaker 1:          08:18          Uh, Kelly's keg is a bar right across the street from the Kenton County courthouse in Kentucky where Gregory Watson was tried and it actually worked. I mean, if you call the number for Kelly's Cag, the bartender would answer and often summon the lawyer William Hagadorn, uh, to the phone. Uh, but unfortunately he may not remember that call. The next day when Wilson gets to court, he says to the judge, your honor, I want a new lawyer and I'm facing the death penalty. I'm from Detroit, I'm in Kentucky. I'm a black man facing the death penalty and a place where I don't know anybody and I need a real lawyer. The judge says, well, Mr. Wilson, you can have any lawyer you want, but this is your court appointed lawyer, Mr Hegg door. Uh, so if you want to bring in another lawyer, of course, wasn't, had no ability to bring in another lawyer.

Speaker 1:          09:09          Uh, and as a result, he went to trial, uh, with Mr Headquarters is lawyer. Uh, he was, it was a somewhat farcical trial. He was sentenced to death. Uh, and in the review process later, the courts rejected his claim that he had not been adequately represented, saying that Wilson had failed to cooperate with Mr Hegg door. Of course he was trying to get Mr Hegg Dorn replaced during all that time. The question you ask if this case is how does a person like Gregory Wilson in force the right to counsel the most fundamental right a person accused of a crime or facing the death penalty has, what do you do when the lawyer is incompetent? And you can tell the lawyers and competent. But this is the judge, the lawyer the judge gave you. Uh, and so here we see an example of when the most fundamental right a person has is actually a unenforceable, even though it's hard to imagine what else Gregor Woodson could have done a than what he did and trying to get a new lawyer.

Speaker 1:          10:14          Uh, Jeffery Leonard was tried by a lawyer who knew so little about him that he was tried under the name James Slaughter. His lawyer didn't even know his client's name. Uh, he had used this, came slaughter as an alias and had been arrested under that name of the lawyer. Didn't know that he was brain damage. Uh, the lawyer did not know a whole lot. I didn't know anything actually about his client and when the case was being heard. And the lawyer testified about his experience, he claimed that he had been a prosecutor in New York and that he had tried to the death point of cases turned out those were not true. Uh, he later resigned from the bar in a deal, uh, because, uh, of his misrepresentations, but the courts all the way through the state and federal courts upheld the death sins for Jeffery Leonard. He was spared execution only because the governor of Kentucky, Ernie Fletcher commuted his sentence, uh, when, when he left office.

Speaker 1:          11:12          Uh, another example is Hollywood, uh, Iq in the low sixties. This is an intellectually disabled person who's tried in Alabama and sentenced to death. And it turns out that the lawyers representing him, local lawyers never bothered to go to the school where Hollywood had been in special education classes. The special education classes were held in the basement of the school. Whether the electricity often didn't work. It also flooded every time it rained and it was called by the other students, the mole hole. And Hollywood was one of the moles. Uh, this would have probably been critical evidence if the jury had only heard it, uh, that he had an Iq in the low sixties that he had been in special education, whatever one can say, uh, about someone faking mental illness. You can't fake, uh, an Iq in the 60s. At the time we were in grade school. Uh, and anticipation that many, many years later you might face the death public, uh, inadequate representation.

Speaker 1:          12:17          Nevertheless, Alabama courts held that the lawyers made a reasonable decision not to investigate, uh, and go to the school and talk to the teachers and find out what was right there in town, uh, and, uh, that that was a reasonable decision. Alabama executed Hollywood in 1960. There are many other examples. I mean, if you go to Texas, uh, three death penalty cases in which the lawyer slept during the trial, uh, judges presiding over cases where the lawyer representing the person facing the death pony is asleep, even snoring in some cases, one of the judges was asked by a journalist, how can you preside over a case where the defense lawyer is asleep, uh, and trying the case? And the judge said, wow, the constitution guarantees you a lawyer. Uh, but it doesn't guarantee you that the lawyer has to be awake. Uh, and so, uh, Calvin Verdeyen, uh, to other people since to death and Kevin Burdens case, the case goes to the United States Court of Appeals.

Speaker 1:          13:22          And the state of Texas argues that, uh, even though the lawyer, Joe Cannon, who also slept in another death point of case and was an older lawyer who often slept after lunch when he tried cases, and yet the judges in Houston continued to appoint him to case after case. Texas made the argument that, well, this was not inadequate loitering or ineffective lawyer in, because after all, the court upheld cases where the lawyers run of the influence of alcohol, uh, drugs, uh, even a case where a lawyer has all timers. Uh, but the court decided that a sleeping lawyer was unconscious and so was therefore unlike the alcoholic Liam paired lawyer or the drug impaired lawyer, uh, and found that a burden was entitled to a new new trial. Another cannon, a client, another person represented by Joe Frank Cannon. Uh, Carl Johnson was executed by the state of Texas and George Macfarlane, who was represented by John Ben, another lawyer who actually snored, uh, during the trial, uh, is, is still on death row in Texas, another lawyer in Texas, his drone guide notes who practices in Houston and who in three different death penalty cases has missed the deadline for filing a federal Habeas Corpus action.

Speaker 1:          14:43          So about as basic a responsibility as a lawyer has in any kind of case, whether it's an automobile negligence case or any other kind of case file within the deadline filed within the statute of limitations, he missed it. Not once, you would've thought that would've been enough to suspend them from practice. Not twice but three times. And yet the state bar of Texas did nothing. The Texas Court of criminal appeals did absolutely nothing. The trial judge's in Houston did nothing. In fact, he's still being appointed to criminal cases, including capital cases in Texas. Today. You're not very lucky if you get this guy as your lawyer. Uh, not very lucky at all. Uh, and yet nothing has been done despite what really should be a basis for some disciplinary action by the bar in terms of missing the statute of limitations. How can it be, uh, that, uh, this happens, uh, in cases?

Speaker 1:          15:41          Well, the Supreme Court held 1942 in a case called Glasser versus United States. That the right to counsel is two fundamental, an absolute for courts to indulge in Nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice from its denial. In other words, if somebody has denied the right to a lawyer, that's so fundamental, we can't get into whether the case would have come out the same way or not. We've got to give them a new trial. The court changed its mind, uh, and decided actually courts could make a fairly rough calculation of what difference it made. A, in the case of Strickland versus Washington in 1984, this was a death penalty case. David Washington was sentenced to death in Florida and had raised the fact that his lawyer had done virtually nothing to prepare for the penalty phase of his case. Uh, the Supreme Court said that a lawyer is not ineffective if the judges can conclude after looking at the case that it didn't make any difference, that the lawyers in competence didn't make any difference.

Speaker 1:          16:44          If the court asks this question, is there a reasonable probability that, but for the lawyers performance, the deficient performance, the result would be different. In other words, do the acts and omissions of the lawyer undermine confidence in the outcome of the case? Uh, this is the, uh, prejudice, prom Strickland versus Washington. There are two parts of it. I'm going to take the prejudice part first because this is where the court said, uh, that judges can decide. And other words, even though a lawyer may be incompetent, I've judge can say there was no violation of the right to counsel because the judge concludes that the case would come out the same way, even if the person had been represented by competent counsel. Chris, very hard for judges to know that, uh, they weren't there at the trial. Uh, they didn't hear the witnesses. Uh, they weren't sitting in the jury and they didn't know how the jury assessed the case.

Speaker 1:          17:42          And yet every day courts decide to uphold cases where people have head deficient legal representation, uh, on the basis that there's not a substantial probability that, but for the representation the person received a, they would have gotten the death penalty. Uh, so even though courts are saying lawyers are not quote ineffective legally, they're not saying or the lawyer can still be incompetent but not legally and effective. And so as a result, it's a way in which courts can paper over the poorer quality representation. Uh, that happens in many cases, capital and non capital as well. The other part of the test is, was the performance of the lawyer deficient. And the court has said that's measured by what our prevailing, uh, professional norms did. The lawyer's representation meet whatever the sort of standard of care in the legal profession is for representing somebody in a death penalty case.

Speaker 1:          18:47          Now, that would be a, an objective assessment. But the court added a couple or three things to make it very difficult to conclude, uh, uh, that the lawyers performance fell below the standard. Uh, first of all, the court said judicial review. It's going to be highly deferential. In other words, the judges are not to second guess lawyers as a general matter. Uh, the courts are to indulge a strong presumption that the lawyer rendered adequate assistance. In other words, regardless of whether the lawyer did or not, the of course are going to presume that the lawyer was adequate and made all significant decisions based upon professional judgment. The lawyer may have been completely clueless, but the Supreme Court says, we'll presume that any decision not to call a witness, not to do an investigation, not to do whatever was a professional decision and tactical decisions or strategic choices made after thorough investigation, which may or may not be an issue in some cases are virtually on challengeable.

Speaker 1:          19:52          So what the court is basically doing here is making it fairly hard for a court considering a claim of ineffective loitering, uh, to find the lawyer a deficient in the performance because of these presumptions, although they can be overcome and they are from time to time in cases. Uh, but then the court can also decide, as I talked about a moment ago, uh, that it didn't have an effect on the outcome. It was, we're all been the same. Uh, and there we'd be, well, a Justice Marshall descents, uh, he says this standard is so malleable, it will either have no grip at all or there will be all kind of variations. In other words, there won't really be a standard of representation, a four people, uh, in, in these cases. Uh, and he also says this presumption, all these presumptions put a very heavy burden of persuasion on the WHO's been convicted or sentenced to death, uh, and says there, once you show back to what the court had said in Glasser, once a determination is made that the lawyers performance was deficient, then that should be the end.

Speaker 1:          21:00          The court shouldn't indulge in this speculation about whether or not it made a difference. Let me take one case to just illustrate, uh, what, what happens here that the, the judicial rulings on denial of council in the state courts are made by elected judges. Uh, often the very same judges, uh, who appointed the lawyer in the first instance. It's not always but often the case, uh, and then reviewed on Habeas Corpus by the federal courts, life tenure judges. But they can set aside a conviction only if they conclude that the decision of the State Court, which is where almost all these cases come from was an unreasonable application of Strickland versus Washington or was contrary to Strickland versus Washington. Let's take a look at Robert [inaudible] case. Um, this was a man since to death in Georgia. It turns out that his lead defense lawyer, uh, drank a quart quart of vodka every night during the trial because he was getting ready to be indicted and ultimately disbarred and ultimately convicted, uh, for, uh, stealing client funds.

Speaker 1:          22:09          The lawyer said he probably shouldn't been allowed to represent anybody. Uh, during this time period. Uh, he didn't present. This man is intellectually disabled, but no evidence was presented about that. Uh, he had been subject to, this is from judge Bork cats to said that he was subject to abuse that was so severe, so frequent, and so notorious that his neighbors called his childhood home. The torture chamber. All of this evidence not presented by this lawyer who's drinking a quart of vodka every day during a capital trial, uh, Georgia trial judge says, no one can seriously believe that Hosely received the constitutional guarantee of the right to council. It seems pretty obvious. Uh, but the Georgia Supreme Court says, well, there's no substantial probability that the case would have come out differently. That even if he had had a sober lawyer, even if he had had a lawyer to put on all this evidence about his mental limitations, about the abuse he received as a child, we, the Georgia Supreme Court justices don't think it would have come out any differently.

Speaker 1:          23:15          And the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th circuit says, well, we defer to the Georgia Supreme Court. Uh, it's not an unreasonable application of Strickland versus Washington because fair minded jurists can disagree, uh, with regard to it. Uh, so in other words, even though the trial judge who saw the witnesses and heard about this, found that a violation of the right to counsel the Georgia Supreme Court doesn't make any finding that the lawyer was on vodka and about to be indicted was competent. They just find that it would've made any difference if he had had, uh, another lawyer in his case. So just as James Fisher, uh, would probably be denied under the law as it is today if the, if you had this deference that was applied and Jose's case, uh, Robert Hosely probably would have received a new trial if his case had been before the federal courts back at the time.

Speaker 1:          24:16          Fisher's case was before the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th circuit. In other words, when these cases came before the federal courts, one was when the law did not require deference to state court findings. That's Fisher. And he got a new trial and he's a free man today. Holst Lee's comes before the court. Uh, when the courts do have to defer the federal courts to the state courts and because of this restraint, we're causing this deference. He loses. So timing is everything. They're going to be a lot of. Robert Holst was a lot of people who are, and there are a lot who are sends to death who the state courts say, well the Lord may not have been great but we don't think it would've made a difference. Uh, and the federal courts then are going to apply this deferential standard of review basically as Justice Marshall predicted in his dissent and strictly, uh, this standard has turned out to be so malleable, uh, that it's an eye of the beholder standard.

Speaker 1:          25:17          Some judges will look at a lawyer's performance and say this was deficient. It affected the outcome. The person's entitled for new trial. Another judge will look at the same set of facts and say, we don't think it made any difference. And if you're a federal judge, you can even say, well, we may not agree with the state court decision. We may not agree with the Georgia Supreme Court, but it's not unreasonable because fair minded judges can disagree. And if fair minded judges can disagree, then we're going to, uh, let the state courts decide. The reason this is so important and we'll talk about judges at another time, uh, is because the state court judges are elected. Uh, and very often the decision making in the state courts is influenced, uh, as justice Stevens has recognized it's just a soda. My IRS recognized, uh, by the political pressure that's often present.

Speaker 1:          26:09          Uh, when you have elected judges to signing cases, the federal judges, uh, life tenure judges have a little more independence. Um, can prejudice be presumed? Uh, this is an interesting case that was decided the same day that the Washington or Strickland versus Washington case was decided. Manny, Moe Harrison chronic, uh, is the government spends four and a half. The United States government spends four and a half years getting his case ready for trial. Uh, it's, he's charged with 13 counts of check kiting. Uh, and the case involves thousands of documents about how there's check kiting scheme worked. Uh, and he's given a real estate lawyer who had never tried a case 25 days before trial. Look at this. The government's been four and a half years getting ready, and his lawyer has 25 days to get ready for trial. The lower court looked at this and said, well, I mean, of course this couldn't possibly be a lawyer, couldn't possibly represent somebody.

Speaker 1:          27:15          In this situation, a supreme court unanimously reversed and said, we're not going to presume a prejudice. Uh, in this case, uh, we are going to require that the court looks at it under the Washington versus Strickland standard. In other words, we're going to look at the lawyer's performance, was it the deficient performance? And secondly, uh, was there any prejudice as a result, a chronics case was sent back to the lower court. It actually found that even under the Strickland standard, uh, he was ineffective. The lawyer was ineffective. Uh, he was given a new trial. He was convicted to the new trial, but on appeal, the court said there wasn't even sufficient evidence to convict him. And he double jeopardy principles, uh, prevented him from being tried again. Uh, again, that case might not come out the same way, uh, today. Uh, but of course this is a case out of the United States, uh, prosecuted by the United States.

Speaker 1:          28:12          So it's not quite the same, uh, as the, as the state cases that are reviewed, uh, on Habeas Corpus, um, for the most part, the denial, the court's going to make clearer, didn't make clear in a number of cases after this that very seldom will prejudice be presumed. In the Calvin Verdeyen case, which I mentioned where the lawyers slept during the trial, the United States states court of Appeals for the fifth circuit sitting with a whole court held that there they would presume prejudice because a lawyer who was asleep was basically absent from the trial. And a sleeping lawyer is really no lawyer at all. And therefore we will presume prejudice. Of course, that's an extraordinary kind of case. That's not your typical case where there's a sleeping lawyer. There may be a very bad lawyer, but usually the lawyers can manage to stay awake during the trial.

Speaker 1:          29:05          Uh, so generally the cases are going to be looked at under strict one. Again, it's going to be very much the courts that look at it. Uh, the political pressures that come to bear, the very deferential standard of assessing whether or not the lawyer's performance was deficient or not. And then finally of course decision about is there a substantial probability? Do we think it made a difference, a substantial probability that it affected the outcome. As a result, many people who receive inadequate representation, uh, are not going to have their cases set aside, uh, and are going to be executed. Of course, there are going to be some cases and there were cases decided by the United States Supreme Court, uh, the Williams case out of Virginia, Terry Williams, where the court held that there was an effective representation, the Wiggins case out of Maryland, again, where the court found in effective representation, but, and, and the, uh, Ron pillowcase from polo versus beer where again, the United States Supreme Court found ineffective representation.

Speaker 1:          30:06          But against those cases, you find case after case, including a number of cases where the Supreme Court has just granted a review of a case and reversed a grant of ineffective assistance of counsel. And we see many courts in the country where it's almost impossible to prevent, to excuse me, to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. What does this mean going forward? It means that people facing the death penalty may have the good fortune to have good lawyers, well trained lawyers, capable lawyers, uh, but they may also not. And if they don't, uh, there may be no relief for them.
