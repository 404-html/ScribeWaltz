Speaker 1:          00:11          Welcome. I'm Steve Bright and this is a course on how race, poverty, mental illness, intellectual disability affect people in the criminal justice system and particularly in cases involving the death penalty. I want to spend a little time in this first class talking about what we're going to cover over the course of this course. Uh, and then we're going to look some at an introductory case, the case of a Arkansas versus rookie rector. Then look at some historical background, which is going to set us up for looking at these issues as they come up, uh, in the future. Let me just say it. The first, uh, this class is not about, uh, the sort of philosophical questions of whether the Moro or theological questions of whether the death penalty is a good idea or not. Whether it's morally wrong or, or or not a, those are very worthwhile inquiries, but they're not the ones we're going to make a in this session.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Uh, this is really going to be a class, uh, about, uh, the challenges of one accused of a crime who is first poor and the consequences of poverty is we'll be talking about is that you have a court appointed lawyer usually representing you, uh, and often deficiencies, uh, race, uh, the fact that a person is a member of a racial minority, uh, and, uh, the person that is accused or a, that people of a certain race are excluded from participation. Uh, as I'll talk a little bit more, uh, later. Uh, and then finally, as I said, people who are intellectually disabled are suffering from mental illnesses, which present a number of question in the context, uh, of these cases. Now these issues are present in almost all criminal cases, but they come into particularly bright relief for clear relief in capital cases. So we're going to look at them in the context of capital cases, but they do have broad applicability to all kinds of cases, particularly a poor people accused of crimes.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Uh, in our legal system. Uh, Hugo black ones road for the supreme court. There can be no equal justice when the kind of trial a person gets depends upon the amount of money he or she has a, but of course we know today that that of course nothing probably counts more in terms of the kind of justice a person receives a than how much money they have. A and in our court system today, uh, the criminal courts, uh, about 90% of the people accused of crimes are poor. Uh, and the consequence of that, uh, as we will talk about the major consequences having a court appointed lawyer, uh, that a person who is accused of a crime does not choose his or her lawyer, doesn't go to the leading criminal defense lawyer in town, uh, and sign them up. Enormously expensive to have a private lawyer.

Speaker 1:          03:11          As we see in some of these cases in which people are defended by private counsel, uh, without a lawyer. Uh, all of your constitute without a competent lawyer, I should say. All of your constitutional rights, uh, mean nothing. The lawyer is the person that the client counts on to know the law, to assert the law, uh, to uh, and do the investigation of the case. Investigate both the government's case to see if there really is a prosecution case against the person. Also do an independent investigation of a whatever facts there may be. So one is completely dependent upon the lawyer for that, but we have this problem. Why would the government, uh, that is trying to convict and execute a person or a fine or in prison or person? Why is the government going to pay for a lawyer to defend, to defeat that very purpose.

Speaker 1:          04:04          But because of course the states are responsible and I should say 95% of criminal cases are in the state courts. We often think about the federal courts, but most, uh, criminal cases are in the state courts, meaning primarily there before elected judges and they're handled by elected prosecutors. And as we'll see, those kinds of political considerations are going to come into play when a person, uh, is, is facing any kind of criminal charges. Um, uh, finally, of course, poverty may have an impact, uh, on a person in many other ways. And we'll talk about that as well over the course of the term, how it is that poverty, someone who grows up in poverty, who is affected by poverty and all kinds of ways. What legal significance, if any, uh, that that may have a race. Uh, this is the court house in Jenkins County, uh, Georgia.

Speaker 1:          05:05          Uh, as you can see, uh, it's, uh, quite a memorial to the confederacy and, uh, people including black people who are called for jury duty, uh, who come as witnesses. And of course, most importantly, those who come accused of a crime, uh, pass by, uh, this, uh, memorial. If you're in Shreveport, Louisiana, you pass by a this memorial and Keto perish. That's the courthouse. Now, there's been some complaints about this monument, which ultimately resulted in the confederate flag being taken down, uh, but still this huge monument to the confederacy, uh, stands outside the courthouse where every person coming in to do business in the court, uh, walks past it with the statutes of Robert E. Lee and stonewall Jackson. And other confederate heroes. Uh, the courts are the institutions that have been least affected by the civil rights movement and the part of the country where I have spent the last 30 years practicing law.

Speaker 1:          06:04          I see a lot of changes. Uh, I see African Americans on city councils and the state legislatures and mayor of Atlanta of course, and other places. But when I go into the courts, nothing's changed. I come into the court, the judges, white people at the prosecution table or White, uh, the court appointed lawyers are usually white. And even in communities that have 25, 30% African American populations, you look in the jury box and every one of the jurors is white. Uh, all the only person of color who's going to be before the rail there in the front of the courtroom is going to be the person accused. And we're going to talk about, uh, what the dynamics are. A, when that happens, uh, race influences everything. Uh, in the criminal justice system, we know that a person of color is more likely to be stopped by the police.

Speaker 1:          06:51          The, so called driving while black or driving while Brown, uh, we know that during that stop, uh, they're more likely to be abused. That is, they may have a gun pulled on them, they may be put in handcuffs, they may be thrown to the ground, uh, they're more likely to be arrested, uh, at the end of that stop. And this continues all the way through, more likely, uh, to be sent to jail instead of put on probation in a, in a, in a first offender case, uh, and all the way through to the severity of the sentence that is imposed. I want later in this session to look at the history, uh, that the criminal courts have played, uh, with regard to racial oppression. Uh, because this backdrop can't just be ignored. The, the slavery, the failure after the civil war of the criminal courts, the courts generally, uh, to provide equal protection.

Speaker 1:          07:40          That is to protect the freed slaves from the Klu Klux Klan and the riders and, and, and other people, uh, uh, convict leasing, uh, which, uh, a lot of people don't even know about, uh, but which really perpetuated slavery by arresting people and leasing them out to plantations and railroads and so forth really perpetuated slavery all the way up until about 1940, uh, Jim Crow Justice, which we will talk a little bit about later. Uh, and of course today mass incarceration, uh, all of these things have a tremendous impact with regard to race and, and on African Americans, Latinos and other people. So we want to examine how it is that that happens in particularly, uh, in, in, in depth senses. Uh, how does one identify racial prejudice? We're going to look at who makes discretionary decisions. Uh, are there any limits? Are there any guidelines when a prosecutor decides whether to seek the death penalty or not?

Speaker 1:          08:38          Are there any restrictions on that? Uh, does anyone review that decision? Can that one person make a decision all by him or herself and not have it reviewed? Or is that going to be a reviewed? If we find discrimination, if we find people who are being excluded from juries because of race, uh, if we find that people are being prosecuted and race is a factor, is there a remedy for it? And the law, we're always asking not only what's the injury, uh, but what's the remedy for that injury and then is the remedy adequate? And one of the things we'll look at in the class has been a number of remedies, uh, that fall far short of accomplishing what we would hope they would, uh, with regard to race. Uh, we'll also talk about mental illness and limited, uh, or, uh, limited intellectual functioning or intellectual disability.

Speaker 1:          09:34          Uh, largest mental institution in any community is the local prison or jail. And there are a number of issues that will arise out of mental, uh, issues that come out and in, in other kinds of criminal cases, but particularly dramatically sometimes in capital cases. Uh, is the person, um, uh, was the person saying at the time of the crime, do they understand why they committed? Are they competent for trial? Can they work with a lawyer and participate in trial? A, are they a future dangerous? This is a reason for imposing the death penalty in many states. Is the person a future danger to the community? And we really asking there is this person so mentally impaired that we treat that person because we don't hold them to the same degree of culpability that we would hold someone who's not mentally impaired or do we kill that person because they're so dangerous?

Speaker 1:          10:34          Uh, which is, uh, somewhat of an eye of the beholder question. Uh, we'll see how that comes up in death penalty cases, mitigating factors. Also a death penalty cases, uh, are things about the life and back in the middle, uh, illness, the mental limitations of a person, something we take into account. And if so, how in deciding to sentence competency to waive appeal, sometimes people who are sentenced to death decide they don't want to appeal, they give up their appeals and, and they're executed. Uh, are they mentally competent to make that decision? Uh, or uh, should, uh, should the courts not allow that? And then finally competency to be executed. The courts have held it before somebody can be executed. And we see this in the Ricky rector case, which we'll talk about in a moment. Uh, the question of does that person understand why they're being put to death?

Speaker 1:          11:27          Uh, and so all of these issues will be taking up. Uh, and then we have the question, even those without, and this particularly in capital cases, even those people without a diagnosable melanomas maybe profoundly damaged, uh, in terms of, uh, of their view of the world and so forth because they'd been physically abused, sexually abused, psychologically abused. They've lived in a, uh, grew up basically in a war zone, maybe within their home domestically because there was so much violence maybe in their community, uh, because there was a lot of violence, uh, maybe a person that's been injured even before they were born because the mother, uh, ingested alcohol during the pregnancy. And so they have fetal alcohol syndrome. And so that affects the way their brain works. And so how does that come into play, particularly when we come to the question of sentencing? Uh, and then we'll talk some about what are the challenges of representing someone, uh, who may have any of these disabilities that I've talked about.

Speaker 1:          12:28          How do we tell their story? Uh, it's very complicated in these cases and the death penalty cases because the people of course are accused of very serious crimes. Uh, this is not question like who's denied going to school or who's denied being able to live in a certain place just because their race. Race certainly plays a factor here. And as a, as we will see a very important factor, but also there's always going to be the argument this person committed. And particularly in the capital cases, this person committed a heinous crime, a terrible crime. Uh, and so often these cases, and one of the challenges these cases is so often they're caught up in the passions of the moment. Uh, and often, uh, we don't function our best when we're caught up in the, in the passions of the moment. And we don't always make the sound is decisions.

Speaker 1:          13:18          Um, so, uh, we'll also examine, uh, the death penalty, which was declared unconstitutional in 1982. We'll take that up in the next session. Uh, but then just four years later, the supreme court upheld the death toll. And so we'll look at the death penalty and what, uh, the court says is required to have a constitutional death penalty. What people can and cannot be sentenced to death, children, people with intellectual disabilities. Uh, those sorts of questions. And then what kind of procedures are required, uh, for a death penalty case. Uh, and then we'll look at the different people, uh, who play a role in this system, the prosecutor and the discretion exercised by the prosecutor and seeking the death penalty and deciding whether or not to resolve cases with plea bargains. Most cases are, and most death point cases are resolved with plea bargains, not with trials.

Speaker 1:          14:09          So we'll explore that. Uh, we're talking about the judges and the role that judges play, particularly judges who are elected, uh, and who have to stand for election every four or six years and how that might influence the way they look upon cases and how they decide legal issues. Because some decisions in death penalty cases if cost judges, uh, their jobs. Uh, we'll look also at the role of the defense lawyer, uh, and what, uh, how the quality of representation provided to a poor person accused of crime. The resources available to that lawyer, the ability of that lawyer to mount a defense on behalf of that person. And then we'll look at the way jury's function and other aspects of this system. Uh, as we, as we go, when we look at these legal issues, we want to think about what law applies, what constitutional provision are we talking about that we say governs this particular issue, what legal standards that does it establish.

Speaker 1:          15:05          And, and, and, and we'll, we'll go into that with regard to different subjects. But basically we're asking what must a party prove in order to prevail? Either what must the prosecution prove in order to prevail? Or what must the defense prove in order to, to when it's motion, uh, who has the burden of proof and what is that burden of proof, uh, and then what evidence is needed, uh, to, uh, provide, uh, to satisfy the burden of proof, uh, that has established, we'll deal with this in more detail as we deal with each of these subjects, but basically it gives you just some sense of how we want to look at these legal issues, uh, during, during the course. Um, I want to talk just a minute generally about sentencing, uh, because one of the questions that we're going to ask in this course is, uh, what is sentencing based upon?

Speaker 1:          15:56          What are the objectives of sentencing people to death or not sensing people to death? Uh, and how important is consistency in sentencing? Uh, if you look at the reasons people give for sentencing, one most primarily incapacitation that we want to take people out of the society, lock them up so that society is protected from any future danger sacks by that person to Terrance both to turn the individual, which is certainly a achieved by executing a person or putting a person in prison without any possibility of parole. But general deterrents, a very controversial subject, whether or not having the death penalty, uh, or other a very severe punishments, uh, has a general effect of deterring people from committing crimes. Uh, at one point, rehabilitation, uh, was seen as a major goal of sentencing. But today we have so many people in prison and such limited prison budgets that, uh, rehabilitation has fallen far down on the list.

Speaker 1:          16:59          Probably much higher should be retribution. A person gets there, just results. Uh, in terms of a, you did this crime, uh, here's what you do to pay for that crime. The others keep people off the streets, those kind of a rounding up the homeless people and all that other ways in which the criminal law is used. Uh, in other objectives that it has. Uh, but then the question, who decides who decides what objective we're seeking here and how to go about it? Theoretically, it's at the start, at least it's legislators because they're going to decide what laws to pass. They're going to decide what punishments to, uh, provide for those laws. Uh, some legislature, 17, do not provide for the death penalty at all. Uh, the others, uh, do provide for the death pony, also a mandatory minimums. So life imprisonment without parole. These are all sentences of the legislature, uh, may adopt.

Speaker 1:          17:56          Uh, the prosecutor has a great deal of discretion in deciding which laws are we going to enforce, how rigorously are we going to enforce those laws? And we'll talk about that more when we come to prosecution. Uh, what sentence is to seek both through trials and through plea negotiations, tremendous amount of power vested in the prosecutor with regard to how cases are resolved. Uh, and the judge, how much discretion does the judge have? We'll talk about judges, as I said earlier. Uh, and then we'll talk about juries and how juries are selected. Uh, and have a go about their decision making. But we realize that all this, that the legislature may have one purpose, uh, in passing a sentencing law, uh, the prosecutor may have a different purpose, uh, in deciding what punishment to seek in a case. Uh, and then the judge may have or the jury may have yet another.

Speaker 1:          18:55          And so if we have all these competing things, for example, we have a judge who believes in rehabilitation. This judge is going to be a more lenient sentence or perhaps where's the judge in the next courtroom, uh, is a strong believer in retribution, old strong believer in protecting the community. So that judge is going to be much more likely to impose a prison sentence and a severe prison sentence. We're going to see the same thing with regard to communities. Some communities as we will talk about later, uh, much more likely to impose the death penalty than others. Uh, and, and much of it has to do with how the community and the culture there, uh, sees the purpose of sentencing, uh, and how it should be dealt with, um, factors to consider. What do we take into account when we're deciding how to sentence people?

Speaker 1:          19:45          Uh, we obviously look at the crime, uh, the community. I don't think there's much question about these injuries, uh, that, uh, are, are the result, a injury to the person, to the community, the heinousness of the crime, the, uh, and then the question, how much do we look to the desires of the victims, uh, with regard to deciding? And then we look at some things with regard to the defendant, what, what's the defendant's prior record? Almost always going to be accounted for. Maybe age is going to be accounted for, but then do we get into things like mental limitations is, I was discussing earlier a potential for rehabilitation, adjustment to prison, a lot of controversy about what kinds of factors are to be considered. And then of course, also the question of does race, class politics, other extraneous factors, non extrovert, I guess I can call extra legal factors. Not legal reasons for imposing a particular punishment. But do they come into play as well? And we'll see very often,

Speaker 2:          20:48          uh, they do.
