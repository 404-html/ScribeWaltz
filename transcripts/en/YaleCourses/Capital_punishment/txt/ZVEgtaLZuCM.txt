Speaker 1:          00:11          Probably nothing is more critical to a fair trial and reliable verdict on either guilt or what penalty is imposed and the fairness and the impartiality of the judge presiding over a case. We presume that a judge is going to be fair, that the judge is not going to be pro prosecution and is not going to be a pro defendant, but it's going to call the, uh, legal issues that come up in the case. What evidence to admit, uh, what evidence might be suppressed because it was illegally seized or, or Taegan how to instruct the jury that all those decisions are going to be made fairly and impartially. Uh, by the same token, appellate judges are going to review what happens at trial, uh, to decide if there's been any error at the trial. Uh, that may require a reversal of the conviction or the sentence.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Sometimes judges cannot be fair and impartial. And I, a lot of times that's going to be obvious. Uh, the judge is related to one of the lawyers and one of the parties, uh, or for some other reason the judge, uh, disqualifies himself or herself. And so no issue is ever presented in the case, but there are going to be cases where the impartiality of the judge is going to be a closely contested. And we're look at a few of those cases, uh, today and how courts tried to sort them out. Uh, Supreme Court has said that the right to a fair and impartial judge means that the judge should have no temptation, uh, to forget the burden of proof and not hold the balance. Nice, clear, true, uh, between the prosecution and the defense. Uh, another way of putting that is a judge may be disqualified if the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned if an objective person knowing all the facts involved, uh, had a doubt about the judge's impartiality.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Then that judge had step aside and another judge who presided over the case where there's absolutely no question that the judge can be fair and impartial. One of the first cases where this came up was burger versus United States in this case, in the burger versus United States. Case involved just land justice Landis later to be the commissioner of baseball. Uh, the affidavit claim, the judge Landis had said, if anybody has anything worse to say about the Germans, or we'll say anything worse than I have, I liked to know what it is so I can use it myself. Uh, he said that German Americans, uh, hearts are reeking with disloyalty and that he knew a safe blower, uh, that he had given nine years, uh, and is now a soldier in France. Uh, and as between him and the defendant, in another case, uh, he would prefer the same floor.

Speaker 1:          02:59          Uh, this comment was made, uh, at a time when there was a great deal of, uh, uh, hostile feeling towards Germany during World War One. A lot of hostile feeling towards German and people of German descent and Victor Burger, the defendant in this particular case was of German descent and also was a socialist, uh, actually elected to Congress, uh, as a socialist. Uh, and he, and, uh, the codefendants in this case, we're saying that with these kinds of attitudes, judge land is, could be fair and impartial in their case. Uh, and so that affidavit has filed. Judge Landis denies it, refuses to take himself off the case. That goes to the Supreme Court, which says, first of all, with regard to deciding the question, the affidavit must be presented under penalty of perjury. In other words, if the person who says that judge land has said these things is lying about it, he or she can be prosecuted for perjury or if it's a lawyer, they can be disbarred.

Speaker 1:          04:01          And the court said that's going to be some protection against frivolous efforts to get judges off the case. And it must state facts, not, not rumors or gossip, but facts that show bias on the part of the judge. Uh, the judge when getting an affidavit like this and a motion to disqualify the judge simply looks at the affidavit. And based upon what it says and assuming the facts to be true, the judge can't say, I deny every single fact. You said here the judge looks at it. And if it appears that the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, it's their responsibility to judge, step off the case, recused themselves, and let another judge, uh, take over the case. Go no further. Let the case be assigned to another judge. That's what the Supreme Court held here. Uh, the prosecution or the defense may know of bias on the part of a judge.

Speaker 1:          04:56          The judges also have a duty to disclose any bias under the code of judicial conduct, which this is the Aba model code. Now, each state has its own version of this, but there's not much difference. A rule two point 11 says the judge would disqualify himself or herself in any proceedings in which the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned what I've talked about. So the judge has the first responsibility to disqualify. If the judge doesn't disqualify, then the affidavit is file, like the one in burger versus United States. The judge passes upon it. The procedure may be very different, uh, in the state courts, uh, where there may be a hearing by another judge, there may be evidence taken, there may be more development of the record and some determination of the truth or false, a falsity of the allegations. Uh, but that's going to vary from place to place, uh, among, uh, so what kind of disqualifying by biases might adjudge have a personal opinion?

Speaker 1:          06:02          The judge has already made up his or her mind. Somebody supported the judge and the campaign gave a lot of money. Maybe it was the judge's campaign manager and is now the lawyer for one side. Uh, one case involved a claim of race discrimination and the judge made the comment outside of court, well, I know that person and that person would never discriminate. Well, if the judge thinks that, then the judge shouldn't be sitting on that case. And so another judge a w would decide that case because that personal relationship, uh, sometimes the judges have knowledge of the facts, uh, such as being a witness or otherwise knowing facts about the case which might disqualify them. Uh, usually this has to be extra judicial knowledge, not knowledge the judge gained in presiding over the case, but knowledge the judge has from outside, uh, which is not properly considered.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Uh, in the case, uh, misconduct during the trial, uh, very seldom is a case going to be reversed because of a judge's misconduct during the trial. That is the judge berates one lawyer humiliates the lawyer, uh, rules against the lawyer all the time. The, the remedy for that, the courts say most of the time is to appeal a conviction. Uh, but that may be a very unsatisfactory remedy because of court of appeals may very well say, well, what the judge did was improper and wrong, but it wasn't harmful enough that we're going to reverse the conviction. So they're, the defendant is with no relief for what happened during the trial. Um, pecuniary interest a, this is the probably the easiest one. If a judge gets some money out of the deal, then obviously a judge can't really be fair and impartial. Some cases where the judges would give part of the fine.

Speaker 1:          07:53          So a defendant comes before the judge on a traffic matter, say, and if the judge imposes a, a fine, a percentage of the fine goes to the judge. A supreme court says you can't do that. Uh, because obviously the judge has an incentive to find people guilty and find them since the judge is getting a cut of whatever fines are being brought in. Uh, in the Ed and the life insurance, a case, it was a little bit different. It was a case about, uh, insurance companies, uh, and one of the judges on the Alabama Supreme Court got a pretty good settlement in a case as a result of that very decision. And the Supreme Court said, no, that violates due process because the judge had to direct the culinary benefit, uh, from the case. That's not going to be the case in criminal cases generally. Um, want to talk a little bit about racial bias, which is one other, uh, kind of bias that is not raised a whole lot, but it is often present in cases in the morning to look at a couple of three cases here where it was raised.

Speaker 1:          08:57          Uh, it may be behavior off the bench, such as the Louisiana judge who wore blackface to a Halloween party a and said he didn't mean to offend anyone. Uh, but he was sent to a, uh, uh, some sort of sensitivity class and was allowed to become a judge. Uh, the judge in North Carolina who made a lot of racist jokes, uh, had to step down as chief judge, but continued to stay on the bench as a judge despite questions raised about the judge's ability to be fair and impartial in cases involving, uh, African American defendants peak versus Florida, uh, was a case in which the Florida Supreme Court after reversing the case for a era that took place during the sentencing phase, the trial noted that the judge in referring to the defendant's family had used a racial slur, uh, in describing them. Uh, and the court said, just for future guidance, uh, we're telling judges that you should avoid the appearance of impropriety.

Speaker 1:          10:01          Uh, this judge, had he been a sportscaster or had he been some prominent public figure, would almost certainly have lost his job. But as a judge, uh, he is just simply told, keep your racist thoughts to yourself, uh, and tomorrow and the next day and every day from now. And he can preside over cases despite having shown this racial bias. In this one particular case where there are two cases out of Missouri, both decided the same year, uh, state versus smalls and state versus Kender, uh, both involve issues of race, racial bias on the part of the judges. In one case, the Missouri Supreme Court fines, racial bias. And in the other case it doesn't. Let's take a look at those cases and whether there's a difference in what happened. Uh, the first case, uh, was smalls here you had judge Karagan who is presiding over the jury selection process and the defense lawyer is making an assertion that the prosecution is striking jurors on the basis of race.

Speaker 1:          11:08          And so the defense lawyer wants to make a record of every person. The prosecutor struck whether that person was black or white. And when the defense lawyer as the judge to note that one juror is African American, the judge says, I don't know what it is to be black. Uh, I don't know what constitute black. Uh, there's some dark complected people and the jury, but I don't know if that makes them black or not. I don't know. Uh, what constitutes is by years ago they used to say one drop of blood, uh, constitutes black smallest raises this on appeal saying the judges just qualified because these remarks that were made in responding to this, she'll racial bias, uh, on the part a of the judge, a judge white rights for the majority of the only African American on the Missouri Supreme Court. Uh, and frames the question this way, whether there's an objective basis upon which a reasonable person could have a doubt about the racial impartiality of the trial judge in this particular case, uh, points out that, uh, the context of this statement that was made was in the midst of a race centered issue.

Speaker 1:          12:22          In fact, the issue here was, was there discrimination against black people? Uh, and also, uh, the descending opinion accuses the majority being hypersensitive. But justice white judge white says, ah, this is just simply acknowledging that prejudice is very often subtle. It, it's not as blatant as it used to be. A, but when we see this kind of coded language used and see the judge obviously resistant to a supreme court decision, which had said that there couldn't be discrimination against blacks, and he's basically saying, I don't even know what black is. I don't know how we can tell who's black and who's white in this situation. Given the context, given what the judge said, the one drop of blood, all of that, the judge is disqualified from any further proceedings. In this case, a judge limbo, descents, uh, he says the trial judge's insensitive, but he's not racially biased.

Speaker 1:          13:19          This is what often is the response to claims of racial bias that it's insensitivity. Uh, and uh, limbo says the judge was just having difficulty figuring out who was black and who was white, uh, in the jury pool. Um, the next case, the Kender case, uh, Brian Kender that justice limbo. We'll be writing a and we will see that much of what the court said in smalls is going to be a set aside or, or, or the law in this area is going to be rewritten. A just a short time later, uh, with judge, uh, limbo in the majority. Here's what happened in kinder kinder's about to go to trial and a death penalty case. Uh, six days, Brian kinders and African American, six days before trial, the trial judge, Judge Blackbaud beside announces that he is changing political parties. He's running for reelection that year and he says that he is switching from the democratic to the Republican parties because the Democratic Party places too much emphasis on minorities such as homosexuals, people who don't want to work and people whose skin is any color but white.

Speaker 1:          14:38          And he says it's time for us to place much more emphasis on the hardworking taxpayers in this country. Uh, Kender says, wait a minute, and I'm facing trial six days from now. The judge is basically said that the Democratic Party represents homosexuals. People don't want to work and people whose skin is any colored black, uh, and suggesting that he has for the hardworking taxpayers. Uh, this suggests an appeal to race, which shows the racial bias and therefore he should be disqualified. Again, context is important here because head this, a press release been issued it no significant time, uh, it might've been seen as a bit distasteful, but, but, but not as relevant to a legal issue. But here it's issue just six days before a capital trial. Well, as I said, ah, now judge Limbaugh's writing, uh, for the majority and he says recusal was not required. One because we presume the judges act with honesty and integrity and making their decision.

Speaker 1:          15:46          Judge Black Wall had said at one point, uh, that everybody is absolutely entitled to their constitutional rights, whether they're yellow, red, white or Polka dot, which may be suggested a certain amount of sarcasm there. Uh, according to judge Limba, uh, the judge did in fact give a fair trial. So he was true to his word. He gave a fair trial. Uh, and in this distinction that the press release that was issued was a political act, that it was not a judicial act but a political act and therefore it didn't come into play. Uh, and the limbo now wants to distinguish the smallest case by saying the reason the judge and smalls was disqualified was because he wouldn't follow the law. Because in, in this race discrimination case, he wouldn't recognize the race of a juror, uh, and wouldn't follow the law. A judge, judge white who wrote smalls takes issue with that.

Speaker 1:          16:46          Uh, in his dissent, he calls the press release a pernicious racial stereotype, race baiting nonsense, uh, suggesting that minorities are not hardworking people. Uh, and that you can't disregard this, uh, just simply because the judge says that he can be fair. Judges will often say they can be fair. The question is whether a reasonable person looking at the facts would think the judge did or did not harbor any bias. Chris would kinders worried about is that the judge running for reelection, having now a changed political parties may be tempted and remember that that standard, whether the temptation is not to hold a balance, nice, true and clear between the defendant in the state, whether there's now a temptation to use this capital trial and the rulings in this capital trial in a way that will help the judges, uh, political fortunes. Um, he also says the majority mischaracterizes his opinion and smalls that it wasn't about a willingness to follow the law.

Speaker 1:          17:49          It was that a judge be free from the appearance of racial prejudice against a defendant or any racial group. You also suggest that what Judge Blackwell did in issuing this pressure release was perhaps more egregious than what happened in smalls and smalls. The judge has an outburst in the middle of jury selection. When the lawyer says, uh, I want you to recognize that this juror is black and the judge goes off and says, I don't know what black is and goes into that, uh, those words we looked at a moment ago. Whereas here, uh, this is a press release, a, this is an appeal to the voters. This is something that's put together, that's proof read, that's a refined, uh, and then announced at a press conference, uh, and is actually a stronger indication. Justice White's suggests then, um, the, the what happened and, and smalls, uh, but he's all by himself, just as white as all by himself and dissent in this case.

Speaker 1:          18:53          So these cases are decided by the Missouri Court, uh, and um, do not see this kind of issue come up very often, uh, but probably should be raised, uh, more often. Uh, this brings us to our next issue, which is political pressures on judges. Uh, our political acts and political considerations, uh, uh, separate from judicial acts and the federal courts. The judges are appointed by the president, United States and subject to confirmation by the Senate. Once they're confirmed there, they have their jobs for life. They may be ambitious and they may want to move to a higher court or they may want some other, uh, political advancement, but at least they are secure in the jobs they have not. So in the state courts in the state courts or judges run for election every four, six years. Some states the judges are up for retention election.

Speaker 1:          19:50          That is just a vote, yes or no, whether to keep that judge in office or not, or judges run head on. And states like Alabama and Texas, uh, judges run under party labels, Democrat, Republican, uh, against each other. Uh, and as we will see where the full array of campaign advertisements which are growing and growing and growing, as the amount of money funneled into judicial campaigns increases, uh, with every election cycle. Uh, so, uh, before one election, uh, voters in Alabama saw this advertisement, which involved a young lawyer who's getting a call from the chief justice of the State Supreme Court.

Speaker 2:          20:40          Tom Is Chief Justice Warren. Judge Warren's been well, good morning to you, sir. You won't bond $500 for you campaign from each member of the phone. Well, now you know, judge, we do have a case panning and your court, it doesn't matter. Yes sir. I'll get the money up to you right away, sir.

Speaker 1:          21:06          Well, I'd imagine that it would be a little disturbing to people to think of judges, whether it be the chief judge or any other judge dialing a lawyer who has a case before that judge for money for their campaign. Uh, but today it's quite frequent. In fact, today it's not unusual for a camp candidate for a state Supreme Court to have a fundraiser, uh, sponsored by prominent lawyers who have cases before that judge for the judge to come. Sometimes the fundraisers are held at law firms, uh, or maybe held, uh, somewhere else, but the judge may calm and shake hands and thank people for making the contribution. So there's no secret about who is supporting that. These committees of people, usually prominent lawyers from all different walks of life who are supporting the judge. Uh, so the question comes when you, when you have that kind of financial support, that kind of public support for the judge, can a judge still be fair and impartial?

Speaker 1:          22:05          Uh, and judges are generally going to face far greater attacks than what chief justice Hornsby faced. Uh, it's not just going to be a matter of whether they solicited cane being called out for soliciting campaign funds. Uh, the generally, uh, it's going to be about decisions the judges made in criminal cases. Very often these cases are really, are these elections are really a fight between the business community that it's interested on caps on punitive damages and civil cases, uh, or, or other civil matters. And between the plaintiff's Bar, uh, which does none of that is the lawyers representing people who are suing insurance companies or businesses or whoever, and they're trying to win as much money as they can. But the campaigns aren't about that. The campaigns are most often about issues of criminal justice. And A, we're looking at one, uh, penny white, uh, voted off the Tennessee Supreme Court.

Speaker 1:          23:06          Uh, this was a retention election in which shortly before the election, uh, suddenly, uh, people started to get mail that said that penny white had voted to free, uh, this man, uh, Odom who had committed this awful crime. In fact, the court had not freed him. It had just simply reversed his death since and sent the case back for a re sentencing where he was against sentence to death. But judges had been voted off the courts a number of times, particularly for their votes in death penalty cases. Uh, three in California in 1986 and since then on the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, uh, the Mississippi Supreme Court Justice White, uh, and of course locally that has happened as well. A trial judge in a local community, maybe three or four counties, uh, has to know that if he or she makes a controversial ruling or an unpopular rolling, uh, in a death penalty case, it could very well cost him the election, uh, when, when they run for reelection, that if they rule in favor of a defendant in a capital case, no matter how clear the law is, that that ruling is required.

Speaker 1:          24:17          Uh, they may be signing their own political death warrant if they do that. Uh, 2010 chief justice of Illinois was on the ballot for retention election. A yes or no election. Uh, business interests a raised about $670,000 for the campaign against him. Uh, but the campaign wasn't about business interest as as we'll see in a moment. Uh, Kale Brides, a committee raised 2.8 million. 1.4 of that came from the Democratic Party at about a 460,000 from the, uh, Illinois Federation of teachers. Uh, quite a bit of money spent on a retention election and most of it went into 32nd ads. Uh, there were many ads and many ads about crime, but here are some actors portraying, uh, inmates in prison. And one of the ads that was run against, uh, chief justice Kilbride.

Speaker 3:          25:18          I was convicted of stabbing victims with a kitchen knife or shooting my ex girlfriend and murdering her sister in front of our child of sexual assault on a mom and her 10 year old daughter. And I slashed her throat. It's on appeal. Justice Thomas Kilbride side with us over law enforcement or victims. Other judges overruled Kilbride in our appeals were denied.

Speaker 4:          25:37          Kilbride chose criminals rights over and over again. We more than any other justice. No. On retention of Thomas Kilbride vote down, bounce. It's a top priority.

Speaker 1:          25:48          Kilbride had many ads run against him saying that he put a criminals over. Victims are criminals over other people. Uh, the next dad was running against Louis Butler, the old way African American on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Uh, and look for the racial implications of this ad. Again, uh, the sort of a theme that ran through the campaign against Butler was that he was loophole Louis, that he always found a loophole to get criminals off on

Speaker 4:          26:20          unbelievable shadowy special interest supporting Louis Butler are attacking judge Michael Gable woman. It's not true. Judge District Attorney Michael Gable make has committed his life to loving up criminals, to keep families safe, putting child molesters behind bars. For over a hundred years, Louis Butler worked to put criminals on the street like Reuben Lee Mitchell who raped an 11 year old girl with learning disabilities. Butler found a loophole. Mitchell went on to molest another child. Can Wisconsin families feel safe with Louis Butler on the Supreme Court?

Speaker 1:          26:52          This was a very misleading ad. Uh, Butler did not rule on Mitchell's case as a member of the Wisconsin Supreme Court. He had represented Mitchell when he was a public defender long ago, early in his career before he became a member of the court. Second, Mitchell did not get off on a loophole. He served his entire sentence, uh, in prison. And also notice at the end of that add the merger of the faces of Reuben Lee Mitchell, the criminal with Louis Butler, both black men both wearing glasses. And this sort of almost like butler, uh, is a personification or the representation of Mitchell, uh, to the voters of Wisconsin. A gay woman, uh, beat Butler in this election, uh, and now sits on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Uh, will these kinds of ads raise lots of questions about how judges behave, both what influence it has on their, uh, seeking office, what they're willing to promise to get office.

Speaker 1:          28:04          And there are two things that we're concerned about here. One, how do we get the best judges? Uh, are we better off for the nominating commission that tries to just select people on the UN on the basis of merit? They're always going to be politics involved and there will be there too. Uh, but that's a system that some states have. Uh, or are we better off with a, uh, an election system in which anybody can run for judge and we have a knockdown drag out campaign. It's pretty much decided on the basis of 32nd ads at least statewide campaigns. Sorry. Now that wouldn't be as true for a local judicial election. But the second question is how once a person is on the bench, however they got there, how do we make it possible for the judge to decide the case on the law to decide the case based on the law, without any fear that if the judge calls it as the law requires that the judge is going to remain an office and has the, uh, the, the protection, uh, that an unpopular ruling, uh, will not be a basis for, uh, being voted out of office.

Speaker 1:          29:08          Judges are not like legislators, presidents, other people who are supposed to represent the public will a responsibility of, of judges to uphold the law even when it's unpopular, a free speech. And even when somebody hasn't very unpopular thing to say, the judge's responsibility is to say under the First Amendment, the United States constitution, you have a right to say these things are to parade in this area or to publish this newspaper, whatever it may be. And by the same token, in criminal cases, when there's a tremendous amount of the and the prejudices of the moment coming into the judicial process, it's the judge's responsibility to hold back those forces to grant the change of venue, uh, maybe to another jurisdiction, although that may, that may make the judges constituents unhappy because they wanted to decide that case or to continue the case until a later time after some of the passion has died down, a number of decisions that judges are going to be made, uh, making, uh, that may or may not be influenced by politics. Well, I'll end this series of ads with one of the most upbeat ads, uh, that's running the last few years. This was sue bell cob, a running for chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court

Speaker 3:          30:24          Zoo. Bill Cobb was raised in Evergreen, Alabama and sue bill cubs values her faith, her family shine brighter every day. She graduated at the top of her class and with honors from law school and became judge sue Belcamp, a pioneer for women judges and Alabama history. She put thousands of criminals in jail. Per House was fire bombed, but judge sue bell carb only grew stronger, more determined. She served 40 counties and today judge Sue Bell Club decides life. While all those years outside the courtroom, judge sue bell Cobb became a state and national leader, a reformer helping children stay out of jail. The southern woman kind and caring, strong and determined. Judge Sue Bell copic is our chief justice should be

Speaker 1:          31:24          pretty good advertisement for use in the Bible belt. Uh, also as I said, one of the few positive advertisements and that year, uh, on the entire Ballard in Alabama, the only Democrat who got elected to anything with Subo Cobb, who got elected chief justice of Alabama, she later a retired as chief justice, but she did a win that election. So at times, uh, a positive approach, although there were plenty of negative ads as well, uh, that ran in that election cycle. Uh, but, uh, uh, that ad was seen as having played a big role in her success as being elected to the cork. Whether or not that's what should be deciding who sits on our courts or not is the question I will leave for you to think about the independence of the judiciary. The judges are independent that they decide cases based on the law and the facts without any other political, financial, any other, uh, influence whatsoever.

Speaker 1:          32:25          Uh, is one of the most important issues in our society today, uh, is justice for sale. Uh, are good people discouraged from being judges because they don't want to go through these elections with these negative ads. They don't want to have the one case that they decided in which, and of course the court is always going to reverse some case. So if you go back through a judge's whole record, you're going to be able to find some case where the judge set aside a conviction who take that one case, blow it all out of proportion, and suggest that that case, like what penny white to the Odom case was everything that justice white stood for, uh, over her long career, uh, as a both a trial, a judge, as an appellate judge, uh, in, in Tennessee, uh, money in politics are at odds with a fair and impartial judiciary. But today, money and politics play a greater and greater role, uh, in who's elected to the bench and who presides over cases. And it has a big effect on the fairness of trials and on the behavior of appellate judges in deciding whether to affirm or to set aside a death penalty case or any other criminal case because of a constitutional violation.
