Speaker 1:          00:11          One of the most controversial areas in this very controversial subject of capital punishment has been the admission of victim impact evidence, a testimony and other evidence about the impact of the crime on the victim, the person who was killed as well as on the survivors of the victim, the family of the victim. And uh, the impact on the community. Uh, this kind of evidence was admissible and non capital cases, uh, for some time, uh, when the death penalty was reinstated, uh, are often precense reports that would be prepared. And part of the pre sentence report would say what the impact had been. Uh, these are both in homicide cases, but also non homicide cases. What the impact had been, uh, on the victims, how much money they lost, whether they suffered any injuries, what their hospital bills were. Uh, that kind of evidence. Uh, but the most states had not provided for that kind of evidence in their capital cases.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Uh, but one of the exceptions was was Maryland. Uh, the Supreme Court is going to say in 1987 that it's not admissible in a case out of Maryland, which was about the only or one of very few states that was allowing a victim impact evidence in the penalty phase of capital cases. Uh, but then very shortly after that, the court would reverse itself in, in 1991. So we'll look at both these decisions, uh, and some of the questions raised by the admission a victim impact evidence that the first case, uh, was, uh, John Booth case out of Maryland booth versus Maryland. Uh, and a written victim impact statement was, uh, presented, which had the, uh, outstanding personal characteristics, uh, of the victim was one of the things that was presented that urban Bronstein 78 and his wife, rose, uh, were robbed and murdered in their West Baltimore home. Uh, the statement was read by the prosecutor, uh, that talked about their qualities.

Speaker 1:          02:09          Uh, also talked about the emotional and personal problems that family members had as a result of the crime. For example, their son, uh, suffered from depression and had trouble sleeping. Uh, he was fearful for the first time in his life. Uh, and he, he characterized the crime by saying that his parents were butchered, like animals. Uh, the daughter, uh, suffered also from lack of sleep and become withdrawn and distrustful a and said she could not forgive booth for having committed this horrible crime. Uh, and then a granddaughter said that the murderer had just completely ruined a wedding in the family because, uh, it had happened, uh, right after, uh, the wedding had happened right after this terrible crime. Uh, and she also said she received counseling but gave up on it because she didn't think anything would do her any good. So very powerful evidence.

Speaker 1:          03:04          Now, this was not presented through the witnesses as it often is today. Uh, it was presented by the prosecutor reading this statement that had been prepared by a, a pre sentence report writer, uh, the Supreme Court, uh, uh, as I said, the opinions and characterizations by the family members as well, uh, was part of what the, what was included in that statement. Uh, in the case Justice Powell rights for a very close five to four majority, uh, in the opinion two types of victim impact evidence that comes in. Uh, and the question is, uh, first of all, uh, relevance is the impact evidence relevant to the decision that the jury makes about imposing the license life imprisonment without possibility of parole or the death tunneling. Uh, and Justice Powell, uh, expresses the concern, uh, that admitting ms kind of evidence could result in imposing the death sins, uh, because of factors about which the defendant did not know, uh, wasn't aware of things, uh, about the, the victim of the case if it was a stranger, uh, and, uh, this would, uh, bring irrelevant factors into the sentencing decisions.

Speaker 1:          04:20          Uh, and so he said this creates an impermissible risk, uh, that capital punishment, uh, resulted, uh, was imposed in an arbitrary manner and violated the eighth amendment. Uh, he also talked about the evidence being, uh, very hard to rebut a that you would end up with a distracting the jury because there would be a mini trial, uh, on the victim. Uh, and that should not be allowed as well. Uh, with regard to the second type of evidence, the characterizations of the crimes, uh, justice Powell holes, uh, that they can serve no other purpose except to inflame the jury and divert it from deciding the case based upon the relevant aggravating mitigating circumstances about the crime and about the defendant. Um, this draws a strong, uh, descent, uh, and we'll look at that because this is ultimately going to be the prevailing view of the court.

Speaker 1:          05:18          Justice White, uh, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and justice O'Connor and Justice Scalia dissent, uh, their first point point that we see from time to time, uh, is the question of what's a judicial question and what's for the legislatures to decide. And they basically say there's nothing in the eighth amendment to the United States constitution that prohibits Maryland's legislature from deciding that juries can consider this kind of evidence, uh, that we hold a murder accountable for the harm that was caused. Uh, of course gives, justice has given a number of examples. If a person shoots a and Mrs, uh, they're guilty of one crime. If they have the same intent and shoot and hit and kill a person, uh, there's a completely different punishment for it. Uh, so the court says we do measure the harm caused not just the intent of the person, not just the act of the person, but what harm is caused.

Speaker 1:          06:13          Uh, they also say that the state has an interest in, uh, balancing out the mitigating circumstances that they've now allowed the defendant to put on anything in mitigation. And therefore the state should be able to counter that with evidence about the victims. Uh, and finally, uh, the difference, one of the questions that Justice Powell raises, we'll, some survivors are going to be much more articulate, much better able to describe their loss and their loved one than other people. Uh, justice white's says for the dissenters, uh, this is true of all kinds of evidence that, that often, uh, witnesses, some witnesses are better than others and some prosecutions, the prosecution witnesses are better than they are in other prosecutions. That's just the nature of the court system. Uh, well, uh, the court is going to reverse itself a, just a short time later, they did affirm, uh, or excuse me, reverse one other case, gay.

Speaker 1:          07:11          There's versus South Carolina, uh, based upon booth. Uh, but now we see a change in the members of the court. Justice Powell, who wrote booth retires from the court and he's replaced by Justice Kennedy in 1987. Uh, the court reaffirms booth and gathers a and justice white who descended in booth joins the majority opinion, just basically saying, I'm bound by booth and therefore, uh, I'm, I'm going to vote to reverse in this particular case. Uh, but then Justice Brennan retires a and he's replaced by Justice Souter in 1990. Uh, and no sooner had just as sooner joined the court, then the court grants search Harare, uh, in a case out of Tennessee, uh, purpose Tyrone pain versus the state of Tennessee. And now the court overrules booth, uh, six to three for basically the same reasons, uh, that the dissenters expressed, uh, in booth versus Maryland. Uh, pain is a very, uh, terrible crime.

Speaker 1:          08:14          Uh, the, uh, killed a mother and one of her children, uh, and the victim impact evidence was, uh, the mother of the victim testifying about Nicholas, the son of the victim, how he has been affected by the loss of his mother and by the loss of his sister. Uh, and she testifies the grandmother of Nicholas testifies that he cries for his mother. That he doesn't seem to understand why she doesn't come home. He's only three years old. He cries for his sister, Lacey. He comes to her often and says, where is lacy? Uh, I missed my lacy. I'm worried about Lacey. Uh, and then the prosecutors in the closing argument, uh, ask the jurors to do something for Nicholas. I say, one of these days, Nicholas is going to be old enough. He's going to understand what happened to his mother. He's going to understand what happened to his sibling, and he will want to know that justice was done.

Speaker 1:          09:09          Uh, and so, uh, basically bring home the death penalty so that, uh, Nicholas where Mel, that, uh, the Supreme Court at Tennessee upheld this even though it appears to pretty clearly violate a booth versus Maryland, uh, pain petitioned the Supreme Court for review it granted it, but not too rural for pain. But to take this opportunity to overrule a booth, uh, chief justice Rehnquist rights for the court. And as I said, these, this is going to be based on the same reasons, uh, that the court, the same reasons set out in the descents, uh, in, in, uh, in booth. Uh, the states may decide there's no restriction in the constitution on the states deciding, uh, what evidence can be admitted and the states can decide to show the harm caused by the defendant. Uh, and also the states can counter the mitigating circumstances by showing what the harm was to the victim.

Speaker 1:          10:06          In other words, almost exactly what justice white had said in dissent and booth is now the opinion of the majority of the Supreme Court. Meaning this evidence is going to be admitted. Um, justice O'Connor, uh, because a lot of people, including the dissenters in this case, Justice Marshall and, uh, particularly in just a Stevens and Blackman, uh, express so much concern rights to sort of, uh, deal with that. Uh, she says, state may decide that a jury before imposing the death pony can provide, let the jury know the full extent of the harm, uh, including its impact on the victim and the victim's family. Uh, and also that the jury can have a quick glimpse. She says, of the life the petitioner chose to extinguished to remind the jury that the person whose life was taken, uh, was a human being. Uh, but you also says this can't be too inflammatory.

Speaker 1:          11:06          If the, if the evidence is too emotional, if it's too inflammatory, it could make the trial a fundamentally unfair. Uh, there are other concurring opinions, but, uh, basically the, the six, uh, carry the day, uh, just as Marshall, this was justice Marshall his last day, uh, sitting as a supreme court justice. It was a very last setting of the term, uh, and he was not happy. Uh, he thundered, uh, in his, uh, descending opinion that power not reason is the currency, uh, that underlies the court's decision making. He pointed out that since booth had been decided, nothing had changed with regard to the law, the only thing that had changed was the composition of the court, which I outlined just a few minutes ago. Uh, and that there was no reason that the court should reverse itself and go back and overrule a booth versus Maryland. Uh, justice Stevens also descendant joined by Justice Blackmun.

Speaker 1:          12:03          Um, and he said, in our law, the prosecutor has never been allowed, uh, to introduce, uh, evidence that went beyond the guilt in the moral blame worthiness or culpability of the person on trial. He suggest that this victim impact evidence serves no other purpose except to, um, uh, weigh in favor of the death penalty without really being relevant, without providing the jury with anything about either the crime or the, uh, the defendant, uh, that can be taken into account, uh, and that it invites the courts to decide or juries to decide these cases based upon emotion rather than reason. Uh, so, uh, strong dissents, uh, strong divisions in the court from the time booth has decided until the time pain is decided. But once pain is decided, the court pretty much leaves this to the lower courts, uh, to decide what evidence is going to be admitted or not.

Speaker 1:          13:04          Uh, justice Stevens also points out a that it can't be applied consistently, uh, in different cases because, uh, of, uh, circumstances that are unforeseen, uh, by, by the defendant. Uh, basically, uh, there are a number of questions that are remaining that remain after pain that are being sorted out by state supreme courts and to some extent by federal courts. Uh, what evidence is admissible the court, some courts have said that if you look at the decisions and in pain and in booth that while the court said that the impact evidence, the impact on the survivors and the community, uh, and, uh, some indication of who the person was that was killed, is it miscible that the, uh, characterizations of the crime by the, uh, victim's families should not be allowed to or their opinions about what sentence should be imposed. We see that in one of the cases in the readings from Oklahoma, uh, that's really the, the, uh, most courts have said that characterizations of the crime, uh, and opinions about the evidences is not going to be admitted.

Speaker 1:          14:14          But on the other hand, uh, and a federal death penalty case battle versus United States, uh, guards at a federal penitentiary where battle had murdered a guard, uh, testified, uh, with regard to what the impact was and what the impact would be if he did not receive the death Polly, that it would be bad for morale. Uh, at the prison, a United States Court of Appeals for the 11th circuit upheld that testimony. Um, uh, other, uh, concerns, uh, different classes of victims, uh, Justice Robert Benjamin has descending opinion in Livingston, uh, was concerned, uh, about the fact that race and class would be taken into account because already, uh, these may be factors that come into play when a prosecutor decides whether to seek the death penalty or whether to plea bargain a case and resolve a case with a plea bargain in a, in a sentence less than death.

Speaker 1:          15:08          And now with the family of the victim testifying, uh, justice been worries that there's going to be, uh, again, race and class factors entering into this process. Um, when is the evidence too prejudicial, uh, when it's weighed against, uh, the probative value, that is what it, what it helps the jury understand about the victim and about the impact. Uh, but when does this evidence become prejudicial? And of course, this can be very emotional evidence. Some courts, like Georgia has said that before this evidence is admitted, uh, there has to be hearing, there has to be testimony and some determination of how, uh, emotional and whether the evidence might be prejudicial. On the other hand, in other states, uh, quite extensive, uh, evidence and characterizations by family members. And I'm a very emotional testimony has been admitted, uh, and upheld by the courts there. Um, does the G, how, how does the jury consider, uh, the victim impact evidence?

Speaker 1:          16:17          Uh, the jury, uh, it's told you way aggravating against mitigating some of the jury instructions, say the victim impact evidence is not an aggravating factor. Uh, but then the question comes, what is it? Uh, a lot of the jury instructions say that, uh, what it is is it tells you what the harm done by the defendant was a, and it's to be considered for that purpose only, but pretty clearly, uh, victim impact evidence is going to weigh on the aggravating side of the scale, uh, when a jury is deciding whether or not to impose a life or death.

Speaker 1:          16:53          So two things we would, I would just say in closing about victim impact evidence, first of all, what the Supreme Court has said is that it never has to be admitted. It's up to the states to decide. So in a state that didn't have a law providing for victim impact evidence, uh, that, that evidence would not be admitted. However, what the court says is if a state chooses to have a law allowing victim impact evidence, there's nothing in the constitution of the United States that would prevent that evidence from being considered a. And then the only question is whether or not a, it's too prejudicial. Justice Stevens, uh, and Kelly versus California express some concern that a videotape which was narrated a description of the young woman's life who was killed, narrated by her mother with very evocative background music might go over the line, uh, in terms of victim impact evidence.

Speaker 1:          17:46          Uh, but, uh, that kind of evidence is, and a lot of cases in California and another parts, uh, of the country, some states still don't have victim impact evidence. But once booth was decided, as I said at the start, uh, before booth versus Maryland, most states that had the death pony did not admit victim impact evidence. However, after Payne versus Tennessee, uh, state's, uh, almost, uh, all the states that had the death penalty pass laws allowing a victim impact evidence. And in many jurisdictions, now it's a part of the capital sentencing process. The jury hears about aggravating circumstances. Here's about mitigating circumstances. And also, uh, here's, and the prosecution's case about the impact of the crime on the victim, who the victim was and how the family, the survivors, uh, and the community were affected by it. So this is very powerful evidence. Uh, court first says it's not miserable, but ultimately, uh, it is, and, uh, these questions remain, uh, and are being decided by, as I said, state and federal courts as we go forward.
