Speaker 1:          00:11          As we've discussed, a person who has sentenced to death, who is raised there, uh, appeal their case and lost in the state courts has gone to the state courts in post conviction proceedings lost. They're the last hope for that person is to file in the United States district court for wherever they are from a appeal to the United States Court of Appeals, uh, under Federal Habeas Corpus. Uh, and as we've talked about, uh, the courts have restricted the availability of Habeas Corpus Justice Brennan and had a very wide view that habeas corpus should be available as long as the person didn't intentionally a bypass the state procedures. Uh, but soon after that justice Rehnquist tighten that up a great deal and said, unless the person complied with every procedural rule, uh, raised the issue at the right time at trial, raised the issue on appeal, gave the same constitutional arguments there that are now being inserted in federal court.

Speaker 1:          01:08          The federal court would not look at that. I want to talk just a little while about how the federal statute was amended in 1996 to restrict even further a review of state death penalty cases by federal courts. And then talk just a little bit about the standards of review and the burdens of proof, uh, that courts utilize in deciding these cases. Uh, in 1996, the Habeas Corpus statute was a minute and a number of ways and I'm only going to talk about a couple that are particularly important. There are others in the materials that, that you can look at, but these are the ones that really made a huge difference. First of all, a one year statute of limitations. There had never been a statue of limitations on Habeas Corpus in the history of the country. So you had people who might've been in prison, let's say in a non capital case like Rubin, Hurricane Carter.

Speaker 1:          01:59          If you've ever seen the movie, the hurricane, uh, he didn't get Habeas Corpus relief until 20 years into his sentence. Uh, many other people often, uh, later in the time that they had served would find lawyers who had worked on their cases or they'd finally figured it out themselves in the law library. Uh, and they, uh, get relief. Now one year, uh, once the case is final on direct appeal, the person has one year to file in federal court. If they go into the state courts in the state post conviction process, the time will be held for the time they're in the state court. In other words, if they wait six months and then file a state post conviction, uh, application, and that's litigated through the state courts for the next, say, two, three years, uh, when that is final, when the state Supreme Court has finally ruled on that, uh, then the person has six months left.

Speaker 1:          02:53          Uh, and of course, if you wait until the last minute, uh, you can be in big trouble there. And lawyers have missed the statute of limitations. In fact, quite a few, uh, people have missed the statute of limitations even in death penalty cases costing their clients, uh, any review whatsoever of the case by the federal courts. The one thing important about the federal courts is that the state court judges, as we'll be discussing, uh, later, uh, our elected, uh, the capital cases are very controversial cases. It's often virtually impossible for a state court judge to be able, uh, to stay in office if he or she grants relief in a death penalty case. The federal courts, federal judges are appointed for life. Uh, and for a long time, uh, before 1996 in reviewing these cases, a number of federal courts had granted the writ of Habeas Corpus finding that they were constitutional violations.

Speaker 1:          03:49          Uh, Congress tried to change this and did change this significantly. Uh, in 1966, they amended 28, United States code 2154 d that's the paragraph that says what the court can do. Uh, when a Habeas Corpus petition is filed in the court, examines it, the court can grant the writ if the State Court decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. This is a huge change because before, when a federal court ruled on a habeas case, uh, it made its ruling based upon what it viewed to be the correct determination of constitutional law. Uh, if the, uh, and, and it didn't necessarily have to depend upon the United States Supreme Court decision, it may be that there was an issue that hadn't been decided by the United States Supreme Court. Uh, that those kinds of issues can no longer be considered a, because the state court, uh, has to have been unreasonable in its application.

Speaker 1:          05:01          Uh, so the, the federal courts no longer decide where they right or wrong on the constitutional issue. Just a pure question of law. Did they correctly apply the law? Uh, but where they unreasonably wrong, uh, in, in, in applying the law, um, the, the first con, uh, first clause here, the contrary to clause, the court set of Federal Habeas Court may grant the red, uh, if the state court reached a conclusion, uh, that was the opposite of a Supreme Court decision, uh, on a question of law. Uh, in other words, the state court decided a case differently. Uh, then the Supreme Court had ruled, uh, on, uh, really the same facts are indistinguishable facts. Uh, the other clause, uh, the federal court, uh, grinding the red, uh, under the unreasonable application clause, uh, is the state court identifies the correct legal principle of a United States Supreme Court decision, uh, but unreasonably applies that principle, uh, to the facts of the petitioners case.

Speaker 1:          06:06          Uh, in other words, the State Court recognized that the legal claim is governed by the example of justice O'Connor gives. And, uh, the Williams case, Terry Williams, uh, uh, out of Virginia, uh, gives the example of a state court identifies that this is a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, violation of the right to counsel. It's governed under the supreme court's decision in Strickland versus Washington. But the court might unreasonably, the State Court, uh, might unreasonably apply Strickland to the facts of that particular case. This is probably where the federal courts have more room in terms of examining a federal issues. Sometimes they'll say, uh, the United States Supreme Court case required that all of the relevant factors be considered and the state court didn't consider some of the relevant factors and therefore it was an unreasonable application of the federal law. But the mere fact that the federal court thinks that the state court got it wrong is not a basis for granting a habeas relief.

Speaker 1:          07:10          This is very deferential to the state courts. Uh, and so, uh, what it means, uh, is that, uh, it's going to be much more difficult. And, and Habeas Corpus, uh, I, I mentioned, uh, uh, in a previous discussion, a much harder to get, almost impossible to get evidentiary hearings now in federal court. So the combination of the federal courts not being able to, uh, have evidentiary hearings, take evidence, consider that, make findings, uh, instead having to defer to the findings of the state courts and even deferred to the legal conclusions reached by the state courts, uh, is greatly going to limit. And it does limit a federal habeas corpus review, but we'll see this language in some of the cases that we'll be looking at. Uh, in the rest of the course, I want to turn the burdens of proof, uh, and talk about, um, uh, the different, uh, burdens of proof that, uh, courts have adopted just because very often in a case the court will decide, first of all, what does the person have to prove to prevail on the client?

Speaker 1:          08:21          Uh, and then secondly, uh, what is the burden of proof? Uh, and then thirdly, who has the burden of proof, uh, because if the burden is very high, the person who has the burden, uh, is going to lose unless they are able to meet that burden of proof. So how the courts define a, these are not things that are in the constitution. These are things that the supreme court decides a in decisions, uh, in cases that come before it. Of course, everyone is familiar with beyond a reasonable doubt. Uh, in criminal cases, you have to prove that the person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If after hearing all the evidence, you have some reservations, some doubt about whether this person is guilty or whether this fact is true, then the government has not met its burden. The prosecution has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

Speaker 1:          09:16          And the requirement would be in that case, to a inner, a verdict of not guilty. Uh, so that's, uh, that's, that's our highest standard of burden. Uh, in civil cases, uh, the burden is preponderance of the evidence just more likely than not. If you put the evidence on a scale and you weighed, uh, the scale, uh, if it's more likely than not, uh, it's by a preponderance of the evidence. Again, who has the burden of proof? If the side would the burden of proof, uh, let's say the evidence is in equal poise, a, you can't say one way or the other. Uh, then the side of the burden of proof loses. So how you allocate the burden of proof is going to be very important. Now in between these two levels, uh, is clear and convincing evidence, uh, that, uh, means that the court a reasonable, substantial and probable, uh, that, uh, the fact that you're trying to prove occurred.

Speaker 1:          10:14          Uh, so sometimes the courts will say you have to prove something by a preponderance of the evidence. But in other areas they will say it has to be proven by a little higher level, uh, by clearing, convincing evidence. And of course, reasonable doubt for the most part, a is limited to cases involving, uh, guilt or innocence and the, and the prosecution's burden there. Now there's another burden. It's a little less than this substantial probability. Is there a substantial probability that whatever happened affected the outcome of the case? Uh, that means not enough to be more likely than not, but enough to undermine confidence in the verdict. Uh, and we'll see that the court adopted this substantial probability test and a couple of areas, uh, as part of the question of whether there's a constitutional violation or not. Uh, but again, as we sort of look on the scale of the, uh, these, these two have degree have to do with a degree of certainty.

Speaker 1:          11:16          We were very certain, when we say beyond a reasonable doubt, we're pretty certain but a little less certain. When we say clear and convincing evidence, we're more likely than not certain. When we say preponderance, when we say substantial probability, we're talking about undermining our confidence in the outcome, feeling not totally comfortable with the outcomes. So that's a little lower standard. And then finally probable cause, which just means probably a, in other words, when a police officer goes to get a warrant to search a house, they'll say, here's what we've been told, here's what we think is in the house. And the uh, judge will say, if it looks like it's probably there, then the warrant will issue a and the person can go out and, and, and sees the prior conduct, the search. And if there is anything there, seize the property. Uh, the same thing for, uh, implement Arie hearings after a person has been arrested.

Speaker 1:          12:11          Uh, the standard is just, is there evidence to say that they probably committed the crime? A, it's a very low standard, uh, but it means that there is some evidence indicating that the person committed the crime or some basis for conducting a search, a of a house or of a person or some basis for issuing an arrest warrant. Uh, but that's the lowest, uh, of these standards, uh, of proof of these burdens of proof that the courts have adopted. Um, when we get to appeals, which many of the cases we'll look at are going to be cases on appeal. Uh, one of the questions to look for in these cases is what exactly a is the court reviewing. Uh, and they fall into three basic areas that I want to just discuss for a moment. Uh, questions of fact, uh, is the court reviewing factual determinations made by the trial judge?

Speaker 1:          13:08          Uh, in other words, a credibility of witnesses, um, whether a juror can be fair and impartial. Uh, and the Ricky rector case, uh, the judge was looking at weather Ricky rector was mentally competent or not. And there were expert testimonies on both sides. Expert testimony on both sides. Uh, the Arkansas Supreme Court said the evidence is hopelessly in conflict. So we defer to the trial judge because the trial judge saw the witnesses, uh, made determinations of credibility. Uh, and therefore we're going to defer to the trial judge on that. Uh, and there's not much left, uh, for the appellate court to decide as long as the trial judge applied the right law. That is the law of competency. By the same token, uh, courts have looked at jury's determination of whether a person can be fair and impartial. The parties are selecting a jury, a person knows about the case because of pretrial publicity, uh, knows a whole lot about the case.

Speaker 1:          14:09          As it turns out, the more that person's question, uh, and at the end of the time, uh, the defense lawyer moves to strike that juror and says, this person can't be fair and impartial. Uh, the Supreme Court has said, uh, that's a factual determination. Uh, so that will be, we'll defer. The appellate court will defer to the trial judge, uh, unless it was clearly erroneous. Uh, and so, uh, that's going to be a higher standard, uh, for the, the person challenging the juror to overcome in order to win. On the other hand, we have just pure questions of law. Uh, is the death pony appropriate for people who are intellectually disabled? Uh, that basically involves the question of pure constitutional question, uh, of what the scope of the eighth amendment is and whether it prevents. So that's a case that the appellate court or the Supreme Court of the United States, uh, in this case is going to decide without much deference to the trial judge or without any deference to the trial judge because it's a pure question of law.

Speaker 1:          15:15          Uh, whether the due process clause requires, say, a hearing or requires notice, uh, in a particular situation, this again is going to be a legal question. And so an appellate court will decide that and be pretty much free to apply the, to decide what the law is and then apply it to the facts. Uh, and then what we often have our mixed questions of law and fact, uh, the question of ineffective assistance of counsel involves both the law with regard to what the sixth amendment right to counsel and guarantees a person. But it's also intermeshed with the facts of what did the lawyer do and that particular case, why did the lawyer do it and so forth, which we will talk about more when we talk about the right to counsel. But so depending upon which of these general areas, the question fits in the appellate court, uh, may or may not, uh, have a, uh, a more vigorous, uh, a role to play, uh, almost complete deference to the trial judge.

Speaker 1:          16:19          If it's, if it's a factual question, court's going to be able to do whatever it wants. If it's a question of law, it's going to try to determine the constitutional law. Uh, and then finally, if it's a mixed question, the court is going to try to distill out what are the facts, which we still defer to the trial judge. Uh, but what are the legal questions, uh, which the court, uh, is going to decide related to this? Is that what standard, uh, does the court apply? Uh, in reviewing these various questions that I have described, a de Novo review, uh, the appellate court decides examples I gave before, what the Constitution, what the statutes, what the rules are, and then applies them to the facts of the case. Uh, clearly erroneous. As I just mentioned. Uh, the appellate court is going to defer to the trial judge, uh, with regards say to whether a potential juror could be fair and impartial.

Speaker 1:          17:18          If the juror, uh, it goes back and forth again, we see this with a question of, could the juror fairly considered the death pony of Juror? May? Well, I don't know if I could do it. Well, I think I could do it. There's a lot of going back and forth. Ultimately, uh, the judge allows the jury to set a appellate court looking at that, if that's claimed to be era is going to defer to the judgment of the, uh, the trial judge unless a, it was clearly erroneous. The court feels, uh, very and strongly, uh, that the, uh, trial judge, uh, made an error. Uh, finally, uh, abuse of discretion standard. Uh, this is for the one challenging, uh, the, the, the appellant who's challenging, uh, what a judge said. This is the hardest to overcome. Uh, judges have a great deal of discretion for all sorts of things.

Speaker 1:          18:09          Like whether to grant a continuance or not. One party says, uh, we need, we're not ready. We need more time. The judge says, I'm setting the case for a certain date. Uh, almost always, uh, that is going to be upheld by, by an appellate court. All sorts of other, uh, administrative or rulings that the judges make, uh, miscibility of certain evidence is, is, is, is judged by, uh, an abusive discretion. Not Always, uh, but sometimes, but the take home story here is if you're appealing and the standards abusive discretion, it's going to be very difficult to prevail. Uh, it's going to be, uh, also difficult and clearly erroneous, uh, much less so, uh, on de Novo Review. So a lot of times the argument in a case will be, uh, what is the standard of review for this particular case? Uh, because if it's one or the other, uh, it may determine how the outcome of the case.

Speaker 1:          19:10          But then when the question, what if there is an error, the court finds that the constitution was violated in some way, uh, but doesn't make a difference. Uh, do we? At one time the rule was that if there was a constitutional violation, the case was reversed. A and the person had a new trial. Uh, but today the court's employ a harmless error standards in order to often confirm a, excuse me, a firm convictions and affirm death sentences. Uh, even though there was era, uh, the, uh, highest standard, again, this is our highest standard of proof here. Harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Chatmon versus California, the Supreme Court held that even a violation of the constitution of the United States could be harmless if the court could say, we are confident beyond a reasonable doubt that this did not affect the outcome of the trial. Of course, it's very difficult for judges to do this.

Speaker 1:          20:11          They didn't see the witnesses. Uh, they didn't sit in the jury box. Uh, so how well a court can or can't do this is, is a, is a, is a matter of debate. Um, another standard is the one that I talked about earlier, but it's used in a different context here, whether there's a substantial probability. I talked about the substantial probability standard and what it was, uh, that the era effected the outcome. Now hear what we're saying is, uh, this applies to violations of the right to counsel. Uh, the lawyer did not perform, uh, the lawyer was deficient and the performance, but then the court as is there a substantial probability that the outcome would have been different even if the lawyer had done all the right things. And if the judges sitting there decide no, then they'll affirm the case. Uh, even though the person, uh, as lawyer did not perform adequately, uh, in representing them, the same thing is true for the discovery or the withholding of exculpatory evidence.

Speaker 1:          21:18          The prosecution has a responsibility to turn over evidence that shows a innocence. Uh, if the court finds that that's not done, the question is going to ask is, is there a substantial probability that that evidence had, had been presented to the jury, would have affected the outcome? And if the judges can shrug their shoulders and say, no, we don't think it would, uh, then they're going to affirm that conviction even though the prosecution withheld evidence. Um, finally, uh, just to mention it, uh, the, the, the other standards applies to non constitutional error, uh, in the federal courts, uh, which is weather, uh, the, the era, whatever it was, had substantial or injures effect, uh, on the verdict. Uh, this is also a, the standard that the supreme court adopted for Habeas Corpus, uh, violations that if there's a habeas corpus violation, we don't ask, is it harmless beyond a reasonable doubt?

Speaker 1:          22:16          Uh, but we ask, uh, whether it is a, uh, substantial, uh, or injurious, uh, impact on the verdict that was decided. Uh, one last thing on harmless error. Some errors are never harmless structural errors, uh, one, uh, is racial discrimination. Uh, if there's underrepresentation of people of a race or ethnicity or gender, uh, in the jury pools, the question's not going to be did it make any difference than the trials? We'll never be able to know that. One reason why it's automatic reversal never harmless when jurors are being struck when they're picking the jury. Uh, if it turns out that the striking is on the basis of race, then that's going to always be deemed prejudicial. And so there's no harmless error, uh, applied to that. Uh, any kind of a race discrimination that takes place, a complete denial of the right to counsel. This doesn't happen very often, but there have been cases where judges have interfered with a lawyer, uh, as the ability to communicate with a client.

Speaker 1:          23:27          Uh, and in those situations, uh, courts have held that that's a violation of the right to counsel. Uh, there's no way to figure out how much damage it did or not. So it's never harmless. It's automatically going to result in reversal denial of a public trial. Uh, not too long ago, the court, uh, reversed a case called Presley versus Georgia in which the judge during the jury selection told the people in the audience, you're going to have to leave the courtroom, uh, while, uh, were picking the jury because there's not enough room for everyone in here. Uh, the lawyer objected, raised it on appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court, and the United States Supreme Court said, constitutional violation, a defendant has a right to a public trial. And if that right is violated, the defendant gets a new trial because again, it's virtually impossible to assess what difference it made.

Speaker 1:          24:19          A, but this is such a basic and fundamental right, uh, that it's going to be automatic a reversal, um, absence of the defendant from the trial. Uh, sometimes things go on. Uh, the defendant hasn't been brought over from the jail or for whatever reason, uh, if the defendant's absent for the Tra from the trial, uh, that's going to be a, that's never going to be harmless, Sarah. That's going to require a new trial. Uh, if that happened, uh, and, uh, finally, uh, denial of, uh, an impartial judge, uh, again, hard to know whether if a judge is not fair and impartial, uh, the rulings were right or not. Uh, but the court had said this is a basic right, that, uh, that people have a, and so if there's denial of an impartial judge, uh, that's going to require a reversal in cases. So you look first at these errors to see are they structural areas, those are going to be easy, assuming you can prove them, which, which is often not easy, uh, or are the arrows which are subject to a harmless Sarah Doctrine.

Speaker 1:          25:26          And if they are, what's the harmless, they're a doctrine that applies. Well, I know this is a lot of technical information, a lot of procedural information, uh, but it's critically important in these cases, uh, because weather, uh, people, uh, are prevail on having their death sins or their conviction set aside a is often going to depend on procedurally whether it was properly presented to all the courts, the state courts, the federal courts. Uh, it's going to depend on who has the burden of proof. Very often it's going to depend very often on what the burden of proof was. And even if a constitutional violation is shown, they're going to be a harmless error standards, uh, applied, uh, that are going to perhaps make it possible, uh, for the court to affirm a conviction. A, even though there's been constitutional error, we'll see all these things coming up, uh, in the materials that follow.
