Speaker 1:          00:11          Oh, good case that illustrates a lot of the issues that we're going to be talking about over the course of the course. Uh, is the case of Arkansas versus Ricky rector. Uh, this was a case out of a, and it's in the readings, uh, out of, uh, Conway, which is in Faulkner County, Arkansas. Tragic death here of a police officer, Bob Martin, who had come to a rest Ricky rector, who had shot and killed someone else just a short time before and had been, uh, on the run. Uh, but he agreed to come back to his mother's house. And Bob Martin was the friend of the family and he came to arrest him and to everyone's complete shock and amazement. Rector walks up behind Martin, uh, and shoots him. But then what he does next, [inaudible] walk out in the backyard and put the gun to his own head, uh, and give himself basically a frontal lobotomy.

Speaker 1:          01:03          A lot of people thought that retro wouldn't live, but he did. And so then the question becomes, what do we do in this case? Uh, this is a community that had never before even had a police officer shot, let along the police officer killed. And so there's a tremendous reaction in the community, uh, because Bob Martin had been a great public servant. He was loved by people there. Uh, and there was a feeling that the death penalty should be imposed because of this loss of a law enforcement official. This case is full of politics from the start to the very end when Bill Clinton running for president in 1992 comes back to preside over the execution of Ricky rector. Uh, right before the New Hampshire primary, in fact, Clinton had scheduled the execution by signing a death warrant, uh, so that rector would be executed. But rector who had been a pretty troubled person and somewhat troubled mentally to begin with, uh, was even more severely impaired after he shot himself through the, uh, front of his head.

Speaker 1:          02:10          Uh, and we'll talk a little bit about how that was looked at in the case. Uh, but first I just raised the question, what do you do if you're the district attorney there in Faulkner County? Uh, the police of course want the death penalty. We don't know what the Martin family wanted, but we assume the family may have wanted the death penalty. Uh, no question. The community wants the death penalty, but we have a man now who is profoundly damaged as a result of this self inflicted wound. Uh, do we still seek the death penalty if we do? What's our purpose? Is the purpose to show people regardless of whatever the facts are about Ricky rector, is the purpose to show people that if you come to Conway, Arkansas and kill one of our police officers, you're going to get the death penalty. Uh, or is there other considerations that should take into account the individual circumstances of rector?

Speaker 1:          03:05          Uh, would it be possible has happened in the Jared Lochner case, the person who shot Gabrielle Giffords, the congressman and killed a federal judge as well as a little girl and other people in that case was ultimately resolved with a plea disposition where the families and the community and everybody agreed. The best thing in this case is to make sure that Jerry Lochner is never in the community again. Uh, but not to go through a death penalty trial and the appeals and so forth that would go with it. Well, that obviously wasn't the decision that was made, uh, in Faulkner County. Uh, but it's important to point out to decisions that the prosecutor had to make first whether to seek the death penalty at all. It's never required to seek the death poly, no, no cases, a mandatory death penalty case. And then second, even after the prosecutor had announced were seeking the death penalty in this case, he would always offer a plea bargain life imprisonment without any possibility of parole, uh, resolve the case without a trial.

Speaker 1:          04:05          Uh, and, and of course, the different sentence, uh, in this case, both those questions were answered that the prosecutor was going to go forward with a prosecution. It was felt that they wanted the death pony, even if Ricky rector wasn't the same person. We want the death pony for Ricky rector, uh, because of what happened in the community and maybe for this deterrence purpose that I talked about. Uh, but, but you can see that that issue is not just a legal question. Is he eligible for the death politic? Uh, it was certainly his because he shot a police officer, uh, but in killed a police officer, but also a lot of political questions. And of course the prosecutors got to run for reelection and Faulkner County. So how much does that factor into the process? And then of course, what happened in the case was there's no question rector committed the crime.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Every one knew that. So the question becomes, is he competent? Is He as a result of his damage to his brain? Is he mentally competent, uh, to, uh, stand trial. Now we have the defense doctors who saw him, Dr. Brown, Dr. Stephens, a psychologist, a Mr. Hello. Dr Heller. Uh, as well as his, um, uh, or excuse me, Heller is his attorney and the Criswell case, uh, the one that had tried before, uh, and his sister all describe how Ricky rector is functioning. And we come out from that with a diagnosis that he has retrograde Amnesia, he's damaged his brain damage. He's got no emotion whatsoever. You go see him one day and he doesn't remember having talked to you the last time you went to see him. Uh, his intellectual functioning is tested 66 later tested at 70. But basically this is a person, uh, who not only is his thinking, it's sort of a childlike level, but is acting, uh, at a child like level, very, uh, childish in, in the way he behaves.

Speaker 1:          06:02          Uh, the state doctors on the other hand, uh, Dr Ahmed is the main state doctor. He says, rectors lying about his loss of memory. Uh, there doesn't have anything to do with this. A bullet wound, uh, through his, through his brain. Uh, and uh, he even says it. By the second trial he had improved. The state also had a, another uh, psychiatrist and two psychologists. So you can see a lot of experts in this case, unusual for a case involving a poor person to have this many, uh, experts too on the defense side and not unusual for the state to have for a on its side. Uh, but where does that get us? They decided, uh, the state doctors that he was faking it, uh, and then he was not cooperating, uh, in, uh, answering their questions and that his lack of emotion and his childlike behavior, uh, they said work life choices that he had made.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Uh, so, uh, what do we do with these? These are the same diagnosis we had before. The defense experts come to the conclusion, manifestly incapable of assisting his lawyers in any way that he's too childlike, too injured, uh, to, uh, damaged, uh, to work with. As lawyers state, uh, these doctors decide he could choose. Again, they're saying that he's faking it and all that they're saying if he wants to cooperate with his lawyers, he can and therefore there's no problem going forward with this. This is what the Arkansas Supreme Court will later say, that the evidence was hopelessly in conflict. This doctors reach one conclusion, one diagnosis, the state doctors, another diagnosis, another conclusion. How does this get resolved? One person, one person resolves it. Uh, and that's the trial judge. Of course, he too is elected by the voters there and Faulkner County. Uh, whether or not that comes into play, uh, we don't know, but we can't help but know that there's got to be some political pressure, uh, there with regard to it.

Speaker 1:          08:03          Let's look at the legal issue that was presented by rectors case. Uh, and, and what other issues are presented by his, his mental health. Was he competent to stand trial? Most fundamental question in this case, and this is what the case is all about because I said there's no question that he's guilty of the crime. Uh, not much question that a jury and Faulkner County is going to sentence him to death. And he ends up with an all white jury in a community that has about 10% African American. Um, the standard, the statute is set out here, the Arkansas Code, which provides that a person who lacks the capacity to understand the proceedings that is, understand what's going on, who the judge is, the prosecutor, the jurors, uh, and how the proceedings are taking place or assist his lawyer that is be able to have conversations with his lawyer, relate information, uh, and that sort of thing.

Speaker 1:          08:57          As a result of a mental disease or defect, uh, uh, is not to be tried if they lack this capacity. So those are the two questions we're asking. Can Rector understand the proceedings and can he, uh, cooperate with his lawyers? Can he interact with his lawyers in a way that makes it possible for them to represent them? And as I said, the whole case is going to be decided on this one issue. And as I said, the judge is the person who's going to decide it. So the judge decided that he's competent and then the importance of that finding by that one trial judge means that when the case goes to the Arkansas Supreme Court, it affirms and it says the evidence is hopelessly in conflict. So we defer to the trial judge. The trial judge was the person who heard the evidence, saw the witnesses, uh, and unless it's clearly erroneous, unless it's absolutely clear to us that he made a mistake, uh, with regard to finding of competence, uh, we're going to defer to his findings.

Speaker 1:          09:59          Every court when the case is later reviewed in the federal courts, uh, those, uh, findings are going to be a binding on those courts. So you see how the power of this one man or really we see the power of two people here, the prosecutor seeking the death penalty, not plea bargaining in the case, and then the power of the judge to decide the legal issue that's going to decide the whole case. If rector had been found not to be competent, he would have been sent to a mental institution and he would have stayed there until either became competent or it was determined that he just was not going to ever be competent. Uh, but of course here he was found competent, which meant that the case moved on to trial. Let me just mention a couple of other issues raised by these mental issues.

Speaker 1:          10:44          Often in cases, one is sanity. We've all heard of the insanity defense. Uh, seldom really used successfully in cases, particularly by poor people who usually can't afford the expert witnesses and often can't get them from the court in order to even try to prove. But the difference here, when we talk about sanity, we're talking about the person's mental condition at the time of the crime, whether or not the person had the capacity. Again, the ability we're talking about to conform his or her behavior to the requirements of the law and appreciate the criminality, uh, of what he or she did. In other words, the person who shoots someone because they think they're an enemy soldier who's the invading the country, and they have a delusional belief. They believe this completely. I mean, that's sort of your classic example of a, of an insanity defense. Don't have that in this case because of course, rectors damage to his brain and his functioning, uh, was a result of an injury he inflicted after he committed the crime.

Speaker 1:          11:45          So no question about his sanity at the time he shot and killed Bob Martin. Uh, mitigation is, we'll talk about later. Uh, is rectors condition a reason for a sentence less than death? Uh, do we take this into account? We look at the crime, uh, the heinousness of the crime of the loss to the community. Uh, but do we also look at rectors condition? And there's some argument about this, about, well, that wasn't his condition at the time of the crime, so we shouldn't consider it. And the other side, well, that is his condition. Now this is the situation. This man is in profoundly damaged as a result of this gunshot wound. Uh, and so perhaps this is not a person who should be sentenced to death. The Arkansas Supreme Court when presented with this question and said, well, this is a matter for executive clemency.

Speaker 1:          12:37          Of course, at the time they said that, uh, or for the governor to consider for executive clemency, Chris, at the time, they considered that they didn't know that, uh, clemency would come up at a time when the governor was running for president of the United States and his law and order Bona Fides would be the most, one of the most important issues in the case, as someone said, for Ricky rector. That timing was very bad indeed. Uh, and then finally at the end of the case, the question came up whether rector was competent to be executed. As I mentioned just a little earlier, uh, whether or not he understood why he was being executed. Uh, so those are, uh, this case gives you a sense again of the way in which these issues come up in cases. Retros case was not a celebrated case when it first came up in Conway, Arkansas, but of course it became a fairly well known case at the very end because the role it played in Bill Clinton's campaign for President United States.

Speaker 1:          13:37          Uh, and it certainly was seen by a lot of people as protecting Clinton from any attack that he was soft on crime, uh, that he would not be like the previous Democratic nominee Michael to caucus, uh, who had been opposed to the death penalty. Uh, and that cost him a fairly dearly with the ads that were run against him when he ran for president. Well, uh, let's go from that just to quickly talk about how these cases make their way through the system. Uh, obviously any criminal case is going to start with a crime being committed, uh, and then an investigation which can last for as long as a few seconds. If the offender is a apprehended right there on the scene or can last for months, years, however long it takes for law enforcement and the prosecutors to decide who it is that committed the crime.

Speaker 1:          14:28          Um, once we know who committed the crime, then there's going to be an arrest. Uh, again, that may be very soon. Or you may have somebody who has fled the country or fled the jurisdiction. So that may take some period of time. Here's where we want to get into the legal proceedings to take place. Those things you probably a pretty familiar with. When you're arrested, you're entitled to a first appearance hearing. In other words, within a day or two of being arrested, a person should be brought before a judicial officer, a judge, or a magistrate. Uh, and the question here, that's critically important. Do you get a lawyer at that point? Because if you're accused of any crime, you want a lawyer at this point because if you're on a minor crime, you're hoping to get out on bail a so you can go back to work so you can keep your home, uh, uh, carry on your life, uh, in hope that maybe you won't ever go to prison on this case.

Speaker 1:          15:21          If you're in a serious case and death point in case you want your while you're out investigating the case right from the start. Diego Martin who was facing the death plenty in del Rio, Texas, gets arrested, asked for a lawyer eight months. He goes for eight months facing the death penalty with no lawyer. And you can imagine the damage that does to his case in terms of there's no investigation. He's not able to talk to a lawyer about his case. What's going on. Uh, he basically just sits in jail for eight months. The prosecution is building its case, uh, and he is not, uh, at any rate at this first hearing of judge will usually tell the defendant what his or her rights are. Uh, set bail. Most capital cases, no bail is set in capital cases, but in other cases, the court will set bail or uh, in some cases release people on their personal promise to come back.

Speaker 1:          16:14          That is their personal Rick cognizance. A short time after that in most jurisdictions. And this is what Chris, we're generalizing here across all states. And so some of these things are not as true, maybe one place to another, but most places within a short time after that, uh, the defendant has a preliminary hearing, uh, is represented by client, by, by a lawyer. Uh, of course, if you don't have a lawyer, like in the case I mentioned, uh, for eight months, you're probably not going to have preliminary hearing because no lawyer is going to request a preliminary hearing, uh, for you. Uh, but at that hearing, uh, the court determines, the judge determines a, whether there's probable cause that is, whether it's probable that the person committed the crime, uh, and if so, the person can continue to be held either on bail or in prison.

Speaker 1:          17:03          Uh, most states still have grand juries, not all in some states, the prosecution's can just simply, prosecutors, excuse me, can just file an accusation which sets out the charges. Uh, but in a lot of states, the cases presented to a grand jury, uh, it considers the evidence and then returned an indictment. And the indictment is the formal charge. The fact that somebody has been indicted does not mean they committed a crime. It just means they're formally charged with a crime. Uh, original purpose of the grand jury or one of its purposes had been that if you were accused of something you didn't do a and the grand jury did not indict, you wouldn't go through the, uh, public embarrassment of being accused. Because today, uh, that's really not the case. Grand Juries are used to gather evidence and investigate cases and generally everybody knows who's being investigated by, by the grand jury, at least in, in cases of any prominence.

Speaker 1:          18:00          Once a person's indicted by the grand jury or they're brought before the court for Arraignment, this is the proceeding where the person enters a plea of not guilty a or in some cases, this will be where the cases resolved with a guilty plea. Certainly in a lot of non capital cases, a lot of people, a lot of poor people accused of crimes will meet their lawyer for the first time at arraignment, will plead guilty and be sentenced all within about a 15 minute time period. Uh, capital cases, generally a not guilty plea is going to be entered because nobody's going to plead guilty or unless less they want the death. Probably most people are going to plead not guilty here. Uh, and then we go to pretrial hearings, which can be on all the issues, uh, that, uh, maybe litigated pretrial, whether to change the venue in the case.

Speaker 1:          18:48          Should we move it to another place where there's not a, the kind of knowledge of the case that there was in the rector case. Uh, is there, uh, suppression of evidence? Uh, the competency issue, uh, in the retro case is a good example. This issue was not an issue. Tried to a jury. This was an issue that was decided in a pretrial hearing before the judge. Uh, there may be other issues like, uh, motions to suppress identification because it was suggestive or some other, uh, motion to suppress the confession because the person, uh, it was not a voluntary confession or there was a violation of Miranda versus Arizona. Basically any issue that's a legal issue that needs to be resolved, uh, can be litigated before that is uh, you know, motion can be filed and the parties can argue about it, present evidence on and the judge decides it before trial, before we get to the issue of guilt or innocence.

Speaker 1:          19:45          Sometimes there'll be issues about what evidence is going to be admitted or not. And the judge will rule upon that prior to trial. Once that happens, uh, we moved to, uh, this process, the trial, uh, this is a where the trial is going to take place. This is where the accused is entitled to a lawyer under the Supreme Court's decision. And Gideon versus Wainwright. Uh, and in depth pony cases, this will be a bifurcated trial. That is two trials, one trial and guilt, one trial on penalty, uh, after assuming the person is convicted, found guilty in some states, like Alabama is a good example. There's an intermediate court of appeals that is as the Alabama Court of criminal appeals. And then above it, the Alabama Supreme Court, all these cases go first to the Alabama Court of criminal appeals and decides the case. And then a person can petition the Supreme Court, uh, to review the case, but it's not required to.

Speaker 1:          20:43          Most states the cases bypass the intermediate court. They go straight from the trial court to the state Supreme Court. Texas, for example, has a whole level of intermediate appellate courts, but the death pawn in cases don't go there. They go straight from the trial court to the Texas Court of criminal appeals or in Georgia from the trial court to the Georgia Supreme Court. And then that state court makes a decision of whether, uh, reviews the trial, uh, the briefs that are filed to see was there any legal error made at the trial, either in those pretrial motions that we just talked about or admitting evidence during the trial jury instructions that were given, anything that may have been discussed or a decided not discussed, but decided, uh, at the trial court level, uh, the State Supreme Court May Review, a party can ask the United States Supreme Court to review it by filing a petition in the Supreme Court seeking review.

Speaker 1:          21:40          Almost always, except in the rare case that's going to be denied a. So this is what we call direct appeal directly from the trial court, uh, up through the state Supreme Court. Now, once that process is ended, person theoretically is eligible to be executed because they've had their trial and they've had their appeal. Uh, but all states provide some kind of collateral, what we call collateral, a attack on the conviction or post conviction review. Uh, and here the person can go back to the trial court and file a petition or emotion saying my death sins or my conviction was obtained in violation of the constitution, the laws of the United States and this particular state. But one thing, the person cannot raise any issue here that could have been raised at trial or in the state supreme court. So what does that leave? If you've already raised these issues before trial or during trial and you've raised them in the state Supreme Court, what's left?

Speaker 1:          22:43          Uh, generally one issue, uh, heard here is a question of ineffective assistance of counsel. Obviously the lawyer can't be claiming to be ineffective while representing someone, the lawyers hopefully providing and thinks he or she is providing effective representation. So that question can be decided here. Uh, suppression of exculpatory evidence, uh, often, uh, more often than than we would like to see, uh, find that the prosecution has failed to disclose some important evidence, uh, to the defense. Uh, and as a result, uh, the argument is that the trial has not been fair because the government has a duty to turn over, uh, evidence that tends to show the person is not guilty. So that issue could be raised there. Uh, sometimes, uh, people learn of jury misconduct, uh, that the jurors may have done something that they're not supposed to do. So that issue could be raised there.

Speaker 1:          23:39          And that's not exclusive list. But that's an example. And then again, depending on the state, it will either go to the state intermediate court or it'll go to the state supreme court. And again, the person can petition in the United States Supreme Court for review. Again, very unlikely the Supreme Court is going to review it. Most of the time they're not. But if there's a really important legal issue there or an issue in which courts are divided than the supreme court may take the case. Finally, the last resort for someone sentenced to death is to file a petition for writ of Habeas Corpus in the United States district court where they are, uh, this basically is a petition that says, I the death row inmate, uh, suing the warden of the facility that's holding that person and being held here in violation of the constitution of the United States. The fact that the state law issues no longer those could be litigated in state court, but not in federal court.

Speaker 1:          24:40          There has to be a federal constitutional violation. I am held in violation of the federal constitution in that there was racial discrimination in my jury selection and violation of the 14th amendment to the United States constitution. That's a classic example of a plane that might be made, uh, in the United States district court. Uh, that court decides the case. Uh, let's say it rules adversely to the death row inmate, uh, the person can then ask the, well, first, ask the district court to allow him or her to appeal to the court of Appeals. They're not entitled to an appeal. Uh, the district court can either say yes or no. This issue is important enough that it can be appealed. A, or if the district court says no, the person can go to the court of appeals and make your argument a second time, uh, that this is an important issue.

Speaker 1:          25:32          Uh, but very often that court will say no. And so that's going to pretty much an end. Of course, the person will petition in the United States Supreme Court for review, but failing that, that person is probably going to be executed and probably executed pretty soon. Uh, Texas is executed far more people than any other state. And one of the reasons, um, there was a lot of reasons, but one is at once he's case come to federal district court, they're usually denied a certificate of appeal. Ability to the court of appeals is denied. Uh, so once this court rules, uh, there's nothing left between that person and the execution chamber. So a habeas corpus used to be a way in which a number of capital cases were reviewed and sometimes set aside the difference. Life, tenure judges, these judges are appointed by the president, confirmed by the Senate.

Speaker 1:          26:25          They serve for life. Not to say there's not some politics both in getting appointed. And not to say that they're not some federal judges who are ambitious to go on to other places, but at the same time there's a lot more independence. Uh, when you have life tenure, a judge in the state court who makes a decision, either a trial judge or a, an appellate judge, uh, maybe signing his or her political death warrant if they grant relief in a death penalty case. Uh, not so for a federal judge, uh, and at one time the federal courts, uh, we're, we're, we're pretty vigorous and enforcing the constitution, uh, Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law a, an act which we'll talk about, which greatly restricts the power now of the federal courts to review these cases. So that gives you an overview of just when we're talking about these cases, you'll have some sense of where they are.

Speaker 1:          27:20          We'll look at cases, decided by state supreme courts will look at cases decided by federal courts of appeal. So you'll know how that got there. Uh, and of course, we'll look at a lot of United States supreme court opinions. Uh, so I hope this gives you some sense of where we are in the process as we look at those cases. And we'll also look at, uh, examples from trial courts as well, including some transcripts of jury selection and so forth. So that's the roadmap of where we're going. And we'll next take up, uh, the historical sort of a backdrop, uh, leading, uh, to where we are today, where the death point of the United States.

Speaker 2:          28:11          Okay.
