Speaker 1:          00:11          We've talked before in the class about aggravating circumstances and about those being the reasons to give the death penalty. Uh, we saw that the mandatory death penalty statutes were struck down, uh, because there was no consideration of the individual offender that was taken into account. The Supreme Court in 1976 in the cases that we looked at back at that time, uh, the three that were upheld from Florida, Georgia and Texas, and the two that were struck down from Earth Carolina, Louisiana. Uh, the fatal problem with the North Carolina, Louisiana statutes were that they did not allow for consideration of the individual person. Uh, the court upheld, uh, the Georgia and Florida statutes that provided for mitigating circumstances. Georgia statute just said anything in mitigation. Florida gave a long list of mitigating factors and then Texas as three special questions. But the idea was that the, the jury would be able to take into account, uh, things about the person when they decided that, uh, as the court said, uh, the diverse frailties of humankind, this was in Woodson versus North Carolina, uh, was required.

Speaker 1:          01:21          Uh, now, normally, uh, the scope of sentencing and what can come in at sensing is decided by legislature. So by statutes, uh, and non capital cases, they decide, for example, in the federal system what is going to be taken into account under the sentencing guidelines. Uh, the question that comes before the United States Supreme Court that we're going to talk about today, uh, is now that we know there has to be individualized consideration. Uh, how broad is that or how narrow is that? A, can the states decide, uh, what factors can be considered as Florida did with its list of mitigating factors? And we're going to see where the Ohio statute a very clear example, uh, of a limit on mitigation and then what the Supreme Court says as a matter of constitutional law. In the case of a woman named Sandra Lockett, who was involved in a pawnshop robbery, uh, in Ohio, uh, if ever there was a sympathetic case, if a murder case can ever be a sympathetic case to come before the Supreme Court, uh, it was Sandra lockets case.

Speaker 1:          02:23          Uh, she was 21 years old. She had no prior record of any serious misconduct, and she, and a man named Al Parker, Nathan road, drew and her brother, uh, were involved in the robbery of a pawn shop. There was no plan to kill. Uh, but once the, uh, the people, uh, she's in the car a while the others go in to rob the pawnbroker a pawnbroker. Uh, and while in there, uh, a fight breaks out and Parker shoots and kills the pawn broker. So he's the main person here in terms of having committed the committed the homicide. Uh, but he pleads, he pleads guilty and testifies against the other people in exchange for that, he avoids the death pony. This is your classic a plea bargaining, uh, in capital cases. Lockets brother as tried and sentenced to death, uh, and do a, does not receive the death penalty because it's found that his involvement was primarily the product of a mental deficiency. That is a mental limitations. A excused him from the death poem and then Sandra Lockett was sentenced to death. Now let's take a look at the Ohio Statute, uh, and what it provided, uh, with regard to, uh, how the death penalty was going to be imposed in Ohio. A seven aggravating circumstances. A person if one or more of those is found than the death penalty is imposed unless the jury finds, uh, one of the three mitigating factors, uh, one of them being that the victim of the offense, uh,

Speaker 2:          04:00          mmm,

Speaker 1:          04:02          uh, induced or facilitated, uh, the crime. Uh, secondly that there was duress, coercion or strong provocation involved. Uh, and finally, and this is the one that applied to Mr Do, uh, that the offense was primarily the result of the offenders psychosis or mental deficiency. None of these apply to Sandra Lockett. Uh, she's minimally involved. She's out in the car while the crime takes place in the pawn shop. Uh, she has some other factors, uh, that she wants to put forward, which we'll talk about in a moment. But what's Ohio trying to do here? What Ohio is trying to do is follow what the court said in the 1976 cases and limit the consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. So that it's the same in every case on the theory that this will mean that the death penalty will be consistently imposed an Ohio, uh, the problem is it leaves out considerations of some fairly compelling mitigating factors.

Speaker 2:          04:57          Ah,

Speaker 1:          05:00          what Sandra Lockett, one of the court to hear. Uh, it was about her minor participation in the crime and not only hear about it. Of course, they knew that, uh, from the, uh, from the trial, uh, but to take that into account, uh, as a mitigating factor, uh, as a reason not to give her the death pony. Uh, she also had a testimony of a psychologist, uh, that her prognosis for rehabilitation was good, uh, that also she was in a drug treatment program and she was on the road to recovery. Uh, and, uh, these factors could not be taken into account in deciding her sins. And the judge, uh, seems to have some reluctance, uh, in imposing the death public. Uh, in this case, Chief Justice Burger rights for the court and he goes through at some length, uh, the plea bargaining, uh, the offer that was made to send her lock at two weeks before trial.

Speaker 1:          05:53          Uh, the offer that was made on the day of trial and the offer that was made to her to get a life sentence to plead guilty and avoid the death penalty after Parker testified at a trial. Now, normally settlement negotiations or plea negotiations have no legal significance whatsoever. Uh, but what Chief Justice Burger is clearly communicating here is that the state really didn't believe that it had to have the death pony for Sandra Lockett. It was willing to give her a plea bargain. Uh, and this is unusual and that all the plea offers are set out in the Supreme Court's opinion, uh, and brings, uh, the court to the conclusion, uh, in terms of what can be considered a and a judge. She says, Burger writing for the court says that the eighth and 14th amendment required that the sensor in all but the very rarest cases is not to be prevented from considering as a mitigating factor, any aspect, uh, of the life and background and circumstances, uh, of the defendant as well of course as the circumstances of the crime.

Speaker 1:          06:57          But any factors, uh, proffered by the defense as a basis for sentence less than death, uh, failure to consider this, he says, we'll run the risk of the death police being imposed despite, uh, factors that may cause for may be rezoned for a lesser sentence. Uh, and therefore that would be arbitrary under the eighth amendment that if someone like Sandra Lockett is receiving the death penalty, even though they're factors that call, uh, for her to receive a lesser sins that violates the eighth amendment's protection against cruel and unusual punishment. Uh, whether there's not a unanimity with regard to this, a justice white, uh, it says this is, we're just going right back to farming. We're going back to completely unfettered discretion by juries if they can consider anything and then decide on the death pony based on anything that's put before them. Uh, we're right back to Fermin.

Speaker 1:          07:53          Interestingly, uh, when we looked at an aggravating circumstances, uh, after the supreme court decided Zant versus Stevens, the case that said, once the jury finds an aggravating factor, it can consider anything and impose whatever punishment it wants. Justice Marshall had said, we've gone back to Fermin. So now we have justices on both sides of the court who are saying, we're, we're, we're, we are risking now, uh, the arbitrary imposition of the death pony that we found to be unconstitutional in Furman versus Georgia. This case could not be more important, uh, because, uh, what, uh, the Supreme Court is saying here is that, uh, the defendant, the defense council decides what's going to be admitted, uh, in, uh, uh, mitigation in a, in a case. In other words, the state can't decide that these three mitigating factors like Ohio did are the only three things to be account taken into account or that the long list that Florida had, which was much more many more mitigating factors.

Speaker 1:          08:58          Uh, it, it has to be not only those, but anything that the defense proffers as the basis for a sentence less than death. And as the death pony develops after the Lockett case, uh, these, uh, become critical in terms of what evidence is going to be admitted at the penalty phase, uh, of capital case. Um, we see this applied again in the case of a Eddings versus Oklahoma. This is a 16 year old youth, uh, who was, uh, convicted and sentenced to death in Oklahoma for the murder of a state patrolman. Uh, he had three aggravating factors, heinous, atrocious and cruel, avoiding arrest and future dangerousness. Uh, the trial judge admitted evidence, uh, of his trouble youth. The fact that his parents divorced when he was just five years old, uh, that his mother was an alcoholic, probably a prostitute, a, that he was not supervised and that he was excessively punished by his father.

Speaker 1:          09:50          All this evidence comes in, but the judge, and this was a sentencing not by a jury, but by a judge. The judge says that he cannot take into account, uh, the facts of Eddings violent background. Uh, Supreme Court decides, uh, that that violates, um, lock it versus, oh, hi, chief justice Berger who wrote, lock it now to parts company with a court and says, wait a minute. Uh, this is just semantics. Uh, the judge, uh, received all the evidence. Uh, Miss, uh, what he said, uh, shouldn't be a basis for setting aside with the majority of the court said, you've got to not only admit the mitigating evidence, but it has to be considered. It has to be a part of the weighing process, which is what Oklahoma had a has to be part of the weighing process in deciding whether or not to give the death pelvic and Hitchcock versus Dugger the Supreme Court.

Speaker 1:          10:45          And one of the rare times in all of its stuff pulling cases is unanimous, nine to nothing, uh, with Justice Scalia writing for the court and striking down a jury instruction in Florida that limited the mitigating circumstances to just the mitigating those set out in the statute. Uh, this is, uh, we're going to see, uh, that this does not last long. Uh, the Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas, they're going to part company with this, but at least at this one time, a 1987 when Hitchcock was decided this was the one place where the court was in complete agreement that anything about the life and background and the person, uh, should be considered. What about the Texas statute though? Uh, we recall that we, when we looked at that when we talked about aggravating circumstances, uh, Texas has these three special questions. Uh, was it deliberate? Uh, is the person a future danger, a probability that there'll be a future danger?

Speaker 1:          11:44          Uh, and was there provocation, uh, how is mitigating our, how our mitigating factors considered in the Texas, uh, scheme of, uh, the supreme court had rejected a challenge, uh, in a case, Franklin versus [inaudible], uh, in which he had wanted to put on or said his evidence in mitigation, which was as good behavior in prison, uh, could not be considered under these three questions. Uh, but the supreme court said, actually it could be considered a under the questions and therefore, uh, because when you're looking at future dangerousness, one thing you could ask and looking at that is, has the person, uh, adjusted well to prison or jail, uh, in the past. Uh, so that was rejected, but a very different cases presented by John Paul penry. Uh, his mitigating factor is his intellectual disability, or at the time referred to in the Supreme Court case as mental retardation. Uh, and he says that under the three, uh, Texas questions, uh, this cannot, uh, be considered, uh, justice O'Connor accepts that argument for the court and says that evidence of intellectual disability is relevant to moral culpability, uh, so that the jury can express what she often says in her cases, a reasoned moral response, uh, to, uh, the crime and the defendants that are before it.

Speaker 1:          13:06          Uh, and she points out that this, uh, evidence of intellectual disability could not be considered under the, uh, three questions that Texas has. A, it's not appropriate for deliberateness. Uh, it doesn't go to future dangerousness. She points out, it goes, it cuts both ways because the person who is intellectually disabled, uh, may not learn from their mistakes, may not plan, and therefore it may be a future danger or it could be used by a jury to conclude that they're a future danger. And of course, it doesn't go to provocation. Uh, the, the, the last question that's asked, uh, here we see the court starting to disagree about this. Justice Scalia, uh, writes a descending opinion. He's joined by justice Rehnquist white and Kennedy. So this is a five, a to four opinion. He says, uh, Texas has done a perfectly fine job guiding the discretion of the jury with the three questions and we should leave it alone.

Speaker 1:          14:00          Uh, the Supreme Court has, uh, no, uh, business, uh, telling Texas how it is to consider a mitigating factors is justice Scalia puts it somewhat. Carl flee, uh, this puts all sympathetic factors are just to be dumped before the jury, uh, for an outpouring of personal reaction. And of course what he's saying there is this is going to be arbitrary too. So the argument is one, if you don't consider the individual circumstances, it will be arbitrary. Uh, but if you do allow anything to be taken into account in mitigation, the death planning is going to be imposed a arbitrarily, uh, in two cases that came not long after that 1990 Walton versus Arizona and in 1993 grand versus Collins, uh, Justice Scalia and justice Thomas reject the Woodson lock at line of cases. That is the cases that say that any thing offered as a basis for a sentence, less than death has to be admitted in mitigation.

Speaker 1:          15:01          Uh, Justice Scalia says in Walton that there's an inherent tension, uh, between the requirements of aggregation that limiting aggravating circumstances and having unlimited mitigating circumstances, uh, and that these contradictory commands, uh, does not constrain the discretion of the jury in the way that it should be. Uh, and so his question, and this is what I raised earlier, whether society, uh, may specify what factors are going to be taken into account in sentencing or not. And in other words, could the state legislature decide, as Ohio did, these are the only three mitigating factors or as Florida, these are the mitigating factors, uh, that we're going to allow. Uh, as a result, uh, he decides that he will no longer follow, uh, the Woodson locket line of cases. And so from now on, Justice Scalia dissents from any case involving a consideration of mitigating circumstances where the court says there was a unconstitutional limitation on that.

Speaker 1:          16:06          Um, the, uh, justice Thomas basically the same thing in grand versus Collins. He takes a different approach. Says Fermin was a case about racial discrimination, uh, points out that the power to be lenient is also, uh, the power, uh, to discriminate a and says that the state should be allowed, uh, to, uh, limit consideration or mitigating factors. In fact, in his opinion, just as Thomas, uh, in Graham versus Collins makes it pretty clear that he does not have any problem with the mandatory death pony statutes. Uh, that saying that some crimes are so bad that there always should be punished with death. Uh, as far as he's concerned is not violate anything. Uh, in the eighth amendment, uh, justice Stevens responds to both opinions. Uh, and he says four things. First, the death penalty is not allowed for certain offenses, uh, that a number of a rape, uh, other, uh, non homicide cases are no longer even considered eligible for the death point of kidnapping, armed robbery, other, other crimes like that.

Speaker 1:          17:11          Uh, secondly, the aggravating circumstances narrow the class of people who can be considered for the death. Polly, and this is what the eighth amendment requires to narrow the class of people who are eligible. Uh, he also says the vague and overbroad aggravating circumstances, um, uh, are, are not allowed actually, uh, as, as we discussed when we talked about a aggravating factors, uh, the courts have said that those catch all aggravating circumstances like heinous, atrocious and cruel, uh, can be considered as long as the state supreme court gives them a limiting instruction. Uh, so whether that's as great, greater protection as, as, as, as he says in the opinion, uh, is, is questionable. Uh, and finally, uh, that the consideration of whatever is offered as a basis for a sentence less than death, it's consideration of mitigating circumstances actually further narrows the class because things like abuse, mental illness, in this case a intellectual disability.

Speaker 1:          18:14          Those are factors that may call for a sentence less than death and do coffers sentence less than death in some cases such as penry. And so once the death point has been narrowed by the first three, then the jury can consider in mitigation, uh, anything, uh, in, in order to decide the ultimate question of life and death. Um, finally I want to take a look at a ton are versus a direct fee. This was a case in which the courts have both Texas and the United States Court of Appeals for the fifth circuit had limited mitigating factors. One limitation they had put on it was to say that mitigating factors had to be uniquely severe. These are a number of cases that came back after the penry decision in which Texas had to decide, um, whether or not the Texas Court of criminal appeals. And ultimately the United States Court of Appeals for the fifth circuit had to decide whether to Nard and others were entitled a new sentencing hearings because evidence of their mental limitations or intellectual disability was not admitted.

Speaker 1:          19:19          Uh, both courts, a Texas Court of criminal appeals, uh, said we find no evidence that, uh, tonight is a mentally retarded. So therefore there is no constitutional violation. In his case, uh, the United States Court of Appeals, the fifth circuit said this was not a, uh, uniquely severe and permanent handicap, uh, which burdened the defendant through no fault of his own and therefore there was no problem. Uh, the other, uh, limitation, uh, was the notion that there had to be a nexus between the mitigating factor and the crime. In other words, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said no evidence that his low Iq and to nards case prevented him from appreciating the wrongfulness of his conduct, uh, and kept him from, uh, controlling his impulses when this crime took place. Uh, and again, the fifth circuit said when it looked at the case, uh, there was no evidence that showed that the crime was attributable to his low Iq.

Speaker 1:          20:22          Uh, Supreme Court rejects that, uh, s six to three, uh, with justice O'Connor writing a for a majority of the court. She's joined by Steven's Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg and Bryer. And she said these tests that the court in Texas had applied and that the federal court had applied has no basis, no foundation in the decisions of the Supreme Court. That there's no screening that's done by a judge or by a court, uh, before evidence in has offered to see if it's uniquely severe or if there's a nexus between it. Uh, and the, uh, the crime that was committed that she repeats, that, uh, mitigation has been very broadly defined, says that a low Iq is inherently mitigating, even if it doesn't amount to a mental retardation, which would preclude the death penalty. It may still be a compelling mitigating factor if the person has limited intellectual functioning. Uh, she says the court has spoken in the most expansive terms, uh, and defining mitigation that irrelevant mitigation is evidence, which tends to prove some fact or circumstance, which, uh, would be, uh, which a fact finder that is the jury would find had mitigating value. Uh, chief justice Rehnquist Scalia and Thomas dissent. Uh, but this is basically, uh, the, uh, uh, state of the law today, uh, that the, uh, this prevailing view that, uh, anything offered in the lie about the life and background of the defendant that seen as a basis for a sentence less than death can be considered in mitigating in mitigation. Uh, we will talk next with Susan Marcus, who has done a lot of work both in investigating and finding mitigating circumstances and also as a lawyer in presenting it to juries.
