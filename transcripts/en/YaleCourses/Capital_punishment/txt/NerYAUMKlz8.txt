Speaker 1:          00:12          Person accused of any crime, including one facing the death. Boy Not only needs a lawyer, but in most cases there's a need for an investigator. There's a need for someone to investigate the strength of the government's case, the prosecution case against the person accused and a person who go investigate things like that. The person was somewhere else at the time of the crime or some other factors self-defence whatever may be the defense, uh, that is presented in the case. There may also be a need for expert witnesses to be presented. Now in, uh, public defender offices, particularly capital defender offices that specialize in defending capital cases. There will usually be investigators that are part of the staff. There may be social workers, mitigation specialists, which look into the mitigating circumstances in a case. Some private lawyers will also have investigators that they rely upon all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Uh, public defender offices may have a budget for expert witnesses. Uh, but very often private lawyers do not have. And, and some public defender offices do not. And as a result, they're going to apply to the court for funds for an expert witness. So let's look a little bit at what the needs are and then what the court has said, uh, with regard to this, uh, expert witnesses, uh, are going to help us decide things like, does the evidence, tell us what happened in the case? What was the angle of the wound, uh, where the people drinking at the time of the crime? Uh, did the bullet come from the defendant's gun? There'd be all kind of expert witnesses are just a few examples, um, where their bodily fluids left at the scene. Uh, was there an accidental fire arson? Uh, we know that many wrongful convictions have been in arson cases because there has been a faulty or mistaken belief that an arson was committed when in fact the fire was accidental.

Speaker 1:          02:11          So it may be very critical for a person who's accused of arson, for example, uh, to have their own expert in fire science, uh, come and evaluate the scene, evaluate, uh, the whatever tests were conducted upon, uh, the remains of the scene, uh, to see whether or not we know that Todd Willingham was executed in Texas, even though in all probability, uh, it was an accidental fire rather than an arson. So experts are critical, uh, because generally the lawyers are not going to know that. Uh, did the baby die because it was shaken a, in other words, the person's accused of murdering a child. That's a terrible crime and they're going to be punished severely. Uh, but it may be that it was sudden infant death syndrome or that some other factor contributed to getting an investigation and, and, and uh, expert witnesses are going to look into that.

Speaker 1:          03:02          How long ago did the crime take place an expert's opinion about how long a person, uh, had been dead? How, when the killing took place, uh, may be critical if the defendant was at a certain place at that time. Uh, and so the case can be determined, maybe determined on something like that. Again, these are just examples. Um, also, uh, expert witnesses are needed in the area of, uh, mental health. Was the defendant suffering from a mental illness? Uh, if so, what was it? Uh, how did it affect the person's behavior? Um, was the defendant sane at the time of the offense? Not often are people going to be successful in raising an insanity defense, but there are times when people are so profoundly mentally disabled that they do not appreciate the criminality of their behavior. And so there may be a question about their sanity at the time they committed the crime.

Speaker 1:          04:04          A is the defendant competent to stand trial is the person accused, uh, mentally able to understand what's going on in the courtroom, uh, to cooperate with a lawyer, uh, and participate in the proceedings. It person has to be a competent to stand trial. Uh, is the defendant intellectually disabled what was previously referred to as mentally retarded? This is critically important in capital cases, uh, because a, a person who is, uh, intellectually disabled, uh, cannot be put to death under the Supreme Court's decision. So that is a determination, uh, that may depend very much on testing. Upon review of records upon childhood, uh, record schooling and all of that. Uh, the Supreme Court has said that the death pony is disproportionate for children. That is people who are under 18 at the time of the crime. And for people who are intellectually disabled, that is people with sub average intellectual functioning, uh, that are not held to the same standard as people that have normal intellectual functioning with age.

Speaker 1:          05:09          It's easy. You just simply find the person's birth certificate and do the math. What are they under 18 at the time the crime took place. Uh, but with regard to intellectual disability, there can be very closely contested question of whether the person is one of those people who is, uh, intellectually disabled to an extent that they are not subject to the death penalty or is not quite intellectually disabled enough and are still eligible for the death. Tony, uh, and the other big question, future danger to society in Texas, the critical question and whether it's somebody who sends to death is, is this person a future danger to society and expert witnesses testify about that. Um, so, um, the penalty phase of a capital trial, again, there's a need for expert witnesses because, uh, it's going to be necessary to investigate and reconstruct the complete life history of the defendant.

Speaker 1:          06:10          Uh, who, uh, was he his parents? Uh, what childhood did he have? What intellectual or mental impairments, uh, might, uh, he or she have most, uh, obviously, as I said, may have a mitigation specialist or a social worker and investigator who will go out and gather that evidence. Uh, but then there is going to be, uh, a need for some mental health testing, uh, Mris, functional Mris, cat scans, those sorts of tests. Those all cost money. Uh, they require specialist. Uh, and so what do you do if you're facing the death penalty and the person has a fairly significant mental health issue? Uh, you're going to investigated in part by doing the work of the mitigation specialist or social worker, finding out the facts regarding that persons behavior throughout their life. Uh, but there's also going to be a need for expert witnesses. Uh, and there may also be a need for psychological testing, particularly with regard to intellectual disability.

Speaker 1:          07:16          Uh, psychological testing, uh, is going to be very important. Again, as I said, in case states with a capital defender office or a public defender, some of these people may be on staff and there may be a budget for the other people. Uh, but in states where that's not the case, then it's going to be necessary for the defense to apply to the court saying, I can get a fair trial unless I have the expert assistance. Uh, in this case, uh, and a case that illustrates this and the case that established the right, uh, of a person to expert assistance is Ake versus Oklahoma. Uh, Glenn Bird Naik, uh, was, uh, charged with killing a couple of wound in their two children in Oklahoma. Uh, his behavior was so bizarre that the judge ordered that he be examined. Uh, and the diagnosis was that he was probably a paranoid schizophrenia.

Speaker 1:          08:14          It was reported that ache appears to be, frankly delusional claims to be the sword of vengeance of the Lord and thought that he would sit at the left hand of God in heaven. It's the person seems not to be well grounded in reality. Uh, and so, uh, after they take a look and see what the diagnosis is, the court finds that he's incompetent for trial. That is, he cannot assist his lawyers understand what's going on at trial. And so he's committed to a hospital, but not long after that, uh, the hospital reports that he's now he's been taking thorazine, which was the, uh, uh, psychotropic drug often given at the time that ache was in the hospital, uh, and that, uh, he is now competent for trial, but the doctors did not examine him on the question of whether he was insane. That is whether he had an insanity defense, uh, based on his mental health at the time of trial.

Speaker 1:          09:13          So let's go to his trial. Uh, guilt phase. He clearly did the crime. The only question is, was he criminally responsible? That is, could he appreciate the wrongfulness of his behavior? Uh, and the law in Oklahoma at the time was that it was on the defendants side that that issue had to be raised and that some doubt had to be raised about sanity. If a doubt was raised by the defendant and the burden was on the state to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. But here, um, uh, no expert testified on either side. So there was no evidence with regard to, uh, aches, sanity, and therefore he was unable to present his insanity defense, uh, at all. And obviously this a case where it sounds like that would have been at least a possible defense in the case penalty phase, even more critical because they're, the issue is future dangerousness.

Speaker 1:          10:10          Is He a future danger to society? Uh, prosecution has three psychiatrists who testify that he is a ache, has nobody. Uh, so in terms of the trial, uh, he has nobody to present and supportive his insanity defense. Nobody to present on the question of future dangerousness. His appeal to the United States Supreme Court is that he's entitled to an expert witness and an opinion by Thurgood Marshall. Uh, the Supreme Court said that he is entitled, or that he has to have an adequate opportunity to present his defense fairly, uh, within the adversary system using what Justice Marshall characterized as the basic tools, uh, of, uh, a defense. Uh, the court bounces three factors in this opinion by Justice Marshall. Uh, the private interest aches, interest, obviously he has a compelling need because he can't present it a fence and he can't put on any evidence on future dangerousness unless he has an expert.

Speaker 1:          11:14          So his need pretty, pretty clear. Uh, the state's interest and Justice Marshall rejects the notion that does, is too expensive for the state to provide a mental health expert for a state could provide mental health experts, uh, for the prosecution. Uh, and it said the state has no interest in this strategic advantage, uh, by denying somebody the evidence they need, uh, to contest the issues in the case. Uh, so, uh, basically says finally the public interest, which is also kind of a state interest, uh, that, uh, the, the, the state has an interest in these issues being adequately litigated. A and being reliably determined. Uh, Justice Marshall points out most states provides psychiatrists or mental health experts and in cases that there is an issue of or a likelihood, uh, of, uh, uh, inaccurate resolution, uh, in these cases that psychiatry is not an exact science, uh, and therefore, uh, that ache is entitled to have evidence to present on his side of the question is basically it's a, it's a descendant of Griffin versus Illinois.

Speaker 1:          12:32          The case in which the Supreme Court said that the two people from Illinois, we're entitled to a transcript for their appeal here. The court much more realized upon the due process clause. While it does rely on the due process clause and not equal protection, but says, as a matter of fundamental fairness, the defense is entitled, uh, to present, uh, expert evidence in the state has to pay for it. But only in these situations where it's a significant factor. In Nick's case, obviously it was a significant factor at the guilt phase and sanity was the only issue. It was a significant factor at the sentencing phase where future dangerousness was. The only issue of course says there's no right of the defense to select the expert. Of course the prosecutor selects the experts that are going to testify for the prosecution. The right recognized an ache is basically just simply a right of a defendant through his lawyer to go to the court and ask for an expert and the court can appoint a whatever expert the judge wants to a point.

Speaker 1:          13:38          As a practical matter, most of the time the defense is going to go to the judge and say, this is the particular expert I need. I needed a neurologist because this issue is presented or I need a psychologist because we need to do testing. The need has to be set out. Uh, but one competent expert is all, at least the constitution titles you to, uh, the expert can assist in preparing the defense. That is the defense may need an expert to just simply look at what the prosecution's expert is set and, uh, help the defense decide. Is this something we can contest? Uh, perhaps after consulting with an expert, the defense will conclude that the prosecution is right or the export is right, uh, and concede the point on the other hand, it may be something that can be contested and aix case clearly. Uh, the question of his sanity and the question of future dangerousness were probably subject to, uh, being, uh, challenged.

Speaker 1:          14:36          Uh, Chief Justice Burger concurring says this is limited just to a depth pony cases and just the mental health experts. But as a, again, as a practical matter, courts all over the country, state courts as well as federal courts have recognized, uh, there is a need for funds for all sorts of expert assistance. It may be ballistics in a case where there's a question about where the bullet came from, whose gun was it fired. Uh, it may be a bite marks in a case where the state is putting forward that very controversial, uh, evidence, whatever the facts, but it has to be a significant factor. If it's not a significant factor in the case, then the court is probably not going to be required to provide the expert assistance, uh, but where it is, uh, where it's critical as it was an aix case, uh, then there's going to be, uh, the trial judge should order funding.

Speaker 1:          15:30          They're always going to be questions far more than we can get into. And in this brief session about the adequacy of the funding, uh, often one sexpert start examining a records and a defendant, there may be a need to do additional testing. There may be a need for additional, uh, other experts to come in. Uh, all of those are issues that are going to come up in cases from time to time. Uh, and the judges are going to decide these as they come in and they're going to be subject to appeal. Very often the question on appeal is going to be whether the defense made a sufficient showing of neat and are the words the defense shows. This was a critical witness that we had to have for our defense. Uh, finally, generally an ache itself indicates that this has to be made x party.

Speaker 1:          16:20          That is, in other words, just to the judge from the defense, the prosecution is not involved and the reasons for that are twofold. One, obviously a person of means a person who could afford his or her own expert, uh, would not be required to reveal who they were retaining and why, uh, to the prosecution. The only reason that a poor person must do it is because they're applying to the court, uh, for the funding. Uh, the second reason is that often in order to meet this very stringent standard of showing of need, uh, the defense is going to have to reveal to the judge, uh, communications with the client, privileged communications between attorney and client. A is going to have to use a, a reveal some of the work product, uh, that the lawyer has done. These are the things that normally are not ever made public.

Speaker 1:          17:11          Uh, and so it would be very prejudicial to the defendant, uh, if that information were revealed to the prosecution, the prosecution, uh, may at some point if the expert is going to be used, receive a report from the expert, uh, but as a general matter, the basis for getting the expert, uh, is not going to be revealed to the prosecution. So this protects the poor person in that situation. Um, let's talk for just a moment about where and when people have a right to a lawyer. Uh, we have talked about the right to a lawyer at trial sixth amendment. The constitution of the United States says that every person accused of a crime is entitled to a trial. And the assistance of counsel at that trial and the supreme court basically said anytime a, there's a loss of liberty, uh, there's a right to a lawyer and certainly in a death penalty case where there's a loss of life, um, there is a right to a lawyer.

Speaker 1:          18:08          Um, but then the question becomes, are you entitled to a lawyer for your appeals? Uh, in, uh, the sixth amendment only applies to trials the same day the court decided Gideon versus Wainwright. Uh, the case that held that a poor person accused of crime in a state court was entitled to a lawyer at State expense to defend them. The court handed down a decision in a case called Douglas Versus California in which the court held that a person was entitled to a lawyer for one appeal and it base that not of course on the right to counsel, which only applies to trial, but based on the case of Griffin versus Illinois, the case that had said there can be no equal protection equal justice when the kind of justice a person gets depends upon the amount of money he or she has. The court repeated that phrase, uh, later.

Speaker 1:          19:05          Nate versus Oklahoma. We don't see that language again. We only see the due process part of Griffin. Uh, but later the court decides in another case, Ross versus Moffitt out of North Carolina, that while a poor person has a right to a lawyer for one appeal, that in a state where there's a second appeal, let's say there's an intermediate appellate court in the state and then an appeal to the state Supreme Court. No, right to a lawyer. Almost every state provides lawyers at that point. And remember estates can always do more than what the constitution requires. But Alabama for example, does not provide a lawyer to seek review in the Alabama Supreme Court only for the first appeal to the Alabama Court of criminal appeals, even in death penalty cases. Uh, once the case has been decided by the state courts, either at the intermediate quarter by the State Supreme Court, a person can petition the United States Supreme Court to review the case.

Speaker 1:          20:03          But there's no right to a lawyer for that. So a poor person, uh, who's convicted and sentenced is going to be dependent upon some volunteer lawyer or perhaps if the state has a public defender system or a capital defender, part of its role will be to represent people before the United States Supreme Court. But in some states, that's not the case. But basically the constitution says right to a lawyer at trial and one appeal after the case is decided on appeal, a person can file a petition for writ of Habeas Corpus or file under whatever vehicle the state provides, uh, for uh, post conviction review where issues like ineffective assistance of counsel, jury misconduct, uh, the prosecution's failure to re to disclose exculpatory evidence. Those kinds of issues can be litigated in a separate action because you may not know about the prosecution's failure to disclose exculpatory evidence and until you become aware of it, I went to the Lord becomes aware of it.

Speaker 1:          21:10          Uh, normally ineffective assistance of counsel can only be raised in post conviction because obviously a person that's defending a case can't raise their own ineffectiveness. They're trying to do the best job they can, but someone later may decide that the lawyer was not competent and that in fact the person was denied a fair trial. Uh, the sixth amendment right to counsel, but no right to a lawyer even in death penalty cases, uh, the court held sometime ago. No. Right. For the average non death case, no right to a lawyer for this stage of the process. And then in Murray versus Jaron Tonto, even though, and Tonto makes the argument, this is definitely case my life is at stake. It's complex law and there's a very short timeframe because I have an execution date and I need to get into court in order to file for a stay of execution.

Speaker 1:          22:07          Supreme Court says it doesn't matter, it matters, but it doesn't matter in terms of a right to counsel, uh, that basically what Virginia was doing, which was providing, uh, lawyers at the prisons to give advice to people so they could follow their own pleadings, uh, which of course it's totally unrealistic in a capital case, uh, but that, that was adequate. Uh, Justice Kennedy and a concurring opinion also pointed out that in depth pony cases, people usually get lawyers from either volunteer lawyers from law firms are public interest organizations, uh, that represent them. Uh, some states do provide lawyers either by providing a, uh, an organization, a program that represents people, uh, in the post conviction process. Uh, but many do not. Uh, and as a result, uh, people may be dependent upon a volunteer lawyer to represent them at that stage. Uh, but basically a person who's not synced to death, uh, probably has very little ability to poor person.

Speaker 1:          23:14          Of course, a person to means can hire a lawyer and take advantage of the post conviction review process. But a poor person generally once their case is affirmed on direct appeal, unlikely that they're going to be able to find a lawyer and raise a post conviction. A challenge to their conviction, uh, will cause they're not entitled to a lawyer. The state may not provide a lawyer. Uh, and there's a time limit. There's a deadline, uh, which is going to vary from state to state, but can be as short as six months. And as long two years. But most people who are convicted and particularly poor people do not have the legal knowledge, uh, to raise these claims. Finally, uh, every person sends to death finally has an opportunity to present their case to the federal courts, um, by seeking habeas corpus relief. This final stage of the process, uh, the congress in adopting the federal death penalty law provided that in capital cases, the federal courts can provide lawyers to people facing the death Palette.

Speaker 1:          24:20          Some federal public defender offices have capital Habeas units that is a part of their office and specialized lawyers who specialize in representing people at this stage of the process. Uh, interestingly, Texas, the of the state that is executed over well over 500 people has the most death sentences of any state in terms of carrying them out. Uh, does not have a capital Habeas unit in any of the offices at the time. Uh, that, uh, that I'm talking. Uh, and uh, but other places do, uh, Philadelphia, Atlanta, uh, some and other places do not, but, uh, the court can also appoint a lawyer. Uh, but generally the issues that are going to be raised in the federal system are going to be issues that should have been raised as well in the state post conviction process. So hopefully, uh, the person has a lawyer who's raised those issues.

Speaker 1:          25:17          They're presented the evidence because the federal courts are going to look pretty much at the record, uh, of what has been developed, uh, in the state courts. So, uh, again, non capital cases, probably no lawyer for any of these steps, capital cases, it's going to depend on the state, but only a constitutional right to a lawyer, a trial and one appeal. And then whether or not their lawyers at these other stages a statutory right when they get to federal court. But you've got this state proceeding in between here. There's a lot of variation from state to state. A and some states have done a very good job of providing lawyers, uh, for people in post conviction and other states like Alabama, which was sort of called out by Justice Ginsburg and maples versus Thomas and Supreme Court opinion, have really done almost nothing at all to provide lawyers. And, uh, the post conviction process. So there's a great variance from place to place, but the lawyer, the qualifications, a little lawyer, the resources lawyer, all these things are absolutely critical, uh, to the review of death sentences and the question of whether somebody is sentenced to death, uh, but because of the crime they committed and the circumstances of the crime and the factors about the person or whether sentenced to death though, cause they had the misfortune of being assigned the worst lawyer.

Speaker 2:          26:51          Yeah.
