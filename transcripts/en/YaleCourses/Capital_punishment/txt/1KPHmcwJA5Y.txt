Speaker 1:          00:13          Once the supreme court upheld the death pony in 1976 and the three cases, Greg versus Georgia profit versus Florida and a jerk versus Texas, uh, there were still a number of issues remaining for the court to decide. Uh, one of those was a, the proportionality, what crimes to the death penalty, uh, applied to, uh, what about the role of the, uh, offender in the crime? Uh, the role that a person played where several people were involved, uh, for certain crimes. Uh, the, all of the three cases handled, uh, in are decided by the court in 1976 were murder cases. Uh, but what about the death penalty for cases in which the victim is not killed? Many of the states which adopted new death penalty statutes, particularly Georgia, uh, provided for the death pony, not only for murder, but for rape, kidnapping, uh, and other offenses.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Uh, and so the court ultimately decided that, and then finally, uh, for certain offenders, uh, particularly people who are mentally disabled and children, uh, is the death penalty excessive or disproportionate, uh, for those individuals. And what we're going to see in today's class, as we look through this, as the court is going to be counting the states, how many states have, uh, provided, uh, for, uh, whatever the court's considering. Uh, is this show that there's a trend or does it show that there is a consensus among the states? Because again, we're back to what we talked about where the eighth amendment, what are the evolving standards of decency that mark, uh, the, the, the development of the law. Uh, and then we'll also see the court look at whether or not with each of these questions, uh, the purpose of punishment is served. And that's a deterrence and retribution.

Speaker 1:          02:02          Uh, so let's first look at the question of the role of the offender. Uh, in the crime, uh, several people are engaged say, in carrying out a crime, each person has a different role. Uh, one person may be the lookout, one person may be the driver of the getaway car. Uh, and perhaps there was no intent when this crime was plan for there to be any injury to any one or any loss of life. Uh, but often unexpected things happen. The police respond and shots ring out and someone is killed. Uh, and then we assess the, uh, role of each person. Uh, they're all going to be guilty as we'll talk about in a moment of murder. Uh, but the degree of culpability may be different. And so the question is going to be, are they culpable enough to be sentenced to death? And I'd like to talk about two cases, uh, where the supreme court decided that both of these cases involve the felony murder rule, which is a rule that just basically says anyone who commits a felony and the co or committing a felony in which a murder is committed, uh, that person is guilty of murder, first degree murder, regardless of whether he or she committed or attempted to commit or intended to commit the murder.

Speaker 1:          03:19          And other words, going back to my example, three people are involved. The person who's the lookout is going to be just as guilty of murder as the person who actually fired the trigger that brought about the death. But there's obviously different degrees of culpability between the lookout and the person who actually pulls the trigger. Uh, and of course, part of that is going to be based on what the people do. That was, what actions did they take. And part of it is going to be based on the state of mind. Uh, this first came to the court in the case of Earl Inman versus Florida. This was the getaway driver, uh, in an arm robbery. Uh, and the question the court had to decide was could he be sentenced to death? He had been sentenced to death. And the question was, could he be sentenced to death if his participation in the crime was, as the court said, tangential and he had no attempt, excuse me, no intent to kill or for life to be taken.

Speaker 1:          04:16          Uh, in the case, the court looks at the different states and it finds Florida's one of only eight states that allows the death penalty for a person who participates in a robbery where the other robber is the person who takes the life. Uh, they find that of the 739 people who were under death sentence at the time, the Inman case was decided only 41, uh, where people who had not actually taken the life. So again, the court is looking at what are the states provide and then they're looking at what has been the practice even in the states that allowed this. Uh, then the court examines retribution and deterrence, uh, and they decide in this case that retribution and deterrence is not served a bill, cause Edmonds participation, uh, was so tangential. So the court, uh, holes that the death penalty is disproportion, very close case.

Speaker 1:          05:12          It's a five to four decision justice white writing for a majority of the court and Justice O'connor as well. If she says this, Berger and Justice Powell and Justice Rehnquist dissenting, uh, the court is now going to look at a case with a very different set of facts, uh, and we're going to see justice white, uh, move over to the other side. Uh, Ricky and Ricky Wayne and Raymond Curtis. Tyson a broke their father out of a prison in Arizona. Uh, they had a large amount of a weapons, uh, in an ice chest, which they snuck into the prison and they actually succeeded, uh, in this breakout there. Father Gary Tyson and another prisoner, uh, Randy Greenwall, uh, we're, uh, broken out of prison and while they're trying to make their getaway, they end up breaking down on the road, a couple stops to give help. And it was just a terrible crime.

Speaker 1:          06:08          Uh, Greenwalt and Gary Tyson, the father, uh, kill, uh, this couple who had been so nice to stop and offer them a ride as well as their children. So it's a horrendous crime. Uh, but, uh, the police apprehend them after a shootout, but Gary Tyson has died. He goes out into the desert and he can't find his way back. Uh, he dies of exposure. So the brothers are, the people left to be tried. Greenwald gets the death penalty. There's no question about his involvement. But the Garret, the two brothers are arguing that they did not intend to kill anyone, that father and the other fellow had taken these people away and that they were walking back to the car. At the time the shots rang out and they found out that these people had been killed and they said also they didn't cause the death of the victims in this case.

Speaker 1:          07:02          And as a result of that, their argument was that while they were guilty of murder, they can't be subjected to the death penalty. They can be put in prison for the rest of their life, but not the death. Polly, this time the court looks at the breakout, looks at the guns involved, looks at the, all of the factors in the case and decides five to four that this the death penalty can be imposed against the Tyson brothers. Uh, justice O'Connor writes for the court, uh, joined by the chief justice as well as just as white who had written the previous opinion in Edmond Powell and Scalia. Uh, and the court finds that there is a consensus among the states, uh, that major participation. Remember that Earl elements participation was tangential. Now the court's talking about major participation, breaking someone out of prison, trying to escape with them and a mental state that the court calls reckless disregard for human life.

Speaker 1:          08:02          That if you participate in an activity like this, you're likely to realize the risk that there may be human life taken, uh, as a part of it. And therefore the level of culpability is more than Emonds and that's sufficient for the death penalty. A Justice Brennan, uh, joined by three other members of the court dissent. Uh, they would treat the Tyson's just like Inman and they would say that because of the role that they've played because they weren't the actual killers and because they didn't intend to kill because they were surprised by what their father and the other person did that they should not be subject to the death penalty. But the court is now established that major participation, reckless disregard is going to be enough to make someone eligible for the death penalty and codefendant cases. Um, the court next turns to the question of whether crimes that don't involve a homicide are subject to the death penalty.

Speaker 1:          09:06          Uh, very soon after the, for the, uh, 1976 cases, the court looks at coker versus Georgia. And the question presented there to the Supreme Court is whether the sentence of death for the rape of an adult woman violates the eighth amendment's cruel and unusual punishment clause. It's important to note adult woman because even after this court or the court decided this case, uh, there remained a question about whether or not a sexual abuse or rape of a child might be eligible for the death penalty. Uh, but George's problem and arguing for the death penalty for the crime of rape, uh, was that it was fairly well isolated, uh, after the Ferman decision had come down. And his number of states adopted new death penalty statutes. Only three, Georgia, North Carolina and Louisiana, uh, provided the death penalty for the crime of rape. Uh, but the North Carolina, Louisiana statutes were both found to be unconstitutional in 1976 and Woodson, uh, versus North Carolina and Roberts versus Louisiana.

Speaker 1:          10:13          Uh, so Georgia now has left as the only state, uh, that makes this provision. So when the court now does this examination of how many states have this punishment, uh, Georgia finds itself all alone. Uh, the court looks at the last 50 years and notices that are majority of the states have not punished rape with the death penalty in the last 50 years. Uh, in 1925, 18 states provided, uh, for the death penalty and as well as the district of Columbia and the federal government, uh, by 1971, that number gone down just a bit, 16 states and the federal government. But by the time cokers decided, uh, in 1977, only Georgia. So Georgia is one out of 50 states that provides this punishment. The court then looks to what if the jury's in Georgia been doing with regard to this and it finds that of the, uh, 63 rape cases that have happened or that had been tried capitally uh, in Georgia since this statute was adopted, uh, only six times have juries impose the death penalty.

Speaker 1:          11:25          So the court concludes that it's infrequent. That is only one state has it. And even in the state that has it, it's infrequently used a justice white, uh, writes the opinion and expresses the, not only does the counting of the states but expresses the abiding conviction that the death penalty is excessive for the crime of rape, particularly since some people who actually kill people don't get the death pony. What we're seeing here is the court is roughly going to say, uh, that the death pony is limited to cases and where life has taken the same day that a coker was decided. The Supreme Court just issued a little, a one paragraph opinion in a case called Everhart versus Georgia in which it said that the death penalty cannot be imposed for the crime of kidnapping where there had not been a loss of life. Uh, and as we'll see, the court is going to decide and Kennedy versus Louisiana, the even in the case of a child, uh, the death penalty cannot be imposed where there is no loss of life.

Speaker 1:          12:26          Uh, Brennan and Marshall in this case say that the death ponies always unconstitutional. Uh, so they join the majority of justice white rights and they side with him. But for different reason. Uh, Justice Powell says the death pony may be constitutional for aggravated rape. Uh, and then just as Chief Justice Burger, uh, joined by Justice Rehnquist says that rape is not disproportionate. Uh, and he looks at coker in particular. Uh, in three years, coker had raped three people. He had killed one. He had tried to kill another and he had escaped. If ever there is a person, chief justice burger is saying for whom the death penalty is appropriate for this crime. It's coker. Uh, he describes him as a, or the chief justice describes coker as a chronic rapist and a continuing threat to society. Uh, but that's the descending opinion. Uh, so the result of the case is that the death penalty cannot be imposed in a rape case where there's no loss of life.

Speaker 1:          13:30          Now we move to Kennedy versus Louisiana in which the court took on the sort of exception here. Coker had been about an adult, uh, person, uh, Kennedy versus Louisiana presents the question of a child. Uh, once again, this is just as Anthony Kennedy, uh, is going to write the opinion for the Supreme Court. Uh, very interesting. Uh, what he says, uh, at the, in prefacing his analysis of the issue here, that when the law punishable by death, uh, it risks its own sudden descent into brutality, uh, transgressing the constitutional commitment to decency and restraint. He says the evolving standards of decency counsel us to be most hesitant before interpreting the eighth amendment in a way that's going to extend the death pony. The court is limited in many ways and now justice Kennedy is saying we should be very hesitant to extend the death pelly decency in its essence a presumes respect for the individual and this moderation and restraint in the application of capital punishment.

Speaker 1:          14:35          Sure. Markable statement for a majority of the Supreme Court he's writing for a majority of the court, uh, in this opinion, uh, which, uh, shows some hesitancy certainly to extend the death penalty and, uh, some concern that whenever the court is dealing with the death penalty, it is, he says, uh, uh, risks its own sudden descent into brutality. When we look at some of the other death pony cases decided by the court, we don't quite see that same concern. Uh, well the court does, once again, it looks at the states and it finds that 44 states have not made such a crime punishable by death, uh, since 1964, which is even back before affirming to eight years before Ferman only Louisiana has sends to anyone to death for this offense. Uh, no one has been executed for a non homicide crime since 1963 and only two people, uh, both in the Louisiana, we're under the death sentence, uh, at the time for the rape of a child.

Speaker 1:          15:41          So the court sees here that with regard again to looking, is there a consensus in the country with regard to this punishment? Death is extraordinary punishment. This era vocable punishment, uh, for even a terrible crime. And there's no question the crime in this case and any case involving a child and a sexual abuse of a child is a, is a horrible crime. Uh, but does it, uh, is a cup ability, the offender such that death can be imposed. And the court, uh, here says, uh, we're not going to have the death penalty where there's not a loss of life. Uh, points out that retribution, uh, the difference between a particularly deprived murder, uh, where the person is killed and where the person is not killed, uh, is the distinction that has to be made here. Uh, that deterrence, uh, actually this may cut against, uh, turns, uh, because Justice Kennedy sees the risk of non reporting.

Speaker 1:          16:39          Of course, the court was informed by a number of briefs, some of them for, from advocates for children who pointed out that most of the sexual assaults that take place or not by strangers who break into the child's bedroom in the middle of the night. Uh, but by family members, by teachers, coaches, priests, ministers, uh, people that the, the, that the family knows. And that if you know that that person who's been abusing you, uh, might be subject to the death Poli, uh, it might be a reason, uh, for some children to not report the crimes is this is not going to serve the purpose. Uh, and also this gives the perpetrator a motive. Uh, if, if, if the perpetrator is going to be subject to the death, plenty to kill the victim. Uh, finally he adds this, uh, point, uh, special risk of wrongful execution, uh, that children will cause they're highly susceptible to suggestive questioning, uh, are, uh, unlike are there to be at least sometimes not that they're likely to give, uh, evidence that's not going to be accurate, but that this is, there's a risk of this happening and this is what the court is concerned about.

Speaker 1:          17:58          And all of these cases are we worried about a risk of the death penalty being imposed in a case where it shouldn't be. And particularly here in a case where 44 other states have decided not to have the death penalty for this crime and only two people had been sentenced. So the court puts all that together, uh, and comes to the conclusion, uh, that the death penalty is not appropriate in this case.
