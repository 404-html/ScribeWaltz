Speaker 1:          00:15          Today we're going to look at challenges to the Supreme Court, uh, in the Supreme Court to the death penalty. In 1971, a challenge was launched. This was based on the due process clause of the 14th amendment. It was unsuccessful the very next year in 1972, another challenge was made, but this time under the eighth amendment of the constitution, the cruel and unusual punishment clause and it was successful. This was the case of Furman versus Georgia. The declared the death penalty unconstitutional. But then just four years later, after a number of states had enacted new death penalty laws, uh, the supreme court upheld the death pony at least for some states. And we'll look at that struck down the death only a four others. Uh, so we'll get a bit of history, uh, out of what we're going to look at, uh, in terms of the death penalty and how it had been practiced.

Speaker 1:          01:03          And then we'll look at the procedures that were adopted in 1976 and where the court, uh, ha ha has gone. Uh, from there, uh, the first case I want to talk about it. Mcgautha versus California. This was a case out of, um, two states, really. California mcgautha himself and a phoneme Wilkerson were appealing of state out of a, excuse me, appealing a Dustin's out of California. Uh, and uh, James Edward Crampton was appealing his de essence out of Ohio. Now, there were differences in the way these cases were treated back at this time. The, the, the California case involved a bifurcated trial. That meant there was one trial on guilt or innocence and one trial, uh, with regard to punishment with regard to sentencing, uh, the Crampton case which came out of Ohio, had what was pretty much the standard practice at that time. One trial and the jury decided both guilt and punishment and basically the way it worked was the jury, if it found the person guilty of murder could come back with a recommendation of mercy, in which case the judge would impose will a sense of life imprisonment.

Speaker 1:          02:10          Or if there was no recommendation of mercy, uh, then the death sentence will be imposed. So two different practices. Crampton is much more universal in terms of the wave statutes worked at that time. Um, this is, I say, based on the due process clause, uh, of the, uh, 14th amendment and basically what they're saying, as I said, California two phase trials we've talked about. Now notice the difference here and California, the jury is instructed that it may be influenced by pity, sympathy, uh, or mere sentiment. Uh, in Ohio the jury is told it must not be influenced by sympathy or prejudice. So different practices in the different states, uh, the is in both these and Ohio, and excuse me, California, they're specifically instructed, um, that they're entirely free to consider anything, uh, with regard to their judgment conscience. There absolute discretion whether to impose the death pony or not.

Speaker 1:          03:14          Uh, in Ohio, uh, they're basically just told if you find them guilty of murder, uh, then he's going to get the death pony unless you, uh, impose, uh, uh, uh, unless you make a recommendation of mercy. Uh, so both of these people, uh, the California people and cramped in, in Ohio are basically saying there's no guidance given to the jury here, uh, about when, uh, the death penalty can be imposed and when he can't, there are no guidelines or the jury's not told what it can consider a and what it can't. Uh, so the question that's before the court in mcgautha is what weight do we give to the fact that this has been the established practice? Uh, pretty much throughout the history. At one time we had mandatory death sentences for a number of crimes that was softened somewhat by the legislatures when they went to this additional provision for mercy as the jury having that option.

Speaker 1:          04:11          So that if the jury felt like the person yes, was guilty of murder, but no, they shouldn't be executed, they could add mercy to their, to their verdict, uh, uh, the, the court looks at this and basically just to put it in everyday language. Well, we've always done it this way. Uh, why would we do it differently? Now a justice, uh, Douglas suggest that, uh, maybe, uh, the requirements of due process can change. Or as he says, he evolve, uh, as time goes by. Uh, and then the question that, that these people are putting before the court is how important is consistency? They're saying the jury and our case could impose the death penalty for any reason. The jury and another case can impose if for any reason, so cramped and may get the deaf, Colleen mcgautha may get the death pony when somebody else a guilty of a crime, um, equally or maybe far more heinous than those crimes does not get the death point.

Speaker 1:          05:08          It's that create a constitutional problem. Uh, and is it possible to tell a judge and a jury ahead of time? These are the factors that you must consider. And deciding whether or not the death point should impose, uh, be imposed. Well, in 1971, supreme court said it's not possible. Uh, and mcgautha the court says to identify before the facts, the characteristics of the criminal, uh, homicides and the perpetrator, uh, which can be taken into account to decide, uh, whether a desk should be imposed or not. Our task beyond our ability, uh, this is not something we can do. And the court goes on to say that it is impossible to say that committing to the complete discretion of the jury, uh, the power to enter the, to impose the death sends a offense. Anything in the constitution. Basically the courts saying Justice Harlan, a writing for the majority, uh, saying, um, if a jury has given the awesome responsibility of whether or not to impose the death penalty or not, it will make that decision in good conscience.

Speaker 1:          06:15          And this is what we rely upon, uh, in terms of making sure that this punishment is imposed in a reasonable way. Uh, justice Douglas and Brennan a dissent, uh, saying, uh, surely the states can create some guidelines. There's gotta be some information given to the jury about what information it can consider, what information it can consider, but that draws only three votes. Uh, in 1971 a year later, the court is going to come to exactly the opposite conclusion. Uh, now the court is going to look at this under the eighth amendment, the cruel and unusual punishment clause. The Eighth Amendment provides that excessive bail shall not be required or excessive fines imposed. And then the part we're interested in nor cruel and unusual punishment imposed a number of cases that are in the materials that accompany the clarity. They're part of the class, uh, that most of the supreme court cases up until this time, uh, had been about the method, the way in which a person is executed.

Speaker 1:          07:20          Is it unusual to shoot someone, uh, in Utah for our crime? Supreme Court said that's not unusual and, uh, you could, uh, could carry out an execution that way. Electrocution electrocution was first introduced challenge to the practice of electrocution and the Supreme Court said, states can use electrician, uh, electrocution. Uh, and then, uh, Willie Francis his case on Louisiana, they tried one time to execute Willie Francis and it wasn't successful. And so the question was, can you try a second time, uh, to put a person to death? And that case made it made its way to the supreme court before they try it a second time. Uh, and Supreme Court said you could and Willie Francis was executed by the state of Louisiana. But, but those, those decisions not very helpful for people challenging the death pony under the eighth amendment. Uh, but there are a couple of cases that are important, uh, as sort of the backdrop, uh, for the Supreme Court's decision, uh, in Ferman.

Speaker 1:          08:23          Uh, the first is a case that came out of the Philippines when, uh, it was a territory of the United States in cases would be reviewed by the United States Supreme Court called Weems versus United States. Uh, Williams was severely punished for the crime of falsifying a public document. And the Supreme Court decided in the case that the punishment was too severe for the crime, uh, that he was imprisoned. He was a, in a hard labor perpetual, uh, uh, surveillance, uh, number of, uh, harsh, uh, and severe penalties imposed for just falsifying a document. And here we get some tools that the supreme court uses when it looks at the death penalty that the cruel and unusual punishment clause may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by humane justice. In other words, the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the eighth amendment is not limited to just what it meant when it was adopted at the time the bill of rights was adopted at that time.

Speaker 1:          09:26          There were all sorts of punishments. Uh, there was a hanging shooting. There was cutting off fingers branding, uh, a number of other kinds of punishments, which the society doesn't really use any more. Uh, and the Supreme Court and Williams says, you look to what is, what is society except today, not what society, except back in the 17 hundreds. Uh, it also introduces the notion that a punishment may be excessive. And the, in determining that we look to the purpose of the punishment and can the purpose of the punishment, uh, be fulfilled without resort to such a severe punishment. In other words, is there a way to punish falsifying a public document or any crime, including murder? Uh, that is less than the most severe sends, uh, that's imposed. And if that's the case, then it may be an excessive unconstitutional sentence as the sentence imposed upon Williams was, uh, in, in, uh, under the cruel and unusual punishment clause.

Speaker 1:          10:31          The other important cases, troop versus Dallas, a troop was denied. He was naturalized, uh, as a result of a desertion during war time. And the question became, is this punishment too much, uh, for uh, leaving him stateless? Is this too much of a, too severe, uh, a punishment under the cruel and unusual clause of the eighth amendment? Uh, the Supreme Court held that it was, uh, justice, uh, Chief Justice Warren riding for four members of the court says the basic concept underlying the eighth amendment is nothing less than the dignity, uh, of humankind. Uh, and it provides some important language, which we'll be looking at all through the course, uh, that the eighth amendment draws its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark, uh, the progress of a maturing society. Again, much like what we've said, but at the court looks at what are the evolving standards of decency.

Speaker 1:          11:32          The, the eighth amendment doesn't necessarily mean what it said at the outset, as I said, and finally and controversially a but not at that time. International standards are relevant. Uh, when they looked at the punishment that had been imposed upon troop, they said civilized nations all through the world, virtually unanimous against this severe a punishment for this crime. Uh, the, the one thing about troop that is important, it only got four votes. Uh, so it was not a majority opinion. Justice Brennan wrote a concurring opinion in which he laid out his, uh, understanding of the cruel and unusual clause, uh, and joined in the outcome or troops sentence was struck down. Uh, but that took a little bit away from the force of this decision. Nevertheless, we get some concepts. Here are some principles under the eighth amendment from these two cases that are going to come into play when the supreme court takes up Furman versus Georgia.

Speaker 1:          12:30          But first, let's just back up. Can you really make an argument that the death penalty is unconstitutional? Uh, uh, the constitution provides, takes into account, uh, the idea of the death pone of the fifth amendment to the constitution says no one shall twice be put in jeopardy of life or limb. I suppose some would say it's even constitutional to remove a limb. Uh, but that practice is pretty much, uh, been abandoned. But, uh, they talk about putting one in jeopardy of life, not deprived of life without due process of law. And then in the 14th amendment, uh, adopted after the civil war, once again, uh, the constitution says, uh, a person is not to be deprived of life as well as liberty or property without due process of law. So the constitution itself clearly contemplates that the states and the federal government, uh, will use the death pony.

Speaker 1:          13:32          So if the argument is going to be made that the death penalty a violates the constitution, it's going to have to be based upon something about the way in which the deaf pony is imposed or the way in which it's carried out. It's not going to be that the death pony is per se, a violation of the constitution. And that's the question that came before the court. And Furman versus Georgia. Uh, uh, Farman was convicted of murder, uh, in Georgia. William Henry Farman, Lucius Jackson, uh, was convicted of rape in Georgia at the time. Fermin came before the court. That death punny was given for a number of crimes, not only for murder, but also for rape, armed robbery, kidnapping, a number of other crimes, uh, Elmer branch also convicted of rape. But in Texas, uh, these three defendants all convicted and trial courts in the states of Georgia and Texas, and they bring this case to the Supreme Court and ask it to answer this question.

Speaker 1:          14:29          Uh, does the death pally violate the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the 14th amendment? Uh, and so the court decides that it does, but in one of the most remarkable opinions, uh, maybe unprecedented in the Supreme Court, no two justices can agree on why it does. So we have five different opinions and the majority, and we have four separate opinions in the minority and each justice has their own take on what this phrase and the eighth amendment means cruel and unusual punishment. Uh, and so we don't come out of from and with any sort of clear guidance as to what the constitution does and does not allow. But we come out with a lot of principals, uh, from the different judges' opinions, which will be very important in looking at the death. Connie, uh, later on, uh, let's look first to justice Douglas. As most senior judge, uh, justice on the court appointed by Franklin Roosevelt, he saw a desire for equality, uh, in the ban against cruel and unusual punishment.

Speaker 1:          15:37          And he went back through a English history at some lengths to talk about why, uh, one of the concerns of the framers when they adopted the cruel and unusual clause was, uh, equality in the way people were treated. Uh, also, uh, discrimination. That of course relates to equality. Uh, a penalty is unusual because we are dealing with a death pony. So we don't have to really, uh, as the question of is it cruel? A court is going to say the death point is unlike any other penalty. It's extraordinary penalty because it just ends a human life. Uh, it's a revokable no way to go back and change it if you find out you made a mistake. Uh, but the question really is, is it unusual, uh, under the cruel and unusual clause? Uh, Justice Douglas says it's unusual if it discriminates by reason of race, religion, wealth, a social position in class, and he Marshall's a lot of evidence which shows that the death penalty has been, uh, carried out in the country, uh, in a way in which it's certainly fallen more heavily on, uh, African Americans in particular at that time, uh, and almost exclusively on the poor.

Speaker 1:          16:46          Douglas says at one point, in his opinion, you can search in vain for a wealthy person, uh, who, who was sentenced to death. Uh, and what he's interested in is the risk of these, uh, factors coming into play. He didn't say you have to prove that race motivated. Uh, the prosecutions in these cases or race was the reason that the death penalty was sought when life imprisonment might've been a completely sufficient punishment. Uh, but that the death penalty is unconstitutional if, uh, there are procedures that give room for the play of race and poverty to come into account. So that's, that's one vote to strike down the death penalty. Uh, next is, is Justice Brennan, uh, Hoover importing to the court by President Eisenhower. Uh, and he has basically a four part, a way of looking at the cruel and unusual punishment clause. First of all, he, he goes back to this notion of dignity that we got out of truth versus Dallas.

Speaker 1:          17:47          And he says, a punishment cannot be severe and degrading. Even the convicted criminal has a measure of dignity. Uh, and therefore there's some limit on what kind of punishments can be imposed and it can't be degrading. Uh, it cannot be arbitrary. Uh, he says that the death pony in terms of how, and this is going to be a theme we see throughout these opinions, it smacks of little more than a lottery system, uh, that some people get the death pony and some people don't. But there's no real basis that we can discern except for race perhaps as to why some people get it and others don't. Third question he asked is, is it acceptable to contemporary society? Here again, we're talking about the evolving standards of decency. Does the country today, except it, there were punishments, uh, as I said a moment ago, uh, like whipping people, most people would say today that, you know, whipping has been abandoned by every state.

Speaker 1:          18:49          And so is it acceptable to contemporary society? The answer probably know, uh, this is a punishment that's been abandoned. Uh, such a, so has branding, so has cutting all fingers, uh, those kinds of punishments once accepted in this country, but no longer acceptable. So does a contemporary society except it. And then finally, the notion that we saw in, uh, in Weems of excessive a will, a less severe punishment serve the same purpose. Uh, and so Brennan sort of ads in this element of necessity. Does the, does the state need the death Tali, uh, to punish the crimes that are involved here? Rape and murder, uh, if it can punish those crimes with life imprisonment and, and serve the same interest that the state has, which is preventing people from committing these crimes and punishing them, uh, if they do, um, well then we go to potter.

Speaker 1:          19:48          Stewart. Justice Stewart is a republican appointee appointed by President Eisenhower had been on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and, and, um, uh, Cincinnati. Uh, he says it's unusual if it's infrequently imposed. Uh, he says for murder, it's infrequent and for rape, it's extraordinarily rare, uh, that the death pony, uh, is imposed, uh, for that. Uh, and he used a very colorful language. Capriciously selected handful, uh, receive the death pony while others who commit crimes just as reprehensible do not. Here again, we see this question of consistency are some people getting the death penalty? And some people, not. Stuart says receiving the death pony is like being struck by lightning. Uh, there's no, uh, some people get it while others don't, and there's no reason for those distinctions. So He's worried about, uh, the infrequency, uh, and also, uh, the capriciousness, uh, of the way in which the death penalty is imposed.

Speaker 1:          20:51          Uh, he goes on and talk about a little bit about race. He says my concurring brother and, uh, have demonstrate that if there's any basis for why these few get the death pony when many others, uh, don't, uh, it is the constitutionally impermissible reason of race. But he says race discrimination has not been proven and I put it to one side. I simply conclude that the eighth and 14th amendments cannot tolerate this unique penalty, the death penalty to be imposed in a wanton and freakish manner. Uh, and so again, sort of colorful language that, uh, justice Stewart uses in describing what he sees as problematic. Notice though that Justice Stewart here is not saying I find the death Polly unconstitutional in all situations. He's saying when it's freakishly imposed, when it's very infrequent, uh, when it's like being struck by lightning, uh, which is the way the depth punny had operated up until 1972, at least according to his view of it, then that makes it cruel and unusual, unusual in the arbitrariness of it, the infrequency of it.

Speaker 1:          22:05          A very important vote here. Uh, Justice Byron White pointed to the court, uh, by, uh, the only appointment by President John F. Kennedy, uh, Justice White, uh, normally fairly conservative on criminal law matters, uh, but he votes to strike down the death polling. He, again, like Justice Stewart talks about the infrequency the fact that the death penalty is so seldom used, uh, that it doesn't really serve the deterrent purpose that its supporters claim, uh, that it has. Uh, he also, uh, finds it excessive that there is a negligible return to the states, uh, for enforcement. Uh, the, this, uh, is more again, gets into this, uh, question. Uh, the Brendan talks about, about necessity, uh, the pointless and needless extension of life with only marginal contributions only marginally serves the state purpose when it has another sentence, which is, can impose, uh, just as well as he said, the legislative purpose will not be frustrated, uh, because it can still punish.

Speaker 1:          23:11          And so we're not saying you can't punish these crimes were just saying you can't punish them. Uh, with the death valley, you can punish them with life imprisonment or a term of years or whatever. And then finally and critically, uh, just as a white says, there's no principled way to separate the few who get the death pony from the many who do not notice. Again, this is our second justice now along with Stewart, who's not saying I'm necessarily opposed to the death pony, but I'm opposed to it in the way it's used infrequently, uh, arbitrarily, uh, and without any principle basis for why some people get it. And some people do not. You read this opinion and you think, well, if there was a principle basis, which is what the states are going to try to do after farming, uh, you'd probably get justice white's a vote to uphold a new death sins, which we will see, uh, happens.

Speaker 1:          24:06          Uh, I think justice white at the time, uh, and the court perhaps overall, uh, thought the death pony was on its way out. I just a few years before Furman was the only time in the late 1960s, uh, when the supreme court, or excuse me, when the public opinion polls show that more people were opposed to the death penalty a then support it, the rest of the time zone has been more support for the death penalty than opposition to it. Uh, but beyond that, the court had decided a case called Weatherspoon versus Illinois, which we'll talk about when we talk about juries in which the court had talked about excluding people from juries, uh, because of their position on the death penalty. And notice that a large segment of the population was being excluded. Uh, and it sort of talked about the people qualified or the people left behind is a dwindling minority of people who supported the death point.

Speaker 1:          24:59          In other words, the, the, the practice of imposing the death. Polly had declined a great deal in the 1960s. Uh, the, uh, public opinion polls tended to show people who are opposed to the death penalty. Uh, and by 1972, the court sort of looks back at all those and things and it's been a moratorium. No DeCinces had been carried out, uh, for some period of time. And so the court thinks, uh, that death pony, this is sort of a society, American society like the English, the French, and, and, and Scandinavians in so many other people are ready to abandon the death point. Uh, what the court didn't anticipate obviously was that the, uh, 1968 presidential election and president Nixon's running on, uh, being very tough on crime and crime becoming a very big political issue. Uh, the public opinion polls had changed dramatically by 1972.

Speaker 1:          25:49          The court's a little behind the curve here. Uh, but it, we'll find out soon that there's more support for the death, plenty, uh, than it thinks a justice. Thurgood Marshall was the only member as a, I've mentioned the only member of the supreme court ever actually handled the death pony case. He actually set in a chair, uh, you know, back when very few black lawyers who are practicing, uh, beside other African Americans and represented them before juries in capital cases. He appealed death penalty cases. He knew that innocent people, uh, could be sentenced to death because he had seen that happen. And one of his, one of his own, uh, not sentenced to death but convicted. And one of his own cases, uh, as far as just Marshall was concerned, that death pony is purposeless vengeance, morally reprehensible, and he finds that retribution is unacceptable as a purpose.

Speaker 1:          26:41          One of the debates that were going to see within the court here is if we have the death pony, what government interests does it serve a, if it serves a retribution, is that a proper interest, uh, for a punishment to serve? Uh, does it serve rehabilitation? Obviously the death pony doesn't serve, uh, rehabilitation. Did Terrence, uh, does it deter? Uh, and we'll see the debate back and forth, uh, in the court, both in this case in 1972, Furman versus Georgia, but also later in 1976 when the court addresses, uh, the new death pony statutes. Uh, but here also, Marshall says the American people would never support the death penalty if they knew that it was imposed. Discriminatorily and he Marshall's a lot of statistics and a lot of historical information and supported that. One of the most dramatic being that since the Justice Department started keeping statistics, uh, on the death pony in 1930, uh, from 1938 until 1972, there had been 455 people executed for the crime of rape.

Speaker 1:          27:48          Uh, 405 African Americans. One of the more damning statistics, uh, in our national history, he also pointed out that innocent people, uh, had been sentenced to death. Uh, and it probably, most people don't know that, but if they did, they probably wouldn't support the death penalty. And then finally picks up the theme that Justice Douglas had set at the outset. It's the poor, the ignorant, and the underprivileged who get the death penalty. A while. People of means people who are better off are and justice, guilty, uh, and perhaps crimes just as reprehensible, uh, they escaped the death pony. Uh, so justice Marshall clearly, uh, believes that the death police time has come and gone. Uh, he and Justice Brennan would oppose and, and Justice Douglas probably, uh, the death pony in, in any case. Uh, but then we have two justices, as I said, just to Stewart and justice white who find that because of the way the death plenty is imposed as they see it in 1972 arbitrarily freakishly, uh, uh, that it's unconstitutional.

Speaker 1:          28:52          Um, so let's look at the dissenters. Uh, Chief Justice Warren Burger trucks about, and this basically, if we want to look at what divides the majority, the five justices in the majority. All right. Separate opinions, the four and the minority. All right. Separate opinions. But what is the basic separation between the two? Uh, and I believe it's what, uh, Justice Burger trucks about here, the primacy of the legislative role. The dissenters believe this is a question for the legislature's. Uh, it's not a question for the court to take up the five and the majority feel like this is a constitutional issue. Does the death penalty violate the eighth amendment of the United States constitution? Uh, and that's a judicial determination to be made. A Burger also points out that the death penalty is not a repugnant. He looks at these, uh, other eighth amendment cases, as I said earlier, about whether a particular method shooting electrocuting trying a second time, uh, do those things violate the criminal unusual punishment?

Speaker 1:          29:57          He says this is not like a burning people at stake or those types of things. This is a, a, a punishment that, uh, is not only a accepted, it's not universally condemned. He points out that 40 states and the federal government, uh, have the death pony. The federal government had even added some desk statutes in the, in the last decade. Uh, and then here's the interesting, a division between the majority and the minority. We see the justices in the majority, the five talking about how unusual the death pony is and how infrequent it is. A Justice Burger turns us around looking at it from another angle and says the infrequency shows the jurors are very cautious about imposing the death Pollock, uh, that they are very cautious and whether to impose it. So you look at the same set of facts, the fact that the death penalty is imposed, a hit here and there, uh, in different parts of Georgia, different parts of Texas and other states, uh, one group of justices sees that as arbitrariness.

Speaker 1:          31:01          Uh, there's like being struck by lightning just as burger. And some of his colleagues in dissent see that as juries are very careful when they're given a person's life in their hands. They're very careful about, uh, whether or not to impose the death penalty. So, um, you can look at sort of the same facts as the court does here, uh, and see two different realities. But the primary one for Justice Burger, uh, is that this is something that courts shouldn't be involved in this, that we are to leave it to the legislature's. Uh, same thing for justice. Blackmun. Uh, justice Blackmun had never liked the death pony. He had made that clear when he was on the United States Court of appeals and he looked at a death penalty case side. Well, many death, plenty of case, but one in particular how to Arkansas. Uh, and he talked about how difficult it was for him to sit on these cases.

Speaker 1:          31:52          Uh, but he said it's a legislative judgment. Uh, whether a state has the duff punny or not is up to the legislatures. We as justices on the supreme court should respect what the state legislature's do. Uh, Justice Powell, uh, pointed again by all of the dissenting justices appointed by President Richard Nixon after his election in 1968. Uh, just as Palestinian, first of all, if we're looking at the evolving standards of decency, uh, we want to look at what the legislatures have done. Again saying, we defer to the legislatures and his Burger had pointed out, 40 states had the death pony at this time. Of course, many of them were not using it. Uh, it was being used primarily in the southern states, but it was on the books, uh, in a number of other other states. Uh, and Powell again takes issue with this notion that the fact that it's not being imposed very often is some indication that the death penalty has been rejected by modern society, which is what, uh, Justice Brennan says when he talks about is it acceptable to contemporary society.

Speaker 1:          32:58          He looks at how few death cases are imposed and says, uh, basically the, the country has turned its back on the death pony. A pal says, well, uh, not so fast. The death penalty was imposed a about two depth pennies a week, uh, or imposed throughout the country in the 1960s. Uh, and then on Brendan's notion of necessity, which also seems to be a little part of Justice White's opinion, uh, power responds to that by saying there's nothing in the constitution that says that a penalty is invalid. Just because there's a lesser penalty that would serve the same purpose. In other words, what white is saying and what Brennan is saying is that the states don't really need the death poly. It's serving only a marginal value because they can punish these crimes with life imprisonment. Just as saying, there's no constitutional rule that says a state has to use the lesser penalty.

Speaker 1:          33:53          Uh, and that that's a reason for striking down the greater penalty. Um, he also talks about race, uh, but in a sort of resigned way, uh, just as Powell says, it's always the poor and minorities, uh, that are treated poorly, who get punished. Uh, but he said the reason for that is because they grow up in poverty. Uh, there's not the parental and, uh, other supervision and that what we really ought to do is deal with the root causes of poverty and income inequality, uh, and not abolish the Death Poli. Uh, and then he seems to suggest that race is not really that big a factor anymore. Uh, he said the great race has greatly diminished because now we have blacks hung juries when we come to juries. Will see that's not the case even today. Uh, but it certainly wasn't the case in 1972, uh, when Justice Powell said that, uh, because at the time, uh, prosecutors were able to strike African Americans from jurors.

Speaker 1:          34:58          And of course, if you've got a group that's in a minority to begin with, uh, it's going to be fairly easy for the prosecutor to use his or her discretionary strikes, what we call a peremptory strikes to exclude people. So, uh, still in a lot of places where the death pony was being concerned was being imposed. A, there were not any blacks on the jury and there weren't any African Americans anywhere in the decision making process in the prosecutor's office, which decides whether to seek the death penalty or whether it a plea bargain. The cases, uh, no, uh, black people on the bench and judges and, and most of the states, particularly the states, uh, and generally cases being tried to all white juries. Uh, and then, uh, we talked about history in an earlier session, uh, and the role that the criminal justice system has played in racial oppression and throughout the history of this country, uh, from the time of slavery to convict leasing to mass incarceration today, uh, Powell says, well, past discrimination, uh, is no reason to strike down the death point.

Speaker 1:          36:03          And this is a question that we will wrestle with. To what extent, uh, do we look at the past? Do we look at how much this history, this utterly corrupt criminal justice system that sent convicts out, uh, into the fields and to the railroads and the coal mines, uh, that, uh, helps slavery by providing for the deaf 20 for so many people? Uh, to what extent is that bleed into the present? Uh, and to what extent have we have the criminal courts overcome it? Uh, but that will take up, uh, as, as we go forward. Uh, finally, uh, we have, uh, Justice Rehnquist and Justice Rehnquist, uh, says that, uh, again, uh, the court is not a roving commission. He again is going to defer to the legislature's, uh, is not going to strike down laws based upon what he says is just the majority.

Speaker 1:          36:58          It's just making a policy determination here. Uh, he says a decision by unelected judge that something is constitutionally prohibited, uh, interferes with the right of people to govern themselves. If the people of Alabama or Texas or Georgia one have the depth pony, the court should, uh, let them have it. Uh, and his main point, judicial self restraint, uh, that the judges should, again, as I said, the primary difference between those and the minority and those are the majority is what's the judicial role here? Is the judicial role to examine this and decide whether or not the death penalty is constitutional or is it to stand back and let the legislature's decide, uh, whether they're going to have the death penalty, what crimes will be punished by the death point and how juries or to come to their decision. But the end result of this is the death pony is declared unconstitutional as applied in 1972.

Speaker 1:          37:56          This resulted in a, the end of the death pony for the time being. Every person about 560 people were on death row at the time. Ferman was decided, uh, this decision affected not only the people in Georgia where Furman came from and, and Texas, uh, but it affected all the death sentence, the state and federal throughout the country. And, and, and we sort of get this out of these cases, uh, the notion of arbitrariness, uh, as part of the notion of unusual, the process of imposing the death pony must be rational. There's got to be some principled basis to distinguish the few. This is going back to justice white's opinion. A few who get the death Polly, uh, from the many who do not. Uh, Justice Douglas says there's gotta be some protection in any death pony statute that prevents the risk of discrimination based on race or poverty or, or other factors.

Speaker 1:          38:52          So we come away with that as sort of a, uh, an eighth amendment principle, uh, out of these cases. Uh, and also, uh, this notion of the evolving standards of decency, uh, the meaning of the eighth amendment. Can change what it meant. Uh, and, and, uh, 1970, uh, in 1776 a is not necessarily what it means today. Uh, punishments that, uh, did not violate the eighth amendment then may violate it today. Uh, as I said, society has reached a consensus that some punishments are no longer acceptable. At the time of the founding of the country, uh, there were no presence. And so people were often punished physically, uh, with say whipping. Uh, but today, if some state enacted a statute that said, we are going to provide a 10 lashes for the crime of shoplifting, uh, probably the supreme court would say that violates the eighth amendment cruel and unusual punishment clause because society has basically abandoned if there's not another state, 49, the other 49 states don't use whipping a as a punishment anymore.

Speaker 1:          40:00          And therefore, even though it was constitutional, uh, at the time the eighth amendment was adopted, uh, not constitutional today. But here's the problem. How do we decide what the evolving standards of decency are? Uh, do we measure it by what juries do, which is what Justice Brennan talked about. Do we look to legislatures, which is what the dissenters talked about. Do we look at public opinion polls? Uh, we will see going forward that the supreme court is going to wrestle with this, uh, for some time about how to measure the evolving standards of decency. It's easy in the examples that I gave. If no other state is using a particular punishment, then you can say society has turned its back on it. Well, but what if 20 states are using it in 30 or not a what if in the 20 that are using and it's only being used every now and then, uh, and the juries aren't imposing it very often, uh, has society evolve to the point that that's no longer an acceptable punishment.

Speaker 1:          41:02          But we will see that with regard to the death punny in general. Uh, and we will see that with regard to the death penalty for a certain kinds of crimes, accomplices, for example, uh, and for certain people, uh, children, uh, have the, uh, the society except anymore, uh, the death penalty for children. Does it accept the death pony for people who are intellectually disabled? Uh, and we will get to all those, uh, in, in the future. Uh, but we see today the court beginning to wrestle with how it's going to decide on the evolving standards of decency, a proportion or excessiveness necessary justice Brennan a suggest, as we talked about the need for a relationship between the severity of the punishment and the government purpose. The government wants to punish people for the crime of murder. Uh, it does. So, and, and Georgia and Texas by providing for the death penalty.

Speaker 1:          42:01          Uh, but the question is, uh, if they have life imprisonment, is it necessary to have the death poem? And Douglas would, eh, would add, particularly if it's discriminating. Uh, and I don't think there's much question today, uh, that certainly, uh, throughout our history, the death pony has been used in a discriminatory manner that it was a particularly against African Americans, both during the time of slavery and up until 1972, uh, after the civil war, uh, was over. Uh, and then the notion of dignity, uh, which was, uh, what Chief Justice Warren thought was the central principle of the eighth amendment and truth versus Dallas. Uh, we're going to see two different notions of dignity, uh, hear from the court, but Justice Brennan's concern, uh, about the punishment not be being unnecessarily degrading. Uh, Justice Arthur Goldberg, who had been on the court before once said that, uh, the deliberate institutionalized taking of human life as the ultimate degradation, uh, of a human being.

Speaker 1:          43:10          Uh, and so for Brennan, that answers the question right there. But we will see later, uh, that for other justices, what dignity means is you take into account the individual characteristics of the person, but it doesn't necessarily mean that you don't allow the death penalty all together. Uh, and then this notion that death is different, that somehow the procedures, uh, are going to be a more careful, uh, in cases involving the death pony because, uh, the death penalty is era. Vocable eliminates a person from the human community. Uh, and the courts have to be very careful, uh, with regard, uh, to, uh, the, uh, fairness and reliability in which the death pony, uh, is imposed clear that as we've discussed that not all five members of the majority think the death penalty is always unconstitutional. The four and the minority clearly think to death. 20 is unconstitutional. Uh, con is constitutional and would defer to the legislatures as soon as, uh, firmer was decided, uh, a number of states, Georgia, Florida, Texas, among them start passing new death penalty statutes, 35 states in all. Uh, and that's what we'll review next is when the court comes in 1976 to look at those statutes and decide whether or not they're constitutional or not. We'll see. The court upholds some and find some others do not satisfy the eighth amendment.
