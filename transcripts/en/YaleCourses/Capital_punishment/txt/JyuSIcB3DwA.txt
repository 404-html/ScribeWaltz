Speaker 1:          00:12          Today, we know thanks to DNA testing and thanks to some exceptionally thorough and diligent investigations that had been carried out that many people who have been convicted and found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in both capital and non capital cases are actually completely innocent of the charges. A number of people have come off death row because they're innocent and a number of people convicted of all sorts of crimes, some of whom have served 20, 30 years have been released because the work of innocence projects all over the country as well as lawyers, public defenders, and other people. Uh, it's a disturbing factor when you look at how close we've come and I think we actually have executed a innocent people. Uh, so we want to talk just a little bit about that and what the reasons are for it. With the guard, the DNA, uh, testimony.

Speaker 1:          01:07          Uh, this fellow here pictured here, Kirk Bloodsworth, uh, was sentenced to death and 1985 of a horrible crime. The rape and murder of a nine year old girl, a five witnesses tied him to the crime. Uh, Bloodsworth said when he was sentenced, he said, you are sensing an innocent man, but he was condemned to die. Uh, his sentence was overturned in 1986 because the prosecution had withheld exculpatory evidence that by law it was required to give him, uh, went to trial again. Bloodsworth once again is convicted this time he's not sentenced to death, but sentence to imprison. Uh, as it turned out that when lawyers later looked at Kirk Bloodsworth case, uh, they found that on the close of the little girl who was killed, there was a very small Siemens Day and by then the forensic experts and learned how to do DNA testing and they tested the stain and they found it was not Kirk Bloodsworth.

Speaker 1:          02:18          It turns out this man who had been condemned to die, this man who has spent so much time in prison was absolutely innocent of the crime. And as often happens with DNA evidence, they also found out who actually committed the crime. So we're going to look at some of the reasons why, uh, people, uh, that are innocent, uh, are convicted, uh, and why perhaps we shouldn't put quite as much faith in the results and the verdicts that are reached in the criminal courts. Uh, as we do, uh, one reason, and perhaps one of the most prominent is misidentification. Uh, the film that's recommended in the materials murderer on a Sunday morning, uh, involved a young African American boy who's riding his bicycle in the neighborhood. A tourist is shot and killed. Uh, the police picked this young man up. He's black, he's in the neighborhood. They take him back to the husband of this woman who's been killed, who was of course shake.

Speaker 1:          03:19          And you can imagine you've just seen your spouse shot right before your very eyes and watched her crumbled to the ground and die. And they bring a black kid and put them in front of you and say, is this a kid? And he says, yes. Uh, it turns out he was wrong. Uh, public defenders, uh, that represented Butler prove not only that Butler was innocent. Not only was he acquitted at trial because of the extraordinary lawyering that was done on his behalf, but they actually found the person who committed the crime. And there was some DNA evidence that left, no question that this other person was the one that did the crime. Uh, mis identification happens in all kinds of cases, particularly in large areas where people don't know each other. Of course, small town, maybe everybody does know each other, so it's less likely.

Speaker 1:          04:08          Uh, and there've been a lot of efforts to try to improve the way in which identifications are done. Uh, but a lot of one enforcement agencies had been very resistant to that. Uh, how, uh, the pictures are presented or lineups. Uh, we know that one of the most suggestive things, uh, is to just simply take a person back one on one a and show him, uh, to, uh, the victim has happened or the witnesses happened, uh, in Butler's case. Uh, so misidentification, uh, still a reason that, uh, erroneous convictions are made very often the person who was arrested, uh, having to be in the neighborhood, that's why they got arrested. Uh, but the aren't the person who committed the crime. A, another reason is expert testimony of, of dubious value. Uh, there are a lot of experts who work at crime laboratories or who testify habitually for the prosecution.

Speaker 1:          05:04          Uh, they may be people who are working in complete good faith, uh, and conscientious. Uh, but when the crime laboratory is part of the State Bureau of Investigation, uh, sorta develops in some of them at least, uh, biases, uh, that favor the prosecution. Uh, they're also honest mistakes that are made, uh, in deciding what evidence may mean, uh, in trying to foul you. Wait, what happened in a case? I mean, a good example is Cameron Todd Willingham. Uh, this was a man who was executed by the state of Texas. He was convicted of an arson, uh, in which is three little children were killed. Here he is with one of them, amber on, on his shoulders. Uh, the fire department didn't really know how to investigate a arson cases. They very seldom had a arson cases in this community. Uh, the question always in an arson cases was the fire started accidentally.

Speaker 1:          06:09          Uh, for some reason or another because of an electric heater that overheated and started a fire. And Chris, this was in the middle of the night, uh, or was it arson? Was it intentional? Uh, the experts in Willingham case that testified for the state said it was arson and they gave a lot of reasons for it. And just one example, uh, they said that the patterns on the glass, uh, that there were all these, uh, they call it a craze glass or the way the glass was cracked and so forth. It that showed that an accelerant was used and that was evidence of arson. Well, it turns out that, uh, glass will end up that way. Uh, if you get class very hot and spray cold water on it, which of course is exactly what happens when the house burned down. Uh, the house, the fire heats the glass, the fire department comes sprays water on the glass and you get this pattern, which doesn't show then an accelerant was used.

Speaker 1:          07:11          It actually shows, uh, that, uh, cold water was poured on high class. And there were a number of other examples of this. There was another case in Texas involving almost, uh, the same, uh, kind of a fire that, uh, Willingham was convicted of. It involved a fella named Ernest Willis. He was convicted of arson. Uh, he had the very good fortune to have a New York law firm take his case and consult with the leading arson experts in the United States. And they basically took the prosecution's case apart and showed that a lot of the testimony that had come in had been based upon sort of these myths or these sort of, uh, beliefs that a lot of old timey arson investigators had. But that science had proven we're not accurate. When this information was taken to the prosecutor, uh, in Willis, this case, uh, the case was dismissed and Willis was set free.

Speaker 1:          08:15          If you change the lawyers in those two cases, if Willingham had had the benefit of Willis as lawyers and checking out his case, and Willis had the misfortune of having Willinghams lawyers, uh, you would change the outcome in those two cases. The battle rages on about whether, uh, Todd Willingham was actually innocent, but the weight of the evidence is certainly, uh, daddy was, uh, another way is prosecutorial misconduct. Another way in which innocent people are convicted, um, uh, for you to turn over exculpatory evidence. We talked about the prosecution. We talked about the responsibility that prosecutors have if there's evidence of medicines, uh, to turn it over. Uh, there've been several prominent cases where that's come to light. John Thompson, uh, who won a multimillion dollar verdict, uh, when it was found that prosecutors knew that the blood type involved in solving that particular case was not John Thompson's blood type and had known for years.

Speaker 1:          09:25          It was only discovered when he was just weeks away from execution. Uh, his verdict was taken away from him by the United States Supreme Court. Uh, uh, Anthony Graves, uh, who was sentenced to death also in Texas. Uh, his case was set aside because the prosecution didn't turn over evidence of the key witness saying that graves was not involved in that somebody else had been involved when the case came back and was examined by a prosecutor for, from Houston. Uh, that prosecutor said it was the worst prosecutorial misconduct she had ever seen. This was the prosecutor put in 19 people on death row. I mean, she's not somebody who's terribly sympathetic to that offense. Uh, but what we don't know is how often these mistakes don't come to light, uh, because they're buried along with the clients. And that would be the case of Carlos de Luna. Uh, Carlos de Luna was sentenced to death in Texas.

Speaker 1:          10:25          Uh, Jim James Liebman and Professor at Columbia University Law School and others have a book coming out in 2014, uh, regarding the case, there's a website about Carlos de Luna, uh, suggesting that in fact, the k the crime was committed by another Carlos, Carlos and Mendez. Uh, and that the prosecution knew about this other Carlos, but stood up in front of the jury and said that the other Carlos was, didn't even exist. That it was a myth that it was just something, a dune. As lawyers, we're trying, uh, to, uh, distract the jury with, uh, but, uh, convincing case, looking at all the evidence that Carlos de Luna like Todd Willingham, uh, even though he was executed was innocent. Another reason is false confessions. It's hard to imagine why a person would confess to a crime they didn't commit. But we know that if a person is deprived of sleep for a long period of time to private to food is subject to a very harsh interrogation techniques.

Speaker 1:          11:36          Uh, we know, particularly if it's a person who has a limited intellectual functioning, although that certainly doesn't mean all the time, uh, that people do make false confessions. Uh, you know, Gary Geiger, who was accused of killing his parents, uh, ultimately after long interrogation with the police and, and being asked to imagine, uh, how he would have committed the crimes if he had ended up with what was supposedly a confession. Can Imagine how horrible it would be to lose both your parents to come home and find your parents dead and then to be accused of the crime. And since to death row turned out later that they found out a motorcycle gang had committed the crime, uh, Earl Washington and sentenced to death and Virginia with an Iq of about 46 or somewhere in that neighborhood, uh, would confess to anything. Uh, and he confessed to committing this crime for which she had not committed a, he said one time the victim was black.

Speaker 1:          12:36          He said at one time the victim was white. He was willing to say just about anything, uh, that he was asked to say. Uh, he had very limited intellectual functioning. Uh, he saw the police as authority figures. Uh, he very much wanted to please them, uh, and he just simply didn't have the ability to cope, uh, with, uh, with dealing with the questioning. Of course, ultimately DNA evidence, proof that he was absolutely innocent of the crimes. And there've been many other examples that are documented by, uh, people who studied, uh, false confessions. Uh, another reason is false testimony by informants. Many cases are made, uh, by informants. Very often people in jails will tell the prosecution, uh, if you'll drop my burglary charge, I'll testify that this person who was in the cell with me, uh, confessed or admitted to me that they did the crime.

Speaker 1:          13:34          We see this in case after case, after case after case. Uh, and increasingly people are realizing that this testimony, this sort of bought testimony, uh, is that a lot of people say just about anything to get out of jail or a lot of people say just about anything to get their sentence reduced. And so, uh, the studies have found that, uh, informants are notoriously unreliable, but there's no way juries are going to know. Some courts now instruct the jury's a year to be very careful and you're to scrutinize this testimony. Uh, but the jury is still at the end of the day, a person says, I was there. The person came to me and they admitted doing it. Uh, we know that for example, in Los Angeles, they were able to get access to court records to find out what the details of the crime were. So the prosecution would argue, uh, he must've confessed because the informant would not have known the d the details of the crime if the defendant hadn't told him.

Speaker 1:          14:35          Uh, in fact, the informant had learned, uh, from court files, uh, what the details of the crime where, uh, so this testimony, uh, continues to be used. It's a very common, uh, in criminal cases today. A poor legal representation is something that we've talked about in the segments on council. Uh, it remains a tremendous problem. Uh, the best protection against an innocent person being convicted and sentenced to death is competent legal representation is having a lawyer who will investigate the identification. A lawyer, he'll find out everything that can be found out about the informant, a lawyer who will check into the forensic testimony that's being used, the opinions of whatever it may be, a medical examiner, an arson expert, and then consult with their own experts, uh, to see if in fact this evidence stands up, uh, that in many cases that just simply doesn't take place.

Speaker 1:          15:37          In many cases, people are inadequately represented. Uh, the government's case is not really contested because the defense lawyer just simply doesn't have the resources to hire the expert witnesses or to do the investigation that's, that's needed. Uh, they're also procedural barriers which come into play often. This evidence is not discovered until long after the trial. If it was known before trial, of course it would be presented at trial, but long after the trial, some evidence comes to light. Uh, and then the question is how to get it before court. Uh, sometimes, uh, Texas for example, you have 30 days after the trial, uh, to file a motion for new trial. Uh, there may be an opportunity in the state post conviction process. Uh, but what happens when you get past that, uh, sometimes they're procedural defaults in the case that his issues have not been properly preserved and then waived, uh, because he didn't seem that significant at the time.

Speaker 1:          16:38          Uh, but now we know that they are tied to evidence of innocence. So, and then the final thing is what happens after a person has gone all the way through the federal review. The Federal Habeas Corpus Review, um, person finds new evidence may be very critical evidence of innocence, but you only get to go to federal court one time, uh, with the exception of an innocence claim. But as we'll see, a very high standard, uh, let's look first at procedural bars. Uh, the Supreme Court held that it is a miscarriage of justice to execute an innocent person. Uh, the court developed at when issues were procedurally waived or when they were barred, uh, that a person could show cause that is a reason external to the defense and actual prejudice, uh, and have the issue heard by the court. But what if the person can't show cause, uh, or actual prejudice?

Speaker 1:          17:41          Usually there's going to be prejudice in the cases that involve innocence. Uh, the court has said where the constitutional violation, that is the issue that wasn't preserved, probably resulted in the conviction of a person who's actually innocent of federal habeas court may grant the writ, even though there's no showing of cause for the procedural default. And the court has made clear that the showing is that is probably resulted in the conviction of an innocent person. Uh, the court can grant the writ. Now it takes a constitutional violation. That is, there was a failure to disclose exculpatory evidence. It wasn't known until just now. It's now being brought before the court and the constitution of violation. If you look at the facts and the facts develop from those facts, show that the person is actually innocent or ineffective. Assistance of counsel, failure of council to do certain things.

Speaker 1:          18:40          And we know now that if council had done those things, uh, the person would be innocent. So it's going to be a combination of a constitutional violation and, uh, evidence of innocence. It's got to establish the innocence of the person. If that constitutional violation has hurt. Now let's look at what happens to a person who doesn't find out about the evidence of innocence of the constitutional violation until after they've been through the federal habeas corpus process. Uh, the supreme, the Congress did this in writing, uh, this part of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act, which was adopted in 1996. A person can try to bring a claim of innocence tied to a constitutional violation, uh, but only if the underlying facts, if proven and viewed in light of all the evidence from the trial. All the evidence that we have as a whole would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence, not probably, but by clear and convincing evidence that, but for the constitutional era, no reasonable fact finder would have found the applicant that is the petitioner guilty of the underlying offense, some much higher standard.

Speaker 1:          20:00          And the law requires that the petition first be presented to the United States Court of Appeals. Three judges here. It decide based on that hearing, whether the papers make out a sufficient showing, uh, that the person may be innocent, uh, and that they can make this showing by clear and convincing evidence, uh, that no reasonable fact finder a would have found the person goatee extraordinarily high standard to meet. If the court finds that, then it sends it to the District Court for a hearing in which the evidence will actually be presented. Uh, but it makes it very difficult to get back into court. Uh, once someone has had a federal habeas corpus hearing, what about a case in which it's found that there's a constitutional violation affecting the penalty phase of the case. And maybe if this had come to light, the person would have a stronger showing a mitigating circumstances and, and, and maybe it would not have been sentenced to death.

Speaker 1:          21:01          Uh, the Supreme Court has said that in order to meet this standard with regard to the sentencing phase, with regard to the sentence that is imposed, the person has to show that, but for the constitutional violation, the person would not have been eligible for the death penalty. This is almost never going to be the case because if you have any case where there's one aggravating circumstance, uh, the person's eligible for the death Polly, it's going to be the very rare case where the constitutional violations is going to show that that aggravating circumstance, uh, would not be valid, although there could be such a case, uh, but for the kinds of errors that really affect the penalty phase of capital trials, uh, no relief either for procedural bars or in Second Habeas Corpus petitions, um, in Herrera versus Collins. Linelle Herrera, uh, didn't have constitutional violation. He came before the court right before he was to be executed by Texas and presented what has been referred to as a free standing claim of innocence.

Speaker 1:          22:08          Uh, that is, he said, I've got new evidence and the new evidence shows that I'm innocent. A bite. It's not tied to a constitutional violation. It's just new evidence. Uh, Supreme Court and a decision by chief justice Rehnquist said the, in order to bring this Habeas Corpus action, uh, there has to be a constitutional violation. You can't bring a habeas case just based on a freestanding claim of innocence. But then in order to get the votes of Justice Kennedy and just O'Connor, he adds a paragraph, uh, near the end that says, we may assume for the sake of argument that a truly persuasive showing of innocence, uh, would render the, uh, execution unconstitutional and be a basis for habeas relief. But Herrera's evidence, uh, the court makes clear it didn't think was very strong at all and certainly not strong enough to make that showing. Uh, the court says the fail safe here is executive clemency, uh, and says quite a bit about executive clemency and the value of it.

Speaker 1:          23:15          Uh, the problem was in Texas, there's never really been much executive clemency because the decisions are made by an 18 member board that never meets as a group in facts is things around to each other. Uh, and never really recommends clemency for anybody. Uh, so it's not much of a fail safe in Texas. It may be, uh, in some other places, uh, justice O'Connor, uh, joined by, uh, Justice Kennedy says, I certainly say that if it's a truly persuasive, a showing of innocence, that a person should get habeas corpus relief, uh, justice white, uh, says only if no rational trier of fact could find proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Uh, Justice Scalia and Thomas, uh, say that there's nothing in the constitution, nothing in the text and the traditions of the country or practice, uh, that requires the court to entertain and claim of innocence at all.

Speaker 1:          24:14          A Texas attorney general was asked her an oral argument. You mean if there was a videotape that showed this person was somewhere else at the time of the crime or showed the crime and that this person didn't commit it, you're saying they could still be executed? And the answer was yes. That's what we're saying, a, that if there's no constitutional violation, uh, the court has no jurisdiction and nothing to look at. Uh, justice Blackmun joined by justice Stevens and justice Souter dissented, uh, saying that the standard ought to be, whether in light of new evidence, the result of the trial is sufficiently, uh, reliable, uh, for the state to be able to carry out its execution. So far, nobody has been able to make a freestanding claim of innocence. Some judges on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals thought that Paul House had in his case, uh, but the supreme court, while finding that house had made a sufficient showing to go back and put it on his claim of innocence, uh, found that it was not a freestanding climb, but he had constitutional issues in there as well.

Speaker 1:          25:19          Well, finally, we'll just take a moment and talk about Glen Ford, uh, released in March of 2014, uh, after 30 years. I mean, this is what happens when innocent people are convicted. 30 years of this man's life, uh, gone. This was taken by his lawyer. This picture of him was taken by his lawyer, uh, on the very first day that he was out after spending 30 years that the notorious Angola prison and death row in Louisiana. Uh, and you see the reasons for wrongful convictions in this case, the lead attorney was an oil and gas lawyer who had never tried a case, never tried a case to a jury, either a civil case or a criminal case. The other lawyer working on the case was two years out of law school. He worked for an insurance defense firm and he tried slip and fall cases, cases where, uh, people would sue a restaurant because somebody slipped and fell and broke their hip or whatever.

Speaker 1:          26:20          He would defend the, the restaurant for the insurance company in this case, which was tried in Shreveport, Keto parish, Louisiana. The prosecutors used all of their strive, user jury strikes to eliminate all the black people from serving. So Glen Ford was tried by an all white jury. And as I said, he went to, uh, Louisiana state penitentiary, the Angola prison, uh, spent 30 years on death row there. And then after 30 years, the prosecutors announced that they had credible evidence, uh, that Ford was neither president or a participant or an any way involved in the robbery and the murder of the victim in this case, uh, 30 years of a man's life. It's a long time, uh, at least he wasn't executed. But what we've learned from what we've been talking about and so much more, uh, is that this criminal courts, the criminal courts do make mistakes.

Speaker 1:          27:19          Uh, and very often the mistakes are found serendipitously. Uh, sometimes the people have been exonerated because the journalism school at Northwestern law school, uh, for people on Illinois to throw are found innocent by journalism students. Uh, sometimes it's DNA testing. Uh, sometimes it's lawyers that do extraordinary investigations and work over years and years and years to finally figure out what happened in cases, but many times they're not those people there. And what we know is that this criminal justice system makes mistakes that innocent people are indeed convicted far more than people realized, uh, that the poor legal representation is a critical part of that. But only one part of it, uh, that is long as the courts are making decisions based on things like identification, based on things like informants, those sorts of things. There are going to be mistakes and unfortunately and tragically in some capital cases, uh, without the kind of extraordinary work that we've seen. In some cases, those are going to be fatal mistakes and innocent people will in fact be put to death as, as I think they had been already.
