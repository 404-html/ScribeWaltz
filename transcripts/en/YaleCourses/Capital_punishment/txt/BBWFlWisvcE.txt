Speaker 1:          00:11          In this session, we take up the peremptory strike. That is strikes exercise by the prosecution and by the defense lawyers to remove prospective jurors after, uh, this is not the same as the challenges for cause. Those challenges are based upon the inability of a juror to be fair and impartial, either because of what the juror has read or heard, or fields or attitudes about the death penalty or any other factor that would keep a person from objectively being fair and impartial. The parties have the right to strike a certain number, usually set by statute. Uh, let's say 10, uh, 10 jurors for any reason whatsoever. Uh, and for years, the perimetry strike was used to exclude African Americans from jury service, uh, in the communities where they were in, uh, the jury pools, uh, Robert Swain, uh, a black man was sentenced to death and Talladega County, Alabama, a 26% of the population of Talladega county was African American.

Speaker 1:          01:17          Uh, but they were underrepresented in the jury pools only 10 to 15%, uh, of the average jury pool and no black person, no African American had ever served on a jury. Uh, in Talladega, uh, Robert Swayne's lawyers presented to claims based on the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the Supreme Court. First of all at the prosecutor discriminated in Swayne's case that is in Robert Swayne's case by striking all six black people who were in the group of people there for jury duty. Uh, and secondly that the prosecutor regularly one, not just in Swayne's case, but in virtually every case, the prosecutor struck African Americans, uh, from jury service and at this practice violated the rights equal protection. It's interesting to look at when Swain was decided, this is right during the midst of what's been called the Warren Court's Criminal Law Revolution. Uh, when the court was deciding cases like Miranda versus Arizona and was trying to do something about some of the abusive practices that were going on and just to, uh, trying to provide some procedural fairness, uh, in the criminal justice system.

Speaker 1:          02:38          Uh, it also came down in the mid 1960 [inaudible] when much of the country was still segregated on the basis of race. This is not that long a time period after the court had decided brown versus board of education requiring a into segregation in the schools, and there was massive resistance to the Brown decision. Uh, and this is right in the midst of the civil rights movement. Uh, and yet, uh, the court ignores the discrimination. It was obvious that Robert Swain and then everybody knew happened in every case. That it was just a routine practice for prosecutors to strike, uh, people on the basis of race. Uh, and, and, uh, the court instead celebrates the preemptory stripe. Uh, it says that it can be exercised on any grounds, uh, including race, religion, nationality, occupation or affiliation. Uh, and in case that wasn't clear enough, a lawyer may strike any group, whether they be Negroes, Catholics, accounts, or those with blue eyes.

Speaker 1:          03:50          Uh, you can imagine that more strikes were probably being used against black people than people with blue eyes. Uh, and the court goes on to say in the quest for an impartial and qualify jury, Negro and white, Protestant and Catholic are subject to the perimetry strike. Think of that sentence again. In the quest for an impartial and qualified jury, Negro and white, Protestant and Catholic are subject to being struck just because of their race or because of their religion. Uh, from jury service. Well, of course, if you're in a minority, uh, if you're the black people, uh, and you're only six blacks in the jury veneer from which Robert's Wayne's trial, uh, was chosen and the prosecution struck you because you are black, that's pretty much going to mean that they're not going to be any blacks serving on juries, uh, in Talladega county. The court here makes again, a wrong call, uh, in dealing with racial discrimination.

Speaker 1:          04:56          I think looking back on it now, we can say that this is a case like Plessy versus Ferguson or like, uh, the dred Scott decision or what the court will later too in McCleskey vs Klemp Kemp, uh, where the court sanctions and puts its stamp of approval here really more than in any other place. The court puts its stamp of approval on race discrimination in jury selection. Uh, and it continues to this day. We'll look at what's been done to try to stem it. To some extent, but I don't think anybody doubts that when peremptory strikes are used, where neither side has to give a reason, that one of the primary considerations is race, even though it's illegal. Uh, the court also, uh, took a look at Swains claim with regard to the systemic, uh, challenge the prosecutor, uh, striking people all the time. Uh, but it's set an impossible standard to me that when the prosecutor, in case case, no matter what the circumstances are, whatever what crime is, is, is, uh, uh, accused, uh, no matter who the defendant, no matter who the victim, uh, if the prosecutor in every case like that removes blacks and they don't serve on juries at all, uh, it might be possible, uh, to conclude that the prosecution was striking on the basis of race and denying black people.

Speaker 1:          06:25          Jury Service Accord is pretty stingy though. It goes on to say such proof might support a reasonable inference that negroes are being excluded for reasons wholly unrelated to the case. And that the peremptory strike is being used to deny black people. Uh, they're writing an opportunity to present, uh, to participate in the administrative of administration of justice like other people. Uh, but Swayne's lawyer hadn't proven, uh, that it was the prosecution responsible for the fact that there had never been an African American on a jury and Talladega County, Alabama. So he fails a on that. But when you think about this test going forward, it means that a prosecution can discriminate in one case, but unless you can prove that over every case, no matter who the defendant, no matter who the victim, no matter what the issue is in the case, unless it's a practice across the boards, the court holds that it doesn't violate the equal protection clause.

Speaker 1:          07:25          Well, uh, the Swain case, uh, well let me mention the dissent. Uh, just as Goldberg joined by Chief Justice Warren and Douglas a descend from this, the court points out that this adds additional barriers. Uh, we know that discrimination is going on in the selection of jurors and instead of doing something to try to stem the tide to try to change it, the court sets of burden that's almost impossible to meet in this case. As the court said, uh, or just as Goldberg said, uh, the court keeps the word of promise to our ears. Uh, but it breaks it to our hope. Uh, he points out that neither side has the right to printers strike. This is not provided for in the constitution, may be provided for him, some state laws. Uh, but this is not a constitutional right that's at stake here. Uh, and, uh, it's just as Marshall points out, uh, later on in Mcrae versus New York, uh, the Swain case was subject to scathing criticism and yet it took 20 years, uh, before the court did anything about the fact that this case made it perfectly okay for a prosecutor and striking a jury to strike people because they were black or because they were Catholic or because of any other characteristic that they might have.

Speaker 1:          08:51          A, whether or not that changes made a difference, uh, is subject to, uh, debate. Uh, but in 1986, the court modified Swain or the standard and Swain, uh, still relied upon the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment that is intentional racial discrimination. But said no longer is it necessary to prove in case after case, no matter who the victim, no matter who the defendant, that the prosecutor is striking, uh, all the blacks in every case, uh, you can infer a court can infer discrimination from a disproportionate use of strikes in a single case. In other words, the prosecutors strikes, he was 10 peremptory strikes and nine of the strikes are against the nine black people in the veneer. So there's an all white jury, the court, and that happened all the time. Uh, the court says you can infer from that race discrimination and it doesn't mean there was, but you can infer from that.

Speaker 1:          09:47          Uh, and if that happened, the judge, the prosecutor then has to give race neutral reasons, uh, has to say why I didn't strike that man because he was black. I struck him for some other reason. I didn't strike that woman because she was black. I struck her for some other reason. And then finally, after the court looks at the strikes and any other evidence that's presented on discrimination looks at the reasons given by the prosecutor, the burden of proof is on the defendant, that challenger, uh, to show intentional race discrimination. And the judge decides that now what this requires a trial judge to find is intentional racial discrimination by a prosecutor and that the prosecutor lied about it by giving a pre textual reason for the strike, uh, when really the reason was race a very, very difficult psychologically, uh, and just practically for judges to make that finding a many jurisdictions in this country, prosecutors and judges work together all the time.

Speaker 1:          10:56          Uh, the judges know Morgan accuse that prosecutor of discriminating and lying about it, uh, because, uh, it politically it may be impossible for one reason. Uh, but secondly, they may have a relationship in which the, the judges wouldn't do that. Or the judge may have racial attitudes, uh, that, uh, don't find objectionable. A striking all the blacks, very often people go to the bench, uh, from having been in prosecutor's offices. So, uh, may be the judge was at one time the district attorney himself and he may have struck all the African Americans when picking juries. Now he's the judge and his chief assistant as the prosecutor and he's striking African Americans. Um, but that's who the courts look to to protect the rights of black people to serve on juries. That trial judges, uh, there's been a tremendous amount of resistance to Bateson, uh, by, uh, both courts and lawyers, uh, ever, ever since it has been decided.

Speaker 1:          11:57          A Justice Marshall who of course had seen race discrimination, personal and up close, uh, correctly predicted in his concurring opinion in bats and that it was not going to prevent race discrimination, uh, pointed out first of all, that because you have to show a disproportionate number of blacks were struck in order to make out a prima facia case. If the prosecution, uh, struck one or two blacks because they were black, uh, it can get away with that because that doesn't establish a prima facia case. It's only when it's something, like I said, nine out of 10. So there are only a few African Americans in the jury. The prosecutors strikes him. Maybe the reason is because they're black, but we'll never know because in those cases, the prosecutor probably won't be asked to give reasons. Secondly, he points out that any prosecutor, uh, can, uh, assert a facially neutral reasons and the tragedies aren't going to know whether those reasons are true or not.

Speaker 1:          12:57          And so they're not going to be able to second guess the prosecutor with regard to the reasons. Thirdly, he points out what the Supreme Court had recognized in Turner, uh, that a prosecutor's conscious or unconscious racism might very well be the reason that he's striking head juror, that he might see a black person and think that that juror is salon or distant. Uh, but he might see a white juror who acts exactly the same way, but he doesn't have that same, uh, feeling, uh, about the jurors. These demeanor reasons, saying that jurors didn't pay attention or that they appeared uncomfortable or all sorts of things that they were selling. A, those are reasons that prosecutors give all the time, uh, for striking African Americans. Uh, and it's virtually impossible for judges to know whether they're true or not. In the litigation over, uh, the use of a peremptory strikes and North Carolina, it was actually discovered that the prosecutors had a list of race neutral reasons, so that if they had struck a juror and they had to give a reason, they could just look down and say, well, that juror was solid.

Speaker 1:          14:09          Uh, so it didn't necessarily have to relate to the particular juror. It was just a race neutral reason, uh, that was available, I should say bats and now applies to everyone. It applies in civil cases to plaintiffs and defendants, lawyers. Uh, it applies to defense lawyers and criminal cases. Uh, but still where it comes up most often is in prosecutors, uh, striking African Americans, uh, from jury service. And we'll look a little more at that in a moment. Uh, but here the court starts basically cutting back on this and Hernandez versus New York, the prosecutor struck for Latinos because they could speak Spanish. And prosecutor's reason was that they would not trust the interpreter if they're Spanish speaking. People on the witness stand, uh, these Latinos would understand what they were saying and he didn't want anybody to understand where they were saying he wanted people to only go by what the interpreter said.

Speaker 1:          15:08          A supreme court says, first of all, the fact that it has a discriminatory impact because this reason of course applied only to Latinos that spoke Spanish. So it meant that they were excluded from the jury. Uh, secondly, the fact that a reason correlates with race, uh, does not, uh, mean that it's an impermissible. It can still be a race neutral reason, even though it may result in all the, in this case Latinos or in another case, all the blacks being excluded. A third, the court talks about deference to the trial judge, uh, reversed only if clearly erroneous. So it's going to be very difficult for a defendant, uh, who makes us challenge to a prosecutor's strike. And the trial judge rejects that and lets the black juror sins, the watch your home, it's going to be very difficult to get that reversed because of this clearly erroneous standard.

Speaker 1:          16:09          Uh, justice Stevens, uh, joined by Justice Marshall, uh, would have found, uh, discrimination, uh, in the case, uh, not long after that, uh, the court decides per cat versus him. In 1995, uh, here, some people wondered if Batson really meant anything at all because the court said, uh, prosecutor in this case struck to blacks. Uh, he said those two African Americans were the only people in the whole jury veneer that had facial hair, mustache and goatee and one and one of them had long curly hair. And he didn't strike them because they were black. He struck them because they had beards. And because the one had long curly hair, uh, the case got reversed below. The Supreme Court says, that's acceptable reasons. Uh, the reason need not be persuasive or even plausible. It can even be silly. You're superstitious, uh, as long as it's not based on race.

Speaker 1:          17:12          Now that doesn't mean that the court can't still find discrimination. Uh, at step three of the bats and process step one being the defendant raises the objection and says, your honor, I object. The prosecutor just struck that juror and I believe it's on the basis of race. And I would ask the PR, the judge not to allow that as step one. Step two, the prosecutor says, your honor, I didn't strike that juror based on race. I struck that juror because he had long curly hair and he had a mustache and goatee. Then at the third step, the court considers all of that evidence and decides whether there was intentional racial discrimination. Uh, this case certainly, uh, said that the reasons don't have to be very persuasive. Uh, silly. You're superstitious. But it did say maybe they wouldn't be persuasive at that third step, but that's up to the trial judge.

Speaker 1:          18:03          A court finds that there is no bats in violation here with the strikes of these African Americans. Uh, just as a and briar a dissent, uh, they would find, uh, uh, discrimination in this particular case. So, uh, what's the impact of Batson? Uh, we know that in Philadelphia and not long after Batson came out or prosecutor was conducting a training session and he basically spent most of it telling people how to consider race in making jury strikes, uh, after the supreme court had just said that it violates the equal protection clause to do so. Uh, the Illinois Court of Appeals says, when it gets to the Batson issue in a case, we now come to the charade called Bateson. Uh, surely every prosecutor's office has a manual or a list of Handy Dandy race neutral reasons, uh, that it can, uh, give. And of course we know that's true because in North Carolina, uh, it actually came out in evidence that there was such a handy dandy list of race neutral reasons that were being used, um, and made up before the prosecutor ever saw the jurors, uh, and knew what to object about.

Speaker 1:          19:17          Uh, and then we see these cases out of Louisiana where the Louisiana Supreme Court says that bear statistics alone is not enough to establish a prima facia case, which seems completely contradictory to Batson, which said, disproportionate number of strikes in the defendant's case could be a basis for inferring race discrimination. Uh, but the Louisiana court now in a number of cases, even one where the prosecution used 11 strikes, 10 of them against blacks, nine of them against women. The court says there's no prime aphasia case. There's no need for the prosecutor to even give reasons. A, because no prime aphasia case, uh, has been established. Uh, Louisiana has been a one of many jurisdictions, which is almost never have the appellate courts found a of bats in violation. One case where the prosecutor said he struck someone, uh, because he was a young black male, uh, that case did get reversed, but that was pretty obvious.

Speaker 1:          20:16          Uh, that person had not gotten the a handy dandy list of race neutral reasons and didn't know that you couldn't give ray a racist and explicit reason. But for the most part, uh, state supreme courts to deferring to trial judges and trial judges are very reluctant to reverse or to say that prosecutors are intentionally discriminating and are not telling the truth about it. The practice continues and case after case, uh, but some cases had been reversed and some of them are quite extraordinary. The middle or case out of Texas Thomas Middle [inaudible] who was sentenced to death in Dallas and who had a Swain hearing that is under Swain versus Alabama. He wanted to show that the prosecutors in Dallas in case after case, no matter who the defendant, no matter who the victim, that they had a pattern and practice of striking people of color. Well then the Batson decision came down.

Speaker 1:          21:11          So the court took that evidence as well as the evidence of the strikes and the particular case trial judge in Houston and Dallas, excuse me, the trial judge in Dallas, no problem. No race discrimination, court of criminal appeals, no race discrimination, federal court and the United States Court of Appeals for the fifth circuit. No race discrimination. But the supreme court sees it differently. And look at the facts that had decided on a, the DA's office had a formal policy of striking blacks. It had a manual that said to strike blacks when picking jurors. Uh, it trained had testimony from people who had been in the prosecutor's office at the time. Miller else case was tried that said we were trained to strike blacks. Uh, when we pick the jury. Uh, also it was obvious in the transcript of the jury selection, which went on for some time here that the prosecutor questioned black jurors differently than white jurors.

Speaker 1:          22:11          The prosecution even use some trick questions to try to disqualify black jurors but didn't ask those same questions, uh, of white jurors. Texas has some very unusual practice called the jury shuffle, where the jurors are all, uh, shuffle that is, they're put in a different order to, to sit. Uh, and anytime that blacks would be near the front, the prosecution would call for a jury shuffle and hopes that the blacks would be moved further back. But then what was probably most critical was what justice Souter called a side by side comparisons that the prosecution had excepted whites who had the same characteristics of blacks that the prosecutor had struck. In other words, there's no real difference between these jurors except for their race. Uh, and for that reason, uh, justice Souter a writing for the court finds that even under the deference that the Texas Court of criminal appeals, which had decided this case on direct appeal, even with the deference that was required under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act, that is that in applying Batson it had to be contrary to, or an unreasonable application of the Batson decision.

Speaker 1:          23:29          That there was a constitutional violation here and there was discrimination and the selection of Thomas Miller L's trial and he's entitled to a new trial with a fairly, uh, select a jury. Uh, three justices dissented, justice Thomas, chief justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia. But a lot of people have said that's an extraordinary case because of the manual, the training, the policy, all those things in Dallas. Uh, what about the more typical case, uh, where you don't have that kind of overwhelming evidence? Well, Snyder versus Louisiana was a case that came on direct appeal, uh, not a habeas corpus case, but Snyder was convicted in Jefferson parish, Louisiana where the prosecutor's office had a long history of striking, uh, black people from juries. In fact, a group of ministers in Jefferson parish filed a friend of the court brief with the supreme court that basically said, we're just not a part of the jury system here because we're always excluded.

Speaker 1:          24:30          Uh, because of the prosecution's use of strikes. A Alan Snyder's case was no different. Uh, there were five African Americans that were in the jury pool. Jefferson parish at that time had about 15% African Americans. Uh, it had been represented in the legislature by David Duke, the, uh, the grand wizard of the Klu Klux Klan. I did voted for Duke when he ran for governor in the United States senator. Uh, and so it wasn't a really good place for an African American to be on trial. Uh, and particularly with an all white jury. The case centered around a student named Jeffrey Brooks, who had said that he needed to get back to school for his student teaching. Uh, but then when the dean was called, it was told that it was okay that he could serve on this case. This case only took about three days, day and a half for jury selection day and a half for trial.

Speaker 1:          25:20          And Alan Snyder was on death row. Uh, what, uh, the court found was that while Brooks was struck, while Jeffrey Brooks was struck, the prosecutor had accepted white people, uh, as jurors including one in Ronald laws, uh, who had a far more urgent reason to get back to what they were doing. Laws had to close on two houses that he was selling, one the next weekend and one the weekend after that, his wife was having surgery and he was having to take his children everywhere. If there was anybody who wouldn't want to be on a jury, it would be laws. Uh, and yet he was accepted and served on the jury and Jeffrey Brooks was struck. Uh, so, uh, prosecution use five for five, only one is examined by the Supreme Court. Uh, Jeffrey Brooks, the court says there was intentional race discrimination in striking Brooks, uh, and therefore Snyder, uh, it gets a new trial.

Speaker 1:          26:16          Uh, well, uh, the discrimination continues, uh, in the selection of juries and particularly in the use of peremptory strikes. A trial judges very reluctant to find, uh, intentional race discrimination for political reasons, for relationship reasons and for other reasons. Uh, secondly, procedural rules, uh, you see often courts rejecting that some claims, even though the, uh, defendant's lawyer can point to side by side comparisons like we're made in the Miller l case, here's a black person who was struck and a white person with the same characteristics who was not struck. Uh, and uh, therefore it shows racist combination. A lot of times. Now the courts are saying, well, you didn't say that at the trial at the time you objected. Of course at that time, it's sometimes hard to know the characteristics of all the jurors if there's a large number of people being considered a for jury service, but very strict procedural rules to try to defeat, uh, these, uh, claims, uh, reluctance of state supreme courts.

Speaker 1:          27:26          Again, most states, supreme court's not all, but most are elected. Certainly the ones in the south and the death belt are elected. Uh, and there is reluctance there, uh, to grant relief in any capital case. But certainly based on jury selection, I think many people may think it jury would have convicted no matter what. But we all know that who participates in a jury is critically important for a lot of reasons, both in terms of the quality of the decisions that are made, but others that I'll mention in a moment. The other factor of the clearly erroneous, uh, standard, which means that state supreme courts can often just simply, uh, ignore, uh, or, or can affirm what the trial court has done, uh, saying, well, we may not agree with it, but we don't think it raises to the rises to the level where it was clearly erroneous.

Speaker 1:          28:20          The other thing that we've seen a lot of courts do is accept multiple reasons where in one case, the prosecutors, first reason was he struck a juror because she was a black woman. But then he went on to give some other reasons and the court said, well, the first reason was a race based reason, but the other reasons we're not and therefore it was upheld. So, uh, as a result, the incentive to prosecutors is give as many reasons as you possibly can give four or five six it surely one of them is going to pass muster as a race neutral reason. On the other hand, some, uh, some courts have said the fact that the prosecutor gives the laundry list of reasons may be a indicia of race discrimination right there. So that's still to be sorted out by the Supreme Court. One of the other questions to be sorted out as this Louisiana, uh, Supreme Court decisions that you haven't made out a prime aphasia case just by showing a disparate number of strikes against African Americans or women.

Speaker 1:          29:24          Uh, but for the most part, uh, discrimination, uh, continues. That's an objections are made. They're very seldom sustained. That is usually the prosecution is going to get away with striking, uh, the people of color from the jury. Uh, justice briar has suggested that it may be time to abolish peremptory strikes this, as mentioned from time to time, just as Goldberg pointed out way back in Swain versus Alabama, there's no right to a peremptory strike. And if you've got to choose between racist combination of peremptory strike, you should choose to eliminate race discrimination just as Marshall and his concurring opinion in Bateson said, if we really want to prevent this, Batson is not going to work. What we decided in this case, if we really want to present, prevent race discrimination, we need to eliminate peremptory strikes. Uh, once more, uh, Justice Marshall, uh, I think, uh, got, got it right.

Speaker 1:          30:22          Uh, but beyond that, Batson is a very poor way to deal with what is a practice, a regular practice taking one juror at, at time. And looking at the reason for that juror sort of takes it out of the context of what's going on in case after case. Uh, with prosecutors, a lot of times now the prosecution will leave one African American on the jury, or maybe even too, particularly if in a state where you don't have to have unanimous verdict, uh, but we'll still end up striking a lot of people on the basis of color. Uh, I tell lawyers it's like a lottery, a buy your ticket, make her objection point out the side by side comparisons point out that the black jurors were questioned differently than the white jurors. Uh, all of those things challenged the reasons given because a lot of the reasons and one of the reasons given for striking Jeffrey Brooks and the Snyder case was he was nervous.

Speaker 1:          31:18          Well, the lawyers said, well, everybody's nervous. I mean, you brought all these people down here to decide whether to kill another human being. Uh, everybody's nervous. I'm nervous, we're all nervous. And it was a way of sort of basically saying this, this reason, then the plot applies to everybody. So there's no reason to strike, uh, Jeffrey Brooks, uh, but ultimately the continuing exclusion of people of color, uh, from juries, even in communities that have very substantial African American population, uh, is undermining the credibility and the legitimacy of the courts. One of the things that was stated in Snyder brief was that African Americans in Jefferson parish, Louisiana, and know that they are not going to serve on juries and it undermines their respect for the courts and nothing the white people know it too. And the fact is that when the community is not all involved, when you don't have everybody in the community represented, and when one group is targeted for exclusion, as tragically continues to be the place, the case in many places today, uh, it undermines the quality of decision making by the courts and the legitimacy and credibility of those courts.
