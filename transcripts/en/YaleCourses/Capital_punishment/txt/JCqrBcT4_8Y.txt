Speaker 1:          00:11          Let's spend just a few minutes talking about clemency. Clemency is the power which the president, United States has governors have. And some states, pardon? Pardon? And parole boards have to commute or preve or forgive a, uh, a crime in a particular case. Uh, normally not subject to judicial review. Important. Just to make a couple of distinctions here, pardon, is to forgive a person completely, uh, for the sentence. They're no longer under any judicial, uh, comp, you know, supervision, uh, whatever. They're no longer being punished for their crime. Uh, clemency is reducing the crime. For example, what comes up most often in capital cases is that the governor or the pardon and parole board, whoever has the authority in that particular state, uh, Ken Commute the death sentence to life imprisonment. So the person is still subject to spending life in prison or spending a certain number of years in prison.

Speaker 1:          01:16          Uh, but not the death sentence. Any sentence can always be commuted to a shorter sentence to time served. For example, in a non capital case, a reprieve is when the governor or whoever has the authority just simply temporarily halts and execution perhaps to get more information or to have time, uh, to uh, consider some factors or consult some people, uh, with regard to the decision. And that happens not very often, but from time to time. Now, these are not to in any way be confused with parole. Uh, which means that a person who sends a serving a prison, sins is released on parole. They're still under sends, they can be revoked and brought back, or a person who's on probation, uh, who is just basically allowed to serve their sentence in the community. Uh, but very often at the end of the process, whether it's a person in the federal system who will apply to the president of United States, uh, for clemency or, uh, and one federal death case was commuted by President Bill Clinton.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Uh, Ronald Chandler's Destin's was commuted from death to life imprisonment or more likely in the states. Uh, there'll be an appeal to the governor for a clemency in a case. A historically clemency has been given more often than it is today, although it is given from time to time today. Uh, Edmond Brown, who was the governor of California in the late fifties and early 1960s, actually wrote a book about his experience, uh, in terms of handling clemency request there in California. It's called public justice private mercy. Uh, and he talks about the decisions he made, the considerations that went into them. Uh, he granted 23, uh, and he denied 36, so 36 people were executed. 23 people were granted clemency. That's a much higher rate of granting clemency than we see in any state today. Uh, so far, uh, with the death penalty, we've had, uh, at least at the end of 2020 13, uh, we had had, uh, about 1300 death sentences carried out in the United States and 273 ca mutations.

Speaker 1:          03:39          But several of those commutations are a large number, uh, were accounted for by a, a very, you know, a few governors, uh, modern practices in for Texas for example, uh, there's almost no clemency for, there's no meaningful clemency process. There's a huge board of 18 people that never meets, uh, that denies in virtually every case. The governor doesn't have as much power as most people think. In Texas. The governor cannot commute a death sentence unless the pardon and parole board, uh, recommends the governor can grant reprieves that is temporarily halt an execution. Uh, but the real power is with the board, which is not inclined to commute sentences. Uh, the most, uh, people commuted and certainly at one time, uh, was in Illinois by Governor George Ryan. Uh, Governor Ryan, who had been a supporter of the death pony and voted for it when he was a Republican member of the state legislature, uh, after becoming governor.

Speaker 1:          04:41          And after seeing a number of people exonerated sometimes by journalism students at Northwestern University, uh, begin to have grave concerns about the death penalty in Illinois. Uh, he appointed a commission that looked into it, found that there were a number of problems with the death penalty that a number of people who were innocent, uh, at the time, uh, Anthony Porter was exonerated not long after Governor Ryan took office. There had been 13 people exonerated and only 12 executed. So the percentages weren't very good in terms of Illinois stuff. Polly governor Ryan became convinced that for more people on death row were innocent, he pardoned those people. Uh, and then in 2003, he commuted the entire death row, 167 people, uh, from the death pony, two sentences in prison. So that was one of the, uh, as the largest number of people to leave death row, except for when the Supreme Court decided the case of Furman versus Georgia, which resulted in, uh, in all the states, basically, uh, vacating the death sentences and going to, to life imprisonment on those cases.

Speaker 1:          05:56          Uh, the extent to which the courts could get into this was challenged in, um, uh, Ohio adult parole authority versus Woodard. A case that went to the Supreme Court in 1997 and the argument was how much due process, how much fairness, what procedures is a person entitled to a that's going to have clemency. And it was sort of started by the fact that the board and Ohio was going to interview Woodard and what it was complaining. Uh, first of all, it, it was too short a notice. There wasn't time to prepare, uh, wanted to have a lawyer there, but board wouldn't allow that. Uh, and then it could make a statement to the board, but then there was some concern with that would be used for, although at this point of the process, um, probably, uh, Megan statement to the board is in an effort to convince it is probably something most people would do.

Speaker 1:          06:55          A, at any rate, the Supreme Court of the United States said that there's no substantive expectation of clemency. Clemency is an act of grace by the executive according to the court, uh, is not part of determining guilt or innocence. Uh, it's committed to the authority of the executive. Uh, and there's no fifth amendment right to remain silent. I guess if a person doesn't want to talk to the board, uh, they don't have to. Uh, but on the eve of execution, um, maybe more important to talk to the board then to exercise one's a fifth amendment rights. Uh, justice O'Connor concurring, uh, she said the protections for someone in the clemency process are minimal, but there are some, she said, for example, if a, they just flipped a coin and decided who got clemency or who not based on, uh, how the coin flip came out. Or if some people were just arbitrarily denied any clemency process at all, that might be a due process concern.

Speaker 1:          07:57          Uh, justice Stevens, uh, took the position that there were particular guarantees to a person, uh, facing clemency for a fair process. Uh, he pointed out that appeal, it always surprises people, but there's no right to appeal a, every state provides for an appeal and the federal government provides for appeals. And the Supreme Court has held that when something is a universal practice, such as that you have a right to a lawyer, transcripts, all, all of the necessary, all the things necessary to handle an appeal. He said, why is this any different? Uh, basically the federal government and the states all provide for some clemency process. And so there ought to be some sort of protections, maybe minimal, but some protections, uh, for people, uh, in the process. The bottom line is that this case is pretty much said, uh, this is going to be up to the governor or up to the pardon and parole board and states that have it.

Speaker 1:          08:54          Uh, I should say just a few states, Georgia being one. Uh, the governor has no authority whatsoever. It's decided by a board of pardons and parole. In some other states. The governor has completed 30 and can do whatever he or she wants to, uh, and yet other states, uh, the board, uh, right, makes a recommendation to the governor will often interview the person who's going to be executed or will receive information from both the prosecution and the, the condemned persons lawyers. Uh, make a recommendation to the governor. Uh, some states the governor can either accept or ignore that recommendation. Uh, some states the governors bound by the recommendation if the, if the board doesn't authorize it, uh, then the governor cramp can't grant clemency the most extreme examples, Pennsylvania, which has a five member board, uh, which has to be unanimous before the governor, uh, can, uh, commute a death sentence or a sentence of life without parole.

Speaker 1:          09:57          Uh, this was because, uh, when a mutation was granted of a life sin sometime ago, uh, and the person, uh, three, three to two vote of the board and the person went out and committed other crimes, uh, the Pennsylvania Constitution was amended to say, now the vote has to be unanimous. So very, very, it's going to be very difficult for anybody to have a commutation, uh, in, in the state of Pennsylvania. But it differs from state to state, uh, in terms of who decides and the power. But primarily it's going to be the executive branch is going to be the governor. Uh, in most states, uh, reasons that, uh, governance have granted. We just look at why have some people gotten, uh, out on, or excuse me, had their death sentences commuted, uh, during the last 40 years. Uh, doubts about guilt. It's probably one of the most compelling.

Speaker 1:          10:50          Sometimes the governor will say, Ah, I'm not convinced this person is innocent. Uh, but on the other hand, I have enough doubts about their innocence, uh, that I'm not going to let them be executed. A oral Washington was such a person in Virginia, uh, in his case, uh, the governor of Virginia, Governor Wilder, uh, had enough reservations about his guilt that he commuted his sentence to life imprisonment turned out good thing that he did. Uh, because later DNA evidence proof that Washington was completely innocent and had absolutely nothing to do with the murder at all. Uh, the same thing happened with governor Taft in Ohio and Jerome Campbell's case, uh, this wasn't a case that turned out as clear cut. Is there a Washington's, but it was a case where there just was not a, just not enough certainty, uh, with regard to guilt. And so the governor commuted the sentence of the person's still serving life imprisonment.

Speaker 1:          11:54          Uh, but at least it's not executed. So that if some additional information, and in other cases like this, if some additional information comes to light as it did in rural Washington's case, uh, the person will still be alive and can get back to the rest of their lives. Uh, another is the role of the person, uh, in the crime. Governor, uh, Kernan of Illinois granted that, uh, granted clemency in the case of Darnell Williams, uh, because of that, because of his role in the crime compared to others. Uh, other factors, sometimes his mental illness and the person's a role in the crime. Uh, Michael Daniels, again, same governor, uh, of Indiana granted a clemency in that case, committed to case to life in prison. Uh, in that case, the victim's son was supporting a commutation of the sentence, which probably, uh, certainly contributed to the governor, uh, making a decision about it.

Speaker 1:          12:53          Uh, the Georgia, uh, board of pardon and parole, uh, commuted the Destin's right when he was about to be executed of Alexander Williams. Uh, this was a man who was tremendous, incredibly mentally ill, uh, was forcibly medicated by the prison in order to keep him manageable. Uh, he was a juvenile at the time of his crime. This was when it was still possible to execute people who are juveniles at the time of their crime. Um, the, uh, just to show how disturbed, uh, uh, Alexander Williams was a, after the board commuted his sentence and he went to service life since just a very short time after that, he committed suicide and ended his life that way. Uh, another reason is that some people just ultimately the board finds a, these people are, uh, not appropriate for the death pony, uh, for reasons that may not have been presented to the jury, but are now known.

Speaker 1:          13:54          One of those was a Willie James Hall, uh, in Georgia. Uh, he had no prior record. He had good to conduct in prison and even had a, one of the things that is most unusual, the prosecutor said that life imprisonment without parole would be okay with him. So after Georgia had convicted this man since him to death, gone through the appellate process, gone through all the review process, um, the board commutes, the sentenced to life imprisonment and hall is serving life in prison instead of having been executed. Uh, another example is gale Owens in Tennessee. Uh, her case became quite the cause there. Uh, at one point she was a battered spouse, uh, who was, uh, sentenced to death. One of the, uh, she hired somebody to kill her husband. Uh, and one thing that happened in her case is they offered a plea, which would have spared her the death pony.

Speaker 1:          14:49          She wanted to take the plea, but the prosecution said, well, only if the codefendant, only if the, the hitman would take it. Uh, and he would not take it. Uh, so she was sort of drug into a capital trial against her will and was sentenced to death. You know, she was a model inmate while on death row. And the governor looked at her case and then looked at a lot of other cases where people in similar situations, particularly battered women who had killed their spouses, uh, and concluded that the death pony was, was out of line for her. And ultimately a commuted her sentence, not very long after her sentence was commuted, she was paroled, uh, and return to the community. So one day she's facing execution and not that long afterwards, CCI, she is actually out in the community. Uh, and then life circumstances, uh, mitigating evidence that maybe it wasn't presented at trial.

Speaker 1:          15:48          I mean, two cases of this or, uh, Joseph Murphy in Ohio, uh, who was beaten and starved and sexually abused. And all of these things that happen to him, uh, resulted in ultimately the governor, uh, granting, uh, or commuting his case, granting clemency in his case so that he wasn't executed by Ohio. Uh, in Delaware. Uh, same reason basically for, uh, Robert Gaddis death penalty being a commuted, uh, just the most horrific sexual abuse, uh, imaginable visited upon Gaddis when he was a child. There was some question about the reliability of this because it hadn't had come out earlier. Uh, the pardon and parole board and making their recommendation to the governor said, even if half this information is true, uh, this man shouldn't be executed. Uh, and that recommendation was, uh, accepted by the governor. Uh, and, uh, his sentence was commuted to life in prison.

Speaker 1:          16:56          It's just a couple of other observations that I would make about the clemency process. Uh, first of all, in most states, uh, it's very unpredictable and it's very political. If the number, if a number of executions have been carried out, then the governor may feel like a case can be commuted, uh, because he's already shown how tough he is by executing other people. On the other hand, if it's been a long time since any [inaudible] anybody's been executed, uh, governor may be very reluctant to commute a sins no matter how compelling the case, uh, because it might create an uproar. Uh, so where people are in the queue to be executed can be very important. Once the governor's granted a commutation, in one case, very unlikely that, that, that the governor's going to grant a Comutation in the next case. Uh, so, uh, those kind of political factors, I mean, Edmond Brown in his book, uh, about, uh, computations that he granted as governor and talked about in one, he didn't do it because he didn't want to alienate, uh, a legislator who's vote he needed, uh, for a program that he was supporting.

Speaker 1:          18:12          Uh, the other thing is that in places that have part in parole boards or where information has just submitted to the governor in some places where there is no board to make a recommendation to the governor, uh, the information is just provided, uh, to the governor's lawyer, the governor's legal counsel. Uh, but regardless of whether it's provided to a board or the council, at least in my experience, most of the time, uh, it's sort of a star chamber proceeding. Uh, the person who's condemned can submit any information and letters and all kinds of supporting information saying, here's why I'm entitled to parole. On the other hand, people who po kind mutation on the other hand, uh, people who oppose commutation can submit all sorts of letters and uh, and can say all sorts of things about the person accused the person of crimes. Maybe they didn't commit, but that information is not shared with a condemned person.

Speaker 1:          19:16          So you don't know what the board or what the governor is considering or the governors advisors, uh, are considering. Uh, and it may very well be that there's information in there that's false, that's not right, but there's no opportunity to rebut it, uh, because you don't know what it is. Uh, so very different from a court process where there's notice of what the information is. There's an opportunity to cross examine. There's an opportunity to rebut the evidence. Uh, none of that in most states. Uh, in the clemency process, it's a very sort of closed process. It's often a very informal process, uh, in terms of how, uh, the governor exercises a clemency, but it's a critically important process. The Supreme Court said in Herrera Versus Collins, uh, the case in which it said there no such thing as a free standing claim of innocence. Uh, the court said this is what a commutation powers for, uh, that, uh, if a person has a claim of innocence, uh, they can present it.

Speaker 1:          20:21          But of course there's no guarantee, uh, that the governor is going to be receptive to that claim. But as we've seen, there may be other things that governors are receptive to. Uh, it may differ from governor to governor and one state has the governor who's more compassionate and grants a clemency and cases the next governor, it's not going to do that. Maybe the next governor is a career prosecutor. He doesn't want to grant clemency any cases. So there are a lot of political factories and other facts and other vagaries that sorta go into this process of whether or not someone receives clemency or not. Uh, generally this is the last decision that's made before someone's put to death. Uh, this was a decision that Bill Clinton made in the case of Ricky ray rector a, that when he decided to deny clemency for rector, which of course was he was politically compelled to do because he was on the ballot and the New Hampshire primary, uh, that sealed the fate of Reiki rector. And as a result, he was put to death in that case. And generally that's the clemency decision is going to seal the fate of most people facing the death Polly, how that comes up.

Speaker 2:          21:48          Okay.
