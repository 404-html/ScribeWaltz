1
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.360
The court next takes up the question of whether the death penalty is appropriate

2
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:17.790
for certain people who commit crimes.

3
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.750
Uh,

4
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.470
in,

5
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.890
uh,

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.910
the Henry Case,

7
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:21.744
the court,

8
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.051
uh,

9
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:23.040
and the Atkins case,

10
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:26.040
the court looks at whether the death pony is constitutionally,

11
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.840
uh,

12
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.190
appropriate for a person whose intellectual,

13
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.930
intellectually disabled.

14
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.561
Uh,

15
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:33.240
at the time these cases were decided.

16
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:35.640
This was generally referred to as mental retardation.

17
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:38.880
And that's the language that's in the court's opinion.

18
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.040
And that's the language mental retardation,

19
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.431
uh,

20
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:43.650
that we see in many of the statutes.

21
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.783
Uh,

22
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.481
this,

23
00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:46.300
uh,

24
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.500
uh,

25
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.040
when we talk about intellectual disability or a mental retardation,

26
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.551
uh,

27
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:55.320
we're talking about a person who has substantially sub average intellectual

28
00:00:55.321 --> 00:01:00.321
functioning that is somebody who tests low on an intelligent quotient test,

29
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:02.010
usually 70,

30
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.851
75,

31
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:04.170
somewhere in that neighborhood or,

32
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:05.004
or below,

33
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.820
um,

34
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.900
that the person,

35
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.890
uh,

36
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.890
has that in deficits in two or more areas of adaptive behavior that is in terms

37
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:16.830
of the person doing the day to day things that all people do,

38
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.381
uh,

39
00:01:17.381 --> 00:01:18.330
in their lives,

40
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.761
uh,

41
00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:20.940
that they have deficits in handling things,

42
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:21.930
making change,

43
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.501
uh,

44
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:23.130
other,

45
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.060
other things like that.

46
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.290
And finally that it was manifested before the age of 18.

47
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:33.060
This appears in the Atkins case at converses for genuine footnote number three,

48
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.080
where the court gives the definition of both the American psychiatric

49
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:40.680
association as well as the American psychological association.

50
00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:42.840
There slight differences in the language,

51
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:45.300
but basically this is the description,

52
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.921
uh,

53
00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:46.650
of,

54
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.130
uh,

55
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.440
mental retardation or intellectual disability,

56
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.100
uh,

57
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.300
that the court uses.

58
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.290
Uh,

59
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.600
now this is interesting in terms of how,

60
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.650
uh,

61
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.950
the consensus as the court finds it develops.

62
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.060
1987,

63
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.130
not a single state,

64
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.270
prohibited the death penalty for the intellectually disabled.

65
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.260
Uh,

66
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.610
by 1989,

67
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.683
two states,

68
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.190
Georgia,

69
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.930
which was the first state to prohibited and Maryland and the United States,

70
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:20.931
which had adopted the death penalty in 1988 had excluded mental retarded people

71
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:24.180
from those eligible for the death pony.

72
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.430
Then we'd come in at 2002,

73
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.710
which is when the Atkins case is decided.

74
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.490
Now,

75
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.490
18 states have held that the death penalty is not appropriate for intellectually

76
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:36.300
disabled people.

77
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.970
And the court looks at those 18 states,

78
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.350
and this is the difference between the majority of the court and the descending

79
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:44.010
opinion.

80
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.250
It also adds in the 12 states that don't have the death pony.

81
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.260
So it reaches a,

82
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:49.711
and of course,

83
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.720
the United States government's still doesn't have it.

84
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.390
Uh,

85
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.130
so the majority adds this up and says this is 30 states.

86
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.620
Notice this is not nearly as overwhelming as in coker.

87
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.300
We had 49 states.

88
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.230
Uh,

89
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.540
only one state had it in 49 states didn't,

90
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.730
or Kennedy versus Louisiana where a handful of states had it in 44 states.

91
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.030
Uh,

92
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.863
did not,

93
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.261
uh,

94
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:12.094
here,

95
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.521
uh,

96
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:13.130
we reached,

97
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.340
uh,

98
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.000
the court reaches a total of 30 states.

99
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.600
Uh,

100
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.680
but that's counting,

101
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.370
uh,

102
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.130
the 12 states that don't have the death penalty at all.

103
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.770
Uh,

104
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.930
the dissenters argue that the states without the death penalty should not be

105
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:26.764
counted.

106
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.060
A,

107
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.950
the courts should only look at the states that have the death penalty.

108
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.580
Uh,

109
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.780
and based on that,

110
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.381
uh,

111
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:33.214
the,

112
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.820
this is not constitutionally prohibited.

113
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.320
The question here,

114
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.980
just whether the death penalty is categorically barred for someone who meets the

115
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:46.804
definition,

116
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.400
uh,

117
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.940
of intellectual disability,

118
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.260
um,

119
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.250
that Supreme Court,

120
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.700
uh,

121
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.220
talks here as it will be talking about in other situations.

122
00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:58.054
As with children.

123
00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.720
Uh,

124
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.910
how do we minimize the risk?

125
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.040
Once we sort of survey the states?

126
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.310
We see 30 to 20 according to the majority,

127
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:11.050
and the majority also points out that in the 20 that that allow imposition of

128
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:11.830
the death pony.

129
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.830
It's very infrequently imposed upon people who are intellectually disabled.

130
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.860
Uh,

131
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.770
and then it sees factors that,

132
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.610
uh,

133
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.110
run the possibility or the risk that a person who is intellectually disabled

134
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.850
might be sentenced to death,

135
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.540
uh,

136
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.470
inappropriately,

137
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.071
uh,

138
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:30.750
that,

139
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.180
uh,

140
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.210
such people are less able to assist their lawyers,

141
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.901
uh,

142
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:36.730
and preparing and working on their case,

143
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.360
uh,

144
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.000
there,

145
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.290
uh,

146
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.580
less able to,

147
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.540
uh,

148
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.360
put on mitigating circumstances because again,

149
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:44.710
they may not have the intellectual,

150
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.640
uh,

151
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.030
capabilities of working with their lawyer and developing the evidence as a,

152
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:49.864
as a person,

153
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.680
uh,

154
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.901
who,

155
00:04:50.901 --> 00:04:53.770
who was not intellectually disabled would be able to,

156
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.550
uh,

157
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.440
they're less able to testify.

158
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.040
Uh,

159
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.100
the court says they are typically very poor witnesses.

160
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.353
Uh,

161
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.000
threat of false confessions.

162
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.630
Uh,

163
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.760
the court looks to the Earl Washington case.

164
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:11.710
This is a fellow with a very low Iq or a Washington who confessed to a number of

165
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:14.050
crimes and was convicted and sentenced to death,

166
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.400
almost executed.

167
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.971
Uh,

168
00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:20.050
but then governor wilder and Virginia commuted his sentence to life in prison.

169
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.250
And then sometime after that with the developments in DNA testing,

170
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.881
uh,

171
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:27.760
it was shown that Earl Washington was absolutely innocent,

172
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.340
had absolutely nothing to do with the case,

173
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.800
even though he had confessed to doing it,

174
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.990
but he was intellectually disabled,

175
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:40.120
very susceptible to suggestion and very willing to go along with authority

176
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:42.520
figures in saying that he had done something,

177
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.881
uh,

178
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:45.070
even though he had not in the court notes that,

179
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.611
uh,

180
00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:46.444
in a footnote,

181
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.570
the court also talks about the unwarranted,

182
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.111
uh,

183
00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:50.944
impression,

184
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.461
uh,

185
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:51.971
that,

186
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:52.120
uh,

187
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.910
the jury may have that a person lacks remorse,

188
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.990
uh,

189
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.400
if they're a intellectually disabled.

190
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.720
And this may be because,

191
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.500
uh,

192
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.390
the person just simply doesn't have the intellectual capability of following the

193
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:07.490
complex proceedings in the court.

194
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.990
And so sits there,

195
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.590
uh,

196
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.590
looking sort of cold and unfeeling when in fact they're just not able to process

197
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:18.020
the information that's coming into their mind.

198
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:18.531
At the time.

199
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:19.580
This is going on.

200
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.421
Uh,

201
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:25.421
so the court decides that the death penalty is unconstitutional for people who

202
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:27.590
are intellectually disabled.

203
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.590
Uh,

204
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.880
then the court has over time,

205
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.600
uh,

206
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.210
looked at the question of the death pony for children,

207
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.991
uh,

208
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:38.690
in 1988 and Thompson versus Oklahoma.

209
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.261
Uh,

210
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:43.160
the Supreme Court does divided four votes one way,

211
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:43.701
four votes.

212
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:48.620
The other justice O'Connor making the critical decision that at least Oklahoma

213
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:50.600
could not put 15 year old,

214
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.650
uh,

215
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:52.460
children.

216
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.470
And we're talking about when the crime was committed.

217
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.590
That is a child who committed a crime at age 15,

218
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.080
not eligible for the death poem,

219
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.090
but then the court and Stanford,

220
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.540
uh,

221
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.700
versus Kentucky in 1989,

222
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.391
uh,

223
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:07.250
upheld the death penalty,

224
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:07.820
uh,

225
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.350
for children who were 16 and 17 years of age.

226
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.700
And that was the law for some time and a number of children that age or who

227
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:19.500
committed their crimes when they were that age were sentenced to death and,

228
00:07:19.501 --> 00:07:20.810
and a number were executed.

229
00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:21.650
Uh,

230
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.840
despite the Stanford case,

231
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.440
the Missouri Supreme Court decides in the Semans case,

232
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:28.161
uh,

233
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:31.340
that the death penalty is unconstitutional for those under 18.

234
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:32.270
At the time of the crime.

235
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.160
So how can the court do that?

236
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:34.881
Uh,

237
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:39.680
the Missouri Supreme Court goes out on a limb just a bit saying that based on

238
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.543
Atkins,

239
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.180
we think if the supreme court were to reconsider this decision,

240
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:44.811
uh,

241
00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:47.650
it would overrule Stanford and it would prohibit a,

242
00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:52.400
the death penalty for people under who commit crimes when they're under 18 years

243
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:53.234
of age.

244
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:53.691
Well,

245
00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:53.880
the,

246
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.430
the Missouri Supreme Court,

247
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.150
uh,

248
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.920
certainly forced the court's hand,

249
00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:58.501
uh,

250
00:07:58.501 --> 00:08:02.540
to make a decision about whether it was going to overrule it's previous decision

251
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:03.350
or not.

252
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.800
Uh,

253
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.970
but ultimately,

254
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:05.451
uh,

255
00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:07.880
the court does affirm in the Simmons case,

256
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:09.080
Roper Versus Simmons,

257
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.651
uh,

258
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:14.180
and decides that the death pony is unconstitutional for anyone who commits a

259
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:17.270
crime when they're under 18 years of age.

260
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.490
Uh,

261
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.540
just as in a Atkins,

262
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:22.190
that's the mental retardation case.

263
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.930
18 states prohibited the death pony for people under 18 at the time of the

264
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:27.764
crime.

265
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.580
Uh,

266
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.240
12 states of course don't have the death pony at all.

267
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:32.931
Uh,

268
00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:35.540
and then you have 20 states that authorize the death pony.

269
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:36.890
But as the court points out,

270
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.000
the use of the death penalty in those states is infrequent.

271
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.940
And it points out that in particular,

272
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:44.450
uh,

273
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:45.980
the governor of Kentucky,

274
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.640
uh,

275
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.473
committed,

276
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:47.871
uh,

277
00:08:47.871 --> 00:08:48.950
Kevin Stanford,

278
00:08:48.951 --> 00:08:49.181
the,

279
00:08:49.181 --> 00:08:49.411
the,

280
00:08:49.411 --> 00:08:53.930
the person who was the named party in Stanford,

281
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.530
uh,

282
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.980
versus the court,

283
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:56.820
uh,

284
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.520
notes that the governor of Kentucky commutes a sentence and it says,

285
00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:03.150
we're not going to execute someone who was a child at the time the crime was

286
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:03.930
committed.

287
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.630
So it finds that the use is infrequent,

288
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.430
even in the states that have it.

289
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:09.331
Uh,

290
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:10.140
and this,

291
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.910
the court says is sufficient evidence that society views juveniles as

292
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:19.830
categorically less culpable than the average person.

293
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:20.851
In other words,

294
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:23.520
that someone who commits a crime under the age of 18,

295
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.960
while guilty of murder,

296
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.530
while certainly can be prosecuted as an adult,

297
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.490
can be punished severely even sentenced to life imprisonment without any

298
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:33.660
possibility of parole,

299
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.930
but that that person cannot be sentenced to death.

300
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.080
Part of it is looking at the states again,

301
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.550
30 to 20,

302
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.970
not nearly the almost unanimity opinion that we saw,

303
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:45.840
a unanimity of,

304
00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:46.160
uh,

305
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:46.860
uh,

306
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.020
views that we saw in the coker case.

307
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:49.950
Uh,

308
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.630
but the same exactly,

309
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.111
uh,

310
00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:54.150
that we saw in the Atkins case.

311
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.110
Uh,

312
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.943
but then,

313
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:56.150
uh,

314
00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:00.900
of course took a lot of evidence in this case on and got briefs from experts on

315
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:05.760
the development of brains and young people and adolescents and people growing

316
00:10:05.761 --> 00:10:06.570
up,

317
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:06.871
uh,

318
00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:07.591
and found,

319
00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:09.870
as most parents would probably know already,

320
00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.380
uh,

321
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.213
that the,

322
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.120
uh,

323
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.460
brain development of someone who's 16,

324
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:15.001
17,

325
00:10:15.001 --> 00:10:16.260
18 years of age,

326
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:16.770
uh,

327
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:17.603
has not,

328
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.030
uh,

329
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.250
or the brain of that person is not fully developed.

330
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:20.971
Uh,

331
00:10:20.971 --> 00:10:21.990
and that at that point,

332
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:25.380
people do not have as good a ability to make decisions,

333
00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:27.690
to make good judgments and so forth.

334
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:28.560
Uh,

335
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.940
so the court looks at,

336
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:30.631
uh,

337
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:35.631
at this factor and compare sort of the intellectually disabled and the children,

338
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:37.430
uh,

339
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:41.250
both having an under underdeveloped sense of responsibility.

340
00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:42.120
The court says,

341
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:42.961
uh,

342
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:44.280
in addition to that,

343
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.270
uh,

344
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:49.260
both are vulnerable as we talked about just a moment ago with regard to the

345
00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:50.370
intellectually disabled.

346
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.940
Uh,

347
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.590
both are vulnerable to negative influences and outside pressures that as they

348
00:10:55.591 --> 00:10:58.710
can be led into doing things that they normally wouldn't do,

349
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.340
but because they're immature or because they're intellectually limited,

350
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:02.790
uh,

351
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.430
they might get caught up in something,

352
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.520
uh,

353
00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:06.930
uh,

354
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.730
they do not make good decisions,

355
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.391
uh,

356
00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:11.190
due to their intellectual limitations.

357
00:11:11.191 --> 00:11:12.990
Or as I talked to him about a moment ago,

358
00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:14.220
the lack of development,

359
00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:14.790
the lack of,

360
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:15.061
uh,

361
00:11:15.061 --> 00:11:17.760
of their brain or what we would call it maturity,

362
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:18.840
uh,

363
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.240
they have less control over their environment.

364
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.050
Uh,

365
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.140
children really don't have much choice whether they live,

366
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:25.681
uh,

367
00:11:25.681 --> 00:11:28.800
have the good fortune to be born into a wealthy,

368
00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:33.600
loving a home or whether they happen to grow up in a domestic war zone,

369
00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.110
uh,

370
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.060
where everyone is an abject poverty and where there's a,

371
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.620
a lot of violence and killing and gang activity and so forth.

372
00:11:40.621 --> 00:11:41.370
So,

373
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.000
uh,

374
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.620
that is a factor that,

375
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:44.270
uh,

376
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:49.270
the court finds militates in favor of prohibiting the death penalty for four

377
00:11:50.191 --> 00:11:51.024
children.

378
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.570
Uh,

379
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.200
and finally the court says the juvenile a character is not well formed and

380
00:11:56.201 --> 00:11:57.034
therefore,

381
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:57.610
uh,

382
00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:58.600
because of that,

383
00:11:58.810 --> 00:11:59.200
uh,

384
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.400
children are less couple,

385
00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:01.120
but again,

386
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.760
not saying they can't be convicted of murder,

387
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.270
but just saying in terms of whether we impose the ultimate punishment,

388
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.583
uh,

389
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.310
again,

390
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:10.180
as an Atkins,

391
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.980
we're concerned about,

392
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:12.970
uh,

393
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:13.803
risk.

394
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:14.770
Uh,

395
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.300
the court says here,

396
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:21.010
the difference between juveniles and adult offenders are so marked and well

397
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:25.690
understood that we can't risk allowing a youthful person to receive the death

398
00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:28.570
penalty even though that person's not sufficiently.

399
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:29.710
A couple of them.

400
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.030
Uh,

401
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:35.710
and the court points out that it's difficult even for an expert in child

402
00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:36.290
behavior,

403
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:37.123
a psychologist,

404
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:37.721
uh,

405
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:40.090
to differentiate between the immature,

406
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:40.930
uh,

407
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.100
child and the,

408
00:12:42.101 --> 00:12:45.730
what he calls the irreparably corrupt child.

409
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:46.511
Uh,

410
00:12:46.511 --> 00:12:47.350
and finally,

411
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:53.130
an unacceptable likelihood exists that the brutality of the crime will overpower

412
00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:55.810
the mitigating circumstances.

413
00:12:55.811 --> 00:12:56.620
This is a,

414
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.370
uh,

415
00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:02.320
questionable in controversial a reason a given in the case because of course,

416
00:13:02.321 --> 00:13:07.120
this is true in almost every death penalty case that the horrific nature of the

417
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:07.954
crime,

418
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.320
uh,

419
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.670
may be,

420
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.120
uh,

421
00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.870
more overpowering than whatever evidence in mitigation is submitted.

422
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.650
Uh,

423
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.410
but in cases where a person is young,

424
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.030
they don't have as much of a life and background as somebody who is older.

425
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:22.760
Uh,

426
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.230
and perhaps that's what justice Kennedy was thinking about here.

427
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:27.340
Uh,

428
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.620
then he looks at the purpose of punishment,

429
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:31.270
a retribution.

430
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:32.463
Uh,

431
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.010
the death penalty is our most severe punishment.

432
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.600
And the question is,

433
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:42.070
do we impose it on someone who's blame worthiness is diminished,

434
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.600
still blame worthy,

435
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.720
but diminished blame worthiness due to their youth and then to Terrance,

436
00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:49.690
uh,

437
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:51.070
is deterrent served.

438
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:55.660
And the court finds that because children don't have the same ability to process

439
00:13:55.661 --> 00:13:56.411
information,

440
00:13:56.411 --> 00:13:57.760
to learn from their mistakes,

441
00:13:57.761 --> 00:13:58.630
to consider,

442
00:13:59.020 --> 00:13:59.560
uh,

443
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.590
to make good judgments and considered the wisdom of what they're doing.

444
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:03.011
Uh,

445
00:14:03.011 --> 00:14:04.000
unlike adults,

446
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:04.571
uh,

447
00:14:04.571 --> 00:14:09.571
that the purpose of punishment is not being served by allowing people who commit

448
00:14:10.361 --> 00:14:13.630
crimes under the age of 18 to be sentenced to death.

449
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:14.890
Uh,

450
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:16.150
justice O'Connor,

451
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:16.811
uh,

452
00:14:16.811 --> 00:14:18.610
would ask a very different question here.

453
00:14:18.611 --> 00:14:19.361
And it's interesting,

454
00:14:19.361 --> 00:14:24.361
she was voted for banning the death pony for people who are intellectually

455
00:14:24.761 --> 00:14:25.480
disabled,

456
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.450
but she dissents from this decision in her view.

457
00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.320
The question here is whether by virtue of youth alone,

458
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:37.950
the defendant in [inaudible] lacks the cognitive vocation of volitional and

459
00:14:38.081 --> 00:14:43.081
moral capacity to act with a degree of culpability that we associate with the

460
00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:44.344
death penalty.

461
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:44.740
Uh,

462
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.431
in other words,

463
00:14:45.431 --> 00:14:46.264
she would,

464
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:46.780
uh,

465
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.690
treat each person individually.

466
00:14:49.691 --> 00:14:51.540
She said there can be a 17 old,

467
00:14:51.541 --> 00:14:54.620
but when you look at the background and life of that person,

468
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:58.820
that person is sufficiently culpable that we should give them the death pony.

469
00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:04.230
We may have an 18 year old who is immature and perhaps not appropriate for the

470
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:05.331
death penalty,

471
00:15:05.331 --> 00:15:07.880
but she would sort it out person by person.

472
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:08.760
Uh,

473
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.620
because she says,

474
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:12.260
youth alone does not always mean.

475
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:12.891
Now,

476
00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:14.810
the majority responds to this by saying,

477
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.260
we,

478
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:15.480
we,

479
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:15.771
we,

480
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:16.910
we can see this point,

481
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.320
but we're worried about the risk.

482
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.970
We're worried about the risk of somebody who's culpability is not as great as

483
00:15:22.971 --> 00:15:23.900
other offenders.

484
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:24.381
Uh,

485
00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:25.400
receiving the death.

486
00:15:25.401 --> 00:15:26.234
Pollock,

487
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:26.511
uh,

488
00:15:26.511 --> 00:15:28.310
O'connor writes only for herself,

489
00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:28.830
uh,

490
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:29.663
in her dissent.

491
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.823
Uh,

492
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.810
Justice Scalia on the other hands joined by the chief justice and Justice

493
00:15:35.811 --> 00:15:36.644
Thomas.

494
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:37.400
Uh,

495
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.450
he says that,

496
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.380
first of all,

497
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.540
we shouldn't count the states without the death pony.

498
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.920
This is the point he'd made earlier.

499
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:43.820
And Atkinson.

500
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.211
He makes,

501
00:15:44.211 --> 00:15:44.720
again,

502
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.710
we should only look at the states that have the death plan on the books and see

503
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:53.780
how many would allow the death pony for those under 18 at the time of the crime

504
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.070
and how many do not.

505
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:55.850
Uh,

506
00:15:55.850 --> 00:16:00.850
he accuses the majority of bringing their personal views into the analysis,

507
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.103
uh,

508
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.770
which of course would probably not be agreed to by,

509
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.220
by the majority of the court.

510
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.970
Uh,

511
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:12.970
but then he also criticizes the studies that are cited in the majority opinion.

512
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:14.151
He points out,

513
00:16:14.151 --> 00:16:18.680
there was no evidentiary hearing in Roper on this question where this was

514
00:16:18.681 --> 00:16:21.020
subject to any kind of adversarial testing.

515
00:16:21.021 --> 00:16:25.010
That is where doctors testified and we're cross-examined and doctors on both

516
00:16:25.011 --> 00:16:26.180
sides testified.

517
00:16:26.181 --> 00:16:28.250
And the court made some finding,

518
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:28.730
uh,

519
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:33.730
with regard to the development of the brains of children and the other issues

520
00:16:33.981 --> 00:16:35.030
that were before the court.

521
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.700
He accuses the court of looking out over the crowd,

522
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:38.301
uh,

523
00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:40.310
and picking out it's friends and other words,

524
00:16:40.311 --> 00:16:44.780
making very selective use of evidence to reach the conclusion,

525
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.180
uh,

526
00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.390
that the death pony is not appropriate.

527
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:48.170
Uh,

528
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.010
he also,

529
00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.083
um,

530
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:50.540
uh,

531
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:55.540
looks and tries to discredit the American psychological association,

532
00:16:56.751 --> 00:16:59.000
which has filed a brief where the courts saying,

533
00:16:59.200 --> 00:16:59.791
uh,

534
00:16:59.791 --> 00:17:00.351
that,

535
00:17:00.351 --> 00:17:01.040
uh,

536
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:01.873
children,

537
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:02.300
uh,

538
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.080
who are 17,

539
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:03.651
17,

540
00:17:03.651 --> 00:17:04.161
and 16,

541
00:17:04.161 --> 00:17:06.700
at the time of the crime are immature,

542
00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:07.250
uh,

543
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.710
don't make good judgments and so forth.

544
00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:13.610
He points out that that same association filed a brief where the court that said

545
00:17:13.611 --> 00:17:18.380
at age 14 and 15 children could make a decision about having an abortion.

546
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:19.430
Uh,

547
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:20.810
he also points out that,

548
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:21.250
uh,

549
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.650
article 37 of the convention of the rights of a child,

550
00:17:24.651 --> 00:17:26.150
which is decided by the majority,

551
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.780
uh,

552
00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.170
it does prohibit the death plenty for this class of people.

553
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.930
But the United States in Somalia,

554
00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:33.980
the only two states,

555
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:34.551
uh,

556
00:17:34.551 --> 00:17:36.650
only two countries in the world have not ratified it.

557
00:17:36.651 --> 00:17:36.951
So he said,

558
00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:41.951
how could this possibly be the consensus of the United States or even relevant

559
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.440
to the views of people in the United States,

560
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:46.101
uh,

561
00:17:46.101 --> 00:17:50.130
when it hasn't even been ratified by the Senate?

562
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:50.970
Uh,

563
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.960
he believes very strongly that the laws of other countries,

564
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:55.440
uh,

565
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.600
should not be considered a,

566
00:17:57.601 --> 00:18:02.010
and he accused as the court of citing the laws and other countries selectively

567
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.230
when it makes those decisions.

568
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.000
What the majority had done has made its analysis of the states,

569
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.680
how many allowed the death penalty for this group of children and how many did

570
00:18:13.681 --> 00:18:14.460
not,

571
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:14.701
uh,

572
00:18:14.701 --> 00:18:16.530
it and then looked at the risk,

573
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:17.161
uh,

574
00:18:17.161 --> 00:18:17.551
of,

575
00:18:17.551 --> 00:18:18.384
uh,

576
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.230
the death plenty being imposed despite diminished culpability.

577
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.530
Only after that the court had said,

578
00:18:25.531 --> 00:18:30.420
and our opinion is confirmed by the fact that other countries in the world,

579
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:30.900
uh,

580
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.720
do not,

581
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.760
uh,

582
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:34.043
allowed us,

583
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:34.620
uh,

584
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.930
but it didn't really say it based its decision on.

585
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.710
And it just simply pointed to the fact that other countries didn't allow it.

586
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.300
But this is a controversial point.

587
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.950
It's a point that comes up and,

588
00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.083
um,

589
00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:45.660
uh,

590
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.660
confirmation hearings when people are nominated to the supreme court.

591
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.860
Will you follow international law or will you only followed domestic law?

592
00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:55.410
Only follow the law of the United States.

593
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:55.861
Uh,

594
00:18:55.861 --> 00:19:00.861
but as the world becomes a more globalized and as we all intend to interact with

595
00:19:01.231 --> 00:19:02.520
other countries and so forth,

596
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.071
uh,

597
00:19:03.071 --> 00:19:04.530
that may be a,

598
00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.600
that view at least can be questioned,

599
00:19:06.601 --> 00:19:10.050
is somewhat a provincial that we might look to other places,

600
00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:10.680
uh,

601
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.200
and find out what they've done and learn from that.

602
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.071
Well,

603
00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:17.010
there were two important decisions that flowed from,

604
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.530
uh,

605
00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:20.310
this decision by the Supreme Court.

606
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.920
Uh,

607
00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.440
the first one was Graham versus Florida.

608
00:19:22.441 --> 00:19:23.760
This is not a death penalty case,

609
00:19:23.761 --> 00:19:27.270
but this is a child in Florida had a number of these children who were sentenced

610
00:19:27.271 --> 00:19:30.450
to life imprisonment without any possibility of parole,

611
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.320
uh,

612
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.780
that committed crimes where no one was killed.

613
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.560
Uh,

614
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.100
Joe Sullivan case that was argued with the gram case,

615
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.000
uh,

616
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.920
where in a one day trial,

617
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:46.250
a 13 year old child is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment without any

618
00:19:46.531 --> 00:19:47.490
possibility of parole,

619
00:19:47.491 --> 00:19:50.190
no matter how well that child does in prison,

620
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:50.560
uh,

621
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.540
or as an adult,

622
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.340
that person does in prison,

623
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.180
uh,

624
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.040
no consideration whatsoever.

625
00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:59.600
The Supreme Court says this is disproportionate and,

626
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:00.990
and excessive,

627
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:01.770
uh,

628
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.060
for a child.

629
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.490
And it looks basically at its death penalty,

630
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:06.270
uh,

631
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.103
decisions.

632
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:12.000
And it looks particularly at what had decided in roper about the development of

633
00:20:12.001 --> 00:20:13.260
the brains of children,

634
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.400
about children's in maturity,

635
00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:15.810
uh,

636
00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:18.660
their ability to make decision and it decides that,

637
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:19.530
uh,

638
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.890
this is too excessive or two severe punishment,

639
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:23.550
uh,

640
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:23.910
for,

641
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:24.420
for,

642
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.290
for those children.

643
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:26.101
Uh,

644
00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:28.740
and then the court decides Miller versus Alabama.

645
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.761
Uh,

646
00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:31.800
this is decided in 2012,

647
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:32.551
uh,

648
00:20:32.551 --> 00:20:34.410
and this involved again,

649
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.500
life imprisonment without any possibility of parole,

650
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.120
but for homicide cases,

651
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.100
the fault the court finds,

652
00:20:41.101 --> 00:20:46.101
the challenge Miller made and the other person who were two cases here,

653
00:20:46.831 --> 00:20:49.210
one out of Arkansas and one out of a Alabama.

654
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.240
And the challenge was that in these cases,

655
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:56.020
life without the possibility of parole was automatic.

656
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.890
That once a person was convicted of this crime,

657
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.600
once someone under 17 or younger was convicted of this crime,

658
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.760
the judge had no discretion,

659
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.160
but the death plenty was mandatory.

660
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.710
The court says you can't do that.

661
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.190
It has to be individualized sentencing.

662
00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:19.810
Hearing where the judge takes into account the child's age circumstances of the

663
00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:22.060
crime and other mitigating factors.

664
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.580
It doesn't mean that a court can't,

665
00:21:24.581 --> 00:21:27.610
after taking all those into account a sentence,

666
00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:32.611
a child to a very long sins or even probably life imprisonment without the

667
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.390
possibility of parole,

668
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.730
but it says that the court has to,

669
00:21:36.731 --> 00:21:37.960
it can't do it automatically.

670
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.460
The legislature cannot provide that if you do a certain crime.

671
00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.330
Uh,

672
00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:43.630
they can,

673
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.690
they can provide that for adults,

674
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.540
but not for these children that if you do a certain crime,

675
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:53.770
it's automatically going to be life imprisonment without any possibility of

676
00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:54.220
parole.

677
00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:58.690
So two significant decisions because the court has done very little on the

678
00:21:58.691 --> 00:22:02.590
question of proportionality outside the area of the death penalty.

679
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.173
Um,

680
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.810
finally we come to individual proportionality review.

681
00:22:07.811 --> 00:22:11.920
This is a different kind of question we've looked at whether the penalty is

682
00:22:11.921 --> 00:22:14.570
appropriate for the role of the offender and the crime we've looked to her,

683
00:22:14.571 --> 00:22:18.490
whether it's appropriate for certain crimes and for certain kinds of offenders,

684
00:22:18.491 --> 00:22:19.160
children,

685
00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.710
an intellectually disabled people.

686
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:21.401
Now,

687
00:22:21.401 --> 00:22:22.540
Robert Dalton Harris,

688
00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.520
who was sentenced to death in California,

689
00:22:24.521 --> 00:22:27.040
comes before the court and he's got a different argument.

690
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:27.700
He says,

691
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:32.700
I want a determination of whether the death pony was disproportionate in my case

692
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.000
compared to all the other murder cases.

693
00:22:36.001 --> 00:22:38.200
And the senses imposed in California.

694
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.420
And the basis for this argument is that when the Supreme Court upheld a Georgia

695
00:22:43.421 --> 00:22:47.290
statute in 1976 in the case of Greg versus Georgia,

696
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:52.360
it pointed out when and lauded the fact that the Georgia Supreme Court under

697
00:22:52.361 --> 00:22:57.361
that statute was required to compare each case to others and see if the death

698
00:22:58.631 --> 00:23:00.160
pony was disproportionate,

699
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.560
considering both the circumstances of the crime,

700
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:03.221
uh,

701
00:23:03.221 --> 00:23:04.840
and the background of the offender.

702
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.860
And so some people read the Supreme Court's opinion,

703
00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:09.560
uh,

704
00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.300
in,

705
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:10.600
uh,

706
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.050
Greg to say that this was constitutionally required course.

707
00:23:14.051 --> 00:23:15.250
The court also upheld,

708
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:15.730
uh,

709
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:19.780
the Texas statute that day where there was no such provision in the statute.

710
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:24.250
Florida had decided judicially to conduct proportionality review,

711
00:23:24.251 --> 00:23:27.670
but it was not in the statute upheld in 1976.

712
00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.773
Well,

713
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.860
the court decides,

714
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.610
uh,

715
00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:31.230
that,

716
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:31.510
uh,

717
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:35.850
the eighth amendment does not require the proportionality review that Harris

718
00:23:35.851 --> 00:23:35.981
has.

719
00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:36.814
Seeking.

720
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.990
Harris wants to say what I did was murder,

721
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.110
but somebody else committed a murder far more heinous than mine.

722
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:45.410
They didn't get the death pony,

723
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:45.861
therefore,

724
00:23:45.861 --> 00:23:49.370
I shouldn't get the death by a Supreme Court says California doesn't have to do

725
00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:49.970
that.

726
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:54.970
That California has limited the death penalty to a small sub class of people by

727
00:23:55.911 --> 00:23:58.400
requiring the consideration and special factors.

728
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:01.820
What we've previously talked about as aggravating circumstances.

729
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.691
In other words,

730
00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:06.560
this is much like what the court said in Zant versus Stevens when it upheld the

731
00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:11.561
Georgia law and said that what Georgia did with it's aggravating circumstance

732
00:24:12.081 --> 00:24:13.160
was narrow.

733
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:18.160
The class of eligibles narrow the people who are eligible for the death penalty.

734
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.380
And that's really all the eighth amendment,

735
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.861
uh,

736
00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:22.790
requires.

737
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:23.600
Uh,

738
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.600
the jury's a discretion is limited,

739
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:27.110
uh,

740
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:32.030
by being directed to particular factors that say these factors weigh in favor of

741
00:24:32.031 --> 00:24:32.880
the death plenty or,

742
00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:33.260
or,

743
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.310
or these do not.

744
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.180
Uh,

745
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.220
so the result of this case,

746
00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:37.790
uh,

747
00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:38.810
is quite significant,

748
00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:39.590
uh,

749
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:43.760
because a number of states that had proportionality review statutes immediately

750
00:24:43.761 --> 00:24:44.594
repeal them.

751
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:45.171
Uh,

752
00:24:45.171 --> 00:24:48.410
and a number of states that still had it on the books,

753
00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.480
quit doing proportionality review,

754
00:24:50.481 --> 00:24:52.010
Georgia being one of them.

755
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:54.620
Georgia had actually found some death sentences.

756
00:24:54.621 --> 00:24:56.720
The Georgia Supreme Court disproportionate,

757
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.321
uh,

758
00:24:57.321 --> 00:24:58.490
before this decision.

759
00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:59.240
Uh,

760
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.920
but after this decision,

761
00:25:00.921 --> 00:25:03.530
it has yet to find a death since,

762
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:04.040
uh,

763
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:04.970
disproportionate.

764
00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:05.720
Uh,

765
00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.190
so once again,

766
00:25:07.191 --> 00:25:07.551
we,

767
00:25:07.551 --> 00:25:12.551
we conclude here with the fact that the court takes a much narrower view of what

768
00:25:13.641 --> 00:25:16.010
the eighth amendment to the United States constitution,

769
00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.220
what the cruel and unusual punishment clause requires.

770
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:21.320
In the 1976 cases,

771
00:25:21.321 --> 00:25:26.210
the court was talking about the discretion of the sensor being guided by clear

772
00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:27.650
and objective standards.

773
00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.690
Here the court is simply saying,

774
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.030
as long as you narrow the class,

775
00:25:32.031 --> 00:25:33.590
as long as the state narrows,

776
00:25:33.591 --> 00:25:34.700
the class says,

777
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:39.640
only people who commit murder them and commissioner of an arm robbery or murder

778
00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.380
the commissioner with kidnapping or however the court,

779
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:43.010
uh,

780
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:43.641
the state,

781
00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:44.390
excuse me,

782
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:47.060
defines it's aggravating circumstance.

783
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:50.810
As long as that narrows the group of people that can be considered.

784
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:52.760
That's all the eighth amendment requires.

785
00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.130
So that means Robert Holden Harris,

786
00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:55.641
uh,

787
00:25:55.641 --> 00:25:58.400
does not get a review of his case compared to others.

788
00:25:58.401 --> 00:26:00.500
He was put to death by the state of California.

789
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:01.131
Uh,

790
00:26:01.131 --> 00:26:02.120
and it means that,

791
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:02.660
uh,

792
00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.020
while there are some states and Florida is one example of a state that still

793
00:26:06.021 --> 00:26:09.500
conducts proportionality review and the farthest supreme court does,

794
00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:10.880
and this is not the only state,

795
00:26:10.881 --> 00:26:14.780
but the Florida Supreme Court does from time to time find that the death Connie

796
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:15.770
is disproportionate.

797
00:26:15.771 --> 00:26:18.050
It looks at other states,

798
00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:18.621
excuse me,

799
00:26:18.621 --> 00:26:20.000
other cases in the state,

800
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:20.601
uh,

801
00:26:20.601 --> 00:26:25.601
what punishment was imposed a and it builds some law there by its decisions in

802
00:26:26.061 --> 00:26:28.550
terms of when the death plan is appropriate and when it's not.

803
00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:33.050
That provides some guidance to prosecutors and Florida and also to trial judges

804
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.980
about when the death penalty is appropriate and when it's not.

805
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:40.130
But that's not the case in most states.

806
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:40.971
Uh,

807
00:26:40.971 --> 00:26:41.450
and,

808
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:41.840
uh,

809
00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:46.180
in the individual proportionality review can be done as a matter of state law,

810
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.450
but it's not required by the constitution of the United States.
