1
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.870
The most critical need that any person facing the death poly has a or facing any

2
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.200
criminal charge,

3
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.930
uh,

4
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.200
is the need for a lawyer.

5
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.670
A lawyer is,

6
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.210
uh,

7
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.210
indispensable to investigating the case against the person who's accused,

8
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.193
uh,

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.610
mounting a defense.

10
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:37.080
If the person accused says that there are witnesses who can show that he or she

11
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:38.970
was somewhere else at the time of the trial,

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.661
the lawyers,

13
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:43.440
the person who's responsible for going and finding those witnesses for putting

14
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:45.900
them under subpoena for bringing them to court,

15
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.220
uh,

16
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.610
so they can testify.

17
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.240
Uh,

18
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.500
the lawyers also,

19
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.891
uh,

20
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:51.960
responsible for all protection,

21
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:55.470
all the legal rights that a person accused of a crime has.

22
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.510
And if the lawyer doesn't raise those issues,

23
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.020
uh,

24
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.700
they might as well not exist at all,

25
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:00.780
at least for that person.

26
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.950
So it's critically important that a person facing the death punny have the

27
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:05.910
lawyer who's competent,

28
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.590
who knows the law,

29
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.920
who has the resources to the investigation that's necessary.

30
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.140
And as we'll discuss in a capital case,

31
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.430
there's going to be a need to do and even greater investigation of the life and

32
00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:19.440
background of the client that,

33
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.490
that lawyer serving.

34
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.900
Uh,

35
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.170
who's facing the death poem.

36
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.990
There's also a need for other people though as well,

37
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:26.940
or other parts of the defense team.

38
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:28.410
One is an investigator.

39
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.921
Uh,

40
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:32.820
that case is going to require investigation both,

41
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:33.391
as I said,

42
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:34.224
of the crime.

43
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.920
The prosecution may rely upon identification that is mistaken.

44
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.750
Uh,

45
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.430
it may rely upon witnesses who have traded,

46
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.270
uh,

47
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.120
favors and for their testimony who may be unreliable.

48
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.751
Uh,

49
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:49.800
it may be that,

50
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:50.250
uh,

51
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.180
there are a lot of factors going to the question of guilt that requires

52
00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:55.260
interviewing witnesses,

53
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.270
talking to people about what they saw,

54
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.260
what they heard,

55
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.460
what other people told them.

56
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:01.320
All of those things that as we know,

57
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.440
are critical in determining guilt or innocence.

58
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.520
And then finally,

59
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.413
today,

60
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.230
uh,

61
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.000
in the criminal justice system,

62
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.010
the use of expert testimony,

63
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.680
uh,

64
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.680
is important as so much use of everything from fingerprints to DNA evidence,

65
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.911
uh,

66
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:19.740
that are prosecution may present,

67
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:20.250
uh,

68
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.680
in support of prosecuting someone.

69
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.680
So the question is how does the defense respond to that?

70
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.100
And if the defense does not have its own investigator or if the lawyer defending

71
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:35.760
a person facing the death penalty can't consult with an expert.

72
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.760
And I'm an investigator,

73
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.531
an expert,

74
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:38.364
not an investigator,

75
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.420
you need to talk to someone who's an expert in that area.

76
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.961
Uh,

77
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:46.770
the lawyer will in order to be prepared to present that well,

78
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:48.360
what if you don't have any of these things?

79
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.650
Uh,

80
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.920
what if you have no money?

81
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.571
Uh,

82
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:51.420
Diego Morin,

83
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.690
uh,

84
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.650
accused of the death penalty and facing the death pointing of del Rio,

85
00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:56.484
Texas,

86
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.030
uh,

87
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.863
eight months,

88
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.490
eight months in jail without a lawyer.

89
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.340
So there's no lawyer to start an investigation,

90
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.380
no lawyer to start preparing this case.

91
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.100
Obviously it gives the prosecution a tremendous advantage.

92
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.550
Uh,

93
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.070
when the person accused does not have a lawyer.

94
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.050
Eventually he got a lawyer,

95
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.240
but it was eight months after his arrest and,

96
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.570
uh,

97
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.740
prop appointment of lawyers and then the lawyer having access to investigative

98
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.020
and expert assistance is going to be critical.

99
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.591
Well,

100
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:24.640
as we talk about this,

101
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:25.474
we'll look at,

102
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.010
uh,

103
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.300
to uh,

104
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.270
uh,

105
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.340
critical parts of the constitution.

106
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:30.641
First,

107
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:33.940
the due process clause of the 14th amendment.

108
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.460
And as we will see and we talk about,

109
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.951
uh,

110
00:03:36.951 --> 00:03:40.420
the case of Griffin versus Illinois in just a minute.

111
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:45.280
Different justices have different ideas what exactly due process means,

112
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.440
but basically fundamental fairness.

113
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:52.441
What do we provide this person that they have a fundamentally fair opportunity

114
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.440
to present their case within the adversary system.

115
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.150
It is an adversary system.

116
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.690
The prosecution is going to be presenting its case with all the,

117
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.050
uh,

118
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.790
the advocacy that it can to try to convince the jury of its point of view.

119
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.391
Uh,

120
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:08.410
and the question is,

121
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.380
what does a state have to provide a poor person,

122
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.520
uh,

123
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.520
to counter that other critical constitutional provision is the sixth amendment,

124
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.210
uh,

125
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.620
of the United States constitution.

126
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.461
Uh,

127
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:22.120
which,

128
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.953
um,

129
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.080
means that every person who's on trial a is entitled to a lawyer to represent

130
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:29.231
them at trial.

131
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:30.850
Notice this just applies to trial.

132
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.480
We'll talk in a moment about lawyers for appeals and other parts of the process.

133
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.020
Uh,

134
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.010
but we'll,

135
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.810
we'll start talking about due process,

136
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.440
uh,

137
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.440
this constitutional provision by looking at a case out of Illinois,

138
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.240
which was some time ago,

139
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.871
uh,

140
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:48.220
but gives us a,

141
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:53.140
the first time the court wrestles with this question of a poor person who needs

142
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:53.974
something,

143
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.371
uh,

144
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:57.130
and is asking for the state to provide it.

145
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.020
Griffin versus Illinois 1956 this case involve two people,

146
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:04.660
Judson Griffin and James Crenshaw,

147
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.380
who were convicted of armed robbery in Chicago.

148
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.400
In order to appeal in Illinois,

149
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.310
you have to have the transcript of the trial.

150
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.911
Of course,

151
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:17.410
while at trial is taking place.

152
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.670
The court reporter is taking down verbatim everything that the witnesses,

153
00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:22.211
the judge,

154
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:23.350
the lawyers say.

155
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.060
And that's what an appellate court uses to review the fairness of the trial.

156
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.940
He's fall,

157
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.081
say,

158
00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:31.420
we can't afford a transcript.

159
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.081
Uh,

160
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:34.930
and they argue that under the due process clause,

161
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.620
uh,

162
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.150
that as a matter of fairness,

163
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.700
uh,

164
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.640
they're entitled to this transcript.

165
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.410
And also if they don't get it,

166
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.440
that they're being treated differently because of their poverty.

167
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.130
Uh,

168
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.830
then other people was the close case.

169
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.371
Uh,

170
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:50.950
the Supreme Court decides five to four,

171
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.761
uh,

172
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:54.190
that they're entitled to a transcript.

173
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.820
A justice black writes the opinion for four members of the court that the

174
00:05:58.821 --> 00:05:59.570
states,

175
00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.841
uh,

176
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:01.790
if you provide an appeal,

177
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.620
you can't deny access to the appeal by denying a transcript.

178
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.090
One of the arguments in the case had been there's no right to appeal or the

179
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:15.680
constitution only provides the right to trial and a right to a lawyer at trial.

180
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.431
Uh,

181
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:19.790
but the court looked at the fact that basically every state,

182
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.340
every jurisdiction provides for an appeal,

183
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.260
appeals or just part of the system.

184
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.810
And if the system is going to be fair,

185
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.580
the appellate review of what happens in the trials is a critical component of

186
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:32.210
that.

187
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.210
And therefore Griffin and Crenshaw are entitled to a transcript so they can

188
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:38.300
appeal their case.

189
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.841
Uh,

190
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:41.010
justice black gives some very sweeping language here.

191
00:06:41.011 --> 00:06:46.011
There can be no equal justice when the kind of justice a person gets depends

192
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:49.040
upon the amount of money here she has,

193
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.031
of course,

194
00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:55.031
that's a noble ideal and the supreme court building has equal justice under law,

195
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.821
uh,

196
00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:57.260
at the front door.

197
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.650
But we will see that equal justice under law remains an aspiration as opposed to

198
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:04.514
reality.

199
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.060
Uh,

200
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.800
very often in the criminal courts.

201
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.251
Uh,

202
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:08.150
and very often,

203
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.720
uh,

204
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.860
in capital cases,

205
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.130
the fifth vote was provided by Justice Frankfurter.

206
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.851
Uh,

207
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:15.110
and he basically said,

208
00:07:15.111 --> 00:07:18.500
just as a practical matter if we're going to have appeals,

209
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.750
we can't keep poor people.

210
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.230
Uh,

211
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.063
from having,

212
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.150
uh,

213
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.730
the lawyers to represent,

214
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:25.131
excuse me,

215
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:25.964
transcripts,

216
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.530
uh,

217
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.530
of the trials.

218
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.720
Now Justice Harlan dissented,

219
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.201
uh,

220
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:30.381
for,

221
00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:31.430
for members of the court,

222
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:36.590
he felt there was no violation of equal protection because he said this cost of

223
00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:38.570
transcripts applies to everybody.

224
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.280
It applies to say,

225
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.410
just like tuition to a university.

226
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:45.170
Some people can afford to pay the tuition and some people can't,

227
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.520
but the government is not discriminating by charging tuition.

228
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.241
Uh,

229
00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:54.440
and therefore this is not discrimination against poor people because they can't

230
00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:55.970
afford a transcript.

231
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.090
He also says there's no due process violation.

232
00:07:59.390 --> 00:07:59.691
A,

233
00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:01.160
because it says due process,

234
00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:02.510
at least as he sees it.

235
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:07.510
And he defines it as not implicit in the concept of ordered liberty and not

236
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:11.780
traditionally regarded as necessarily the fundamental fairness.

237
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:12.614
What does that mean?

238
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.610
Basically,

239
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:14.960
how have we always done it?

240
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:20.120
If we haven't provided transcripts to poor people in cases up until now,

241
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.280
why suddenly should we change?

242
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.380
Why does the due process clause,

243
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.920
uh,

244
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.040
suddenly have a provision in it that it didn't have,

245
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:28.610
uh,

246
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.443
before?

247
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:29.900
Uh,

248
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.840
basically justice Harlan is saying federalism,

249
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.970
leave it up to the states.

250
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.020
The United States Supreme Court shouldn't decide whether people get transcripts

251
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:39.854
or not.

252
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:40.600
Uh,

253
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.470
this is a very close case,

254
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:42.951
uh,

255
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:47.951
but a very important case because we will see that it becomes important a few

256
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.390
years later and giving people the right to a lawyer,

257
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:50.750
uh,

258
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.583
for appeal.

259
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.023
Uh,

260
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.680
but what about the right to a lawyer at trial?

261
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:56.730
Once you have a transcript,

262
00:08:56.731 --> 00:09:00.630
of course you need a lawyer and when you're accused of a crime and once you're

263
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.740
at trial,

264
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.190
uh,

265
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.540
you have a right to a lawyer.

266
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.950
Power versus Alabama,

267
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.420
which we looked at earlier,

268
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.910
involve the young men in Scottsboro,

269
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:09.360
uh,

270
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.680
facing the death pony there.

271
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:12.720
The Supreme Court said that in that case,

272
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.950
the sort of casual appointment of lawyers who really had not prepared and sort

273
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.990
of stumbled through the case wasn't a violation right to counsel on the sixth

274
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:23.700
amendment because it didn't apply to the states then,

275
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.410
uh,

276
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.280
but it was a violation of due process.

277
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:28.260
They were denied a fair trial,

278
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:29.131
uh,

279
00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:31.020
in Johnson versus [inaudible].

280
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.450
Uh,

281
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.810
the Supreme Court held that in federal cases,

282
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.100
the sixth amendment right to counsel required that poor people accused of a

283
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:39.750
crime who could not afford a lawyer,

284
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:40.200
uh,

285
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.300
should be provided one a.

286
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:44.010
And for a while,

287
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.441
uh,

288
00:09:44.441 --> 00:09:48.120
the court said that in state courts it depended case by case.

289
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.040
In some cases you might be entitled to a lawyer if the case is complicated and

290
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:53.550
so forth.

291
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.170
But if it's a simple case and,

292
00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:55.680
uh,

293
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.150
the defendant can represent himself,

294
00:09:57.151 --> 00:09:57.984
then you're not.

295
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.700
Powell basically stood for the proposition that everybody in a capital case was

296
00:10:02.701 --> 00:10:03.630
entitled to a lawyer.

297
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:04.830
Um,

298
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.980
but what happened in 1963 was this man here,

299
00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:11.190
Clarence Earl Gideon wrote this five page.

300
00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:15.510
This is the first of a five page petition that he wrote to the Supreme Court of

301
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:20.511
the United States getting had been tried for breaking into a pool hall in a Bay

302
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:20.611
Harbor,

303
00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:21.444
Florida.

304
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.291
He'd been convicted.

305
00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:23.850
He had asked for a lawyer at trial.

306
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:24.631
The judge said,

307
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:25.530
you're not entitled to one.

308
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:26.580
It's a simple case.

309
00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:29.610
There's no reason you should get a lawyer.

310
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.151
Uh,

311
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:34.650
and the case goes to the Supreme Court on Gideons handwritten petition,

312
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:35.761
uh,

313
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:40.761
and the supreme court holes in Gideon versus Wainwright unanimously with justice

314
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.410
black writing for the court,

315
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:48.450
that any person who is too poor to afford a council to afford a lawyer who's

316
00:10:48.451 --> 00:10:49.350
hailed into court,

317
00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:52.110
charged with a crime is entitled to a lawyer.

318
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.393
So,

319
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.000
uh,

320
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.900
now the states have the responsibility of providing lawyers,

321
00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:58.920
but,

322
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.250
but of course there's this is,

323
00:11:00.251 --> 00:11:02.880
is if ever there is an unfunded mandate,

324
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.193
this is it.

325
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:09.410
And what are the states doing response Florida where Gideon had been tried

326
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.870
immediately within three months of the Supreme Court decision,

327
00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:15.060
adopted a statewide public defender system,

328
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:20.640
but many other states that didn't provide lawyers to people conscripted lawyers.

329
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.190
If you practice law in a place,

330
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.460
a part of the privilege of practicing law was that every so often you were

331
00:11:28.591 --> 00:11:32.640
assigned a criminal case and the lawyer had to represent the person even though

332
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.100
the lawyer might be a tax lawyer,

333
00:11:35.101 --> 00:11:36.300
a real estate lawyer,

334
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.920
a divorce lawyer,

335
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.731
uh,

336
00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:39.121
that,

337
00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:39.721
that was,

338
00:11:39.721 --> 00:11:40.220
uh,

339
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:40.650
uh,

340
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.090
just part of being a lawyer.

341
00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:45.840
Of course that resulted in very poor legal representation.

342
00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:48.660
Since the lawyers a didn't want the job,

343
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:53.830
a B didn't get paid anything for it and see often lacked the expertise needed,

344
00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:55.150
uh,

345
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.680
to provide representation.

346
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:57.200
Uh,

347
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.033
in a case.

348
00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:58.590
Well,

349
00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.660
there are different ways in which states have provided,

350
00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:02.171
uh,

351
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:03.220
representation.

352
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:03.730
Uh,

353
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.970
public defender programs are programs in which you have full time.

354
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:11.950
Lawyers who are trained and supervised usually have a staff of investigators,

355
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:12.850
social workers,

356
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:13.360
uh,

357
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.620
in some states now have capital defender offices in Virginia for example,

358
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:22.860
for regional capital defender offices obviously is that specialize in

359
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:25.900
representing people in death penalty cases.

360
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.651
Uh,

361
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:27.850
the same thing in Georgia.

362
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.330
The capital defender office created in 2005,

363
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.193
the Virginia one,

364
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:32.650
uh,

365
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.880
once after that,

366
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:34.210
uh,

367
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:35.830
Colorado for a long time,

368
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:36.401
uh,

369
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:41.260
has had an outstanding capital unit within its public defender system that

370
00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:42.250
represents people.

371
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:42.881
Uh,

372
00:12:42.881 --> 00:12:44.050
but in a lot of other states,

373
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:44.891
uh,

374
00:12:44.891 --> 00:12:47.740
there is no capital defender office.

375
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:52.120
And often as we'll talk about the lawyers representing people in death penalty

376
00:12:52.121 --> 00:12:52.820
cases,

377
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:53.140
uh,

378
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.330
may not quite be up to the task.

379
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:55.961
Uh,

380
00:12:55.961 --> 00:13:00.100
another system is a what's called panel programs are assigned counsel.

381
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:04.810
Basically lawyers are unlist and the judges may appoint from the list.

382
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:05.910
That's the panel is,

383
00:13:05.911 --> 00:13:07.560
is the list or the judge.

384
00:13:07.561 --> 00:13:08.341
It's just my appointment.

385
00:13:08.341 --> 00:13:09.174
People they know.

386
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:09.911
Uh,

387
00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:14.911
and one of the problems that we see is that judges elected judges appointing

388
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.870
lawyers that they know,

389
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:17.441
uh,

390
00:13:17.441 --> 00:13:18.850
to represent people in cases.

391
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:23.851
Often the lawyer may be more loyal to the judge who appointed the lawyer and who

392
00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:27.040
the lawyer depends upon for his or her livelihood.

393
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:27.600
Uh,

394
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.450
then the client,

395
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:28.870
uh,

396
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.730
that they're representing a,

397
00:13:30.731 --> 00:13:32.470
another system has contracts.

398
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.320
Basically a lawyer or a law firm,

399
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.930
contracts with a jurisdiction,

400
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:38.500
uh,

401
00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.880
to represent every person accused of a crime must as a conflict of interest.

402
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:43.510
Uh,

403
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:44.440
in cases,

404
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.560
a lot of jurisdictions like this because it's cheap,

405
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.460
but it also is a very high volume,

406
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.620
a poor quality system.

407
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:54.581
Most of the time,

408
00:13:54.581 --> 00:13:54.821
of course,

409
00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:55.421
not all the time,

410
00:13:55.421 --> 00:13:56.171
but most of the time.

411
00:13:56.171 --> 00:13:57.004
And then finally,

412
00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:57.280
uh,

413
00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.660
there is still conscription,

414
00:13:58.930 --> 00:13:59.560
uh,

415
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.970
less and less than there was,

416
00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:01.870
uh,

417
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:02.740
50 years ago.

418
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:03.550
Uh,

419
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:04.630
but in Louisiana,

420
00:14:04.631 --> 00:14:08.140
a lawyer can still be drafted to handle the case,

421
00:14:08.141 --> 00:14:10.150
including a death public case.

422
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.253
Um,

423
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.093
so,

424
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.113
um,

425
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:14.030
in,

426
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.290
in,

427
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:14.501
in,

428
00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:16.210
in considering all of these programs,

429
00:14:16.211 --> 00:14:20.740
I would say that the public defender program is the one where there is the

430
00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:23.470
greatest likelihood that you're going to have specialization.

431
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.251
A,

432
00:14:24.251 --> 00:14:25.600
you're going to have supervision,

433
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.470
uh,

434
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:28.360
and training of the lawyers,

435
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:28.901
uh,

436
00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:30.610
which in capital cases is critical.

437
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:31.240
Uh,

438
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.073
because,

439
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:32.890
uh,

440
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:35.290
capital cases are incredibly complex.

441
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.840
They involved a complex area of the law.

442
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.090
They involved additional investigation,

443
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:40.510
uh,

444
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:41.500
that has to be done.

445
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.470
And so some specialization is helpful,

446
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:45.610
but you will find,

447
00:14:45.611 --> 00:14:49.120
we will find that in many places just simply any lawyer who's a member of the

448
00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:53.580
bar may be appointed to represent someone in a death penalty case.

449
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:54.773
Um,

450
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:58.500
in 1976 when the supreme court struck down the,

451
00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.370
uh,

452
00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.350
mandatory death pony statutes,

453
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.980
they said in a case out of North Carolina Woodson versus North Carolina,

454
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.611
uh,

455
00:15:05.611 --> 00:15:08.940
that the jury cannot be precluded from considering,

456
00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:09.840
uh,

457
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.340
any of the compassionate or mitigating factors about the individual facing the

458
00:15:14.341 --> 00:15:15.174
death Poli,

459
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.173
uh,

460
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:16.740
uh,

461
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:21.740
that arise from the diverse frailties of humankind two years later and lock it

462
00:15:21.901 --> 00:15:22.770
versus Ohio.

463
00:15:22.771 --> 00:15:27.771
The court said the sensor cannot be precluded from considering any aspect of the

464
00:15:28.411 --> 00:15:30.030
defendant's character record,

465
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:30.571
uh,

466
00:15:30.571 --> 00:15:34.410
that is offered for a sentence less than death in the case of lockup vs Ohio.

467
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:35.550
Um,

468
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:39.000
the same time the court upheld the death penalty and Greg versus Georgia,

469
00:15:39.001 --> 00:15:44.001
the prevailing opinion said accurate sensing information is indispensable for

470
00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:49.590
the death penalty to be carried out in a constitutional and fair manner.

471
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:50.120
Uh,

472
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:50.551
of course,

473
00:15:50.551 --> 00:15:55.050
that puts tremendous responsibility on the defense lawyer to do the

474
00:15:55.051 --> 00:15:56.160
investigation,

475
00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.720
which those cases require.

476
00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.940
That is to look at the life history of the person,

477
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.740
everything about their life,

478
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.960
any mental issues that may be in the case,

479
00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.390
any intellectual disability,

480
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.840
uh,

481
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.880
or any other as a case,

482
00:16:08.881 --> 00:16:09.870
as the court said,

483
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.270
diverse frailties of humankind,

484
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:13.980
that may be a mitigating factor.

485
00:16:13.981 --> 00:16:17.190
It doesn't explain away or justify the crime,

486
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.600
but it's something that jury takes an account in measuring culpability.

487
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:21.570
Uh,

488
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:22.141
we will see,

489
00:16:22.141 --> 00:16:22.974
unfortunately,

490
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.940
that sometimes lawyers are not up to the task of doing that.

491
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.110
And as a result,

492
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.790
that critical information,

493
00:16:29.791 --> 00:16:33.360
probably the most important information at the penalty phase of a capital trial

494
00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:34.440
may not be presented.
