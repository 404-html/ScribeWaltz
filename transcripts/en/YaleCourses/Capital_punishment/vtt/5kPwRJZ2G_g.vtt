1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.993
Okay.

2
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.010
<v 1>The one to offer a few thoughts about how to think about some of these legal</v>

3
00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:19.540
developments that you're studying

4
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.070
and particularly the McCleskey decision.

5
00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:28.870
The class ski really stands out in American jurisprudence has one of those

6
00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:30.610
tremendous contradictions.

7
00:00:30.611 --> 00:00:35.611
We survived this era of segregation and racial oppression and racial hierarchy.

8
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.390
Now that was dismantled during the 1950s and sixties through the heroic

9
00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:44.224
leadership.

10
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.120
Uh,

11
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.750
many people who lived in this community,

12
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.500
uh,

13
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.500
my office is just a few blocks from the church were Dr. King pastored in 1955.

14
00:00:54.671 --> 00:00:59.350
We are just a few blocks from the corner of Rosa Parks.

15
00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:01.630
Refused to give up her seat.

16
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.440
And around me are the landmarks where activism by people who were black and

17
00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:09.491
white,

18
00:01:09.491 --> 00:01:12.820
young and old force this country to recognize,

19
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.660
uh,

20
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.680
that the legalized use of racial bias and discrimination,

21
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.580
uh,

22
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.110
the legal lies,

23
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.370
marginalization and subordination of people of color could no longer be

24
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:25.204
tolerated.

25
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.040
It's interesting,

26
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.180
uh,

27
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.830
to be celebrating the 50th anniversary of many of these milestone achievements

28
00:01:32.831 --> 00:01:37.831
and civil rights and then be required to read McCleskey vs camp because the

29
00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:43.811
McClusky decision that actually stands in stark opposition to much of what was

30
00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.150
discussed and achieved,

31
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.900
uh,

32
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.760
in the 1960s accord in the class game does something that I've never really

33
00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:53.500
recovered from,

34
00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:58.501
which is to kind of talk about and to concede bias and discrimination and

35
00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:00.550
America's death penalty.

36
00:02:00.551 --> 00:02:01.150
And,

37
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.490
uh,

38
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.230
I think one of the challenging things when you read McCluskey is to see the

39
00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:08.260
court painfully aware of these disparities.

40
00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:08.471
I mean,

41
00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:13.210
this one's a case that was presented to the court after a long line of cases had

42
00:02:13.211 --> 00:02:18.211
asked the court to deal more honestly and more effectively with the legacy of

43
00:02:18.551 --> 00:02:20.560
racial bias and the middle justice system.

44
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.870
When you look at death penalty cases,

45
00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:25.060
you actually have to see this trilogy emerge.

46
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.340
It begins with Greg in 19,

47
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.911
excuse me,

48
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:29.380
with Fermin in 1972,

49
00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:33.010
but the court strikes down the death penalty after declaring that it's

50
00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:33.731
arbitrary,

51
00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:35.020
it's capricious.

52
00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:36.460
It's like being struck by lightning.

53
00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:41.380
And the park affirming that I'm interested in is actually the part where Justice

54
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.400
Marshall Educate the court about its history of racial bias and discrimination.

55
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.760
And it's Justice Marshall that points out that between 1930 and the time of the

56
00:02:53.831 --> 00:02:58.831
Furman decision in 1970 to 87% of the people who executed for the crime of were

57
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:00.940
African Americans,

58
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.863
uh,

59
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.570
convicted of crimes involving white victims that almost all of the people that's

60
00:03:06.571 --> 00:03:06.791
cute.

61
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:11.410
It for that offense where people executed for offenses involving victims who are

62
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:13.930
white and his racial legacy.

63
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:18.931
This racially discriminatory context is what's really meant by the arbitrariness

64
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.351
language,

65
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:25.090
the capriciousness language that the court uses in striking down the death

66
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:26.050
penalty and affirming.

67
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.760
Now and then of course we have the grant decision in 1976 it's a few years

68
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.150
later,

69
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.360
uh,

70
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.800
reinstating capital punishment,

71
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:37.801
upholding capital's punishment and lawyers from the legal defense fund made the

72
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:41.200
argument that um,

73
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.370
nothing had changed in America or too little had changed in America now to

74
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:49.960
justify the court finding the death penalty constitutional now in ways that it

75
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:51.430
had not four years earlier.

76
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.200
But the corpus in a different mood.

77
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:54.670
And the court essentially said,

78
00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:54.821
well,

79
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:58.350
we're not going to presume that the modern death penalty wool,

80
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.650
I act in the same discriminatory manner that the old Desmond t act,

81
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.760
they credited these new guided discretion statutes and these new procedures as

82
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:14.530
safeguards that would shield the death penalty fuck the racialized

83
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:16.060
discriminatory history,

84
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.660
uh,

85
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.640
that Ted sustained and created it.

86
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.260
And of course,

87
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.860
uh,

88
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.790
those of us who are working on these cases quickly recognize that these new

89
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:25.451
procedures,

90
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:30.451
these new safeguards were inadequate to overcome the legacy of racial bias and

91
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:31.474
discrimination.

92
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.060
Now that surrounds the criminal justice system.

93
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.530
And that gave rise to a death penalty that was every bit as biased and

94
00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:39.400
discriminatory,

95
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.011
uh,

96
00:04:40.011 --> 00:04:41.260
in the late 1980s.

97
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:43.000
And that's the context that,

98
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.500
uh,

99
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.130
set up the McCleskey decision.

100
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.680
It was a choice by litigators to prove to the court that the safeguards were not

101
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:51.400
working,

102
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.400
that the death penalty was still biased and discriminatory and the data was very

103
00:04:56.651 --> 00:04:57.340
compelling.

104
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.820
Uh,

105
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.160
there was a study done.

106
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.870
The study presented some very,

107
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.890
uh,

108
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.730
shocking but powerful findings about the prevalence of race bias,

109
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.570
uh,

110
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.990
being 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than

111
00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:11.081
that.

112
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:11.891
The victim was black,

113
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:13.390
was an astonishing finding.

114
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.040
The finding that you're 22 times more likely to get the death penalty if the

115
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:19.510
defendant is black and the victim is white.

116
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:21.040
It was an astonishing pining,

117
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:26.041
even the 4.3 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white

118
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:27.310
than if the victim is black.

119
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.270
A statistic that the court relied on was an astonishing finding.

120
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:38.641
It's an incredible showing of the prevalence of race consciousness in a

121
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.840
Georgia's death penalty then to have the court except these data to make the

122
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.130
choice to not quibble with the data,

123
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:52.450
to believe what the day to say to us about disparities based on race and

124
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:55.720
nonetheless uphold Georgia's death penalty was,

125
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.980
I think the difficult thing.

126
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.930
Uh,

127
00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.930
and I tell people all the time that in my career and I've been representing

128
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.190
people on death row now for nearly 30 years in my career,

129
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:09.290
probably nothing has been harder for me than reading.

130
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.340
Now the court's decision in the class ski,

131
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.290
we had allowed ourselves to be hopeful about what the court might do a and to

132
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:18.441
read a five,

133
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:23.441
four decision where the court talks about these disparities as if they are just

134
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:25.280
artifacts of our society.

135
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.113
They are just,

136
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.810
uh,

137
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.370
in the landscape in ways that we have to tolerate and embrace was deeply

138
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:32.204
distressing.

139
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.260
Uh,

140
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.600
the court had a line of reasoning that said,

141
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:35.721
well,

142
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:40.721
basically if we recognize the disparities in the death penalty and we create

143
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:43.760
constitutional remedies for these racial disparities in the death penalty,

144
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:48.080
it couldn't be just a matter of time before lawyers start complaining about the

145
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:52.040
same kinds of race disparities in the administration of other kinds of crimes

146
00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:53.260
and criminal laws.

147
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.440
And they'll find the same disparities for drug crimes and property crimes and

148
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.030
other violent crimes.

149
00:06:59.031 --> 00:06:59.690
And,

150
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.050
uh,

151
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.560
this,

152
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.393
uh,

153
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.450
this fear,

154
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.470
justice Brennan in his descent characterize it as a fear of too much justice,

155
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:06.980
uh,

156
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:10.130
cause the court to decide to do nothing.

157
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.010
And for many of us that was deeply disheartening,

158
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.880
but it was the second part of the court's opinion that I found most distressing

159
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:17.830
this line,

160
00:07:17.831 --> 00:07:20.150
which where the court says a certain amount of bias,

161
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:24.770
a certain quantum of discrimination is in the court's opinion inevitable.

162
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.550
And that language is the language that still haunts me.

163
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:29.690
It still troubles me.

164
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.550
It's what really,

165
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.330
really has changed my relationship to the law,

166
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.710
uh,

167
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.420
because we cannot talk about the inevitability of race bias in a society like

168
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:43.310
America without doing deep injury,

169
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:44.180
uh,

170
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.090
to our efforts and confronting race bias.

171
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:50.780
I'm a product of Brown versus board of education or grew up in the community,

172
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.041
were black children,

173
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:53.270
could not go to school.

174
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:54.200
Uh,

175
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.220
in the public schools.

176
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.050
We had to go to a colored school.

177
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.190
And I remember when lawyers came into our community to implement the Brown

178
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:02.024
decision.

179
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:02.900
And,

180
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.640
but for their willingness to intervene,

181
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:08.660
but for their applying and implementing Brown in my community,

182
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:13.661
I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you today until I know the power of the

183
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:14.031
law.

184
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:18.020
I know the power of what the court can do,

185
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.640
not when it rejects evidence of race bias and discrimination.

186
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:27.140
And I know the consequences of that law when the court refuses to do that.

187
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.280
And I just want to offer a little bit of analysis of why I think the court got

188
00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:34.251
it wrong.

189
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:36.170
I think the court got it wrong.

190
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.430
Um,

191
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.340
for the same reason that we often get it wrong,

192
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:45.080
we think and talk about racial inequality in America.

193
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:47.780
When we talk about racial injustice in America,

194
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.410
we tend not to talk in historical terms.

195
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:57.150
We have a very superficial understanding of what our legacy,

196
00:08:57.151 --> 00:08:59.670
our history of racial inequality has done.

197
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.930
And it means that we sometimes react to claims of racial bias and discrimination

198
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:08.931
in a very superficial way and were easily provoked by the assertion that there

199
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:14.001
is racial bias where easily discouraged in thinking carefully and critically

200
00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:17.400
about what these assertions me.

201
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.540
And we're quick to be exhausted by the whole topic.

202
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.550
And what's sad is that it doesn't take very much in most parts of this country

203
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:27.980
to create racial conflict,

204
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.890
racial tension.

205
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.760
You experience it probably as law students and certainly as college students,

206
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:35.010
you experience it when you go back into your communities.

207
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:35.880
Um,

208
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.770
there are oftentimes things that happen that create some discomfort around the

209
00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:41.581
topic of race.

210
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.500
And I think that's in part because,

211
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:44.400
yeah,

212
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.770
we have not dealt with this issue,

213
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.680
uh,

214
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.070
in an in an appropriate historical way.

215
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:55.320
And so I think the court gets it wrong because they fail to appreciate the ways

216
00:09:55.321 --> 00:10:00.321
in which the death penalty creates another institutional relationship to African

217
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:02.940
Americans and the people of color in this country.

218
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.790
That's part of a long line of relationships.

219
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:09.060
And it's only way you think about this institutional,

220
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.960
a relationship in an historical context that you get to a different place.

221
00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:17.490
And for me becomes important to talk about these issues differently,

222
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.990
to contextualize them.

223
00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.370
You can't understand the death penalty in America today and certainly claims of

224
00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:26.580
racial bias in the depth domain America today without understanding slavery.

225
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:27.630
You know,

226
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.830
we've been interested in talking about slavery because slavery created myths

227
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:33.690
about African American people,

228
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.480
but that have not been adequately addressed.

229
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.680
Slavery in America wasn't like slavery in other parts of the world as some

230
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:41.880
transitional state,

231
00:10:41.881 --> 00:10:46.881
some transitory status that you could fall into because of bad decisions or

232
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:48.570
being conquered in a war.

233
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.160
It wasn't like that in America.

234
00:10:50.161 --> 00:10:51.930
Slavery in America was a racialized.

235
00:10:51.931 --> 00:10:52.690
It was a,

236
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.060
a system that was created,

237
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:54.650
um,

238
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:59.650
afford labor for economic development that was focused on people who were black

239
00:11:01.471 --> 00:11:03.540
people who are African descent.

240
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.650
And we created narratives to justify this about these people.

241
00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:09.750
And we said they weren't really fully human,

242
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.070
that they had qualities and deficits and attributes that are required and

243
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:15.840
benefited from enslavement.

244
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:21.470
And we use this insane narrative to justify the morality of slavery and to even,

245
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.910
uh,

246
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.740
feel good about what we were doing.

247
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.420
And as a result of that,

248
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:27.810
uh,

249
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:28.440
we,

250
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:28.710
uh,

251
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.610
had a racialized system of slavery in this country that could not be,

252
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:33.390
ah,

253
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.030
eliminated by simply eliminating slavery.

254
00:11:36.031 --> 00:11:38.250
The 13th amendment didn't talk about the myths,

255
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:38.640
uh,

256
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.680
created about black inferiority.

257
00:11:40.681 --> 00:11:45.681
It didn't talk about all of the ways in which people of color had been a thought

258
00:11:47.431 --> 00:11:48.810
of as less than human.

259
00:11:48.811 --> 00:11:52.230
And neither of the emancipation proclamation nor the 13th amendment had the

260
00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:55.360
power to overcome these myths.

261
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.010
And because we didn't talk about the miss,

262
00:11:57.011 --> 00:11:58.480
we just tried to move on.

263
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.670
We didn't really end slavery.

264
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.250
We just created a new form of it.

265
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:04.390
Slavery didn't end.

266
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:05.224
It evolved.

267
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.620
And it created a second institution that you see that beginning at the end of

268
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:11.200
reconstruction carried on to a World War II,

269
00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:11.690
uh,

270
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.300
that I define as terror.

271
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.310
It was the American terrorism.

272
00:12:15.311 --> 00:12:19.150
It was the experience of racial terror that shaped the lives of people of color

273
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.390
from the end of reconstruction until World War II.

274
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:26.320
It was the experience of daily worrying about being lynched daily,

275
00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:29.950
worrying about being arrested and released as a conflict,

276
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.270
a daily worried with threats of violence and intimidation from,

277
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.320
uh,

278
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.220
the law enforcement or any person who was white could say anything at any moment

279
00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:41.320
that could cost you your life.

280
00:12:41.321 --> 00:12:43.990
And it's for these reasons that we have the segregated south,

281
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:45.700
that we still have a today.

282
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:50.320
People organize themselves on the other side of the railroad tracks for security

283
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:55.740
from the terror and the violence and the lynchings and that sense of threat and

284
00:12:56.351 --> 00:12:56.771
injury,

285
00:12:56.771 --> 00:12:59.740
which was so dominant in the deep south,

286
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:00.430
uh,

287
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:05.430
was absolutely overwhelming in shaping a race relations in this country.

288
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.041
Of course,

289
00:13:06.041 --> 00:13:11.041
then the third institution becomes a apartheid Jim Crow laws,

290
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:12.730
uh,

291
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:17.730
role in a legitimating racial hierarchy and racial subordination the way we

292
00:13:18.341 --> 00:13:23.290
enacted codes and conventions and statutes and provisions,

293
00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:23.860
uh,

294
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.220
to insist on these divided lines,

295
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.210
uh,

296
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.470
defined by race.

297
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.270
And again,

298
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:36.300
our efforts of confronting that Wa were noble and historic and revolutionary,

299
00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:38.470
but they were also in complete,

300
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.130
uh,

301
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.640
because we didn't actually talk about all the damage that had been done by

302
00:13:42.641 --> 00:13:44.800
decades of segregation and humiliation.

303
00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:45.521
When I was a child,

304
00:13:45.521 --> 00:13:49.090
my parents wouldn't take me into town with them because they didn't want me to

305
00:13:49.091 --> 00:13:53.620
see them humiliated by any white person who chose to say something insulting to

306
00:13:53.621 --> 00:13:53.910
them.

307
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.870
He chose to say something or unfair to them.

308
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.060
And that sense of injury,

309
00:13:58.061 --> 00:14:00.660
that sense of trauma has not been addressed.

310
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.170
We didn't do a what other countries have done to overcome decades of human

311
00:14:05.171 --> 00:14:05.891
rights abuses.

312
00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:08.950
We didn't commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation.

313
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.390
And because of that,

314
00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:14.800
we have not reconciled herself to this history in South Africa.

315
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:17.770
There was a recognition that after apartheid there had to be truth and

316
00:14:17.771 --> 00:14:18.580
reconciliation.

317
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.413
In Rwanda,

318
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.880
there's a recognition that after the genocide,

319
00:14:21.881 --> 00:14:25.990
there must be a truth and reconciliation in this country.

320
00:14:25.991 --> 00:14:30.991
There was a need after the civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s after the

321
00:14:31.091 --> 00:14:32.800
assassination of Dr. King,

322
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:33.400
uh,

323
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.380
four process of truth and reconciliation.

324
00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:36.214
But we didn't do it.

325
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.900
And because we didn't do it,

326
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.670
a fourth institution emerge and it is the institution of mass incarceration and

327
00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:47.440
the crown on that institution is the death penalty because it combined all of

328
00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:49.600
these historical antecedents,

329
00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:54.470
the myths about a dangerousness of people of color and the threat that they

330
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:54.891
pose.

331
00:14:54.891 --> 00:14:58.940
It's the reason why these disparities documented by David Ball goes in the

332
00:14:58.941 --> 00:14:59.231
class,

333
00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:00.860
game exist.

334
00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.980
They would not exist in the country without our history of slavery.

335
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:07.760
They would not exist in a country without our history of terror and lynching.

336
00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:12.530
They would not exist without decades of segregation and racial subordination.

337
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.770
And the court doesn't talk about that because they don't talk about it.

338
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:20.300
They minimize the significance of tolerating and tolerating.

339
00:15:20.301 --> 00:15:20.841
It of course,

340
00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:25.730
makes this institution like the other institutions and institutions that will

341
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:30.731
persist and prevail until there is some consciousness that says this is not

342
00:15:31.281 --> 00:15:34.490
consistent with a just society with a fair society,

343
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:36.110
but an equal society.

344
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.580
And so for me,

345
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:38.150
uh,

346
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.560
the court's decision in the class fee is like the court's decision in Plessy,

347
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:43.640
uh,

348
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.710
like the court's decision in dred Scott.

349
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:51.260
It is a concession to conventional norms and values that tolerate systemized

350
00:15:51.261 --> 00:15:56.261
structural racism and bigotry in ways for which there is no justification and

351
00:15:56.721 --> 00:15:58.610
light these other decisions.

352
00:15:58.611 --> 00:16:03.611
It will be a decision that at some point we'll be seen as a low point in the

353
00:16:03.771 --> 00:16:04.940
court's jurisprudence.

354
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.810
You cannot talk about the inevitability of bias and discrimination in the nation

355
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.640
as fractured and,

356
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:14.750
and destroyed by racial oppression as ours.

357
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.790
You cannot talk about,

358
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:17.750
uh,

359
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:22.750
the acceptibility of these attributes and features of the death penalty when you

360
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:24.650
reflect on the legacy of lynching.

361
00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:28.850
I gave some lectures in Germany talking about the correlation between racial

362
00:16:28.851 --> 00:16:30.880
bias and the death penalty in America.

363
00:16:30.881 --> 00:16:35.210
And when I finished that was struck by how the German scholars,

364
00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:35.750
uh,

365
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:36.740
stood up and all said,

366
00:16:36.741 --> 00:16:36.861
well,

367
00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:38.990
we can't have the death penalty in Germany.

368
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.010
And they were quite adamant that there could never be a moment in Germany's

369
00:16:43.011 --> 00:16:48.011
future where they could accept putting people in gas chambers and executing

370
00:16:48.111 --> 00:16:48.261
them.

371
00:16:48.261 --> 00:16:48.591
And they said,

372
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:52.310
it doesn't matter whether the people we execute are guilty of heinous crimes.

373
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:52.731
They said,

374
00:16:52.731 --> 00:16:53.900
we cannot do that.

375
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:54.891
They said,

376
00:16:54.891 --> 00:16:59.210
our history of the Holocaust means we can never again engage in systematic.

377
00:16:59.211 --> 00:17:00.044
Kevin.

378
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.630
And I thought about that on my flight back home.

379
00:17:02.631 --> 00:17:03.051
I thought,

380
00:17:03.051 --> 00:17:03.231
well,

381
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:03.501
yes,

382
00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:04.221
it would be very,

383
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:09.221
very difficult for me to stay silent in a world where people were still being

384
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.570
putting gas chambers in Germany.

385
00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:11.840
I,

386
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.470
the very notion of it provokes me to the point where I know I'd have to say

387
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:16.304
something.

388
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:17.060
Oh,

389
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.230
the flight back and started thinking,

390
00:17:18.231 --> 00:17:18.391
well,

391
00:17:18.391 --> 00:17:22.820
what would I feel like if I were living at a time where the nation state of

392
00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:25.940
Germany was still executing people and the people they were disproportionately

393
00:17:25.941 --> 00:17:27.230
executing were Jewish.

394
00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.180
And the more I reflect on that,

395
00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:31.190
the more I realized I couldn't be silent in such a world.

396
00:17:31.191 --> 00:17:32.050
I'd have to do something.

397
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.110
I'd have to say something,

398
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.120
I'd have to go there and have to fight it.

399
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:40.400
And then I got off the plane in Alabama and I walked to my car and drove to my

400
00:17:40.401 --> 00:17:41.960
office were buried in the ground,

401
00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:46.650
or the bodies of thousands of people were the victims of lynching and slavery

402
00:17:46.651 --> 00:17:50.760
and racial violence and racial terror and increasingly the death penalty.

403
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:56.400
And it's in that context that the court's decision that McCluskey and could have

404
00:17:56.401 --> 00:18:01.401
been very different if the court recognize the history of racial inequality in

405
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:01.800
America.

406
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.930
They've thought about slavery.

407
00:18:02.931 --> 00:18:03.990
If they thought about lynching,

408
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:05.490
if they thought about segregation,

409
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.720
then they would have realized that the question presented in the classic,

410
00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:13.721
he is not a question about whether people convicted of crimes deserve to die for

411
00:18:14.191 --> 00:18:14.881
their offenses.

412
00:18:14.881 --> 00:18:18.330
They would recognize the question presented by McCluskey is,

413
00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:19.620
do we deserve to kill?

414
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.490
And when we have systems of justice that tolerate racial bias,

415
00:18:23.491 --> 00:18:26.400
when we have decision makers who would disproportionately white,

416
00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:28.830
and we allow people of color to be excluded from juries,

417
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:33.840
and we allow our conscious and unconscious racial bias to create the kinds of

418
00:18:33.841 --> 00:18:38.010
results documented about professor baldness in those researchers.

419
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.240
And it's through that Lens that you recognized the inherent,

420
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:43.663
uh,

421
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.770
illogic of the McCleskey outcome.

422
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.030
And more than that,

423
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.020
the chain full character of the McClusky opinion.

424
00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.750
And as you've probably heard,

425
00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.080
just as a pow and he retired,

426
00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:58.680
uh,

427
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:03.680
gave voice to his deep regret about McClaskey wished he could change his vote,

428
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:10.250
but re recreating a time when the court can revisit this issue and it can take a

429
00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:12.270
different approach.

430
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.610
Can think more honestly about our history.

431
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.020
We'll take some doing.

432
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.041
And that's,

433
00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:18.920
I think the challenge of McCleskey.

434
00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.310
Uh,

435
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:25.050
Steve Professor Bride has probably told you that it was a very disheartening

436
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.750
moment for those of us representing people on death row limit.

437
00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.450
Classic came down in 1987,

438
00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.910
but after that moment passed,

439
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.730
we began to reflect on what the court actually said.

440
00:19:35.731 --> 00:19:38.970
And what the court actually said is that you didn't prove that the individual

441
00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:43.380
decision makers and we're acting with race anamis that you didn't show us that

442
00:19:43.381 --> 00:19:47.010
there was real bias behind some of these outcomes and that actually created an

443
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:50.100
opportunity to rethink the way we litigate.

444
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.220
And that's when we started working on cases.

445
00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:57.930
Steve did the in Georgia and others did around the south where we tried to

446
00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.160
expose,

447
00:19:59.440 --> 00:19:59.580
uh,

448
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:03.750
the history of racial bias that had situated many of the capital prosecutions

449
00:20:03.751 --> 00:20:06.600
that we saw that and we continue to see today.

450
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:12.350
And so whether a system is fully just completely free of racial bias becomes a

451
00:20:12.661 --> 00:20:13.830
threshold question.

452
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:14.590
Uh,

453
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:18.900
when you think about the death penalty and if that system is not free of racial

454
00:20:18.901 --> 00:20:19.231
bias,

455
00:20:19.231 --> 00:20:22.110
if that threshold requirement has not been met,

456
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.520
then there is an obligation,

457
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:24.383
I believe,

458
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.180
to give voice to a racial discrimination,

459
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.150
conscious and unconscious racial thinking.

460
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.810
Uh,

461
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:31.980
disparate outcomes,

462
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:33.570
racialized talking,

463
00:20:33.571 --> 00:20:34.590
racialized thinking,

464
00:20:34.591 --> 00:20:35.850
racialized prosecutions,

465
00:20:35.851 --> 00:20:39.540
racialized sentencings all have to be exposed because in the absence of that

466
00:20:39.541 --> 00:20:39.961
exposure,

467
00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:41.970
we contribute to the institution.

468
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:44.700
It's like being silent during slavery.

469
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.980
It's like being silent during,

470
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.410
it's like being silent during segregation.

471
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:54.440
I think the [inaudible] is demanding from us either silence or activism.

472
00:20:55.171 --> 00:20:59.550
And it's one of the reasons why it's such an important case regardless of

473
00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:03.690
whether you choose to go into criminal defense work or criminal justice work.

474
00:21:03.691 --> 00:21:07.950
It is an important case and I think it requires us to say something.

475
00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:08.941
Uh,

476
00:21:08.941 --> 00:21:12.570
and you'll hear a lot more about that from Steve and you'll certainly see that

477
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.240
in the kind of career that he is created.

478
00:21:15.241 --> 00:21:20.241
But I think of this case and I think of this area of the law as a critically

479
00:21:20.761 --> 00:21:24.810
important area because it says something not only about the port and about what

480
00:21:24.811 --> 00:21:25.381
law could do,

481
00:21:25.381 --> 00:21:29.580
but it says something about us and whether we will choose to be the kind of

482
00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:33.170
people who stand with others just sitting and the kind of people who have speak,

483
00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.220
but others are quiet.

484
00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:39.330
The kind of people who are rallying against the institution of slavery that

485
00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:40.530
Fight Against Lynching,

486
00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.021
uh,

487
00:21:41.021 --> 00:21:44.070
that fight against segregation and that fight against,

488
00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:44.580
uh,

489
00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.413
tolerated,

490
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:46.110
uh,

491
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:49.320
acculturated racialize use of the death penalty.

492
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.700
And that's exciting part of the work that you're doing of the course that you're

493
00:21:53.701 --> 00:21:54.534
taking.

494
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:55.021
Uh,

495
00:21:55.021 --> 00:21:57.210
and I look forward to hearing more about it.

496
00:21:57.211 --> 00:21:59.010
I look forward to meeting some of you,

497
00:21:59.370 --> 00:21:59.911
uh,

498
00:21:59.911 --> 00:22:03.750
when you finish your time at Yale or when I get to Yale and I'm delighted to

499
00:22:03.751 --> 00:22:08.520
have a opportunity to share a few thoughts about this case and about the legacy

500
00:22:08.521 --> 00:22:09.600
that it represents.

501
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:11.220
A wish I could be there with you.

502
00:22:11.221 --> 00:22:11.521
Again,

503
00:22:11.521 --> 00:22:13.230
I'm sorry for my congested state,

504
00:22:13.231 --> 00:22:14.610
but I hope you all the best

505
00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.130
<v 2>and your continued studies.</v>

506
00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:16.700
Thanks.
