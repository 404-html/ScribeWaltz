1
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.970
Many people think that criminal cases,

2
00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:17.180
including death pony cases are won and lost,

3
00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:19.340
won or lost in the selection of the jury.

4
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.590
Today we'll talk about how a person goes from their home in the community,

5
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.840
gets that summons in the mail,

6
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.700
telling them they've got a report for jury duty and ends up being one of 12

7
00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:36.701
people sitting in a capital case deciding whether a person will live or die.

8
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.850
Uh,

9
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.331
actually,

10
00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:42.860
jury selection is not so much selection as it is excluding people,

11
00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:45.050
excluding people who can't be fair and impartial.

12
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.710
The parties exclude people with their peremptory strikes.

13
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.150
Uh,

14
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.851
and finally,

15
00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:51.920
when all the dust clears,

16
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:54.110
their 12 people left and usually two alternatives.

17
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.651
Uh,

18
00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:56.870
and those are the people who decide the case.

19
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.200
Let's look here quickly at how people go.

20
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.771
Uh,

21
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:01.371
as I said,

22
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:03.320
from their home to the jury,

23
00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:07.100
where there one of 12 people sitting in the jury box,

24
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.640
uh,

25
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.890
we start with whatever the political subdivision is.

26
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.660
And uh,

27
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.560
many jurisdictions,

28
00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:13.341
it's a county.

29
00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:14.001
In Louisiana,

30
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:15.860
it's a parish or maybe a district.

31
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.180
If it's federal court,

32
00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:20.120
it will be a United States federal district.

33
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.130
But those are divided into divisions.

34
00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:22.964
Usually.

35
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.391
Uh,

36
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:24.440
in some states,

37
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:29.441
a jury commission will make the determination that out of the people in that

38
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.291
county,

39
00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:31.124
let's say,

40
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.820
uh,

41
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.220
which ones will be included in the jury pool,

42
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.850
uh,

43
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:35.870
other places,

44
00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:38.090
it may be done just by computer.

45
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.900
Uh,

46
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.900
but not everybody who lives in the community will necessarily be in the jury

47
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:45.470
pool.

48
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.060
And this is what the litigation has been about with regard to whether or not

49
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.200
jury juries are,

50
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.960
are representative or whether there's been discrimination in the selection of

51
00:01:56.961 --> 00:01:57.794
the juries.

52
00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.221
Uh,

53
00:01:58.221 --> 00:02:00.590
there's no right to have a jury here,

54
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.510
the 12 people to decide the case.

55
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.280
No right to have a jury,

56
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.680
uh,

57
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.860
that reflects the composition of the community.

58
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.100
But the jury pool must represent roughly the composition of the jury.

59
00:02:12.921 --> 00:02:13.401
In other words,

60
00:02:13.401 --> 00:02:18.401
if the community is 25% African American and they're only 10% African American

61
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.960
Americans in the jury pool,

62
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.450
uh,

63
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.530
that's a 15% underrepresentation.

64
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.370
And that would be the basis for a challenge to the jury pool saying that it

65
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:32.360
needs to be reconstituted so that it better represents the entire community.

66
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.740
By the same token,

67
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:34.170
uh,

68
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.180
the jury pool,

69
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.721
uh,

70
00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:36.590
we look at race,

71
00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:37.424
ethnicity,

72
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.420
and also gender.

73
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:41.450
We would assume that jury pool and most communities are going to be about 50,

74
00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:43.070
50 men and women.

75
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.250
If we see the jury pool has only 30% women,

76
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.940
uh,

77
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.110
then there's obviously a problem with that and there are two legal basis for

78
00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:51.944
challenging it.

79
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.260
One that has been discrimination,

80
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:58.730
a violation of the equal protection clause in excluding that group,

81
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.780
either by race or by gender.

82
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.290
Uh,

83
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.130
secondly,

84
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.671
uh,

85
00:03:02.671 --> 00:03:07.050
that there's been a denial of the sixth amendment guarantee of the fair cross

86
00:03:07.051 --> 00:03:08.190
section of the community.

87
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.870
And either way,

88
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.570
uh,

89
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.820
a court will look at what the composition has been over some period of time,

90
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.331
uh,

91
00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:17.460
how the selection process works.

92
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.900
Uh,

93
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.590
how subjective it is a,

94
00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:22.650
whether there's some explanation for the disparity,

95
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.730
but otherwise,

96
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.480
uh,

97
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.120
the,

98
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.410
uh,

99
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.500
jury will have to be reconstituted so that it more fairly,

100
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.890
uh,

101
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.410
reflects the community out of the jury pool.

102
00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:35.490
A number of people will be summoned to the courthouse for trials.

103
00:03:35.491 --> 00:03:38.400
They'll get a summons in the mail telling him to come to court.

104
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.271
Uh,

105
00:03:39.271 --> 00:03:41.950
and then once they get to the courthouse,

106
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.040
they'll usually go to a jury assembly room,

107
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.400
unless it's a very small community where they may go straight to the courtroom

108
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.630
and a group of people will be called what we call the veneer.

109
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.950
A group of people will be called to the courtroom for questioning.

110
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.310
And this is the start of the jury selection process.

111
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.540
The first thing is why they're the questioning of the jurors,

112
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.560
uh,

113
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.230
which may be by the judge maybe by the parties,

114
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.100
uh,

115
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.470
but as that questioning has gone on,

116
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.460
or at the end of it,

117
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.151
uh,

118
00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:17.151
each party will be able to strike a certain number of jurors for cause that is

119
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.583
a,

120
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.590
<v 2>okay,</v>

121
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.681
<v 1>oh,</v>

122
00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:20.371
I screwed that up.

123
00:04:20.371 --> 00:04:21.204
Let me back up on,

124
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.753
<v 2>okay.</v>

125
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.600
<v 1>The people call to the courtroom,</v>

126
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.351
uh,

127
00:04:34.351 --> 00:04:34.981
we call this the,

128
00:04:34.981 --> 00:04:35.401
the near,

129
00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:37.530
these are the people that are going to be summons to the courtroom.

130
00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:39.630
And now we're going to be questioning question.

131
00:04:39.631 --> 00:04:41.880
This is what the jury process involves,

132
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.990
what we call for deer,

133
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.460
the questioning of the jurors.

134
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.440
And while the jurors are being questioned,

135
00:04:46.441 --> 00:04:50.010
one of the things the parties and the court will be looking for is whether

136
00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:54.060
there's any reason the juror can't be fair and impartial and the judge can

137
00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:56.280
strike any juror for cause.

138
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.180
Uh,

139
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.020
if they can't,

140
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.540
if that juror cannot be fair and impartial,

141
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.500
uh,

142
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.333
ultimately,

143
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.180
uh,

144
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.090
each side will exercise peremptory strikes,

145
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.070
which we'll talk about another time.

146
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.551
Uh,

147
00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:10.800
each side will have a certain number of strikes,

148
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.300
a established,

149
00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:14.190
usually by a state statute or rule.

150
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.911
Uh,

151
00:05:14.911 --> 00:05:15.744
and once,

152
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.380
uh,

153
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.820
they strike down.

154
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.780
We'll have usually a jury of 12 jurors and two alternates.

155
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.570
If the case is expected to last a really long time,

156
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.970
uh,

157
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.400
there may be four alternatives.

158
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.870
The alternatives of course would substitute for the jurors if for some reason a

159
00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:33.090
juror had a family emergency or,

160
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.880
uh,

161
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.230
I had a personal emergency or something like that and had to be replaced.

162
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.453
Uh,

163
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.200
the questioning of jurors,

164
00:05:40.201 --> 00:05:41.820
that method is decided,

165
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.360
uh,

166
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.680
pretty much by the judge.

167
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.820
Uh,

168
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.090
and also to some extent by statute or rule.

169
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.811
Uh,

170
00:05:48.811 --> 00:05:51.600
it differs from questioning each teacher individually.

171
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.170
Uh,

172
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.220
that is in Texas.

173
00:05:53.221 --> 00:05:55.440
A jury may take a jury selection,

174
00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:59.060
may take a long time while each juror is brought in,

175
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.050
one at a time,

176
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.660
ask questions by the prosecution,

177
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.740
by the defense.

178
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.400
Uh,

179
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.750
and then another jurors is brought in.

180
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:08.150
You can imagine that takes some period of time,

181
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.840
uh,

182
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.430
in other judges will conduct the jury selection and panels.

183
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:14.030
That is,

184
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.900
they'll bring a group of 12 or 13 people or 15 in at one time.

185
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.970
And just those people will be questioned.

186
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.090
And some of the questions will be group questions to everyone.

187
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:23.420
Like,

188
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.620
raise your hand if you know someone involved in this case.

189
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.281
Uh,

190
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:30.830
and some will be individual cases like Mr. Smith.

191
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:32.810
I see here on your jury questionnaire,

192
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.431
uh,

193
00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:34.940
that you work at a certain place.

194
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:35.770
Would that,

195
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:36.140
uh,

196
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.290
in any way come into play if you were chosen as a juror.

197
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.380
So,

198
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.850
uh,

199
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.140
that's another way to do it.

200
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:43.580
And then a third way is often,

201
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.770
and this is particularly true in federal courts,

202
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.420
all the jurors maybe question in one huge group.

203
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:50.991
In other words,

204
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:53.510
the court room is full of prospective jurors.

205
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:54.583
And,

206
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.921
uh,

207
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:58.910
whether the questioning is done by the judge or by the lawyers is again,

208
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:01.370
often differs from judge to judge in court.

209
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:02.204
The court,

210
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.660
uh,

211
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.010
in many federal courts,

212
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:06.650
the judge will conduct the jury selection,

213
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:08.990
which will only take a very short period of time.

214
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.530
Uh,

215
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.570
the judge will tell the jurors about the case,

216
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.780
ask them if there's any reason they can't be fair and impartial,

217
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.460
ask a few other questions.

218
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:16.941
Uh,

219
00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:19.430
the jurors are to respond by raising their hand.

220
00:07:19.431 --> 00:07:21.350
If the answer is yes to those questions,

221
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.750
but most people won't say anything.

222
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.600
And so the actual striking of the jury,

223
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.050
uh,

224
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.910
will take place without either side knowing very much about those jurors.

225
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:34.310
If we're in a place that has a large population,

226
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:35.061
of course,

227
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:37.010
if we're in a small jurisdiction,

228
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:37.910
uh,

229
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.890
it may very well be that everybody knows everybody,

230
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:40.491
uh,

231
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:44.090
that the prosecutor through the sheriff's Deputies and other people,

232
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.480
uh,

233
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.280
knows,

234
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:45.800
uh,

235
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.980
about all the jurors if not notice them.

236
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:48.741
In fact,

237
00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:49.760
and by the same token,

238
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:52.310
the defense may very well know the people.

239
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.540
The other point I'd make here is that what the jury is going to look like,

240
00:07:56.541 --> 00:08:01.541
it's going to depend very much upon the county or the parish from which the jury

241
00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:03.074
is chosen.

242
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:03.741
Uh,

243
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:08.360
if you have a white flight suburban community that is a community in which

244
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.730
they're almost no people of color,

245
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.310
95% white population,

246
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.990
then the jurors who are some of the courtroom are probably going to be about 95%

247
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:18.973
white.

248
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.311
Uh,

249
00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:22.790
and so the likelihood that they're going to be any people of color on that jury

250
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.170
is,

251
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.590
is pretty slim.

252
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.611
On the other hand,

253
00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:27.320
if you're in a more diverse community,

254
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.011
uh,

255
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:31.460
where a third of the population is African American,

256
00:08:31.461 --> 00:08:36.461
then you should see that reflected in the g in the jurors who are summoned to

257
00:08:37.281 --> 00:08:38.114
court.

258
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.073
Um,

259
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:44.350
and then the question for strikes for cause it's basically can juror be fair and

260
00:08:45.321 --> 00:08:47.630
impartial on any subject?

261
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.660
I'm going to talk about the three that come up the most.

262
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.261
Uh,

263
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:53.690
but there can be others as well.

264
00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:55.530
Has the juror heard about the case?

265
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:59.910
In a lot of cases where there's been a lot of media attention to the case,

266
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:01.770
a lot of social media attention,

267
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.680
a lot of talking about the case in small communities.

268
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:05.251
Uh,

269
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:07.680
one of the concerns is going to be,

270
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.673
uh,

271
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.160
to the jurors already had their minds made up,

272
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:11.730
uh,

273
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.880
because of what they've read or what they've seen about the case.

274
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:15.570
Uh,

275
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.440
secondly,

276
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.700
less often asked,

277
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:22.590
but I want to be sure to touch on it is racial bias to the jurors have any

278
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:25.860
racial prejudice which might come into play,

279
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.060
particularly if it's white jurors and they're sitting on an interracial crime.

280
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.750
Supreme Court has recognized the right to ask questions about that.

281
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.190
And then third,

282
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:35.700
uh,

283
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.950
what are the jurors attitudes on the death penalty?

284
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.730
Uh,

285
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:43.110
because it may be that some people either feel so strongly in favor of the

286
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:43.381
death,

287
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:44.214
Polly,

288
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:44.671
uh,

289
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:48.990
that they can't be fair and impartial or there may be and probably will be more

290
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:49.730
people,

291
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:50.190
uh,

292
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.480
who for religious conscientious or other reasons are opposed to the death Polly

293
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.380
and wouldn't consider the death pony any under any circumstances.

294
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:59.041
Uh,

295
00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:00.060
those people,

296
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:00.930
uh,

297
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.850
will probably be excluded unless they're able to put those fears aside.

298
00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.860
Same thing with pretrial publicity.

299
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.150
The question will be,

300
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:10.230
you've heard about the case,

301
00:10:10.231 --> 00:10:12.030
you've read about it and maybe you've talked about it,

302
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.950
but can you put that aside and decided the case just on the evidence that you

303
00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:17.784
hear in court.

304
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.073
Um,

305
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.220
and then once those strikes a,

306
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.780
once the court has decided who struck for cause,

307
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.291
uh,

308
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:30.291
each side exercises a certain number of peremptory strikes the prosecution and

309
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:31.464
the defense,

310
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.831
uh,

311
00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:32.880
for a long time,

312
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.450
uh,

313
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.480
you could exercise a preemptive strike for any reason and you didn't have to

314
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:37.140
give a reason.

315
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.100
The parties did not.

316
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:38.671
Uh,

317
00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:39.504
but now,

318
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:40.270
uh,

319
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.110
a party cannot strike based on race or gender,

320
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:43.711
uh,

321
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:47.670
unless there is a race or gender neutral reason for it.

322
00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.040
And we'll talk more about that in another segment.

323
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:50.490
Uh,

324
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.180
but whether that works or not is certainly subject to debate.

325
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:55.171
And again,

326
00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:56.480
the method of,

327
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.830
of,

328
00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:57.071
of,

329
00:10:57.071 --> 00:11:00.750
of striking jurors may vary a judge by judge court,

330
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:05.460
by court and courts where the jurors are examined one at a time.

331
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:10.350
It may be that right after each juror is questioned a party exercise of

332
00:11:10.351 --> 00:11:11.184
peremptory strike.

333
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:11.911
Of course,

334
00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:15.420
it's hard to do that because you don't know what all the other jurors look like.

335
00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:16.201
Uh,

336
00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:18.900
in courts that question,

337
00:11:18.901 --> 00:11:19.950
people in panels,

338
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.230
it may be that after each panel,

339
00:11:22.231 --> 00:11:23.880
let's say 12 is questioned,

340
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.140
each side goes in chambers with the judge out of the presence of the jury.

341
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.990
And each side makes its motions to strike for cause.

342
00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:34.710
I don't think that person can be fair because of what they read about the case,

343
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.780
the judge grants or denies,

344
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:41.340
then the judge may call upon the parties to exercise their peremptory strikes.

345
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:42.151
In other words,

346
00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:43.800
each side may have 10 strikes.

347
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.920
And so right then the judgment call upon a party saying,

348
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:48.023
uh,

349
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.010
the you accept these people or,

350
00:11:50.011 --> 00:11:53.560
or do you strike or a what is at least,

351
00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:54.550
uh,

352
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.780
often done and majors dictions issue qualify the number of people you need to

353
00:11:58.781 --> 00:11:59.650
choose the jury.

354
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:00.341
Uh,

355
00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:01.061
so for example,

356
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:04.810
if each side had 10 strikes plus two strikes for an alternate,

357
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:05.381
uh,

358
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:10.381
you'd qualify 38 people and then each side would exercise 12 strikes.

359
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.530
And that will leave you with a jury of 12 and two alternates.

360
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:15.730
So all of these,

361
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:16.840
uh,

362
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.150
methods of jury selection differ.

363
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.090
When other thing I should say is that very often,

364
00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:24.250
not only is that the questioning of the jurors,

365
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.810
but judges,

366
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.381
uh,

367
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:28.480
often allow a jury questionnaire,

368
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:29.110
uh,

369
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:30.130
to be circulated.

370
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.310
Some jury questionnaires,

371
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.051
a very extensive,

372
00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:33.850
they may go on for 15 or 20 pages.

373
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.890
Some jury questionnaires may be two pages.

374
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.750
So again,

375
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.280
the discretion of the judge,

376
00:12:39.281 --> 00:12:42.070
how the judge allows this process to take place.

377
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:42.770
Uh,

378
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:47.770
and some jury selection process is very elaborate with long questionnaires,

379
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.670
individual questioning of jurors in other places.

380
00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:55.480
And this is in capital cases as well as non capital cases.

381
00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:55.900
Uh,

382
00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.220
the jury selection may be very perfunctory as it was in the [inaudible] case,

383
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.690
which we will,

384
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.141
we'll,

385
00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:03.040
we'll talk about,

386
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:03.970
uh,

387
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.260
because the question comes,

388
00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:05.800
uh,

389
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.121
what,

390
00:13:06.121 --> 00:13:07.060
what can you ask,

391
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.920
what can a party,

392
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:14.520
let's say a person represented representing men and his case in Virginia?

393
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.210
Uh,

394
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.860
what can you ask the jurors?

395
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:18.520
Uh,

396
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.290
he was,

397
00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:19.690
uh,

398
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:24.070
accused of a murder a while he was in a prison work crew.

399
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.000
Uh,

400
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.890
47 newspaper articles.

401
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:27.490
Uh,

402
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.970
not only did they tell about the murderer who was accused hub and an earlier

403
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:35.740
murder he had been involved in also told about his confession.

404
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:36.310
Uh,

405
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.860
said he had been rejected for parole six times.

406
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.040
So the defense had some reason to be concerned that if people had read these

407
00:13:44.351 --> 00:13:45.040
things,

408
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.140
they might not be fair and impartial.

409
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:51.100
They might already think that he's guilty of the crime because they've got a lot

410
00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:51.934
of publicity.

411
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:52.390
Uh,

412
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:57.390
the first thing a lawyer does in that situation for a person facing the death,

413
00:13:57.551 --> 00:13:59.110
plenty is moved for a change of venue,

414
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.690
move the case to another county,

415
00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:02.410
uh,

416
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:06.760
where people haven't heard anything about the case and have a very,

417
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:07.721
you know,

418
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:11.290
don't bring any of this knowledge into the jury box.

419
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:13.360
Seldom is a change of venue.

420
00:14:13.361 --> 00:14:13.930
Granted,

421
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.490
partly with elected judges,

422
00:14:15.491 --> 00:14:16.690
it's a politically,

423
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.261
uh,

424
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:20.210
often not a good idea to move the,

425
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:20.690
the,

426
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:25.060
the trial out of the community where people want to decide both guilt and

427
00:14:25.061 --> 00:14:25.894
punishment.

428
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:26.530
Uh,

429
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.070
and what judges will often do is what happened in the movement in case the

430
00:14:30.071 --> 00:14:31.300
Virginia judge there said,

431
00:14:31.301 --> 00:14:31.511
well,

432
00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:35.020
we'll question the jurors and then we will see,

433
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:35.620
uh,

434
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.050
whether or not they can be fair and impartial if they can,

435
00:14:38.051 --> 00:14:39.370
we'll have the trial here.

436
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:39.970
Uh,

437
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:40.751
if they can't,

438
00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:41.380
then we'll,

439
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.610
we'll change the venue.

440
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:43.660
Uh,

441
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.493
so,

442
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.393
uh,

443
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.160
once the change of venue was denied,

444
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.530
a moment wanted or his lawyers,

445
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:51.981
uh,

446
00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:56.981
wanted the judges to ask questions about what the jurors had seen about the case

447
00:14:57.921 --> 00:14:58.371
read,

448
00:14:58.371 --> 00:14:59.300
heard about the case,

449
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:00.680
so called content questions.

450
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:01.281
Of course,

451
00:15:01.281 --> 00:15:02.570
if you do that in a group,

452
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:03.621
it doesn't work.

453
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:05.330
Because if one person stands up and says,

454
00:15:05.331 --> 00:15:05.451
well,

455
00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:09.200
I heard he confessed to the crime and goes into some detail in describing it,

456
00:15:09.201 --> 00:15:11.120
then all the other jurors hear it.

457
00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:12.920
So you have to pretty much do that,

458
00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:13.570
uh,

459
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:14.540
one at a time.

460
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:15.110
Uh,

461
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.861
but in this case,

462
00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:20.861
the judge just simply question all the jurors as a group and would not ask about

463
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:24.490
what they had read or heard,

464
00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:25.550
just simply as,

465
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.230
can you keep an open mind?

466
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.170
Can you wait until the case is presented?

467
00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:30.920
Uh,

468
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.070
before reaching a decision about guilt or innocence.

469
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.911
Uh,

470
00:15:34.911 --> 00:15:38.180
and so some people were struck when they answered those questions.

471
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:38.710
Uh,

472
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.050
and then each side struck six jurors,

473
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.760
14 people were seated,

474
00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:45.740
12 jurors and 12,

475
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:46.993
two alternates.

476
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.210
So moments case makes it all the way to the United States Supreme Court.

477
00:15:50.211 --> 00:15:55.211
On the question of did he have an adequate opportunity to get a fair jury

478
00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.400
because he wasn't allowed to ask these questions.

479
00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.331
Uh,

480
00:15:59.331 --> 00:16:00.021
and here,

481
00:16:00.021 --> 00:16:03.380
Justice Rehnquist rights for the court on a very close call,

482
00:16:03.381 --> 00:16:07.940
five to four opinion by the Supreme Court and says that the content questions

483
00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:10.520
are not constitutionally required.

484
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.330
He points out that if you had the content questions,

485
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:20.630
you'd have to ask each teacher individually and for this court,

486
00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:21.853
uh,

487
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.030
saving time,

488
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.770
what's most expeditious,

489
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.480
very important consideration.

490
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.201
Uh,

491
00:16:27.201 --> 00:16:27.951
and then secondly,

492
00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:32.750
the wide discretion that judges have and all of these areas that the judge has a

493
00:16:32.751 --> 00:16:36.050
lot of discretion in how to conduct a jury selection.

494
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.210
And if the judge wants to do it in a big group,

495
00:16:38.211 --> 00:16:39.044
they can,

496
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:39.380
uh,

497
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.310
but that the constitution at least doesn't reach this far.

498
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.240
And Sandra Day O'connor writes a concurring opinion.

499
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.330
She was the swing vote,

500
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:47.961
uh,

501
00:16:47.961 --> 00:16:48.830
in this case.

502
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:49.461
Uh,

503
00:16:49.461 --> 00:16:54.200
and she said it would have been helpful had the jurors answer these questions.

504
00:16:54.201 --> 00:16:56.180
It certainly would have been more,

505
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.170
uh,

506
00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.590
the judge would have been better able to make decisions about how fair and

507
00:17:00.591 --> 00:17:05.591
impartial jurors could be if the judge knew what the answers to the questions

508
00:17:05.811 --> 00:17:06.081
were,

509
00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:06.920
what they had read,

510
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.030
and what they had heard.

511
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:13.210
But she said the constitution doesn't require that the sixth amendment doesn't

512
00:17:13.371 --> 00:17:14.204
require that.

513
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.940
And here we see what we see from time to time.

514
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.751
The court says,

515
00:17:17.751 --> 00:17:20.420
here's what the constitutional floor is.

516
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.060
You at least got to do whatever.

517
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:24.950
But if a state wants to,

518
00:17:24.951 --> 00:17:26.930
if a judge wants to ask more questions,

519
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:28.250
justice O'Connor saying,

520
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:28.731
who'd be good?

521
00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:29.960
I did ask more questions,

522
00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.730
but it's not required by the constitution.

523
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:32.893
So she,

524
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.531
uh,

525
00:17:33.531 --> 00:17:34.910
is the fifth vote here,

526
00:17:34.911 --> 00:17:39.830
which now means that juries can be selected in any jurisdiction in sort of the

527
00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:42.230
very superficial way,

528
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:42.621
uh,

529
00:17:42.621 --> 00:17:43.850
that the jury was selected.

530
00:17:43.851 --> 00:17:44.684
In this case,

531
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.670
a Justice Marshall to sense.

532
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.440
He points out that the assurances of jurors,

533
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.801
this,

534
00:17:49.801 --> 00:17:53.760
this system basically lets the jurors decide whether they can be fair and

535
00:17:53.761 --> 00:17:58.761
impartial as opposed to a judge hearing everything a juror knows about a case,

536
00:17:59.131 --> 00:18:00.960
what opinions they may have formed,

537
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:04.200
what conversations they may have had with their spouse or their children,

538
00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:05.430
their neighbors.

539
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:06.061
Uh,

540
00:18:06.061 --> 00:18:09.690
and then the judge makes a decision that even though this person thinks he or

541
00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:11.940
she may be fair and impartial,

542
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.560
perhaps they know a little too much,

543
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.960
or perhaps they've set a little too much.

544
00:18:15.961 --> 00:18:16.501
If they've said,

545
00:18:16.501 --> 00:18:16.741
you know,

546
00:18:16.741 --> 00:18:17.790
they ought to hang that guy.

547
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:18.541
Uh,

548
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:22.110
if you knew that a judge might make a different decision,

549
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.500
if you just ask a person to on Moss,

550
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:29.520
raise your hand if you're not able to be fair and impartial.

551
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:29.970
Uh,

552
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.710
not many hands are going to be raised.

553
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.580
Uh,

554
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.391
Justice Kennedy,

555
00:18:33.391 --> 00:18:38.040
who's using the swing vote this time is a descending a writes a descending

556
00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:38.790
opinion.

557
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.211
Uh,

558
00:18:39.211 --> 00:18:40.050
and he said,

559
00:18:40.051 --> 00:18:45.051
you just can't rely upon silence by jurors to questions as to the whole group

560
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.693
and Mohs.

561
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:48.680
Uh,

562
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.070
so it's a close decision,

563
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:50.671
uh,

564
00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:52.320
but because of justice O'Connor's,

565
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:52.920
uh,

566
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.670
voting,

567
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:54.091
uh,

568
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:55.200
the way that she did,

569
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:55.771
uh,

570
00:18:55.771 --> 00:18:59.850
the court upholds moomins jury selection process.

571
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.043
Um,

572
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.260
what about the racial attitudes of the jurors?

573
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:04.950
Uh,

574
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.480
several cases important,

575
00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.170
uh,

576
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:07.711
to this.

577
00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:11.940
I want to just touch on a couple lightly and then we'll talk about Turner versus

578
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.850
Marie and Ham versus South Carolina.

579
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.870
Uh,

580
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:20.460
the defendant ham wanted to ask questions about race and what the jurors,

581
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.720
racial attitudes,

582
00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:25.770
where would you disregard his race if you were chosen as a juror?

583
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.520
And do you have any prejudice against black people?

584
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.331
Uh,

585
00:19:30.331 --> 00:19:31.920
and have you used the term black,

586
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:35.280
which at the time of this case in 1973,

587
00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:35.950
uh,

588
00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.680
had not been used as much as of course,

589
00:19:37.681 --> 00:19:38.514
it has been,

590
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:38.850
uh,

591
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:39.750
since that time,

592
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.740
uh,

593
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.700
the judge would not allow those questions and the Supreme Court held that that

594
00:19:44.701 --> 00:19:47.520
was air and that ham was entitled to a new trial.

595
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.520
But it was because of the facts of the case.

596
00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:53.190
Justice Rehnquist writes the opinion and he says,

597
00:19:53.191 --> 00:19:54.090
in this case,

598
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:54.901
Hams,

599
00:19:54.901 --> 00:19:59.520
whole defense was that he was being prosecuted because he was active in the

600
00:19:59.521 --> 00:20:01.890
civil rights movement and he was,

601
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:02.671
uh,

602
00:20:02.671 --> 00:20:05.370
the law enforcement agencies were out to get him,

603
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:05.970
uh,

604
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.950
because of his civil rights activities.

605
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.070
So issues of civil rights,

606
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:11.940
race,

607
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.130
we're front and center in this case.

608
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.090
And in this case,

609
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:19.920
he had a right under the due process clause to ask the court to ask the jurors

610
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.170
about their racial attitudes.

611
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.401
But then the court,

612
00:20:23.401 --> 00:20:24.151
in another case,

613
00:20:24.151 --> 00:20:25.380
just a few years later,

614
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.060
Christando versus Ross,

615
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:27.840
uh,

616
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.810
decides that that's not required in a case,

617
00:20:30.811 --> 00:20:34.590
even though it was a case involving three African Americans charged with the

618
00:20:34.591 --> 00:20:36.030
murder of a white person.

619
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.841
Uh,

620
00:20:36.841 --> 00:20:41.841
the court said because race wasn't inextricably tied up in the case.

621
00:20:42.031 --> 00:20:42.391
In fact,

622
00:20:42.391 --> 00:20:43.860
the case was not about race,

623
00:20:43.861 --> 00:20:45.340
it was just a,

624
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:46.230
a crime,

625
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.390
but it was black on white,

626
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:48.071
excuse me,

627
00:20:48.071 --> 00:20:48.761
black on white,

628
00:20:48.761 --> 00:20:50.170
that the defendants are black.

629
00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:50.740
Uh,

630
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.730
the victim was white.

631
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:52.421
Uh,

632
00:20:52.421 --> 00:20:55.540
the Supreme Court had earlier said way back in 1931,

633
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.820
a in the Aldridge case,

634
00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:58.510
uh,

635
00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:03.510
the corn had said in response to some justices saying it'd be too much trouble

636
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:05.230
to ask these questions.

637
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:05.790
Uh,

638
00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:09.910
the majority of the court had said it would be better to take the time to ask

639
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:14.470
these questions then had people speculate about how much race may have played a

640
00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:16.030
role in the decision.

641
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:16.721
Well,

642
00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:21.460
the court in Roe Stano decides that that's not a constitutional rule.

643
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.990
That's just a rule that the court adopted for lower federal courts as in it's

644
00:21:25.991 --> 00:21:28.960
supervisory power over lower courts.

645
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.970
And so hell that,

646
00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:31.983
uh,

647
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.120
the race questions weren't required,

648
00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:34.660
uh,

649
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.351
in this case.

650
00:21:35.351 --> 00:21:35.471
Now,

651
00:21:35.471 --> 00:21:39.400
that doesn't mean that a trial judge might not ask those questions.

652
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:40.210
Uh,

653
00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.420
but the court is saying they're not constitutionally required.

654
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.900
And then Willy Lloyd Turner's case comes along.

655
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:47.850
Uh,

656
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:48.880
this is a case again,

657
00:21:48.881 --> 00:21:49.710
out of Virginia.

658
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.550
Murray was the warden or theirs.

659
00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.770
It's the prison where Turner was held.

660
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:59.050
And Willie Lloyd Turner brought his case up on the grounds that the jurors in

661
00:21:59.051 --> 00:21:59.861
his trial,

662
00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:04.090
he had wanted to ask questions about their racial attitudes and wasn't allowed

663
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:04.750
to,

664
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:05.021
uh,

665
00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:10.021
hear the Supreme Court says the questioning was required in Turner's case

666
00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.010
because of it being an interracial case.

667
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.090
And secondly,

668
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.470
being a capital case,

669
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:18.161
uh,

670
00:22:18.161 --> 00:22:23.161
the court pointed out the discretion that jurors have in capital sentencing that

671
00:22:24.041 --> 00:22:24.641
basically,

672
00:22:24.641 --> 00:22:29.641
unlike deciding whether a person meets the four elements of a crime,

673
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.760
uh,

674
00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.800
there's a great deal of discretion,

675
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:33.730
uh,

676
00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:35.830
in how jurors view mitigating evidence,

677
00:22:35.831 --> 00:22:36.790
aggravating evidence,

678
00:22:36.791 --> 00:22:37.900
victim impact evidence,

679
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.660
and make decisions in death penalty cases.

680
00:22:40.661 --> 00:22:41.890
So there's a lot of discretion.

681
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.210
And then secondly,

682
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.230
uh,

683
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.310
jurors might,

684
00:22:45.311 --> 00:22:50.311
in exercising that discretion be influenced by their racial attitudes and

685
00:22:50.591 --> 00:22:53.020
according to even suggest that the jurors might be,

686
00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:53.800
uh,

687
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.550
affected by their unconscious racial attitudes.

688
00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.840
This is quite a,

689
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.080
a remarkable recognition on the part of the court because almost all the court

690
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:09.451
cases about race discrimination is about intentional race discrimination.

691
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:11.141
Here.

692
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:14.950
The court is not saying these jurors would intentionally discriminate,

693
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.680
but they're saying they may have attitudes,

694
00:23:17.681 --> 00:23:19.060
they may have stereotypes,

695
00:23:19.061 --> 00:23:20.800
they may be afraid of black people.

696
00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:21.250
Uh,

697
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:26.110
they may have subtle biases that they don't even realize they have themselves.

698
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:26.831
Uh,

699
00:23:26.831 --> 00:23:30.580
and there's some chance that they would come into play.

700
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:34.330
So the court holds that had violated a Turner's,

701
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:39.430
a right to an impartial jury because of the unacceptable risk.

702
00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.830
Not that racial bias was proven,

703
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.850
but the failure to ask the questions resulted in an unacceptable risk.

704
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:49.610
That race might play away,

705
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:49.970
uh,

706
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:50.960
play a role.

707
00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:56.320
But the remedy the court gives us almost completely inadequate to do deal with

708
00:23:56.821 --> 00:23:59.090
the problem of unconscious discrimination.

709
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.781
Uh,

710
00:23:59.781 --> 00:24:02.150
the court says the judge has the discretion,

711
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:06.380
the jurors can be questioned individually or they can be questioned as a group.

712
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:07.161
Uh,

713
00:24:07.161 --> 00:24:10.430
all they have to be told is that this is an interracial crime.

714
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:11.661
As you can see,

715
00:24:11.661 --> 00:24:12.500
ladies and gentlemen,

716
00:24:12.501 --> 00:24:14.420
the gentleman sitting at counsel table,

717
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.010
it's an African American.

718
00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:16.660
Uh,

719
00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.540
I'm telling you that the victim in this case was white or Caucasian.

720
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:21.440
Uh,

721
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:26.180
would any of you have any racial bias that would come into play if you were

722
00:24:26.181 --> 00:24:27.620
chosen to sit on this case?

723
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.580
Of course,

724
00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:32.210
almost no one is going to raise their hand and answer to that question.

725
00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:33.493
So,

726
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:34.290
uh,

727
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.260
the courts can do very little,

728
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:36.741
uh,

729
00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:37.910
in response to Turner.

730
00:24:37.911 --> 00:24:38.271
Also,

731
00:24:38.271 --> 00:24:41.900
these questions are asked only if the defense lawyer asks for them.

732
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:42.741
Uh,

733
00:24:42.741 --> 00:24:43.574
otherwise,

734
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:44.533
uh,

735
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:45.423
it's waived.

736
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:50.570
But some courts will grant questioning and we'll grind questioning individually

737
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:54.950
of jurors about racial attitudes in which there are opportunities to really

738
00:24:54.951 --> 00:24:58.220
engage jurors about congress in conversations about race.

739
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.190
What do they think of the segregated schools,

740
00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:02.150
the all white,

741
00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:02.660
uh,

742
00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.330
segregation academy and do they send their children there?

743
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:06.190
Uh,

744
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:09.920
what do they think about whatever the racial attitudes in the community are?

745
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:10.730
Uh,

746
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.720
do they think that the defendant has anything to worry about,

747
00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:15.441
uh,

748
00:25:15.441 --> 00:25:18.110
with regard to race in this community?

749
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.520
Not what they personally think.

750
00:25:19.521 --> 00:25:22.490
But in the community it's possible to have a conversation.

751
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.230
And out of that conversation,

752
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:29.000
the lawyers can get some sense of what the jurors attitudes are with regard to

753
00:25:29.001 --> 00:25:29.720
rates.

754
00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.021
Uh,

755
00:25:30.021 --> 00:25:31.940
some jurors will be fairly open about it.

756
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:32.690
Uh,

757
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:34.280
some jurors will be very,

758
00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:35.383
uh,

759
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:36.460
closed and,

760
00:25:36.461 --> 00:25:36.791
and,

761
00:25:36.791 --> 00:25:37.150
and,

762
00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:37.370
uh,

763
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:39.080
almost unwilling to talk about it.

764
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.561
Uh,

765
00:25:39.561 --> 00:25:41.150
those things tell lawyers things,

766
00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:41.670
uh,

767
00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.660
that they may use when they make strikes of the jurors.

768
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.110
Uh,

769
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.150
later on in Turner's case,

770
00:25:47.151 --> 00:25:49.700
the Supreme Court upheld his conviction,

771
00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:50.301
uh,

772
00:25:50.301 --> 00:25:51.710
but set aside his death sentence.

773
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.330
So the case was sent back,

774
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.720
uh,

775
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.760
just simply for a trial and sentence.

776
00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:56.661
As it turned out,

777
00:25:56.661 --> 00:25:59.150
Turner was as to death even,

778
00:25:59.370 --> 00:25:59.600
uh,

779
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.200
when the questions were asked at his second trial and he was ultimately put to

780
00:26:03.201 --> 00:26:04.520
death by the state of Virginia.

781
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.923
Um,

782
00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.530
the next question is the jurors attitudes on the death penalty.

783
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:10.640
Uh,

784
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.600
this is usually something depending upon the community.

785
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.840
It's going to take a lot of time during jury selection.

786
00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.750
I've been in communities where when you ask the question,

787
00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.670
is anybody opposed to the death poly?

788
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.420
Uh,

789
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.610
not a single person says a word.

790
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.100
So there's no questioning to be done there,

791
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:29.300
at least on that part of it.

792
00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.021
Uh,

793
00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:31.160
but in many communities,

794
00:26:31.161 --> 00:26:36.161
there will be a number of people who will have some religious or other scruples

795
00:26:36.441 --> 00:26:37.460
against the death penalty.

796
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:42.770
But for the Witherspoon case was decided with a spoon versus Illinois in 1968.

797
00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:43.441
Of course,

798
00:26:43.441 --> 00:26:46.080
we're just simply ask people raise their hand if they were opposed to the death

799
00:26:46.081 --> 00:26:47.310
poly and they would excuse them.

800
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:48.241
Uh,

801
00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:49.410
but the Supreme Court,

802
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.220
uh,

803
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.240
decided that,

804
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.170
uh,

805
00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:53.340
it shouldn't be that easy.

806
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:54.181
Uh,

807
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:54.841
and that,

808
00:26:54.841 --> 00:26:58.170
that was excluding too many people in the community for jury service.

809
00:26:58.171 --> 00:26:58.830
So,

810
00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:59.100
uh,

811
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.110
they said two things set them both in footnotes.

812
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:01.771
Uh,

813
00:27:01.771 --> 00:27:02.371
in this case,

814
00:27:02.371 --> 00:27:04.920
the footnotes are more important than the written opinion.

815
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:05.700
Uh,

816
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.690
the courts said they,

817
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:11.750
that a jerk can't be excluded unless that juror states unambiguously that he or

818
00:27:13.111 --> 00:27:14.580
she would automatically,

819
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:18.420
these became the critical words in jury selection for many years,

820
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.470
that the person would automatically vote against the death penalty.

821
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:23.460
Uh,

822
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:28.320
or if the jurors didn't make it unmistakably clear.

823
00:27:28.321 --> 00:27:32.280
And what this meant was when an appellate court reviewed the case,

824
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:36.780
when the State Supreme Court or a federal court on a Habeas Corpus reviewed the

825
00:27:36.781 --> 00:27:37.380
case,

826
00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:42.380
it had to be unmistakably clear in the transcript of the jury selection that the

827
00:27:43.981 --> 00:27:47.190
juror would automatically vote against the death penalty.

828
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:51.720
So what this meant is there wasn't the usual deference to trial judges.

829
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.350
And so for many years after the Witherspoon case was decided,

830
00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:58.830
a lot of death penalty cases were set aside,

831
00:27:59.130 --> 00:27:59.490
uh,

832
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:00.420
based upon,

833
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.140
uh,

834
00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:01.711
people's,

835
00:28:01.711 --> 00:28:01.951
uh,

836
00:28:01.951 --> 00:28:06.951
answers to the questions about whether they could decide death pony cases or

837
00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:08.244
not.

838
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:08.790
Uh,

839
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:13.790
Weatherspoon was decided two years after the Gallup poll has shown that for the

840
00:28:14.311 --> 00:28:16.680
only time in the history of the United States,

841
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.420
more people were opposed to the death penalty than for it.

842
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.980
47% opposed 42% in favor.

843
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:23.580
Uh,

844
00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:24.450
since that time,

845
00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:24.931
uh,

846
00:28:24.931 --> 00:28:28.140
support for the death penalty has gone up as high as 70%,

847
00:28:28.141 --> 00:28:31.740
and then receded back to something much lower than that.

848
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:32.310
Uh,

849
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.230
but you can see in the court's opinion,

850
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:34.950
uh,

851
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:37.830
how it sees that the death pony is,

852
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.030
as it says,

853
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:40.380
uh,

854
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.520
on the way out.

855
00:28:41.521 --> 00:28:43.380
Just as Stewart says,

856
00:28:43.381 --> 00:28:44.610
a death qualified jury.

857
00:28:44.611 --> 00:28:45.750
That is jurors who,

858
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.843
uh,

859
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.430
only made up of people who vote for the death.

860
00:28:50.431 --> 00:28:54.090
Pawnee can speak for only a distinct and dwindling minority.

861
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:54.961
Uh,

862
00:28:54.961 --> 00:28:58.770
the state has produced a jury that is uncommonly willing,

863
00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.640
uh,

864
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.360
to,

865
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:00.630
uh,

866
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.460
condemn a person to die,

867
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.390
uh,

868
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:06.090
and that Illinois has stacked the deck.

869
00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:06.923
This is very,

870
00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.580
a descending opinions don't like this language at all that Illinois has stacked

871
00:29:11.581 --> 00:29:16.290
the deck and given Mr Witherspoon a hanging jury.

872
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:16.921
Well,

873
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:17.820
justice is black.

874
00:29:17.821 --> 00:29:18.810
Harlan and white,

875
00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:19.620
uh,

876
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:20.453
are quite,

877
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:21.301
uh,

878
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:24.450
upset with that characterization of what's going on.

879
00:29:24.451 --> 00:29:25.170
After all,

880
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:29.130
this is the way capital jurors had been selected all the way up until the time

881
00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:29.590
Gr,

882
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.830
uh,

883
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:34.380
Wetherspoons jury was selected and actually until Wetherspoons case was before

884
00:29:34.381 --> 00:29:36.900
the Supreme Court in 1968,

885
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:42.230
but it had quite an effect on who could serve on capital juries and who could

886
00:29:42.341 --> 00:29:42.970
not.

887
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:43.720
And another,

888
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.720
unless it was unmistakably clear that the person would automatically vote

889
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:51.160
against the death pony.

890
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.701
In other words,

891
00:29:51.701 --> 00:29:52.131
that the person,

892
00:29:52.131 --> 00:29:52.451
you could say,

893
00:29:52.451 --> 00:29:55.720
I would consider death probably wouldn't consider it very long,

894
00:29:55.721 --> 00:29:56.680
but I would consider it.

895
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:59.110
It would be very hard to exclude that person.

896
00:29:59.470 --> 00:29:59.711
Well,

897
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:01.810
the Supreme Court started changing that,

898
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:02.711
uh,

899
00:30:02.711 --> 00:30:03.700
as a,

900
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:04.923
uh,

901
00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:11.680
soon as it could first in a case out of Texas in 1980 called Adam sources Texas.

902
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.320
But that case sorta did not really get noticed.

903
00:30:14.321 --> 00:30:17.250
The case that got noticed was Wainwright versus with a,

904
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:22.400
which was decided in 1985 and here the court did two things that are critically

905
00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:23.240
important.

906
00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.800
He changed the grounds for disqualification.

907
00:30:26.801 --> 00:30:31.030
It no longer was whether it was automatically vote against the death penalty.

908
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:36.330
It was whether a person's views about the death pony would prevent or

909
00:30:36.611 --> 00:30:41.611
substantially impair their ability to consider death as a punishment.

910
00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.500
So that was a difference there.

911
00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.610
The second difference,

912
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:46.750
even a bigger one,

913
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:52.170
the court replaced the requirement that the juror's ability to serve be

914
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.820
unmistakably clear and instead defers to the trial judge.

915
00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.140
In other words.

916
00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.160
Now,

917
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.420
instead of the appellate court,

918
00:31:01.421 --> 00:31:05.170
looking at the transcript of the jury selection in saying it's not unmistakably

919
00:31:05.171 --> 00:31:06.004
clear here,

920
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:10.930
that this juror cannot be fair and impartial because he or she will not consider

921
00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:12.460
the death penalty is a punishment.

922
00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:13.270
Uh,

923
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:18.270
now the court says once there's this back and forth between the maybe the judge

924
00:31:18.461 --> 00:31:19.120
and the juror,

925
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:19.871
the parties,

926
00:31:19.871 --> 00:31:21.640
the lawyers for each party and the jurors,

927
00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:23.500
the judge at the end of that time says,

928
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:27.730
I'm striking this juror because I don't think he or she can be fair and

929
00:31:27.731 --> 00:31:29.980
impartial because of their views on the death penalty.

930
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:30.971
Now,

931
00:31:30.971 --> 00:31:35.320
appellate courts are going to defer to what the trial judge's did.

932
00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:36.521
And not only that,

933
00:31:36.521 --> 00:31:40.180
they're going to assume that the trial judge knew what the law was and applied

934
00:31:40.181 --> 00:31:42.070
it correctly than in other words,

935
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:47.200
the trial judge knew what the law was and made a factual determination based on

936
00:31:47.201 --> 00:31:48.400
the demeanor of the juror,

937
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.170
how the jury answer the questions,

938
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:54.250
all sorts of atmospherics that are seeing there in the courtroom but may not be

939
00:31:54.251 --> 00:31:55.150
in an appellate record.

940
00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:58.390
So this was a great change in two regards.

941
00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:58.960
Uh,

942
00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.730
with regard to death qualification and once wit versus Wainwright was decided,

943
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:05.950
fewer and fewer cases,

944
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:06.500
more,

945
00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.060
more,

946
00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:07.570
uh,

947
00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:12.570
was it unlikely that a case would be reversed based upon some person sitting on

948
00:32:12.611 --> 00:32:13.444
the jury,

949
00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:14.230
uh,

950
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:15.790
or being excluded from the jury?

951
00:32:15.791 --> 00:32:17.790
That really is the issue that would go up as a,

952
00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:18.250
uh,

953
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:19.930
the defense would object to striking.

954
00:32:19.931 --> 00:32:21.100
The person in the state would say,

955
00:32:21.101 --> 00:32:24.850
I moved to strike this juror because she can't fairly consider the death Polly

956
00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.090
and the judge would grant that and that would be the issue on appeal.

957
00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:33.100
And that became less and less of an appellate issue once Wainwright versus what

958
00:32:33.101 --> 00:32:33.934
was decided,

959
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:34.661
uh,

960
00:32:34.661 --> 00:32:39.661
the court decided a couple of other points with regard to the death on jurors

961
00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:41.840
are what jurors could be as,

962
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:42.733
uh,

963
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:48.310
to lower federal courts had held that a desk qualification.

964
00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:49.520
Uh,

965
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:49.671
they,

966
00:32:49.671 --> 00:32:51.650
because you take off the jury,

967
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.070
all the people who are opposed to the death Pawnee or have scruples against it,

968
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:55.850
uh,

969
00:32:55.850 --> 00:33:00.850
that you have a jury that is prosecution prone and you obviously have a jury

970
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:02.960
that's more likely to give the death penalty.

971
00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.750
And those courts also had said that,

972
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:06.500
uh,

973
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.760
you don't have a fair cross section of the community when you've excluded that

974
00:33:10.761 --> 00:33:12.830
part of the community that opposes the death penalty.

975
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.311
Well,

976
00:33:13.311 --> 00:33:16.580
the Supreme Court reversed a case out of the eight circuit Lockhart versus

977
00:33:16.581 --> 00:33:18.440
McCree reverse both cases.

978
00:33:18.441 --> 00:33:20.180
The other case was out of the Fourth Circuit,

979
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:20.901
uh,

980
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:25.901
and said that death qualification does not deny a defendant a fair cross section

981
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.920
of the community.

982
00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:28.670
Uh,

983
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.940
the fair cross section applies only to the veneer,

984
00:33:31.941 --> 00:33:35.030
to the jury pool that we were talking about before.

985
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:35.820
Uh,

986
00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:36.040
it,

987
00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:36.460
it,

988
00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:36.880
and,

989
00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:37.081
and,

990
00:33:37.081 --> 00:33:37.970
and secondly,

991
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:38.750
uh,

992
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.850
when we're talking about a fair cross section,

993
00:33:40.851 --> 00:33:43.190
we're talking about the exclusion of race,

994
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:44.240
ethnicity,

995
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:45.253
gender,

996
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:45.740
uh,

997
00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.470
but not people's attitudes on an issue.

998
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:49.430
Uh,

999
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:50.210
so,

1000
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:50.480
uh,

1001
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.171
people with,

1002
00:33:51.171 --> 00:33:51.560
uh,

1003
00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.910
opposition to the death penalty,

1004
00:33:52.911 --> 00:33:54.110
the court said are not,

1005
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:54.770
uh,

1006
00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:55.850
a distinct group.

1007
00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:56.630
Uh,

1008
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:58.640
the court then went on to look at the fact that,

1009
00:33:58.641 --> 00:33:59.120
well,

1010
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.640
what about the fact that it's not a fair jury because it's so prosecution pro.

1011
00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:03.710
Uh,

1012
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:04.970
and the court said that,

1013
00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:06.470
uh,

1014
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:07.820
delve qualification was,

1015
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.920
was not such a,

1016
00:34:09.921 --> 00:34:11.510
that it denied a person,

1017
00:34:11.511 --> 00:34:12.350
a fair trial.

1018
00:34:12.351 --> 00:34:14.090
And that it would be so cumbersome,

1019
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:14.871
uh,

1020
00:34:14.871 --> 00:34:19.871
to select a jury try case and then qualify as the jurors about their attitudes

1021
00:34:20.361 --> 00:34:22.430
on the death pony and then try the penalty phase,

1022
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:23.300
uh,

1023
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.530
that it would be,

1024
00:34:24.531 --> 00:34:25.281
as the court said,

1025
00:34:25.281 --> 00:34:26.630
hopelessly impractical.

1026
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:28.430
So again,

1027
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.830
considerations of efficiency,

1028
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:31.431
uh,

1029
00:34:31.431 --> 00:34:32.630
administration,

1030
00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:32.811
uh,

1031
00:34:32.811 --> 00:34:33.890
judicial economy,

1032
00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:34.431
uh,

1033
00:34:34.431 --> 00:34:39.140
are the determining a considerations here with the court and it rejected those

1034
00:34:39.141 --> 00:34:40.370
claims and uh,

1035
00:34:40.371 --> 00:34:41.000
they,

1036
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.330
uh,

1037
00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:44.720
have not been heard since practicalities basically,

1038
00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:45.170
uh,

1039
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:48.170
triumphed over this claim,

1040
00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:48.620
uh,

1041
00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:53.390
that the jurors can be fair and we're very prosecution prone and very likely to

1042
00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:54.224
impose death.

1043
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:58.520
The other case it's important to mention is Morgan versus Illinois.

1044
00:34:58.940 --> 00:34:59.571
Here the case,

1045
00:34:59.571 --> 00:35:01.850
basically the court basically said,

1046
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:02.570
uh,

1047
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:07.570
that just as you can ask if a person is opposed to the death pony and therefore

1048
00:35:07.581 --> 00:35:09.890
will not consider imposing the death.

1049
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:10.530
Polly,

1050
00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:10.940
uh,

1051
00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:14.720
you can also ask people whether they are so in favor of the death penalty for

1052
00:35:14.721 --> 00:35:15.560
certain crimes,

1053
00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:16.310
uh,

1054
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:20.450
that they can consider a sentence of life imprisonment or life imprisonment

1055
00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:21.284
without parole.

1056
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.660
And there will be jurors who will be excluded.

1057
00:35:23.661 --> 00:35:25.070
There'll be jurors who say,

1058
00:35:25.071 --> 00:35:26.960
if it's a police officer killing case,

1059
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.441
see,

1060
00:35:27.441 --> 00:35:30.200
I think somebody that committed that crime should get the death pony.

1061
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.020
And I don't think any other punishment is enough.

1062
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:38.410
That person may be excluded for the same reason another person would be excluded

1063
00:35:38.461 --> 00:35:39.360
when that person said,

1064
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:41.250
I'm religiously opposed to the death.

1065
00:35:41.251 --> 00:35:41.910
Polly,

1066
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:42.241
uh,

1067
00:35:42.241 --> 00:35:43.830
I could consider life imprisonment,

1068
00:35:43.831 --> 00:35:46.170
but I could not ever vote for the death poem.

1069
00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:47.460
Uh,

1070
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.540
in some jurisdictions,

1071
00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:51.510
jurors have three choices and sometimes even more,

1072
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:52.440
uh,

1073
00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.280
death penalty,

1074
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.850
life imprisonment without parole and life imprisonment with parole.

1075
00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:58.980
And sometimes jurors will say,

1076
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:00.240
I could consider death.

1077
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.270
I could consider life imprisonment without parole,

1078
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:06.120
but I couldn't consider parole a sentence that would,

1079
00:36:06.121 --> 00:36:06.780
uh,

1080
00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.613
be,

1081
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:08.453
uh,

1082
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:12.210
parole eligible for this defendant given what he's accused of.

1083
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:15.690
And those people may be excluded for that reason,

1084
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:21.170
very much discretion on the part of the trial judge here and deciding how to

1085
00:36:22.141 --> 00:36:25.920
grant these motions to strike jurors.

1086
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:26.760
Uh,

1087
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.580
we get into the question of what does it mean to consider?

1088
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.510
Because the person who's religiously opposed to the death pony,

1089
00:36:33.511 --> 00:36:34.344
for example,

1090
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.260
will never consider the death penalty.

1091
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:39.540
That person is opposed to the death poem.

1092
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:42.240
Many African Americans are excluded,

1093
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:43.020
uh,

1094
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.620
during this death qualification process because they will say,

1095
00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:47.010
well,

1096
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:48.480
I'm opposed to the death poem.

1097
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:49.231
Uh,

1098
00:36:49.231 --> 00:36:53.400
it's been used to discriminate against black people throughout the history of

1099
00:36:53.401 --> 00:36:54.151
the United States.

1100
00:36:54.151 --> 00:36:54.351
And,

1101
00:36:54.351 --> 00:36:54.850
and I,

1102
00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:56.820
I think it should not be used anymore.

1103
00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:57.601
Uh,

1104
00:36:57.601 --> 00:37:00.240
and I would never vote to send anybody to death.

1105
00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:00.811
Well,

1106
00:37:00.811 --> 00:37:02.100
that person is excluded.

1107
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:04.410
But then you have the person who says,

1108
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.140
I strongly in favor of the death penalty.

1109
00:37:07.141 --> 00:37:10.380
I think the death penalty should be imposed in this kind of case.

1110
00:37:10.381 --> 00:37:13.770
I'm not sure any other punishment would really be adequate.

1111
00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:16.260
But the judge turns to the person and says,

1112
00:37:16.261 --> 00:37:16.411
well,

1113
00:37:16.411 --> 00:37:19.020
could you consider life without parole?

1114
00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:20.570
Yeah,

1115
00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.920
I could consider life without parole.

1116
00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:25.830
You have the sense that may be a rather fleeting consideration,

1117
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:30.450
but this person has no religious objections to life without parole.

1118
00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.480
The person just simply doesn't think it's a,

1119
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.260
it's a severe enough sentence,

1120
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:38.640
but the person who is against the death penalty may have religious or other

1121
00:37:38.641 --> 00:37:39.380
reasons,

1122
00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:39.600
uh,

1123
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.690
which would never allow them to vote for the death point.

1124
00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:47.850
So the result of this can often be that the jury is somewhat skewed with the

1125
00:37:47.851 --> 00:37:51.780
people who are opposed to the death pony all being excluded.

1126
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:55.260
And with many people who have strong views in favor of the death,

1127
00:37:55.261 --> 00:38:00.261
Polly a remaining on the jury because they say they can consider the alternative

1128
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.350
of life imprisonment without parole.

1129
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:05.910
But one final case,

1130
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.690
uh,

1131
00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:11.430
which takes us full circle on the death qualification and that Utec versus

1132
00:38:11.431 --> 00:38:12.140
Brown,

1133
00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:12.450
uh,

1134
00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:15.000
decided by the Supreme Court in 2007.

1135
00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.200
Uh,

1136
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:21.130
the juror here was identified only as jurors z in the court's opinion.

1137
00:38:21.131 --> 00:38:22.920
It was a referee basketball referee.

1138
00:38:22.921 --> 00:38:24.210
His brother was a police officer.

1139
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:26.040
So just based upon that,

1140
00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:26.670
uh,

1141
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:30.390
you would think that he might not be a bad jury.

1142
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.070
A juror for the prosecution.

1143
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:33.210
Uh,

1144
00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.010
here's what's interesting about,

1145
00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.330
at least in my view,

1146
00:38:36.331 --> 00:38:36.811
that case,

1147
00:38:36.811 --> 00:38:37.290
one,

1148
00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:38.220
he was not,

1149
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.930
he had no objections to the death.

1150
00:38:39.931 --> 00:38:40.650
Poland.

1151
00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:43.890
This was not like what we see often,

1152
00:38:43.891 --> 00:38:46.020
which is a juror takes the stand and judge says,

1153
00:38:46.021 --> 00:38:46.651
what's your opinion,

1154
00:38:46.651 --> 00:38:47.484
the death point and say,

1155
00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:49.050
I'm opposed to the death poem.

1156
00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.800
I have religious scruples against the death penalty.

1157
00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:53.520
A,

1158
00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.720
I can never impose.

1159
00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.430
This is Jared didn't impose the death pony,

1160
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.880
uh,

1161
00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.080
didn't oppose the death by,

1162
00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:58.710
uh,

1163
00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:00.660
he had no problem with it,

1164
00:39:00.661 --> 00:39:02.640
but he was asking very kind of broad question,

1165
00:39:02.641 --> 00:39:04.920
when would the death pony be appropriate?

1166
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:08.760
And he was very confused in his answers.

1167
00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:09.650
Uh,

1168
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:12.480
any worried about that the person might be released,

1169
00:39:12.481 --> 00:39:17.481
even though he was told more than once about life imprisonment without the

1170
00:39:17.701 --> 00:39:19.200
possibility of parole.

1171
00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:19.801
Uh,

1172
00:39:19.801 --> 00:39:20.091
he,

1173
00:39:20.091 --> 00:39:22.410
he seemed not to completely understand it,

1174
00:39:22.411 --> 00:39:23.430
but he repeated,

1175
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:24.450
uh,

1176
00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:26.310
I believe in the death penalty.

1177
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.620
Uh,

1178
00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.820
the judge granted the strike,

1179
00:39:29.821 --> 00:39:34.821
the prosecution moved to strike the Juror for cause said that this juror

1180
00:39:34.861 --> 00:39:36.960
couldn't be fair and impartial,

1181
00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:37.570
uh,

1182
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:39.630
because of his views about the death penalty.

1183
00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:40.321
Uh,

1184
00:39:40.321 --> 00:39:42.390
and that was upheld by the Supreme Court,

1185
00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:42.960
uh,

1186
00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:43.800
in this case.

1187
00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.470
So we've gone full circle from,

1188
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:47.220
uh,

1189
00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:52.220
Weatherspoon where a jury had to make it unmistakably clear that their views

1190
00:39:53.131 --> 00:39:58.131
about the death pony were so strong that they would automatically vote against

1191
00:39:58.501 --> 00:40:01.980
the death point every case to utech versus Brown,

1192
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:06.660
where the court says simply because the juror expresses some confusion,

1193
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:07.621
uh,

1194
00:40:07.621 --> 00:40:08.454
and doesn't,

1195
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:12.120
sometimes you see cases where the jerseys don't want to be involved in deciding

1196
00:40:12.121 --> 00:40:13.800
whether another person's going to live or die.

1197
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:14.820
Uh,

1198
00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.890
and the trial judge excludes that person,

1199
00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:17.460
uh,

1200
00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:18.660
that's going to be sustained.

1201
00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:19.440
Uh,

1202
00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.273
so,

1203
00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:20.760
uh,

1204
00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.760
now very much the question of who sits on the jury given their attitudes about

1205
00:40:26.251 --> 00:40:30.480
the death pony is very much up to the trial judge that tries that case in very

1206
00:40:30.481 --> 00:40:31.280
seldom,

1207
00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:31.591
uh,

1208
00:40:31.591 --> 00:40:34.080
is the trial judge's decision on that,

1209
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.500
uh,

1210
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:38.700
going to be reversed by an appellate court because the trogers there sees the

1211
00:40:38.701 --> 00:40:39.270
jury.

1212
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.730
This is going to be true in all of these areas.

1213
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.200
How we conduct the voir dire,

1214
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:44.550
what questions are asked,

1215
00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:48.600
and then the ultimate choice or decision that a trial judge makes in these

1216
00:40:48.601 --> 00:40:49.290
cases,

1217
00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:53.100
which is whether or not that juror can be fair and impartial,

1218
00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:54.000
uh,

1219
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.080
parties may appeal it,

1220
00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:58.560
but there's going to be a lot of discretion given to the judge in those

1221
00:40:58.561 --> 00:40:59.394
situations.

1222
00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:04.680
And so that concludes our discussion of just a very basic overview,

1223
00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:05.030
uh,

1224
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:08.490
of the jury selection process with regard to,

1225
00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.510
uh,

1226
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:13.110
questioning jurors and determining if they can be fair and impartial.

1227
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:13.770
Uh,

1228
00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:14.670
in another segment,

1229
00:41:14.671 --> 00:41:19.020
we'll turn to the use of the peremptory strikes in which the parties are able,

1230
00:41:19.021 --> 00:41:23.700
the prosecutor and the defense lawyer are able to strike people from jury

1231
00:41:23.701 --> 00:41:24.150
service.
