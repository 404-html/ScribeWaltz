00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.640
Gilbert king discusses Thurgood Marshall's defense of a capital case based on

2
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:20.250
his Pulitzer Prize winning book devil in the Grove,

3
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.630
Thurgood Marshall,

4
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.740
the Groveland boys and the dawn of a new America.

5
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.580
<v 2>This particular case started with a 17 year old girl named norm of pageant and</v>

6
00:00:33.611 --> 00:00:34.121
she was,

7
00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:34.954
um,

8
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.980
at the age of 16,

9
00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:40.981
she had already been married and separated from her husband and it was sort of

10
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.921
around town.

11
00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:44.770
The rumors were that Norma was being beaten by her husband and he was,

12
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.500
her husband was sort of a narrow dwell at the time.

13
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.693
And um,

14
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.500
he was about 22 years old and they tried to get back together,

15
00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:54.970
went out to a dance one night,

16
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.010
something happened in the car between them.

17
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.950
And the next thing you know,

18
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.350
she is on the side of a road claiming that she's been raped by four black men.

19
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.170
When word got out,

20
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.220
uh,

21
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.610
the clan rolled into town and all the locals just started burning down the black

22
00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:13.061
community.

23
00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:14.500
This is in Groveland,

24
00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:15.040
Florida,

25
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.150
1949.

26
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.320
So here you see three stellar members of the community,

27
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.573
uh,

28
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.760
prosecutor who is Jesse Hunter on the left.

29
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.390
Sheriff Willis Mccall in the center of the big hat man.

30
00:01:28.391 --> 00:01:30.490
They called him and his deputy James Yates.

31
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.640
And this was the family of a,

32
00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:36.070
one of the alleged rapist.

33
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.550
One of the,

34
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.810
one of the alleged rapist named sort of saw what was happening and he skipped

35
00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:46.420
town and sheriff McCall went up,

36
00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:47.830
got a posse of a thousand men.

37
00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:48.664
They shot him down,

38
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.660
um,

39
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.493
killed him.

40
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.310
Uh,

41
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.830
I think they said something like 400 bullets were in the body.

42
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.970
Unbelievable.

43
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.040
But these are the three Groveland boys.

44
00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.090
And uh,

45
00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.170
this case is a lot,

46
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.520
a lot like the Scottsboro boys.

47
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:01.630
It's just not as well known.

48
00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:02.351
And you know,

49
00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:02.801
it's funny,

50
00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:05.080
I went through a lot of readings and Marshall,

51
00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:09.370
this isn't even a case that makes it to Marshall's biographies very often and it

52
00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:12.730
was one of the most dangerous cases he ever got involved in sort of explaining

53
00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:13.540
to that.

54
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.770
But there you see sheriff McCall,

55
00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:17.770
he sort of a notorious sheriff on the left and,

56
00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:18.430
um,

57
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.940
he was every bit as important in enforcing the death penalty.

58
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.110
Then the prosecutor,

59
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.343
uh,

60
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.361
you know,

61
00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:29.740
what happened was Norma Padgett claimed when this first happened,

62
00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:31.270
she couldn't recognize the victims.

63
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.620
She didn't recognize them.

64
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.213
Um,

65
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.380
later on after a talk with prosecutors and,

66
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:38.050
and,

67
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.220
and a sheriff McCall,

68
00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:43.090
she finally figured out who these men were and she could name every single one

69
00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:44.470
of them naturally.

70
00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:47.470
And they were basically who sheriff McCall considered troublemakers.

71
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.953
Um,

72
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.750
the tall,

73
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.370
the tall kid in the middle 16 year old Charles Greenley was in another jail at

74
00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:54.670
the,

75
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.211
at this point.

76
00:02:55.211 --> 00:02:56.500
And he wasn't even involved with this,

77
00:02:56.501 --> 00:02:57.280
but,

78
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.210
but normal,

79
00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.103
they had to have four.

80
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.970
And so they just picked him.

81
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.820
<v 0>Okay.</v>

82
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.031
<v 2>Uh,</v>

83
00:03:03.031 --> 00:03:04.440
this was right after the,

84
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.940
right after the alleged rape.

85
00:03:05.941 --> 00:03:06.481
This was the,

86
00:03:06.481 --> 00:03:06.900
um,

87
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.660
one of the editorials in the Orlando Sentinel,

88
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.590
uh,

89
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.150
the supreme penalty,

90
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.320
the Lake County tragedy,

91
00:03:13.321 --> 00:03:16.650
and basically they're already lining up the pot.

92
00:03:16.651 --> 00:03:16.761
The,

93
00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:19.380
the fact that this community is going to put these kids to death.

94
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.933
Um,

95
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.610
this actually w was the,

96
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.020
uh,

97
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.440
played a large role in the supreme court verdict on this,

98
00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:29.490
which I'll read to you in a moment.

99
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.471
Uh,

100
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:33.290
this is just,

101
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.290
you can see what happened after the writing.

102
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:36.130
This is really interesting.

103
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.650
After the rioting life magazine,

104
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:42.490
send a photographer down like the day after while they were still investigating

105
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:43.270
this.

106
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.100
And so you have sort of this real time photo repertory of this murder case.

107
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:50.710
This is the spot where the alleged rape was supposed to have taken,

108
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.663
taken place.

109
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.280
Uh,

110
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.370
Norma pageant is standing way in front of the car.

111
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:58.180
They're a part of the agreement with the photographer was that he wouldn't

112
00:03:58.181 --> 00:03:59.500
photograph her or if he did,

113
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.640
he'd be from a distance.

114
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.980
Um,

115
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.390
here you can see Willie pageant,

116
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:05.224
that's enormous,

117
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.340
separated husband.

118
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.703
Um,

119
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.390
Jeffrey Hunter's the prosecutor and Mabel Norris Reef is the reporter.

120
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.870
They play a really important part of this case,

121
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:20.440
which I'll explain to you later and you can sort of see behind the prosecutor.

122
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:21.041
That's normal.

123
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:22.710
She's just photographer.

124
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.553
Just hit her back there.

125
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.140
This is one of the most,

126
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.200
I think one of the most fascinating photographs that I've ever come across and

127
00:04:30.201 --> 00:04:31.220
it doesn't look like much.

128
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.690
It's,

129
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.970
it's,

130
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.720
it's sort of just telling you that something's happening in this little cafe,

131
00:04:35.721 --> 00:04:40.190
but this is sort of how the death penalty works and this is how justice works

132
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.900
and it's all right here in this photograph.

133
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.430
This guy has a name by the name of Lawrence Bartowski.

134
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.680
Now he had a little cafe on the side of the road outside of Groveland and he was

135
00:04:50.871 --> 00:04:53.330
the first person to see normal pageant that morning.

136
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.510
And Norma pageant came in and told him a story,

137
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.250
but she didn't tell it right away.

138
00:04:58.251 --> 00:04:59.930
She sat down and had coffee with them,

139
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.370
didn't seem to be hurt at all.

140
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.000
And she,

141
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.680
she said that she told Lawrence that she couldn't find her husband.

142
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.940
She didn't know where he was at.

143
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.270
Some black men had come along and got in a fight with her husband and she wanted

144
00:05:13.401 --> 00:05:13.580
to,

145
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.761
she,

146
00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:15.290
if Lawrence would take him back,

147
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.330
take her back to find her husband

148
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.630
that didn't fit the story of a rape.

149
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.131
She knits.

150
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:22.250
She said nothing about a rape.

151
00:05:22.251 --> 00:05:23.570
She didn't look upset,

152
00:05:23.571 --> 00:05:24.530
she didn't seem hurt.

153
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.070
And so Lauren's Berghoff,

154
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.840
whose father owned this cafe when they came around to talk to him,

155
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.630
they sort of put it in his head like,

156
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.861
what about that rape?

157
00:05:33.861 --> 00:05:34.431
She showed up,

158
00:05:34.431 --> 00:05:37.010
she said she was raped by four men and he said,

159
00:05:37.011 --> 00:05:38.600
actually that's not at all what she said.

160
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.850
And he told a totally different story.

161
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.510
And so you can see the prosecutor in the foreground,

162
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:47.900
Jesse Hunter sort of trying to get this story out of Lawrence Lawrenceburg off.

163
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.730
This is a 17 year old kid.

164
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.260
He's about to go off to the army and they're basically saying,

165
00:05:54.261 --> 00:05:54.471
you know,

166
00:05:54.471 --> 00:05:55.790
your father has got a nice place here.

167
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.590
It'd be shamed if he lost his license.

168
00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:59.660
All these things threatening and sort of,

169
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.550
and you can see sheriff McCall and James Yates who's deputy sort of glaring at

170
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:06.740
him because they're used to getting their way in this town.

171
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:08.330
These guys are stone cold killers,

172
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:09.920
which I'll explain to you in a little bit,

173
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.120
but they were absolutely feared in this town and the sheriff was the most

174
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:15.320
powerful man in town.

175
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.880
More powerful than the prosecutor.

176
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.590
More powerful than anybody.

177
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.390
And they could make things happen.

178
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:24.200
They made bodies disappear in the orange groves with central Florida.

179
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.100
Uh,

180
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.933
they were killers.

181
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.130
And so you can just see that look on them.

182
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.091
It's just sort of,

183
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:30.650
that's how you're influencing justice.

184
00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:32.310
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

185
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.240
<v 2>Burt off by the way,</v>

186
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.410
refused to go along with them.

187
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.423
Um,

188
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.000
and later on and that he comes back from the army and he stands up to the

189
00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:43.510
prosecutor and like a 45 minute cross examination,

190
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.260
uh,

191
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.050
one of the most heroic testimonies I've ever seen considering,

192
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.440
you know,

193
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.230
that he had family members in the clan are allegedly,

194
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:50.831
uh,

195
00:06:50.831 --> 00:06:53.410
they threatened to shut his father's business down and he just,

196
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.873
his mother said,

197
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.050
get up there and do what's right,

198
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.000
which is unbelievable in the 1940s,

199
00:06:58.001 --> 00:06:58.834
to be honest with you,

200
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.643
it's Thurgood Marshall.

201
00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:01.910
It,

202
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.120
he just got to see a picture of her.

203
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:08.701
The first trial,

204
00:07:08.701 --> 00:07:10.990
the growth and boys was a disaster and,

205
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.380
and the Naacp did get involved.

206
00:07:13.381 --> 00:07:16.740
Marshall wasn't doing the criminal case but you sort of steering it from New

207
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.310
York.

208
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.143
Um,

209
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.610
it was reversed on,

210
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.170
went to the Supreme Court and they both got can both men got convicted,

211
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.610
sentenced to the electric chair.

212
00:07:26.611 --> 00:07:27.350
The third boy,

213
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.440
16 year old kid,

214
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.760
he got life in prison.

215
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.123
Um,

216
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.740
but Marshall knew when they were taking this trial that the way they selected

217
00:07:34.741 --> 00:07:35.790
the jury was just,

218
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.580
there was already an opinion.

219
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.730
Castle verse Texas,

220
00:07:38.731 --> 00:07:43.260
I believe it was that had already said that you couldn't select jury members by

221
00:07:43.261 --> 00:07:43.710
hand,

222
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.640
which is what they were doing.

223
00:07:44.641 --> 00:07:47.250
They were saying he's one of the best blacks we have.

224
00:07:47.251 --> 00:07:50.040
He can be on the jury and then they excuse them.

225
00:07:50.041 --> 00:07:51.060
But that's how they were doing it.

226
00:07:51.061 --> 00:07:53.190
There was no other way of selecting them apparently.

227
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.390
So once this case had gone to the Supreme Court,

228
00:07:57.391 --> 00:07:58.410
Marshall took the case.

229
00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.460
Um,

230
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.570
they knew where they were going to win.

231
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:00.991
In fact,

232
00:08:00.991 --> 00:08:03.000
Florida knew they were going to get destroyed.

233
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.160
They set up their attorney general and he's just like,

234
00:08:05.161 --> 00:08:08.580
this is going to be easy for you guys because the supreme court like two months

235
00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:08.911
earlier,

236
00:08:08.911 --> 00:08:09.810
I just ruled on this.

237
00:08:09.811 --> 00:08:11.130
So they knew it was going to happen.

238
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.090
But I want to read to you because this is,

239
00:08:15.091 --> 00:08:15.601
this was the,

240
00:08:15.601 --> 00:08:15.900
um,

241
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.900
justice Jackson wrote the opinion and he's talking about the jury selection.

242
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:22.650
Any,

243
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:23.210
anybody,

244
00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:23.560
he,

245
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.060
he reads a very strong opinion into this and I'll just read it to you.

246
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.440
Uh,

247
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.160
the situation presented by this record is not different in essentials from that

248
00:08:32.161 --> 00:08:36.090
which was founded denial of due process in more verse Dempsey under these

249
00:08:36.091 --> 00:08:39.510
circumstances for the court to reverse these convictions upon the sole ground

250
00:08:39.511 --> 00:08:43.090
that the method of jury selection discriminated against the Negro race is to,

251
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.020
is to stress the trivial and ignore the important.

252
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.810
While this record discloses discrimination,

253
00:08:48.811 --> 00:08:51.360
which under normal circumstances might be prejudicial,

254
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.050
this trial took place under conditions and was accompanied by events,

255
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.540
would deny defendants a fair trial before any kind of jury.

256
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:03.010
I do not see as a practical matter how any Negro on the jury would have dared to

257
00:09:03.011 --> 00:09:04.780
cause a disagreement or acquittal.

258
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.650
The only chances these negroes had of acquittal would have been in the courage

259
00:09:08.651 --> 00:09:13.480
and decency of some sturdy and forthright white person of sufficient standing to

260
00:09:13.481 --> 00:09:16.540
face and live down the odium among his white neighbors.

261
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.400
That's such a vote if required,

262
00:09:18.401 --> 00:09:22.150
would have brought to me the technical question of discrimination and the jury

263
00:09:22.151 --> 00:09:24.700
selection has only theoretical importance.

264
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.330
The case presents one of the best examples of one of the worst menaces to

265
00:09:28.331 --> 00:09:29.320
American justice.

266
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.550
It is on that ground that I would reverse and that was a pretty strong opinion.

267
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.590
And basically they're saying that the sheriff who stood on the steps and said,

268
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.420
I just got those boys to confess,

269
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.130
this will all be taken care of soon.

270
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.760
But there was no confessions brought into evidence.

271
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.381
They would.

272
00:09:45.381 --> 00:09:45.700
There was,

273
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.820
they knew that will get reversed even they were smart enough to know that then,

274
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.570
but yet the word was out there that these three guys had confessed.

275
00:09:52.571 --> 00:09:53.960
It was all over the newspapers.

276
00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:55.090
The coverage was awful.

277
00:09:55.091 --> 00:09:55.810
And that's what,

278
00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.000
that's what Justice Jackson was talking about when you,

279
00:09:58.001 --> 00:09:58.834
when you said,

280
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.291
you know,

281
00:09:59.291 --> 00:10:02.410
it's one of the best examples of one of the worst medicines to American justice.

282
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.530
One man who didn't particularly care for the Supreme Court,

283
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:07.800
uh,

284
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.540
decision was I'm Sheriff Willis.

285
00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:14.541
Mccall Mccall said it was a decision that was influenced by subversives up in

286
00:10:15.871 --> 00:10:16.620
New York,

287
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.140
um,

288
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:21.390
bunch of Naacp lawyers who've gotten to the heads of the Supreme Court justices

289
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.850
and he didn't really care much for the opinion,

290
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.590
but by law he was required to go pick up the prisoners and bring them back for a

291
00:10:28.591 --> 00:10:29.424
second trial.

292
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.000
And what do you know they tried to escape?

293
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.621
This is,

294
00:10:34.621 --> 00:10:35.454
um,

295
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.730
McCall actually put these guys in the car,

296
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.260
cuffed him together and took them down a dirt road on the way back to the,

297
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.870
to the jail for the trial on the eve of the trial,

298
00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:47.613
um,

299
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.810
Samuel Sheppard,

300
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:53.811
who is the one in the Supreme Court Opinion Shepherd versus a Florida is on the

301
00:10:57.181 --> 00:10:57.511
left.

302
00:10:57.511 --> 00:10:57.811
He is,

303
00:10:57.811 --> 00:10:58.140
um,

304
00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.670
he was killed instantly.

305
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.260
This is also another remarkable photograph for what it represents.

306
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.870
This was taken about 10 minutes after the shooting.

307
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:08.490
So after the shooting,

308
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.440
McCall got on with his deputy and said,

309
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:11.400
get the police back here.

310
00:11:11.401 --> 00:11:12.420
They tried to escape.

311
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:13.470
Uh,

312
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.500
the police showed up with a photographer.

313
00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:20.580
There was a town hall meeting and they came and took this photograph,

314
00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:23.220
the Flash Flyer fired as soon as the flash fired,

315
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:24.643
uh,

316
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.370
the prosecutor who happened to be there as well,

317
00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:28.260
said one of those guys just moved.

318
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.970
So Walter urban on the right was actually still alive.

319
00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.600
So Marshall had come down that who came down for the trial,

320
00:11:37.601 --> 00:11:39.460
he was going to conduct this trial himself.

321
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:40.270
Um,

322
00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.700
you can feed in here with the young Paul Perkins who was,

323
00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:43.534
um,

324
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.330
this was one of his first cases out of college.

325
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:46.711
He,

326
00:11:46.711 --> 00:11:47.000
he,

327
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.690
this is the first case he ever was paid cash.

328
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.710
You got three 75,

329
00:11:50.711 --> 00:11:53.200
an hour to two to practice law.

330
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.800
Before that he was being paid in ham and oranges.

331
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.310
So he was very excited to be working with Thurgood Marshall.

332
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:01.144
Needless to say,

333
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.040
Marshall came down and now he gets a chance to go into the hospital and meet

334
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:06.874
Walter Urban.

335
00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.470
It hasn't met Walter urban yet.

336
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.730
And Walter urban tells a very different story about the escape.

337
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:14.440
Uh,

338
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.240
urban tells a story that they,

339
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.880
they just went down a dirt road and McCall just said,

340
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:19.601
get out of the car.

341
00:12:19.601 --> 00:12:21.280
And as soon as they started to get out of the car,

342
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.593
he shot them.

343
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:23.723
Uh,

344
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.660
now he's cuffed to Samuel Shepard.

345
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:27.890
Shepard falls really can't go anywhere.

346
00:12:27.891 --> 00:12:28.900
I can't run anywhere.

347
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.033
You stuck.

348
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.240
He takes two bullets,

349
00:12:31.241 --> 00:12:32.080
one in the side,

350
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:33.190
one in the chest.

351
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:34.750
And um,

352
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.390
there's a third bullet wounds that,

353
00:12:36.391 --> 00:12:39.220
that they've accounted for all the bullets.

354
00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:41.050
But there's one bullet they haven't accounted for.

355
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.820
And that was the neck wound.

356
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.110
And this is where urban story gets a little bit intense.

357
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:48.190
And Marshall's hearing this,

358
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.290
the reporters are hearing this for the first time.

359
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.143
He said that

360
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:58.750
he was lying on the side of the road and McCall made that phone call to get his

361
00:12:58.751 --> 00:13:03.751
deputy back here and the deputy drove back to the scene,

362
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.300
took out his flashlight and he's shining the down and he says,

363
00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:08.200
this one's not dead.

364
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.790
He pulls his gun and fires it straight down at urban,

365
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.931
hits him in the neck,

366
00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:15.070
goes right through his neck.

367
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:16.451
Okay,

368
00:13:16.451 --> 00:13:19.450
so now you have two versions of what happened in this story.

369
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.900
You have McCall's version that there was an escape that these two guys were

370
00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:25.690
coming at them and McCall was backing up and firing his weapon.

371
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.670
Six bullets,

372
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:28.660
five of them that were,

373
00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.180
were accounted for because they were in the bodies of the victims.

374
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.460
The sixth bullet was unaccounted for.

375
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.040
So if you believe McCall's story,

376
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.890
that bullet would never be seen because he got shot in the neck,

377
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.030
uh,

378
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.080
while he was being attacked.

379
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.920
But urban says that the deputy came back,

380
00:13:44.921 --> 00:13:46.240
shot him straight to the neck.

381
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.650
So the FBI hears this,

382
00:13:47.651 --> 00:13:48.850
they go back to the scene,

383
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.170
they find the blood spot,

384
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.390
they start digging in 10 inches under,

385
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.650
they find the bullet.

386
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:55.630
So it is urban story.

387
00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:56.380
After all,

388
00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.280
remarkably,

389
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.290
the FBI sat on this evidence and didn't it never released it.

390
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.200
It just kind of died in the files,

391
00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:06.470
uh,

392
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.080
along with the bullet information.

393
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.090
Very strange that this would happen.

394
00:14:10.091 --> 00:14:13.210
But these are the things that happen when you have a of state attorney who's a

395
00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:14.530
known segregationist.

396
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.251
Uh,

397
00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:17.170
they just managed to cover this up.

398
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.033
In fact,

399
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:19.181
the,

400
00:14:19.181 --> 00:14:19.780
um,

401
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:24.700
the reason McCall was not indicted after evidence like this was that the judge

402
00:14:24.701 --> 00:14:25.534
in the case,

403
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.510
the criminal case said that,

404
00:14:28.511 --> 00:14:28.811
you know,

405
00:14:28.811 --> 00:14:30.550
let's just go by the coroner's report.

406
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.550
The coroner's report was very accurate as to what happened.

407
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.980
The coroner's report was made up of six of Willis.

408
00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:38.500
Mccall has friends who said it was self defense.

409
00:14:38.501 --> 00:14:40.270
And so when the call was never charged on this,

410
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:41.783
um,

411
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.910
there's James Yates,

412
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.090
the deputy who's the one who fired the bullet

413
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:48.730
the second,

414
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.440
the second trial did go forward.

415
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:51.050
Um,

416
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.790
and it was pretty much even,

417
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.340
even with Thurgood Marshall represented,

418
00:14:54.341 --> 00:14:56.540
it was just no way that they were going to win.

419
00:14:56.541 --> 00:14:57.311
And they knew that they,

420
00:14:57.311 --> 00:14:57.920
they,

421
00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.600
it was 12 white jurors.

422
00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.650
They knew what they were up against and,

423
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.900
and they were just not going to do it.

424
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.680
One of the things that they were up against was falsified evidence.

425
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.180
This is James Yates,

426
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.613
the killer.

427
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:10.483
Um,

428
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:11.720
<v 0>yeah.</v>

429
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.230
<v 2>You can see the newspaper articles that were running at Scotland Yard.</v>

430
00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:16.520
Please don't take our gate.

431
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.470
This was a Yates was in charge of putting the evidence together for this case.

432
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.360
And what he did was he found these,

433
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.210
he was supposedly this forensic genius.

434
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.750
He was able to make footprints of plaster in Paris,

435
00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:34.100
in the sand that put Walter urban at the scene of the crime alleged crime.

436
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.691
What do you really did?

437
00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:40.691
Was he confiscated Urban's shoes and went home and made footprints and brought

438
00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:43.310
them in for evidence.

439
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:44.643
Um,

440
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.150
Marshall actually hired a very sophisticated,

441
00:15:49.151 --> 00:15:49.780
um,

442
00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.740
forensic expert who worked for the FBI.

443
00:15:51.741 --> 00:15:52.780
You did the Lindbergh kid.

444
00:15:52.781 --> 00:15:53.021
I mean,

445
00:15:53.021 --> 00:15:56.260
he was very adamant that these footprints were false.

446
00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.860
That there would've been a different way of convex impressions.

447
00:15:59.861 --> 00:16:01.960
And he said these were false and,

448
00:16:01.961 --> 00:16:02.794
but the jury,

449
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.780
all the prosecution really had to do was say,

450
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.240
who are you going to believe these negroes up here?

451
00:16:07.241 --> 00:16:09.280
Or are you going to believe are find deputies?

452
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.230
And this was exactly how it played out.

453
00:16:11.231 --> 00:16:12.190
So they got their verdict.

454
00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:13.780
They got their death sentence.

455
00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:14.891
At the time,

456
00:16:14.891 --> 00:16:19.090
actually Florida was getting such bad publicity for this case that the governor

457
00:16:19.091 --> 00:16:23.650
actually stepped in and offered a plea to Walter urban said,

458
00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:24.760
we can end this now.

459
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.520
Just take life in prison,

460
00:16:26.521 --> 00:16:27.850
will stop going through the death penalty.

461
00:16:27.851 --> 00:16:29.740
Just confessed.

462
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.820
Just say you did it.

463
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:31.720
That's all you have to do.

464
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.000
And Marshall's strategy was to sort of,

465
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.250
he was hoping that that urban would take the plea.

466
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.180
He really knew that Florida meant business and they were gonna kill him.

467
00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.490
And that he really encouraged him.

468
00:16:45.491 --> 00:16:46.450
But Walter Urban said,

469
00:16:46.451 --> 00:16:46.541
well,

470
00:16:46.541 --> 00:16:48.610
what do I have to do to do this?

471
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.140
And Marshall explained to him,

472
00:16:50.141 --> 00:16:53.390
you said you have to go before the judge and said and say that you raped Nora

473
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:54.243
pageant.

474
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:55.151
And he said,

475
00:16:55.151 --> 00:16:55.301
well,

476
00:16:55.301 --> 00:16:56.260
you can say it for me.

477
00:16:56.261 --> 00:16:59.230
I'm not saying I didn't rape her and he wouldn't say it.

478
00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.060
And this was to save his life.

479
00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:02.800
Basically Marshall was trying to persuade them,

480
00:17:02.801 --> 00:17:02.981
say,

481
00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:04.870
we can get this taken care of later.

482
00:17:04.871 --> 00:17:05.800
Just save your life.

483
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.310
Because there's ways we can influence the political process and,

484
00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.560
and take care of this.

485
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:12.781
And he was encouraging.

486
00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:13.060
But,

487
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.630
but urban would not lie and his mother wouldn't lie on the stand.

488
00:17:16.631 --> 00:17:20.800
His mother could have saved his life to by by saying that that Walter was home.

489
00:17:20.801 --> 00:17:23.110
But the family just would not lie and they wouldn't say,

490
00:17:23.111 --> 00:17:24.370
he would not admit to raping.

491
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:24.760
Okay.

492
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.593
<v 0>All right.</v>

493
00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:26.693
It's pretty interesting.

494
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.370
<v 2>And here you see Jack Greenberg,</v>

495
00:17:29.371 --> 00:17:30.420
I don't know if you send me to know him.

496
00:17:30.421 --> 00:17:33.510
He was head of the Naacp or the legal defense on for awhile.

497
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.370
And this was one of his first cases.

498
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.550
Greenberg was interesting because he had stormed the beaches of Ua Jima

499
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:41.933
<v 0>and</v>

500
00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.060
<v 2>how I asked him what were you scared?</v>

501
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:45.841
And he goes,

502
00:17:45.841 --> 00:17:48.000
not as scared as I was in Groveland because when he,

503
00:17:48.001 --> 00:17:48.900
the night before trial,

504
00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:52.770
the was circling around his hotel and he was putting like dressers in front of

505
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:53.281
the doors.

506
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:54.930
I mean he was absolutely scared out of his mind.

507
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:59.190
The second trial was interesting because Marshall,

508
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.350
here's the DNA died,

509
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:06.360
the dynamic at play here you haven't an African American lawyer and she,

510
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.760
he is supposedly questioning a white victim of rape.

511
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.150
And there were all sorts of things that Marshall would not do.

512
00:18:15.151 --> 00:18:15.990
And one of them was,

513
00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:20.710
he was not going to stand before a jury of 12 white rural men and questioning

514
00:18:20.711 --> 00:18:23.340
the integrity of this woman's character.

515
00:18:23.341 --> 00:18:24.174
It was called the,

516
00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:25.363
uh,

517
00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.600
flower,

518
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.600
a white southerners flower of white southern womanhood that would be considered

519
00:18:32.131 --> 00:18:35.160
so untestable and that an automatic conviction.

520
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:35.901
So they,

521
00:18:35.901 --> 00:18:36.101
they,

522
00:18:36.101 --> 00:18:37.500
they were very careful about that.

523
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.470
So the only way they could really only defense they could mount was one of

524
00:18:40.471 --> 00:18:44.200
mistaken identity because that didn't impugn her reputation.

525
00:18:44.201 --> 00:18:44.640
And they're saying,

526
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:44.791
oh,

527
00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:46.440
we're not saying the rape didn't happen,

528
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:47.341
we're just saying,

529
00:18:47.341 --> 00:18:47.731
you got,

530
00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:49.470
you selected the wrong people.

531
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.750
And it was very,

532
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:53.550
she was very adamant about who,

533
00:18:53.551 --> 00:18:53.880
you know,

534
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.170
recognizing these men.

535
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.860
Now actually when I went through the FBI files,

536
00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.200
the FBI files were sealed for 60 years.

537
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:02.041
Um,

538
00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:05.730
so I just got them released a couple of years ago and I went through them.

539
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:10.770
And they are fascinating because they include a lot of off the record comments.

540
00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:12.840
And so you had the police chief,

541
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:13.711
you know,

542
00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:14.820
telling the FBI,

543
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.410
giving the statement,

544
00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:19.290
and then pulling the FBI guy to the side and saying,

545
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.390
I'll tell you what really happened here.

546
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.040
And so those things are in the record.

547
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.210
It's pretty fascinating.

548
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:26.160
But Norma Padgett,

549
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.350
when she was doing her FBI statement,

550
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:29.670
she,

551
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.280
it was completely different than what she said on the stand,

552
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.380
but of course this never came out in the trial.

553
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.140
So she contradicted herself.

554
00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:39.750
You could say she committed perjury and one of those statements or the other.

555
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.963
Um,

556
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.510
but that's how,

557
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.630
that's how Hamstrung Marshall was in this defense.

558
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:46.021
Now,

559
00:19:46.021 --> 00:19:46.890
what's really interesting,

560
00:19:46.891 --> 00:19:48.960
I showed you earlier the picture of Jesse Hunter,

561
00:19:48.961 --> 00:19:51.510
the prosecutor and Mabel Norris Reese,

562
00:19:51.511 --> 00:19:55.080
who was the white reporter after the shooting.

563
00:19:55.081 --> 00:19:56.940
When McCall shot these two guys,

564
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.010
they started to have a change of heart.

565
00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:00.163
Now they,

566
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.000
this is the only time I'd seen this,

567
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.910
the prosecutor,

568
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.380
the prosecutor started to leak material and information to the NAACP.

569
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.050
So what they were basically doing,

570
00:20:10.051 --> 00:20:10.290
they,

571
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:11.071
he would not go,

572
00:20:11.071 --> 00:20:13.650
he was going to go ahead and he was going to prosecute for the death penalty.

573
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.600
But beside behind the scenes,

574
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.140
the prosecutor was leaking material that would be helpful to the defense.

575
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:20.460
Um,

576
00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:20.990
which was,

577
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.790
uh,

578
00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:22.470
I had,

579
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.120
I had not come across that before.

580
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.480
And in fact the sheriff McCall was so upset by this that he leaked himself

581
00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:32.723
through one of his,

582
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.430
he was friends with the assistant prosecutor.

583
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:40.050
He leaked to the Naacp that the prosecutor was in on the murder with him.

584
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:45.090
And so this showed up in Marshall's office and Marshall just dismissed it out of

585
00:20:45.091 --> 00:20:45.301
hand.

586
00:20:45.301 --> 00:20:46.230
He figured it out.

587
00:20:46.231 --> 00:20:46.520
He said,

588
00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.990
McCall is trying to drag the prosecutor down cause he knew the prosecutor was

589
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:50.824
leaking this.

590
00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.000
So after,

591
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:57.130
after Jesse Hunter wins this conviction and gets Walter Urban Center the death

592
00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:57.820
penalty,

593
00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.050
the electric chair,

594
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:00.693
what he does is he,

595
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:02.560
he writes the governor and says,

596
00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:03.394
we got it all wrong.

597
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.770
And he says,

598
00:21:05.771 --> 00:21:06.700
I really don't think,

599
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.010
I think you should find a way to stop this right now.

600
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.330
And that this infuriated McCall because McCall was the one who really ran this

601
00:21:13.331 --> 00:21:14.164
county.

602
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.450
And so for,

603
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:20.470
for McCall started accusing them of suddenly falling into the communist hands

604
00:21:20.861 --> 00:21:22.000
becoming senile.

605
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.260
And one of the things that's interesting and this is the will to win.

606
00:21:26.261 --> 00:21:27.094
Like he wouldn't,

607
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:27.791
the prosecutor,

608
00:21:27.791 --> 00:21:30.910
Jesse Hunter would not stop the case.

609
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:32.103
He had to win it.

610
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.390
And to the extent that he went to,

611
00:21:34.391 --> 00:21:36.430
to win this was kind of remarkable.

612
00:21:36.431 --> 00:21:37.810
I think you'll find it pretty interesting.

613
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:38.651
He,

614
00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:39.340
um,

615
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.570
in his closing argument,

616
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:42.490
he stands before the,

617
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:43.870
at this point,

618
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.030
Marshall and his assistants are just making,

619
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:47.243
you know,

620
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.670
one list,

621
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.070
one long list of prosecutorial misconduct.

622
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.151
Uh,

623
00:21:52.151 --> 00:21:54.430
at the very end of his is a closing argument.

624
00:21:54.431 --> 00:21:55.630
Jesse Hunter stands up,

625
00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.850
walks over to the rail and starts talking to the 12 men on the jury and he says,

626
00:22:00.851 --> 00:22:01.684
gentlemen,

627
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.141
you,

628
00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:02.974
uh,

629
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:04.420
you know,

630
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.040
I haven't told anybody about this,

631
00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:10.030
but I have a terminal disease and this is probably going to be my last case.

632
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.280
And I show we'd like to go out with a win.

633
00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:12.761
And you know,

634
00:22:12.761 --> 00:22:13.720
I wouldn't lie to you,

635
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.520
so if you wouldn't mind,

636
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:17.230
just let me go out as a,

637
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:18.183
as a winner.

638
00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.830
And Marshall didn't even object at this point.

639
00:22:20.831 --> 00:22:22.600
They're just making a list of all these things.

640
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:23.650
Um,

641
00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:25.480
so those are the kinds of things that they were up against.

642
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:26.920
Another thing that was interesting,

643
00:22:26.921 --> 00:22:29.950
it was Jesse Hunter in the second trial when they brought the forensic expert

644
00:22:29.951 --> 00:22:30.784
up,

645
00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:35.050
hunter was just walking up and down the isles making fun of the witness.

646
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:36.640
And the judge wouldn't even stop him.

647
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:38.051
So he would say,

648
00:22:38.051 --> 00:22:40.510
why to fancy man with your fancy explanations.

649
00:22:40.511 --> 00:22:43.450
And he was yelling this stuff and at one point you can see in the transcript,

650
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.190
can you get him to stop your honor,

651
00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.053
proceed.

652
00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.770
And it was just going on and on like this.

653
00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.180
And so the case was,

654
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.740
the second trial was kind of a,

655
00:22:50.741 --> 00:22:51.630
a carnival in a,

656
00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:52.870
in a lot of different ways.

657
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.250
But um,

658
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:54.640
so yeah,

659
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.473
that was

660
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:57.980
urban did testify,

661
00:22:57.981 --> 00:22:58.570
but you know,

662
00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:02.020
it was one of those things where he didn't know what happened.

663
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:02.290
He,

664
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.123
he,

665
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:03.550
and,

666
00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:05.170
and that Marshall made a point of that saying,

667
00:23:05.171 --> 00:23:05.411
you know,

668
00:23:05.411 --> 00:23:07.300
this is not the behavior of someone.

669
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:09.910
Technically it was one of his neighbors.

670
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.860
They lived near each other in Groveland,

671
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.420
Norma pageant and Walter Urban.

672
00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:15.060
And what,

673
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.820
what's strange is that urban gets up on the stand it and he,

674
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.040
he basically says,

675
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.380
I saw them on the side of the road.

676
00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:25.270
We help them fix the car and then we drove away,

677
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.463
which was true.

678
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:27.600
Um,

679
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:27.841
and they,

680
00:23:27.841 --> 00:23:32.770
they went back to bed and woke up the next morning to go to work when the police

681
00:23:32.771 --> 00:23:33.604
shut up.

682
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.200
And Marshall tried to make the point.

683
00:23:35.201 --> 00:23:35.530
He goes,

684
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:40.530
in all my years I've never seen a black man who rapes a neighbor and goes to

685
00:23:41.861 --> 00:23:42.101
work.

686
00:23:42.101 --> 00:23:43.030
Like nothing happened.

687
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.410
When they left her alive,

688
00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:45.950
it made no sense to him.

689
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.760
And so that's how he knew that he knew that urban was innocent,

690
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:52.250
but he really knew when urban refused to say that he ray,

691
00:23:52.251 --> 00:23:55.490
he could have saved his life and he refused to just say I raped her.

692
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.900
One of the most fascinating parts of the story to me is,

693
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:03.290
is Marshall actually hired a spy to go down to Florida.

694
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:08.620
The young girl who was just anti capital punishment and she went down south and

695
00:24:11.301 --> 00:24:15.860
she had this world is a world peace pin that she wore around and she went around

696
00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:20.270
to all these different people in this clan community and said,

697
00:24:20.271 --> 00:24:24.140
I want you to sign my petition against capital punishment.

698
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.550
And she went down and she got all these people to sign in Bay County and one of

699
00:24:28.551 --> 00:24:29.211
the things she did,

700
00:24:29.211 --> 00:24:30.260
which was fascinating,

701
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:35.770
she got Norma pageant to sign that petition and c they were country Baptist and

702
00:24:37.341 --> 00:24:39.110
they didn't really have a strong opinion.

703
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:40.130
They,

704
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.320
they had a strong opinion about guilt or innocence,

705
00:24:42.321 --> 00:24:44.630
but they weren't really in favor of capital punishment.

706
00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.950
And so by this spy who I never was able to find her,

707
00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:52.460
she had a fake name and Marshall just hired her from a detective agency.

708
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.590
She went down there and got my call,

709
00:24:54.591 --> 00:24:56.570
tried to get my call to sign it and call,

710
00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:57.733
get outta here,

711
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.963
shoot her away.

712
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.250
But she did get the pageants to sign that.

713
00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.190
And so it's sort of this activism in a way.

714
00:25:04.191 --> 00:25:05.720
She was a detective and a spy,

715
00:25:05.721 --> 00:25:07.280
but she was also an activist.

716
00:25:07.281 --> 00:25:11.990
She really strongly believed she was very anti capital punishment and by her

717
00:25:11.991 --> 00:25:12.711
going around,

718
00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:13.544
she lived,

719
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.280
she went fishing with Norma paget.

720
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:15.890
She's,

721
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:20.890
she went under the guise of wanting to buy real estate and in Groveland and so

722
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.240
they were very friendly even in this little clan community and they were against

723
00:25:26.241 --> 00:25:27.050
capital punishment.

724
00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:30.770
And so that was one of the factors that made the Governor Leroy Collins

725
00:25:30.771 --> 00:25:31.221
actually,

726
00:25:31.221 --> 00:25:32.660
pardon Walter Irvin.

727
00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:33.890
It was,

728
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:34.310
you know,

729
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:35.390
a lot of different factors.

730
00:25:35.391 --> 00:25:37.790
But one of them was seeing that the victim in this case,

731
00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:39.020
it was willing to sign that.

732
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.580
I will add that it doesn't end quite that happily because sheriff McCall found

733
00:25:43.581 --> 00:25:48.470
out about that petition and mounted this big campaign to press charges because

734
00:25:48.471 --> 00:25:51.880
there was a communist loosen our neighborhood and she was getting to sign

735
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.800
capitol punishment and they were under a ruse.

736
00:25:54.801 --> 00:25:58.790
And then he tried to get normal pageant to recant it and say that was not my

737
00:25:58.791 --> 00:25:59.241
signature.

738
00:25:59.241 --> 00:25:59.961
He tried everything,

739
00:25:59.961 --> 00:26:01.400
but he was unsuccessful.

740
00:26:01.401 --> 00:26:02.510
So Walter urban was,

741
00:26:02.511 --> 00:26:03.344
life was spared.

742
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.320
Walter Irvin had had a pretty strange,

743
00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:06.890
um,

744
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.890
he served 19 years in jail and he got,

745
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.753
he got out,

746
00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.450
um,

747
00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:16.450
I think it was 1968 and within a year he decided he wanted to go back to lake

748
00:26:18.081 --> 00:26:20.270
county because it was forbidden.

749
00:26:20.271 --> 00:26:20.991
But he,

750
00:26:20.991 --> 00:26:21.290
uh,

751
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.850
one of his uncles had passed away,

752
00:26:22.851 --> 00:26:24.290
so we wanted to go back for the funeral.

753
00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.760
And so he had to alert Lee county that he was coming to lake county for funeral.

754
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.400
He got to Lake County and they found him dead in a car.

755
00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:36.620
So Mabel Norris Reese was a big part of this story.

756
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.180
She just immediately says,

757
00:26:38.181 --> 00:26:41.000
McCall got to him like 20 years later and McCall God to him,

758
00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.110
uh,

759
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.943
nothing was ever,

760
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:43.741
you know,

761
00:26:43.741 --> 00:26:43.901
the,

762
00:26:43.901 --> 00:26:46.530
the corner just sort of hung up and said it was natural causes.

763
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:48.300
Marshall never believed that.

764
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.050
And in fact,

765
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:53.190
Marsha was sitting as a justice of the supreme court when he got news of this.

766
00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:55.140
He still called Hoover and said,

767
00:26:55.141 --> 00:26:56.220
I want an investigation.

768
00:26:56.221 --> 00:27:00.990
And McCall McCall was like a nemesis effort of his for many years and he never

769
00:27:00.991 --> 00:27:01.824
forgot that.

770
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:03.630
So that was Walter Urban's fate.

771
00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:04.573
Yup.

772
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:16.860
<v 0>Yeah.</v>
