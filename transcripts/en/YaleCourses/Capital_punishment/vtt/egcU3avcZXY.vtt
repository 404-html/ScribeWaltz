1
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.780
One of the stage that is looked most closely.

2
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:16.111
In fact,

3
00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:19.920
the only state that's look closely at race discrimination and the death penalty

4
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.300
is North Carolina.

5
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.560
And we're joined today with Henderson Hill,

6
00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:29.561
the distinguished North Carolina lawyer to talk about the experience of North

7
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.950
Carolina with its racial Justice Act.

8
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.400
Uh,

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.851
Henderson,

10
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:35.190
thank you so much for being with us here today.

11
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:36.461
<v 2>Steve.</v>

12
00:00:36.461 --> 00:00:37.300
I'm happy to be here.

13
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:38.000
Thank you.

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.361
<v 1>Well,</v>

15
00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:39.170
glad to have gun.

16
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.840
I W would you just tell us,

17
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.000
tell us about the,

18
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.180
the racial justice act in North Carolina,

19
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.680
what it provided and how it made a difference in terms of the way courts looked

20
00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:51.440
at race discrimination in death penalty cases.

21
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.771
<v 2>Well,</v>

22
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:53.560
sure.

23
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.080
One of the things that we became painfully aware of and had been for a good long

24
00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:03.081
while was at a solid citizens hard working members of the community were being

25
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:07.770
excluded from participation in the criminal justice system.

26
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.840
And it became really very clear in the capital cases that increasingly capital

27
00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:16.080
trials were tried before jurors that were entirely white.

28
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.370
And,

29
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.180
uh,

30
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.541
uh,

31
00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:20.340
the supreme court had of course,

32
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:23.400
had a mechanism for dealing with racial discrimination.

33
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:24.300
Jury selection,

34
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.630
the bats in three step process was that mechanism.

35
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.690
And in North Carolina it just was not very effective.

36
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:31.051
In fact,

37
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:35.220
it was less effective than North Carolina than in many of the southern states.

38
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:36.060
And the death battles

39
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.570
<v 1>be there for a second.</v>

40
00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:40.100
When you say the bats and process,

41
00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:43.940
you mean where after the prosecution has struck African Americans?

42
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.350
The defense objects,

43
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.030
the prosecution gives reasons and then the judge decides whether there's a race

44
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:54.950
discrimination based on the number of black struck and the reasons given by the

45
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:55.784
prosecutor.

46
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.771
<v 2>That's correct.</v>

47
00:01:56.771 --> 00:02:00.820
And it's in that second step of the process where the reasons are offered.

48
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.030
That was so frustrating to litigators and observers of the system because in

49
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.360
that second step,

50
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.201
uh,

51
00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:08.710
the,

52
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.710
the explanations race neutral explanations were so clearly pretextual having to

53
00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:15.334
do with,

54
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.650
uh,

55
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.040
the directness of eye contact,

56
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.840
body language,

57
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.010
um,

58
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.390
where they went to school,

59
00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:23.970
whether or not they had children,

60
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.240
the age of the defendant,

61
00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:27.190
whether they were the age of the defendant,

62
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.350
whether they had family members,

63
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.100
uh,

64
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.100
who were involved in the court system.

65
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.200
All of these questions,

66
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.260
which first of all had little or nothing to do with their,

67
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.660
their capacity to serve as jurors.

68
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.830
Uh,

69
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.830
but increasingly those questions were not the same questions at white citizens

70
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.330
call to jury service.

71
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:49.660
We're were being asked.

72
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.080
And so we were struggling as a state,

73
00:02:53.081 --> 00:02:57.520
as a community of criminal justice officials with how to tap into that.

74
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.910
And of course we had a scene McClaskey and you know,

75
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.790
it's mclass way was rightfully viewed as one of the more shameful opinions and

76
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:10.030
the Supreme Court's history particularly shameful,

77
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:14.560
was the notion that we could recognize that race had an undue impact on the

78
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:15.580
operation of the system.

79
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:17.500
But it was too difficult to tease out.

80
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.760
And it really wasn't the federal judiciary responsibility to try to tease that

81
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:22.001
out.

82
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.530
And if you tried to tease that out,

83
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:25.420
the whole fabric would fall apart.

84
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.130
That's a frustrating response to get from the spring court and looking at the

85
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:31.690
courts invitation to the,

86
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.660
to the state legislatures to create a fix.

87
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.880
Good people in our legislature said,

88
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.481
well,

89
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:39.160
let's try to create a fix.

90
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.870
And so in 2009,

91
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:42.910
we pass the racial justice act,

92
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:43.744
which said that,

93
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.010
you know,

94
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.010
if in fact race played an undue role in either the decision to seek the death

95
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:54.061
penalty to impose the death penalty or in selecting jurors to preside or to sit

96
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:55.330
in they,

97
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.020
uh,

98
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.010
in the trial,

99
00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.640
uh,

100
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.440
that showing could lead to the reversal of the death sentence and an imposition

101
00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:04.540
of a sentence of life without parole.

102
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.320
Uh,

103
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.960
it was a historic piece of legislation.

104
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.183
Uh,

105
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.210
importantly,

106
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.440
one of the things that,

107
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.010
uh,

108
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.820
two things,

109
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.900
two important features,

110
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.660
one was a statistical evidence,

111
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.370
scientific evidence would be admissible and for many years,

112
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:26.260
one of the frustrations where we were not able to admit statistical evidence of

113
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:30.250
discrimination in our classic lawsuit in our classic motions.

114
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.641
Well,

115
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:34.510
this was an expression by the general assembly saying that in the criminal

116
00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:35.321
justice arena,

117
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:37.450
just like in the public health arena,

118
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:39.160
just like an industry,

119
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.000
uh,

120
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
in every other walk of life science would be allowed into evidence.

121
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.620
And so there was an open invitation to include statistical and scientific

122
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:51.454
evidence.

123
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.740
Uh,

124
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.380
and that was incredibly helpful.

125
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.270
I think the other part that I thought was very dramatic and very important was a

126
00:04:58.271 --> 00:04:58.811
suggestion.

127
00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:03.811
Though we're not necessarily accusing prosecutors and judges of racial Animus,

128
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.660
we're not suggesting that what,

129
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.310
what are jurors and are confronted with and you know,

130
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.580
2010,

131
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:17.581
2012 his bowl Connor or the folks who believe the,

132
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.740
the African American jurors,

133
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.450
no more than monkeys.

134
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.460
And it's not that level of animus.

135
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.670
What we are talking about is a legacy in the courthouse of regarding African

136
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.113
American jurors,

137
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.170
citizens as something less than full citizens,

138
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.470
either intellectually or as a part of morality or with respect to some

139
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:47.431
prosecutors who were more interested in just winning.

140
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.890
If,

141
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.600
if it was viewed that black jurors were an obstacle to winning,

142
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.260
securing the death sentence for whatever reasons,

143
00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.630
the prosecutor may not have racial Animus,

144
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:04.520
but he connects race to a particular outcome independent of what the jurors

145
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.060
actual feelings are on the relevant questions.

146
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.121
And so I thought the,

147
00:06:09.121 --> 00:06:10.400
the General Assembly,

148
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.851
uh,

149
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:11.240
was,

150
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.240
was looking for discriminatory impact as opposed to a discriminatory intent.

151
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.020
And I think that was an important innovation in the,

152
00:06:19.021 --> 00:06:19.854
in the law.

153
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.390
And when you went out and gathered this statistics and presented them to the

154
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:25.851
court,

155
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:26.684
what did you find?

156
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.013
Well,

157
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.710
Steve,

158
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.780
it was overwhelmingly powerful.

159
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.730
According to the statute.

160
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:39.731
We were tasked with identifying the impacts both on a statewide basis,

161
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.840
on a countywide basis.

162
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.540
And then on the individual case itself.

163
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.070
And the consistency of the numbers were just mind boggling.

164
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:49.311
You know,

165
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:51.050
which ever way you looked at it.

166
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.270
And you know,

167
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.350
if you are African American,

168
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:58.910
you were somewhere between two and a half to three times more likely to be

169
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:01.550
excluded from jury service then if you were white.

170
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.870
Now of course that did vary with respect to counties.

171
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:09.020
And so some counties it was dramatically high or,

172
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:14.021
and so in some counties that we consistently hover closer to the three or exceed

173
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:16.400
three and other counties,

174
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:19.400
that would be a closer to the two of.

175
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.263
But when you,

176
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.140
one of the things,

177
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:22.430
I'm not a statistician,

178
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.720
that's not my training,

179
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.710
uh,

180
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.300
but I've had some invaluable contact with the researchers.

181
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.570
Uh,

182
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.280
Katherine Grosso and Barbara Brian.

183
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.900
<v 3>And these differences too that are incredibly long.</v>

184
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.691
I mean,

185
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:37.580
you're talking about three times.

186
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.680
The likelihood of being excluded.

187
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:42.030
If you African American then if you're

188
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.330
<v 2>a white citizen,</v>

189
00:07:43.331 --> 00:07:46.390
that kind of ratio is incredibly powerful.

190
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.270
If you go,

191
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.041
it's based on,

192
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:52.690
it was this based on an analysis of all the jury strikes and capital cases all

193
00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:54.010
over the state of North Carolina.

194
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.020
What yes,

195
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.440
what they did and it was an enormous effort.

196
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.930
I think it was 173 cases,

197
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.250
uh,

198
00:08:03.251 --> 00:08:05.050
that went to,

199
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.460
that received the death sentence.

200
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.670
They polled every single juror,

201
00:08:09.671 --> 00:08:12.730
every single citizen that was called for jury service.

202
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:13.960
In those cases,

203
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:14.610
in,

204
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.450
in almost all of those cases,

205
00:08:16.451 --> 00:08:17.760
there were questionnaires,

206
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.050
often very voluminous questionnaires.

207
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:20.980
Um,

208
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.080
there was long transcripts.

209
00:08:23.081 --> 00:08:27.910
One thing about North Carolina is you have fairly broad Vardy and so the

210
00:08:27.911 --> 00:08:30.370
transcripts go thousands of pages.

211
00:08:30.371 --> 00:08:32.930
They're often weeks long jury,

212
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.390
the questioning of the jurors.

213
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.880
That's rare in the jury selection process.

214
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.350
That's exactly right.

215
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:43.590
And so these researchers use literally scores of law students and some certified

216
00:08:44.471 --> 00:08:45.304
attorneys,

217
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:45.791
uh,

218
00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:49.690
to go out to the county courthouses to pull,

219
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:50.620
uh,

220
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.210
above the questionnaires.

221
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.240
The clerks had their own charts where recorded and calculated the strikes

222
00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:00.660
peremptory and cause drawings for the government,

223
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:02.100
for the state and by the court.

224
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.700
All of these original documents were secured,

225
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.260
uh,

226
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:06.481
and,

227
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:09.810
and process by these independent researches and,

228
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.890
and the staff of law students and investigators that they supervise.

229
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:14.340
Uh,

230
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.660
it was an enormous effort.

231
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:16.411
Uh,

232
00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:17.730
there are thousands,

233
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:22.731
I believe the actual number was somewhere between seven and 8,000 citizens whose

234
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:25.430
responses were evaluated under a,

235
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.710
this incredibly complicated ma methodology.

236
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.053
Um,

237
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.800
and the results were,

238
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.430
were,

239
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.430
were simply powerful and eventually those results were presented to the court

240
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:39.390
and Cumberland County,

241
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:41.850
they're in North Carolina and a couple of cases.

242
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.380
Indeed,

243
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:43.520
uh,

244
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:43.720
it,

245
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.000
it first started,

246
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:45.651
first of all,

247
00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:48.270
I should say that we attempted to organize with the district,

248
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.860
with the district attorney's,

249
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.440
uh,

250
00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.630
sort of orderly way in orderly process of litigating the cases.

251
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.670
We had meetings with the DA,

252
00:09:56.671 --> 00:10:01.140
with the ags office to see if we could come up with sort of a complex litigation

253
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:01.974
strategy.

254
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:02.640
Uh,

255
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.570
in the end they,

256
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.493
they declined.

257
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.310
They didn't want an orderly process to it.

258
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.240
And so as it happens,

259
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:14.241
it was sort of left to a random selection of when a particular case would be

260
00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:16.200
filed and who would bid it on for hearing.

261
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.011
Uh,

262
00:10:17.011 --> 00:10:22.011
and we ended up with the first case being litigated in Cumberland County.

263
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:22.800
Uh,

264
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.910
as it happens,

265
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.390
uh,

266
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.700
the senior residence period court judge was,

267
00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:27.840
Cumberland County was a,

268
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.290
uh,

269
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:31.680
a judge named Greg weeks who was perhaps the most,

270
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:32.250
well,

271
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.860
one of the most well respected trial judges in the state.

272
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:35.821
Uh,

273
00:10:35.821 --> 00:10:36.930
incredibly bright,

274
00:10:36.931 --> 00:10:38.400
incredibly fair,

275
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:39.061
uh,

276
00:10:39.061 --> 00:10:42.990
and skilled with respect to criminal practice and criminal procedures.

277
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:45.960
Very well thought of in the county and in the state.

278
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.520
And he conducted a hearing after a,

279
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.280
and you'll appreciate this Dave,

280
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.940
after several motions of contingent to continue by the state,

281
00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.020
right,

282
00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.020
he bent over backwards to afford them every procedural opportunity to get ready

283
00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:01.830
for this,

284
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.720
the study that we hit prepared.

285
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.980
And they had claimed that they wanted to do some independent research and he

286
00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:09.690
gave them time to do that,

287
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:10.200
uh,

288
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.530
to amend their response to our study.

289
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.693
Uh,

290
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.700
and so there was an extensive hearing where the researches and gave,

291
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:20.520
you know,

292
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.390
days and days and days of testimony regarding the methodology,

293
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:25.763
um,

294
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.240
the sourcing of the documents and then the statistical analysis.

295
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.890
And you know,

296
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.710
even for a non lawyer at that time I had left,

297
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.460
I,

298
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.520
I had left the,

299
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.470
the trial team,

300
00:11:37.471 --> 00:11:39.720
but I sort of watched from a distance.

301
00:11:39.721 --> 00:11:41.250
It's a testimony came in.

302
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.060
Uh,

303
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.450
and the statistical evidence was really quite overwhelming.

304
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:46.763
Uh,

305
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.410
one of the things that I thought made it powerful,

306
00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:52.800
both as a piece of litigation but also as a method,

307
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:58.240
as a vehicle for public education was in addition to the statistics,

308
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:03.250
there was a good amount of anecdotal testimony about the practices and

309
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:04.090
Cumberland County,

310
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:04.871
uh,

311
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:05.704
in,

312
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:06.190
uh,

313
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:06.391
in,

314
00:12:06.391 --> 00:12:08.770
in very significant significant part,

315
00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:12.160
you had sick the senior members of the bar,

316
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.460
all of them white who offered affidavits about their exposure to,

317
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:18.650
uh,

318
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:22.000
the sort of discriminatory practices in the county.

319
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.590
And even these affidavits of lawyers who were not willing to suggest that there

320
00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:30.130
was racial animus by the assistant district attorneys.

321
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:30.964
And in fact,

322
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:31.190
the,

323
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.130
on one of those senior district attorneys.

324
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:37.600
And someone that I know and know very well and I would hesitate to accuse him of

325
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:38.860
racial animus.

326
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.940
Uh,

327
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:44.590
but patterns develop or even in the absence of Animus,

328
00:12:44.591 --> 00:12:49.300
there was a consistent pattern of African American jurors being excluded at

329
00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:51.610
these enormously high rates.

330
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:52.560
Um,

331
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:52.750
and,

332
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.610
and that was a piece of particular,

333
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.470
particularly powerful evidence.

334
00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:01.470
<v 1>So what you saw here is while you might look at one case and c five</v>

335
00:13:01.471 --> 00:13:02.760
African-american Struck,

336
00:13:02.761 --> 00:13:06.840
and it may not be that impressive when you put all the cases together,

337
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.400
the evidence was just too much to be a,

338
00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.540
you just couldn't be a matter of chance.

339
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.420
<v 2>That's exactly right.</v>

340
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.780
Over the course of 173 cases,

341
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:22.670
and I forget now how many of the hundred counties in North Carolina had death

342
00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:23.504
sentences.

343
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.630
You,

344
00:13:24.631 --> 00:13:29.570
you never found a county where the ratio was one,

345
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:35.350
one for one w which would be the statistical evidence of a perfect equality.

346
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:37.303
Could a person

347
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.790
<v 1>black has just as much chance of being struck or a person who is white has just</v>

348
00:13:40.791 --> 00:13:41.960
as much chance of being struck,

349
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:42.910
<v 2>right?</v>

350
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:43.181
I mean,

351
00:13:43.181 --> 00:13:46.170
there were those aberrations where you'd have a,

352
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.200
a county to the far west of the Far East where they just didn't use the death

353
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:52.480
penalty very much.

354
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.210
And so he had very little statistical basis.

355
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:55.691
Uh,

356
00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:57.520
and so some of that cases,

357
00:13:57.521 --> 00:13:59.090
some of the evidence there was weaker,

358
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.300
less powerful than in others.

359
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.010
But even in those cases,

360
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:03.700
you know,

361
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.700
the ratios were still in a suggestive of discrimination in Cumberland County

362
00:14:09.251 --> 00:14:09.671
itself.

363
00:14:09.671 --> 00:14:11.470
One of the powerful anecdotes was,

364
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:11.981
uh,

365
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:13.840
the cases of Burmeister and right.

366
00:14:13.841 --> 00:14:18.841
And these were the two young white men who went in Cumberland county hunting for

367
00:14:19.151 --> 00:14:20.260
black people to kill them.

368
00:14:20.261 --> 00:14:21.580
He found some black people killing.

369
00:14:21.581 --> 00:14:22.414
They killed him.

370
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.500
Uh,

371
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.360
interestingly in that case,

372
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.583
uh,

373
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.433
you know,

374
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.760
I think there were 10 African American jurors,

375
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:31.630
uh,

376
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:32.980
who were passed,

377
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:33.641
I believe,

378
00:14:33.641 --> 00:14:34.510
nine of them,

379
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:35.351
uh,

380
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:36.610
or pass by the state,

381
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.930
which was incredible.

382
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:39.040
I mean,

383
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.650
<v 1>polluted from service struck by that.</v>

384
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:41.271
<v 2>No,</v>

385
00:14:41.271 --> 00:14:41.690
no,

386
00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:42.290
they weren't.

387
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.800
They were allowed Paul out.

388
00:14:43.801 --> 00:14:44.240
I'm sorry.

389
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:44.930
Bye.

390
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.430
By the district attorney.

391
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:47.290
You know,

392
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:47.540
the,

393
00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:51.680
the one case where the discrimination was,

394
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:56.681
I think 0.5 happened to be in the case where the white defendants were charged

395
00:14:58.611 --> 00:15:02.780
with racially charged killings of African American jurors.

396
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.250
In that one case,

397
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.170
the prosecutors decided that,

398
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:06.291
oh,

399
00:15:06.291 --> 00:15:07.820
these African American jurors,

400
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.110
they can be fair.

401
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.650
You looked at the questionnaires and those questionnaires had all of the same

402
00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:16.280
characteristics of African American jurors that you had contacts with criminal

403
00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:17.270
justice system.

404
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.373
You had,

405
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:19.243
uh,

406
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:20.450
you know,

407
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:21.283
the same,

408
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.890
you know,

409
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.460
historically black colleges attended all of the same things that they would in

410
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:30.490
other cases used to exclude in that particular case they use because they

411
00:15:30.591 --> 00:15:33.590
believe race meant something.

412
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:34.520
And so they,

413
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.930
they purposely sat,

414
00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:36.710
you know,

415
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:41.420
African American jurors in that racially charged case with white defendants.

416
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.880
Uh,

417
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.430
so it's sort of a,

418
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:48.440
we looked at it as a flip of the racial dynamic,

419
00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:53.360
but it was still powerful evidence of the racial dynamic in that particular,

420
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:53.870
uh,

421
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.450
prosecuting office that race matters.

422
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:58.100
Race matters.

423
00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:58.963
In fact,

424
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.410
race was pivotal.

425
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:05.740
Race was determinative of the voir dire jury selection strategy of the district

426
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.103
<v 1>attorney.</v>

427
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:08.281
Now,

428
00:16:08.281 --> 00:16:11.040
what are the other anecdotal piece of evidence was this cheat sheet,

429
00:16:11.041 --> 00:16:11.440
right?

430
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.840
It's by the prosecutor.

431
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.330
<v 2>I and Steve,</v>

432
00:16:15.331 --> 00:16:17.880
I'm not quite sure how that came to light.

433
00:16:17.881 --> 00:16:18.051
I,

434
00:16:18.051 --> 00:16:18.720
I,

435
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.051
you know,

436
00:16:19.051 --> 00:16:19.890
I'm getting up in age,

437
00:16:19.891 --> 00:16:21.510
I just can't remember how it came.

438
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.520
But what we learned was,

439
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:23.851
uh,

440
00:16:23.851 --> 00:16:25.260
in 1995,

441
00:16:25.261 --> 00:16:29.700
the North Carolina and District Attorney Association conducted one of their

442
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.180
teaching seminars for the district attorneys from across the state.

443
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.810
And it was actually entitled the top guns seminar,

444
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:40.170
meaning the elite of the district attorneys,

445
00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:42.000
the assistant district attorneys would come.

446
00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:45.750
These would be the ones who were or practicing capital litigation.

447
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:47.790
And in that seminar,

448
00:16:47.791 --> 00:16:52.791
what they did was they literally prepared a cheat sheet of excuses.

449
00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.480
Protect is for excluding African Americans.

450
00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.710
And if you remembered Justice Marshall Thurgood Marshall's opinion,

451
00:17:01.711 --> 00:17:04.740
I think it was like a concurring opinion in Batson where he said,

452
00:17:04.741 --> 00:17:09.240
this three step process isn't going to work because we can imagine,

453
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.070
uh,

454
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:10.903
that they're going,

455
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:15.930
if you can so easily overcome a prime aphasia showing of,

456
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:20.700
of discrimination by asking the litigant to come up with reasons,

457
00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:21.151
well,

458
00:17:21.151 --> 00:17:24.990
that's going to be an illusory protection eye protection because it'd be so easy

459
00:17:24.991 --> 00:17:25.824
to overcome.

460
00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.620
And in fact with this top gun sheep,

461
00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.340
all you had to do is go through the 15 reasons,

462
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:33.360
uh,

463
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.230
eye contact,

464
00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.610
body language,

465
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:36.600
uh,

466
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.310
slow to respond.

467
00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.253
Um,

468
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:41.100
you know,

469
00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:43.351
<v 1>they simply,</v>

470
00:17:43.351 --> 00:17:47.700
it was a list of basically a list of race nude for reasons.

471
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:48.643
So when the,

472
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.300
uh,

473
00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.970
prosecutor struck on African American and the judge said,

474
00:17:51.971 --> 00:17:55.870
why you're just looked down at the list and picked one of the reasons you just

475
00:17:55.871 --> 00:17:56.740
pick a handful,

476
00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:57.710
right?

477
00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.770
<v 2>There'd be 15 reasons you pick your top four or five.</v>

478
00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.110
And those that seem to be most fitting,

479
00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:03.351
uh,

480
00:18:03.351 --> 00:18:07.250
with respect to the particular case or the particular juror.

481
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.360
Uh,

482
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.230
and I mean,

483
00:18:09.231 --> 00:18:14.231
it really did shine a light on the credibility of the,

484
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:14.920
uh,

485
00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.070
of the approach of the district attorneys and to know that what they're being

486
00:18:19.071 --> 00:18:21.110
trained and how they're being,

487
00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:21.460
uh,

488
00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.293
schools,

489
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:22.790
uh,

490
00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.700
not to protect the rights of good,

491
00:18:25.701 --> 00:18:30.701
hardworking citizens who respond to a summons for were for jury service,

492
00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:36.340
but they actually using this as a ploy to exclude those persons from a basic

493
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.690
responsibility and right of citizenship.

494
00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:43.030
Um,

495
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:43.863
and so

496
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.890
it was as disappointing as a member of the profession,

497
00:18:47.891 --> 00:18:52.700
as disappointing as a member of the community to know that our public officials

498
00:18:52.701 --> 00:18:55.030
are being trained in that way to,

499
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.910
to basically trample on the basic rights of citizens.

500
00:18:59.670 --> 00:18:59.761
<v 1>Well,</v>

501
00:18:59.761 --> 00:19:03.360
you mentioned this case went before one of the most senior and a respected

502
00:19:03.361 --> 00:19:04.021
judges in,

503
00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:05.370
in North Carolina.

504
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:06.550
Uh,

505
00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:06.840
how,

506
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.430
how did he handle,

507
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:13.490
or what was his determination of the evidence that was presented by both the

508
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:16.620
prosecution and the defense in this case?

509
00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.273
<v 2>Well,</v>

510
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.700
as I mentioned,

511
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.180
uh,

512
00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.460
he gave both sides,

513
00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:23.623
you know,

514
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.620
clear room as litigated to present their case.

515
00:19:27.621 --> 00:19:31.070
And I should say that the case that was presented,

516
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.980
the study that was presented by the district attorney as it,

517
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.150
as it turned out,

518
00:19:35.151 --> 00:19:39.800
was really just a collection of surveys that had been sent out.

519
00:19:39.801 --> 00:19:44.500
The district attorneys and the survey responses were basically the questions

520
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.691
like,

521
00:19:44.691 --> 00:19:48.050
did you intend to discriminate against African Americans?

522
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.000
What was your approach to jury selection?

523
00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:52.310
And those sorts of questions.

524
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:56.000
And it would not be surprising to note that most of the district attorney's that

525
00:19:56.001 --> 00:20:01.001
responded said they had no racial animus and they were colorblind and their jury

526
00:20:01.281 --> 00:20:02.114
selection.

527
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.560
So the judge went through and very workman like fashion,

528
00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.930
the evidence that was submitted at trial that the,

529
00:20:10.931 --> 00:20:11.764
um,

530
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:17.140
the very peer reviewed study from the Michigan State University researchers,

531
00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:20.623
um,

532
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.080
the independent statistician that had reviewed the study,

533
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:24.860
uh,

534
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.360
concurred with their approach.

535
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:27.230
We had,

536
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:28.063
uh,

537
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.200
we had a,

538
00:20:30.201 --> 00:20:33.770
an expert in and race in the criminal justices.

539
00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:34.670
Uh,

540
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.350
a person very well known to you,

541
00:20:36.351 --> 00:20:37.490
Bryan Stevenson,

542
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:42.700
who talked about similar studies in other southern states where the death

543
00:20:43.701 --> 00:20:44.870
penalty is employed.

544
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:49.000
He had an opportunity to not only the study,

545
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.510
but also the anecdotal evidence that was submitted.

546
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:53.830
So judge,

547
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:59.280
judge weeks reviewed the entirety of that testimony and not with reluctance,

548
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.410
but it was one of the most sober opinions you're going to read from a district,

549
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:05.831
from,

550
00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:06.460
uh,

551
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.860
from a sitting superior court.

552
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.810
And I thought it was just,

553
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.130
it was eloquent.

554
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:13.301
I mean,

555
00:21:13.301 --> 00:21:13.690
it,

556
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:14.200
it goes,

557
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:19.200
it went actually back to the history of slavery and Jim Crow and w w without at

558
00:21:21.701 --> 00:21:24.550
all calling any of the participants,

559
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.570
the district attorney,

560
00:21:25.571 --> 00:21:26.510
the prosecutor's,

561
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.370
uh,

562
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:32.370
the law enforcement officer's racist or even suggesting that they were racist,

563
00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:33.870
uh,

564
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:35.680
identify the problem with the,

565
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:40.770
some legacies of discrimination that then it's sort of tore it his heart because

566
00:21:42.221 --> 00:21:47.221
this was his home county impacted the process and he's in his court house.

567
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:52.090
And so I think while it may have been a very sober,

568
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:53.081
uh,

569
00:21:53.081 --> 00:21:54.010
opinion,

570
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.580
it was a powerful one because it reviewed,

571
00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.450
uh,

572
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:02.050
the evidence that was presented and the evidence he was quite simply

573
00:22:02.051 --> 00:22:02.920
overwhelming,

574
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.720
both statistical and anecdotal and yeah,

575
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.410
as litigators when you're,

576
00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:13.411
when you're in receipt of that kind of overwhelming evidence that the systems

577
00:22:13.481 --> 00:22:16.830
that you as a lawyer support and work with them,

578
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:22.170
that they are systematically being used to target and deprive hardworking

579
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.920
citizens of participation in the system.

580
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.880
It's a hard thing to accept when it's in black and white like that.

581
00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.190
And so I think the opinion that came out,

582
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:38.900
Steve had had to be a hundred page long order and it just sort of,

583
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:40.601
and work,

584
00:22:40.601 --> 00:22:44.830
been lying fashion just sort of work through the evidence and,

585
00:22:44.831 --> 00:22:45.031
and,

586
00:22:45.031 --> 00:22:46.270
and one of the things that you,

587
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:47.230
there was,

588
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:52.230
there was tremendous evidence on implicit racism that what we're talking about

589
00:22:53.141 --> 00:22:57.970
here is not any sort of conscious decision of district attorneys,

590
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.660
uh,

591
00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.210
to Shane criticized,

592
00:23:01.211 --> 00:23:03.820
demean African American citizens.

593
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:09.090
But part of the legacy is that the view that African Americans,

594
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.480
you know,

595
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.010
look at the government differently.

596
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:13.840
Look at crime differently,

597
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:16.600
value crime victims differently.

598
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.800
That's some of the baggage that we walk around with.

599
00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:21.641
And,

600
00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:21.881
uh,

601
00:23:21.881 --> 00:23:22.600
it was,

602
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:22.691
uh,

603
00:23:22.691 --> 00:23:23.860
Professor Summers,

604
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:24.310
uh,

605
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:25.143
from,

606
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:25.631
uh,

607
00:23:25.631 --> 00:23:27.550
I think it was Tufts.

608
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
I've been in Boston that presented some powerful evidence about implicit bias.

609
00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:35.953
Uh,

610
00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.940
and this is just the way folks organize their information.

611
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.830
It doesn't reflect Animus,

612
00:23:41.831 --> 00:23:44.710
but it reflects a convenience.

613
00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.740
It reflects,

614
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:46.470
um,

615
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.130
shortcuts to reaching conclusions.

616
00:23:49.131 --> 00:23:50.150
We all do it.

617
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:51.000
Uh,

618
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.040
and it's just that,

619
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:52.821
you know,

620
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:53.654
when,

621
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:54.620
when you,

622
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:59.680
when things become sort of received notions of truth about who's strong for law

623
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:02.210
enforcement or who's antigovernment,

624
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:07.090
those things help people organize the way they look at the world and how you

625
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.020
look at the citizens and the jury box.

626
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.050
And those are the biases that the study reflected.

627
00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.580
And ultimately,

628
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.301
uh,

629
00:24:14.301 --> 00:24:18.320
the judge weeks said violates our constitution.

630
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.070
Uh,

631
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:22.700
and most clearly violate the racial justice act.

632
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:26.300
Really a combination of history,

633
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:27.163
culture,

634
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.440
and unconscious or implicit racial attitudes that are the three pieces there,

635
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:35.900
right?

636
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.880
The three pieces came together,

637
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:38.820
uh,

638
00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:39.331
and,

639
00:24:39.331 --> 00:24:39.770
and,

640
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.750
and fit in a way that was,

641
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.880
I think every observer of the hearing thought was overwhelming.

642
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.193
Um,

643
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.860
yeah,

644
00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.800
I have not seen as,

645
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:52.703
as,

646
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.740
as one sided a,

647
00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.291
uh,

648
00:24:57.291 --> 00:25:02.291
an important legal engagement as that litigation was one sided,

649
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.720
not because of the amount of resources that were available to one side or the

650
00:25:07.731 --> 00:25:08.240
other.

651
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.650
You went into the courtroom,

652
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:10.180
you know,

653
00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.170
there are plenty of lawyers over there,

654
00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:12.621
you know,

655
00:25:12.621 --> 00:25:17.621
the lawyers over there had the benefit of all of the statewide resources of the

656
00:25:17.781 --> 00:25:19.790
attorney general's office and everything else.

657
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.410
It was one sided,

658
00:25:21.411 --> 00:25:23.640
Steve based on justice,

659
00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:25.280
substantive evidence,

660
00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.670
the scientific approach to the efforts,

661
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:30.140
the,

662
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:34.430
the professional management of the evidence and have the witnesses.

663
00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:35.573
Um,

664
00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:40.190
that was literally one of the most one sided pieces of litigation I,

665
00:25:40.191 --> 00:25:41.024
I've seen.

666
00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.800
And what was I think scary to people who were opposed to the,

667
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.940
uh,

668
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.800
to the objectives of the racial justice act is looking down the road,

669
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.290
looking at the future,

670
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.650
it was hard to see how that dynamic would change.

671
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.320
It was hard to see,

672
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:00.801
you know,

673
00:26:00.801 --> 00:26:05.801
what would be the best scientific criticism of the study.

674
00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:06.590
Yeah.

675
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:10.040
How would you attack some of the anecdotal evidence,

676
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:10.950
uh,

677
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:11.840
that was presented.

678
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.000
And I imagine those,

679
00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:17.300
those folks struggled mightily with that.

680
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.140
Yeah,

681
00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:22.070
I should say there were some strategic considerations from our side that

682
00:26:22.071 --> 00:26:22.940
influenced it,

683
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:23.510
you know,

684
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:28.510
the Racial Justice Act talk not just about jury selection but about the decision

685
00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:32.840
to seek the death penalty and the decision to impose to them.

686
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.610
I don't see those parts were involved in a separate study by the same

687
00:26:37.611 --> 00:26:42.320
researchers and Michigan State University and I for one and not a statistician.

688
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:43.740
Uh,

689
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:48.720
it could see in their report that the strengths of those other parts of the

690
00:26:48.721 --> 00:26:50.400
study wasn't as clear,

691
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.540
wasn't as strong as the jury selection study.

692
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.790
And so we made some strategic decisions that those parts of the study,

693
00:26:59.791 --> 00:27:02.700
we would not deal with us at this heroic,

694
00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:07.500
we essentially bifurcated the litigation between the jury selection part of the

695
00:27:07.501 --> 00:27:12.200
study and the decision to seek the death penalty on the district attorney's

696
00:27:12.201 --> 00:27:12.960
farm.

697
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.210
Uh,

698
00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:15.150
and just as a matter of science,

699
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:20.210
it would have been a much more complicated hearing to show that the decision to

700
00:27:21.601 --> 00:27:25.950
seek the death penalty violated the statute and or the constitution.

701
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:31.110
I think if we had made a different strategic move and put the entire study in,

702
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:31.920
uh,

703
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.120
in litigation,

704
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.630
things would not have been perhaps as clear,

705
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:41.610
perhaps as overwhelming as it was with the sort of bifurcated part.

706
00:27:41.611 --> 00:27:42.370
And I think,

707
00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:42.870
uh,

708
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:47.460
once that decision was made and you all know Kenny rose and ty hunter,

709
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:48.030
uh,

710
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:48.841
Jim Ferguson,

711
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:50.610
we were all part Jim Cooney,

712
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.440
we're all part of that decision.

713
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.950
You know,

714
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:57.950
that decision went a long way towards having a as clear an outcome,

715
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.840
a decision by the court and as overwhelming and evidentiary basis supporting

716
00:28:07.261 --> 00:28:09.570
that decision as we could have imagined.

717
00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:10.950
Uh,

718
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:11.761
sometimes Steve,

719
00:28:11.761 --> 00:28:12.810
you win too much.

720
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:13.651
Well,

721
00:28:13.651 --> 00:28:14.150
I was gonna

722
00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:14.451
<v 1>say,</v>

723
00:28:14.451 --> 00:28:19.451
I mean this is a very disturbing finding by a senior judge,

724
00:28:20.121 --> 00:28:22.190
a respect to judge there in North Carolina.

725
00:28:22.191 --> 00:28:25.670
I believe there were two cases in which judge weeks found,

726
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:26.421
uh,

727
00:28:26.421 --> 00:28:29.030
that race was a significant factor and therefore the,

728
00:28:29.031 --> 00:28:31.280
the death census had to be set aside.

729
00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.420
Uh,

730
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.780
what was the response of North Carolina,

731
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.070
uh,

732
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:41.930
to these disturbing findings about the fact that race had played such a role in

733
00:28:41.931 --> 00:28:44.360
the selection of juries there and North Carolina?

734
00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:45.811
<v 2>Well,</v>

735
00:28:45.811 --> 00:28:46.230
uh,

736
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.160
there was the one case,

737
00:28:47.161 --> 00:28:52.161
Marcus Robinson was the first case after that three cases were combined.

738
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.330
And so there was a second

739
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.070
piece of litigation,

740
00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.950
second set of hearings.

741
00:28:58.951 --> 00:29:00.930
But they combine three cases in that,

742
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.130
in that second case,

743
00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.061
uh,

744
00:29:03.061 --> 00:29:05.280
the same kind of evidence.

745
00:29:05.281 --> 00:29:07.110
Many of the same witnesses were called,

746
00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.070
uh,

747
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:12.690
the government had obviously more of an opportunity to be prepared for the,

748
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.160
the nature of the evidence.

749
00:29:14.161 --> 00:29:14.994
And Steve,

750
00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:15.930
uh,

751
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:16.800
their presentation,

752
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.560
the second was no stronger,

753
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.290
no more effective than the first.

754
00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:23.693
And in fact,

755
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:24.763
you know,

756
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.940
as a criminal defense lawyer,

757
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.990
you rarely look forward to retrials because you think the other side is more

758
00:29:30.991 --> 00:29:31.824
prepared.

759
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.410
You shot a gun,

760
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:33.691
you know,

761
00:29:33.691 --> 00:29:34.080
you've,

762
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.790
you've exposed your evidence,

763
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:38.610
surely they'll have all these powerful comebacks.

764
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.300
Well,

765
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:39.631
Steve,

766
00:29:39.631 --> 00:29:40.740
that wasn't the case here.

767
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.153
Um,

768
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:46.330
this is one of those situations where just the merits of the evidence,

769
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.880
both statistical and anecdotal,

770
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:55.570
it didn't matter if they had another six months to go after it,

771
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:56.321
you know,

772
00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:58.730
a doubling of their budget to go after it,

773
00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:00.730
know they were not going to change,

774
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:01.200
uh,

775
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.580
the essential facts of the litigation.

776
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:04.833
And they didn't.

777
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:06.910
And if anything,

778
00:30:06.911 --> 00:30:08.230
because of the three cases,

779
00:30:08.231 --> 00:30:11.080
we had more anecdotes to pick from.

780
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:11.970
Uh,

781
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:15.220
just sort of add to the spice of things,

782
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:15.731
uh,

783
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:17.310
at that hearing than,

784
00:30:17.311 --> 00:30:17.640
uh,

785
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:17.860
than,

786
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:18.010
uh,

787
00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:18.401
the,

788
00:30:18.401 --> 00:30:18.610
uh,

789
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:19.540
earlier hearing.

790
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:20.703
Uh,

791
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.650
the result was that it was exactly the same.

792
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:24.670
Uh,

793
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:27.430
but I believe it was in between those two hearings.

794
00:30:27.431 --> 00:30:27.881
Steve,

795
00:30:27.881 --> 00:30:28.091
if,

796
00:30:28.091 --> 00:30:29.680
I'm not sure,

797
00:30:29.681 --> 00:30:31.480
I've got the dates precisely in mind,

798
00:30:31.481 --> 00:30:34.360
but I think it was shortly after the Marcus Robinson hearing,

799
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:39.540
but before the golfing hearings that the repeal of the Racial Justice Act

800
00:30:40.421 --> 00:30:41.254
happening,

801
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:41.561
uh,

802
00:30:41.561 --> 00:30:42.880
and there were negotiations,

803
00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:43.301
first of all,

804
00:30:43.301 --> 00:30:45.850
there was the amendment of the Racial Justice Act,

805
00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:46.811
uh,

806
00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:48.160
which you know,

807
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:53.460
was sort of a compromise reached by the partisans at the General Assembly,

808
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:55.230
uh,

809
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.460
where they need to essential provisions.

810
00:30:57.461 --> 00:31:01.360
One is that statistical evidence by itself,

811
00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:01.960
uh,

812
00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.960
it could not result in the overturning of a death sentence.

813
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:05.801
Uh,

814
00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:09.490
and basically what that meant is you'd have to provide anecdotes,

815
00:31:09.491 --> 00:31:14.491
descriptions of discriminatory behavior by the local district attorney or the

816
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:16.840
court system.

817
00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:17.920
And,

818
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.070
uh,

819
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:20.380
the second provision was that you,

820
00:31:20.381 --> 00:31:23.380
you'd have to show evidence within the case itself,

821
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.390
the defendant's case itself,

822
00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:26.291
uh,

823
00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:29.680
that he was subjected to actions that were discriminatory.

824
00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:30.963
Uh,

825
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:31.510
and,

826
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.610
and I believe that happened.

827
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.860
The amendment happened before the second suit,

828
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:40.950
say second set of litigation didn't change the outcome both because the

829
00:31:41.141 --> 00:31:44.620
litigators were prepared with the anecdotal evidence,

830
00:31:44.621 --> 00:31:49.610
the non statistical evidence to supplement the work by the researchers from

831
00:31:49.611 --> 00:31:51.040
Michigan State University.

832
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.790
And that included evidence of,

833
00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:55.181
you know,

834
00:31:55.181 --> 00:31:57.190
race specific discriminatory,

835
00:31:57.191 --> 00:31:58.180
specific stuff,

836
00:31:58.540 --> 00:31:58.900
uh,

837
00:31:58.900 --> 00:31:59.281
in,

838
00:31:59.281 --> 00:31:59.801
in the,

839
00:31:59.801 --> 00:32:00.820
in the case itself.

840
00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:02.283
Um,

841
00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:02.981
you know,

842
00:32:02.981 --> 00:32:03.641
one of the things,

843
00:32:03.641 --> 00:32:03.971
Steve,

844
00:32:03.971 --> 00:32:04.470
that,

845
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:05.303
uh,

846
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:10.590
has been powerful in the litigation and the preparation of these cases is once

847
00:32:11.051 --> 00:32:13.600
you get past the statistical evidence,

848
00:32:13.601 --> 00:32:18.070
and for some of us it's this trickle evidence is it's not boring,

849
00:32:18.071 --> 00:32:20.110
but it can all talk about that for so long.

850
00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.280
Right?

851
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:21.551
I mean,

852
00:32:21.551 --> 00:32:22.600
the results are,

853
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:23.111
you know,

854
00:32:23.111 --> 00:32:26.020
56% of African Americans are excluded,

855
00:32:26.021 --> 00:32:27.520
24% are white,

856
00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.250
and they'll vary from county to county.

857
00:32:30.251 --> 00:32:32.020
They are very over time.

858
00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:32.560
But you know,

859
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.350
that's basically the band of that evidence.

860
00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:36.131
You know,

861
00:32:36.131 --> 00:32:41.131
what's so disturbing or these affidavits from individual citizens,

862
00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:42.160
um,

863
00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:42.400
uh,

864
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.020
affidavits from jurors who,

865
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.093
you know,

866
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.460
who misrepresented things in their questionnaire,

867
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:50.353
um,

868
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.650
uh,

869
00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:54.200
about their own histories with violence or with rays.

870
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.610
And these things came up the,

871
00:32:56.611 --> 00:33:01.611
the rouse opinion where a one white juror simply didn't tell Fox that his mother

872
00:33:03.291 --> 00:33:07.970
had been murdered by an African American and he thought that all black men were

873
00:33:07.971 --> 00:33:12.410
violent and he didn't feel the need to share that in jury selection.

874
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:13.040
Well,

875
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.870
that's not part of the study.

876
00:33:14.871 --> 00:33:17.630
That's not part of the research piece,

877
00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:21.250
but does it inform the,

878
00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:21.960
uh,

879
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.300
the,

880
00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.770
the quality of justice in that county,

881
00:33:24.771 --> 00:33:26.660
those post conviction motions?

882
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:27.390
Uh,

883
00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:27.980
Roe v,

884
00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:32.320
which revealed that bias we're were made shortly after the trial.

885
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.490
It didn't affect the post conviction core.

886
00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:35.890
<v 0>Okay.</v>

887
00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:37.630
<v 2>Didn't provide any relief.</v>

888
00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:41.950
So we're now through the guise of the racial justice act,

889
00:33:41.951 --> 00:33:46.951
looking a conviction and a death sentence that ignored the fact that a juror

890
00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:52.920
literally misrepresentative not lied under oath under questioning and kept from

891
00:33:53.981 --> 00:33:58.780
the litigators evidence that was critical to his fairness to sit in the trial.

892
00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:02.020
And our court system said that didn't matter.

893
00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:03.540
<v 0>Okay.</v>

894
00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:03.810
<v 2>Uh,</v>

895
00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:04.201
it's a,

896
00:34:04.201 --> 00:34:09.201
it's a sort of constant refrain that the value and the quality of African

897
00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:16.770
American citizens and it just doesn't measure up to the value and the

898
00:34:17.011 --> 00:34:18.420
appreciation given,

899
00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:18.810
uh,

900
00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:23.810
to citizens who are white who are responding to their call,

901
00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:24.953
call to duty.

902
00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:26.210
And it's just,

903
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:31.210
it was just a constant drumbeat of evidence of evidence after evidence if that's

904
00:34:31.441 --> 00:34:34.260
the case and counties throughout the state.

905
00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:35.573
Um,

906
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.130
one of the tragedies I see,

907
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:38.640
uh,

908
00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:43.640
we're not quite sure what the effect of the other repeal of the racial Justice

909
00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:44.970
Act will be.

910
00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:49.970
It's truly the legislature after that amendment that you talked about after the

911
00:34:50.431 --> 00:34:51.121
second hearing,

912
00:34:51.121 --> 00:34:53.250
the actually repeal the act or is that correct?

913
00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:54.713
That's correct.

914
00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:55.573
Um,

915
00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:57.690
and you know,

916
00:34:57.691 --> 00:35:00.690
we're still litigating with the impact of that repeal is,

917
00:35:00.691 --> 00:35:01.750
but you know,

918
00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:06.770
after the elections of 2010 then elections of 2012,

919
00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:08.723
uh,

920
00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:14.360
the partisans opponents had control of the State House,

921
00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:15.720
state Senate,

922
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:16.680
and the governor's seat.

923
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:22.170
And they simply ran the table on the racial justice act and just took it off the

924
00:35:22.171 --> 00:35:26.970
books and see if you'll note that it was the same running of the table that

925
00:35:26.971 --> 00:35:29.190
resulted in the most outrageous,

926
00:35:29.191 --> 00:35:33.360
most notorious voter suppression legislation in the country.

927
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.550
You can't really keep them separate.

928
00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.170
It's part of the same initiative.

929
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:37.921
Uh,

930
00:35:37.921 --> 00:35:39.870
but with respect to the racial justice act,

931
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.720
it took the racial justice act off the books.

932
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.320
Now for the hundred and 58 people who had filed petitions.

933
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.160
And those petitions are in one state of litigation or another.

934
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.860
It's not clear whether that repeal,

935
00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.290
how that repeal will affect their rights.

936
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:58.890
We're continuing to litigate those cases.

937
00:35:59.280 --> 00:35:59.731
Uh,

938
00:35:59.731 --> 00:36:04.731
but one of the things is absolutely painful to me is that the public education

939
00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:10.161
that goes on in the litigation of these cases and in the small county

940
00:36:10.951 --> 00:36:11.880
courthouses,

941
00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:12.311
uh,

942
00:36:12.311 --> 00:36:17.311
of our state and getting enormous publicity in that county and as such,

943
00:36:17.491 --> 00:36:18.960
a missed opportunity,

944
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:19.590
uh,

945
00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:24.590
for public education for our young voters are middle aged voters to see what

946
00:36:25.951 --> 00:36:27.410
happens in the courthouse.

947
00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:27.990
Right.

948
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.310
You know,

949
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:29.490
people are not,

950
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:30.150
uh,

951
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:34.230
often attuned to the country and the state civil rights history.

952
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.570
They even less attuned often to what happens in their county courthouse.

953
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:44.910
And the Racial Justice Act Litigation was an opportunity to bring all of that

954
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.870
fairly remarkable history,

955
00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:50.670
local history,

956
00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:51.190
uh,

957
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:52.860
before the eyes of,

958
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.790
you know,

959
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:56.400
local citizens at the county level,

960
00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:58.110
at the municipal level.

961
00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.281
And yeah,

962
00:36:59.281 --> 00:37:02.700
I think there's just very few public education vehicles,

963
00:37:02.701 --> 00:37:04.810
as powerful as,

964
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:09.910
as the litigation and the racial justice act is a tragedy to shut that door,

965
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:15.710
to prevent our citizens from having that educational experience.

966
00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:20.870
<v 1>And of course in other states that educational experience is not taking place</v>

967
00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:23.330
because there is no racial justice act.

968
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:24.441
And it's,

969
00:37:24.441 --> 00:37:24.770
uh,

970
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:28.550
certainly sobering at the North Carolina legislature upon finding,

971
00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:29.540
uh,

972
00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.570
have judicial findings of race entering into the,

973
00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:37.660
the influencing these capital cases instead of dealing with the fact that race

974
00:37:37.731 --> 00:37:38.780
is entering into them,

975
00:37:38.781 --> 00:37:40.640
repeal the racial Justice Act so that,

976
00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:41.600
uh,

977
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.620
no longer would those issues be discussed with that public education and take

978
00:37:45.621 --> 00:37:46.490
place and would,

979
00:37:46.491 --> 00:37:47.210
uh,

980
00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:48.043
um,

981
00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.970
the state grapple with the issue of race and,

982
00:37:50.971 --> 00:37:51.340
and,

983
00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.960
and the death pollack basically that's off the table now,

984
00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:54.460
right?

985
00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:55.293
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

986
00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:55.750
Uh,

987
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.920
it,

988
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.500
it,

989
00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:57.350
it's a shameful,

990
00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.200
it's a shameful occurrence and,

991
00:38:00.201 --> 00:38:01.034
uh,

992
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:01.760
you know,

993
00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.600
it's hard,

994
00:38:02.601 --> 00:38:03.620
hard to know,

995
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.823
um,

996
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:06.200
because the,

997
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.390
the thing has become such a partisan issue,

998
00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:09.000
right?

999
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:09.410
Eh,

1000
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:10.243
how,

1001
00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.860
how people of goodwill,

1002
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:14.420
uh,

1003
00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:19.420
people good faith can endorse the strategy which shuts the door and that kind of

1004
00:38:19.611 --> 00:38:20.840
public education,

1005
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.470
uh,

1006
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:26.470
without thinking or suggesting that they harbor some inappropriate biases.

1007
00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:28.903
Um,

1008
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.440
yeah.

1009
00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.400
And yeah,

1010
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:35.160
it does it help to suggest that it's part of a partisan agendas of the people

1011
00:38:35.161 --> 00:38:38.040
can join in that agenda without sharing,

1012
00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.073
uh,

1013
00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.830
the animus or the bias.

1014
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:41.401
Yeah.

1015
00:38:41.401 --> 00:38:44.430
It's like counting the angels on the head of a pin.

1016
00:38:44.431 --> 00:38:46.230
It's an exercise I find futile.

1017
00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:47.453
Uh,

1018
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:47.910
but it's,

1019
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:48.021
it,

1020
00:38:48.021 --> 00:38:48.870
it's painful.

1021
00:38:48.871 --> 00:38:50.580
The result is something that's painful.

1022
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:51.481
Uh,

1023
00:38:51.481 --> 00:38:53.340
I'm not sure how we reverse,

1024
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:54.210
uh,

1025
00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:55.560
that kind of decision.

1026
00:38:55.561 --> 00:38:58.950
So as a matter of state public policy as a matter of,

1027
00:38:59.210 --> 00:38:59.760
uh,

1028
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.170
you,

1029
00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:00.480
yeah,

1030
00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.460
educational potential in the state.

1031
00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:07.460
I don't know how we get back the opportunity to present a witness like Bryan

1032
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:12.210
Stevenson and to have his testimony covered locally by radio stations,

1033
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.770
local newspapers,

1034
00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:18.240
and to have someone of that quality review,

1035
00:39:18.241 --> 00:39:23.241
the evidence has been presented and we'll link that to the history and legacy of

1036
00:39:24.031 --> 00:39:29.031
racism and race discrimination in our justice system in the south.

1037
00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:33.570
That's an opportunity that you're not going to often get in Cumberland county.

1038
00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:34.930
It's not an opportunity to,

1039
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.350
you're often gone to get and union county,

1040
00:39:37.351 --> 00:39:39.720
North Carolina and Duplin County,

1041
00:39:39.721 --> 00:39:40.710
North Carolina,

1042
00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.920
and that's what the Racial Justice Act afforded the citizens of North Carolina.

1043
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.150
And we've lost that now.

1044
00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:49.921
Well Henderson Hell,

1045
00:39:49.921 --> 00:39:54.921
thank you very much for describing this time and what the state of North

1046
00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.330
Carolina did and what they found and uh,

1047
00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.830
it's immensely helpful for us understanding me.

1048
00:39:59.831 --> 00:40:00.121
Thanks.

1049
00:40:00.121 --> 00:40:00.954
Thank you very much.

1050
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:01.861
Thank you.

1051
00:40:01.861 --> 00:40:02.670
Save.

1052
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:03.090
Good luck.
