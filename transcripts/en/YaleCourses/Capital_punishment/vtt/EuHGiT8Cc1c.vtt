1
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.450
In civil cases where money is at stake.

2
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.350
There is extensive discovery by the parties.

3
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.213
In other words,

4
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.300
in a civil case,

5
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:25.260
each side we'll give the other side the name of all the witnesses that know

6
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:27.600
anything about the issue in dispute.

7
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.600
The parties will even be able to take depositions.

8
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:31.051
That is,

9
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:35.160
they'll be able to sit down with the witnesses one at a time and ask them

10
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:37.290
questions and the witnesses will answer the questions.

11
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:39.360
The court reporter will take it down a,

12
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:43.230
there'll be able to see any documents that are going to be introduced that have

13
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:44.820
any relevance to the case.

14
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:45.840
They'll inspect,

15
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.770
uh,

16
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.840
maybe the scene of where the incident was,

17
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:50.010
whatever it may be.

18
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.310
But basically by the time the trial starts,

19
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.390
uh,

20
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.470
everyone will know everything about the facts of the case and the question will

21
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:03.270
just be presenting those facts and having the jury decided criminal cases where

22
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.340
life and liberty at stake quite different.

23
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.970
Uh,

24
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.620
in many jurisdictions in the country,

25
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:08.520
in many places,

26
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:10.020
it's trial by ambush.

27
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.801
Uh,

28
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:14.610
the defense really doesn't know who a lot of the witnesses are until they take

29
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:16.410
the witness stand and testify against them.

30
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.520
Uh,

31
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.480
the criminal rules generally prescribed that.

32
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:21.961
And again,

33
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:24.600
this is generalizing over 50 states and the federal government.

34
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:27.330
So there are differences in each place,

35
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.890
but generally the prosecution must give the defense lawyer,

36
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.460
uh,

37
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.180
any statements made by his or her client.

38
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.140
Uh,

39
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.820
any documents or tangible evidence that might be a in the possession of the

40
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:43.860
prosecution that might be used,

41
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:44.251
uh,

42
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:44.590
that,

43
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.770
uh,

44
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.870
that can be seen,

45
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.950
uh,

46
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.560
any mental or physical examinations,

47
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.130
uh,

48
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.480
which are taking place,

49
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.900
uh,

50
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.240
the defendant's prior record and other words,

51
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:55.200
the rap sheet,

52
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.831
uh,

53
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:59.100
and a summary of any testimony of expert witnesses.

54
00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.790
Uh,

55
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.960
but that's the minimal,

56
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:03.840
that's about all that some jurisdictions,

57
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:04.260
uh,

58
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.093
provide.

59
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.970
Uh,

60
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.440
so as I said,

61
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:12.441
often it may not know if a witness what a witness is going to say until that

62
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:16.050
person takes the witness stand or even who the witnesses are or what the

63
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:17.400
background of the witnesses are.

64
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.061
Well,

65
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:20.700
the Supreme Court has held that at least in some instances,

66
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.510
uh,

67
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.650
particularly when there's evidence that tends to show the defendant did not do

68
00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:25.771
it,

69
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.270
or at least can be arguably,

70
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.410
uh,

71
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.420
are used in an argument for innocence,

72
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.961
uh,

73
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:35.850
that the prosecution does have some responsibility to disclose evidence.

74
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.043
Um,

75
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.080
the Supreme Court held in,

76
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.710
uh,

77
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.820
1963,

78
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.510
uh,

79
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.100
that the prosecution is required to disclose any evidence that's favorable to

80
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:47.791
the accused.

81
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:50.880
This was in the state called in a case called Brady versus Maryland.

82
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.940
And that cases often just used as a,

83
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.610
a term now for the disclosure of evidence,

84
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:57.690
Brady evidence,

85
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.321
uh,

86
00:02:58.321 --> 00:02:59.410
as people will call it.

87
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:01.420
But we're talking about exculpatory evidence.

88
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.931
Uh,

89
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.210
not long after Brady was decided,

90
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.781
uh,

91
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:07.810
the court decided in another case called Miller versus paid.

92
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.831
In that case,

93
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:13.120
the prosecution had argued throughout the trial that the stains on some

94
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:15.730
undershorts that had been recovered from the defendant,

95
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.391
uh,

96
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:21.010
were blood when in fact the prosecutor knew all along they were paint.

97
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.790
Uh,

98
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.900
and that there were not.

99
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.900
So the Supreme Court reversed that case and made clear,

100
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.390
uh,

101
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.000
that in that kind of situation,

102
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.360
uh,

103
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.840
that evidence has to be disclosed to the defense.

104
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.710
Uh,

105
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.710
the court has also said that a prosecution cannot knowingly presents a false

106
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:38.554
testimony,

107
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.160
uh,

108
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.400
during the prosecution's case in a case called an to pool versus Illinois and

109
00:03:43.401 --> 00:03:45.040
decided in 1959,

110
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.761
uh,

111
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:50.440
the prosecutors should witness the witness testifying for the prosecution,

112
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:53.290
said he got nothing in exchange for his testimony,

113
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:54.011
no reward,

114
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:55.540
no incentives whatsoever.

115
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.590
In fact,

116
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.041
uh,

117
00:03:57.041 --> 00:04:00.880
the prosecutor had promised to seek a reduction in his sentence.

118
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.920
So,

119
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.201
uh,

120
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:03.340
the supreme court said,

121
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:05.920
you can't do that if you make promises.

122
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:08.410
If the prosecution makes promises to a witness,

123
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.950
uh,

124
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.880
then the prosecution has to disclose that to the defense and that can be used to

125
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:17.881
argue the credibility of that witness a and Gago versus United States.

126
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:19.780
And I decided in 1972,

127
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.140
a one prosecutor had a promise to witness that he would not be prosecuted if he

128
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:26.020
testified.

129
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.681
Uh,

130
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:30.160
but then there was another prosecutor who didn't know anything about that

131
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.590
particularly bargain that had been reached.

132
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.341
A,

133
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:35.020
and when the witness testified,

134
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:37.300
he said there had been no promises made to him.

135
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.261
Again,

136
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:39.400
the Supreme Court said,

137
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.060
uh,

138
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.890
the entire prosecution office has to be responsible for knowledge,

139
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.251
uh,

140
00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:46.084
of what,

141
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.820
uh,

142
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.160
deals have been made,

143
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.821
uh,

144
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.920
and reversed that case as well.

145
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.390
These are the easy cases.

146
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:55.780
These are not cases that are going to be hard to decide.

147
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.500
Uh,

148
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.500
but we will see that this becomes much more complicated,

149
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.831
uh,

150
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:06.310
as the cases become more involved.

151
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:09.910
Or is there more factual disputes in the cases as a question of whether the

152
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:11.290
evidence just tends to,

153
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.280
uh,

154
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.710
raise some question about the strength of the prosecution's case or,

155
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.980
or whether it's actually exculpatory.

156
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.970
Uh,

157
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.803
so,

158
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.140
uh,

159
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.470
and of course the other part of this that I should mention is the question of

160
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.140
whether or not the defense ever becomes aware of it.

161
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.490
Undoubtedly,

162
00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:31.150
there are many cases where there's evidence such as what I'm going to talk about

163
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:33.550
in the graves case and John Thompson's case,

164
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:34.121
uh,

165
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:35.470
which never comes to light.

166
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.161
Uh,

167
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:37.720
and therefore there is no issue,

168
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.290
uh,

169
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.100
but where the evidence is discovered serendipitously,

170
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.700
uh,

171
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.060
someone calls the defense lawyer and tells them about evidence.

172
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.270
Often there's a freedom of information act or open records act litigation that

173
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:55.000
produces evidence that the defense did not know at the time of trial.

174
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.260
And if that's the case,

175
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.330
then there may be litigation about whether or not,

176
00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.870
uh,

177
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.640
a case has to be set aside.

178
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.880
A will cause the failure to disclose exculpatory evidence to supreme court.

179
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.911
Uh,

180
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:09.380
in later cases though,

181
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.160
uh,

182
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.390
cut back quite a bit on what's required in terms of disclosure.

183
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.290
Uh,

184
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.951
first of all,

185
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:16.790
the court said,

186
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.510
uh,

187
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.343
there,

188
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.990
uh,

189
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.540
it was no violation,

190
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:23.570
at least in the case of augurous versus United States.

191
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:27.410
This was a failure to disclose the criminal record,

192
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.101
uh,

193
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:28.934
of a witness.

194
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.511
Uh,

195
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:33.350
one of the things the court looked at in deciding that case was the fact that

196
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.610
there'd never been a request,

197
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.210
uh,

198
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.940
made,

199
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:36.320
uh,

200
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.130
by,

201
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.461
uh,

202
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:39.410
the defense force for that record.

203
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.011
Uh,

204
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:43.160
and the court said this did not violate Brady versus Maryland.

205
00:06:43.161 --> 00:06:45.290
This was not a violation of due process,

206
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:47.380
which is the part of the constitution,

207
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.490
the due process clause of the 14th amendment,

208
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:50.240
uh,

209
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.073
that the,

210
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.650
uh,

211
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.650
that states are required to provide this information or the fifth amendment in,

212
00:06:56.741 --> 00:06:57.740
in federal cases.

213
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:58.431
Uh,

214
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:01.580
the court said the prosecutor may not have known the evidence was exculpatory or

215
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:05.570
may not have known that the defendant wanted it also,

216
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:05.991
uh,

217
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:09.560
there's no violation if the evidence is not material.

218
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.520
Uh,

219
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.450
that was what the court said in a case called the United States versus Bagley.

220
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:15.530
Uh,

221
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:15.981
there,

222
00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:20.030
even though the defense requested that any deals and promises that had been made

223
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:22.070
and the prosecution had not disclosed,

224
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.150
uh,

225
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.120
witnesses had been paid money for the testimony they gave.

226
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:26.571
Uh,

227
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:28.430
the court refused to reverse the case,

228
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:28.940
uh,

229
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.550
and said it was not material.

230
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:32.091
Uh,

231
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:34.670
that evidence is material only.

232
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:38.990
If there's a reasonable probability that had the evidence been disclosed to the

233
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:39.441
defense,

234
00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:42.500
the result of the proceeding would have been different.

235
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.840
This is really a harmless error standard.

236
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:45.530
Uh,

237
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.170
basically the court is saying this is evidence that,

238
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.220
uh,

239
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.440
even if it had been disclosed to the defense,

240
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.140
uh,

241
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.260
it would not have had an impact on the outcome.

242
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.093
Of course,

243
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:59.000
the argument is that appellate judges who didn't see the witnesses,

244
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:00.380
who didn't sit in the jury box,

245
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:02.870
who don't know how the jury has assessed the case,

246
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:08.470
may not be able to really know whether or not had this evidence been presented

247
00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:09.524
to the jury.

248
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:09.750
Uh,

249
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.240
it would have affected the outcome.

250
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:11.790
Uh,

251
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:12.623
or not.

252
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:13.783
Um,

253
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.760
Anthony Graves case provides,

254
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.240
uh,

255
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.820
an example of how close these questions can be sometimes a,

256
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.030
the key witness,

257
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:23.681
uh,

258
00:08:23.681 --> 00:08:27.230
against Anthony Graves who was synced to death in Texas was a fellow named

259
00:08:27.231 --> 00:08:28.280
Robert Earl Carter.

260
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.170
And he had told the prosecutors during some private meetings with them to things

261
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:34.010
that were important.

262
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:34.844
One,

263
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:35.150
uh,

264
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.190
that graves had nothing to do with the crime.

265
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.941
Uh,

266
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:38.810
and second,

267
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:40.700
that Carter's wife cookie,

268
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.520
uh,

269
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.780
was her name was involved in the crime with him.

270
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.591
Uh,

271
00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:46.041
of course,

272
00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:47.000
that trial,

273
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:52.001
he testified that graves participated in the crime and didn't make any mention

274
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.230
of cookie participating,

275
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:54.780
uh,

276
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.800
in the trial.

277
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:56.430
Uh,

278
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.480
the court found that,

279
00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:58.140
uh,

280
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.610
the prosecutor did not disclose this information even though graves counsel had

281
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:03.444
requested it.

282
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.261
In fact,

283
00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:07.380
the prosecutor had deliberately misled,

284
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:07.951
uh,

285
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:11.760
the defense counsel with regard to these statements that had made.

286
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.230
And in addition to that,

287
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:16.410
the prosecutor called a Texas Ranger,

288
00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:17.060
uh,

289
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:17.893
Kaufman,

290
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:18.330
uh,

291
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.900
who testified that Carter had never said anything different.

292
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:22.111
Now,

293
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:22.944
obviously,

294
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:23.551
uh,

295
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:24.960
the prosecutor knew,

296
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.650
uh,

297
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:26.700
that this statement,

298
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:27.391
uh,

299
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:28.710
that Ranger Kaufman,

300
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:29.400
uh,

301
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.150
made,

302
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.421
uh,

303
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:31.380
was not true.

304
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:32.730
He knew that it was false.

305
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:33.481
Uh,

306
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:34.590
and as a result,

307
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.550
uh,

308
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.920
the United States Court of Appeals,

309
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:38.340
uh,

310
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.110
vacated graves conviction,

311
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.240
his case was sent back.

312
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.171
Uh,

313
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:47.220
and it's interesting to look at the history of the case before it made its way

314
00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:50.820
to the United States Court of Appeals for the fifth circuit.

315
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.710
Grades had first tried to raise this and the Texas Court of criminal appeals.

316
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:56.370
Uh,

317
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.550
but unfortunately I had a very bad lawyer with very little experience,

318
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.390
uh,

319
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.223
who,

320
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:01.860
uh,

321
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.120
didn't raise the issue.

322
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.220
And then when they tried to raise it a second time,

323
00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:07.140
the court held that it was barred,

324
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:10.200
that it was procedurally barred because it hadn't been raised the first time.

325
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:10.950
Uh,

326
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.540
then when it gets to federal court,

327
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.850
the Magistrate Judge who first examines the case and then the district judge who

328
00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:18.840
examined the case,

329
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.560
uh,

330
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.460
conclude,

331
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:21.091
uh,

332
00:10:21.091 --> 00:10:23.880
that there was not a substantial probability,

333
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:24.611
uh,

334
00:10:24.611 --> 00:10:25.444
that the,

335
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:25.830
uh,

336
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.240
outcome would've been different.

337
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.050
Uh,

338
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.270
had the case gone.

339
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:31.383
Uh,

340
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.900
had the evidence been disclosed.

341
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.183
Um,

342
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.240
the United States Court of Appeals for the fifth circuit says first of all that

343
00:10:39.241 --> 00:10:43.650
the provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act did not

344
00:10:43.651 --> 00:10:44.484
apply.

345
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.911
Uh,

346
00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:45.721
in this case,

347
00:10:45.721 --> 00:10:46.554
this is a,

348
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.720
as we've talked about in other segments,

349
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:49.800
uh,

350
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.800
greatly restricts the power of the federal court to issue a writ of Habeas

351
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:55.621
Corpus.

352
00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:57.720
In a case like this,

353
00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:58.230
uh,

354
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.420
the court also found there was cause,

355
00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:01.170
uh,

356
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.430
for the procedural to fault that were some issue is not presented because was

357
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:06.900
there a reason for that?

358
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:07.681
Uh,

359
00:11:07.681 --> 00:11:12.570
and the court said there was in this case because the state did not disclose the

360
00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:15.990
evidence and little after the case had already gone through,

361
00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:19.770
at least disclose some of the evidence until the case had already gone through

362
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.120
the entire,

363
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.630
uh,

364
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.463
state,

365
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.250
uh,

366
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:27.120
appellate process and was actually in federal court when the evidence came to

367
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:27.421
light.

368
00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:31.800
So graves can hardly be faulted for not having raised the issue in state court

369
00:11:31.801 --> 00:11:35.400
when he didn't even know what the prosecution knew at the time.

370
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.980
The case goes back for retrial.

371
00:11:37.981 --> 00:11:38.814
But the new,

372
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:39.270
uh,

373
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.110
prosecutor,

374
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.010
uh,

375
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.170
brings in a very experienced,

376
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:43.801
uh,

377
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:48.801
Harris County that's Houston assistant district attorney who had tried a Kelly

378
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.180
Siegler.

379
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:49.500
Uh,

380
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.950
she'd sent 19 men to death row in her career as a prosecutor,

381
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:53.710
uh,

382
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.543
in Houston.

383
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.120
Uh,

384
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.050
she called the prosecution of Anthony Graves at his first trial,

385
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:00.880
a nightmare and a travesty.

386
00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:01.601
Uh,

387
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:03.610
she said it's a prosecutor's duty,

388
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.331
uh,

389
00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:08.020
never to fabricate evidence or to manipulate witness or take advantage,

390
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:08.650
uh,

391
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.640
of victims.

392
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.790
And she said all of these things happened in this case.

393
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:13.840
Uh,

394
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.673
so,

395
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.753
uh,

396
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.150
here's a case in which a man was prosecuted,

397
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.500
sends to death,

398
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.080
denied any relief in the Texas courts,

399
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.450
partly because he had a very bad lawyer,

400
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.171
uh,

401
00:12:26.171 --> 00:12:27.004
for his,

402
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:27.480
uh,

403
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.380
post conviction review of the case.

404
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.040
Uh,

405
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.550
but then when's the case in the United States Court of Appeals?

406
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:37.900
And when it goes back and independent prosecutors brought into assess,

407
00:12:37.901 --> 00:12:41.440
it finds that there's this kind of prosecutorial misconduct,

408
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.130
uh,

409
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.360
that happened in the case.

410
00:12:43.361 --> 00:12:45.310
Anthony Graves has been free ever since.

411
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:45.970
Uh,

412
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.060
he talks to people around the country about his experience.

413
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.660
Uh,

414
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.291
what happens,

415
00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:54.790
you can learn more about Anthony Graves by going to his website.

416
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.110
Anthony believes,

417
00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:56.680
uh,

418
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.513
dot com,

419
00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:58.390
uh,

420
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:03.040
one other case that illustrates both the question of disclosure,

421
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:03.641
uh,

422
00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:05.380
as well as accountability,

423
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.981
uh,

424
00:13:05.981 --> 00:13:08.140
is a case of a man in Louisiana.

425
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.123
John Thompson,

426
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.030
uh,

427
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.370
John Thompson was accused of separate crimes,

428
00:13:12.371 --> 00:13:15.790
the arm robbery that happened one time and a murderer.

429
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.340
These crimes are separated by about two weeks,

430
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.280
and they happen in New Orleans in 1985.

431
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.121
Uh,

432
00:13:22.121 --> 00:13:23.500
in the arm robbery case,

433
00:13:23.501 --> 00:13:28.501
the police had taken a swatch of fabric that was stained with blood of the

434
00:13:29.651 --> 00:13:30.484
perpetrator.

435
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.350
These for some kids who got robbed.

436
00:13:33.351 --> 00:13:34.720
And in the process of it,

437
00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:38.260
there was a scuffle and there was blood on the pants and the police took a

438
00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:39.160
sample of that.

439
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:42.610
This is of course the kind of critical evidence that law enforcement uses to

440
00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:43.630
solve crimes.

441
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:44.201
Uh,

442
00:13:44.201 --> 00:13:45.970
they sent it to the crime laboratory,

443
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:46.511
uh,

444
00:13:46.511 --> 00:13:49.600
and it came back that it was blood type B.

445
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:50.740
Uh,

446
00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.220
well,

447
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.053
uh,

448
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.270
there's no mention of the results of the blood tests at trial.

449
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.080
Uh,

450
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:56.501
in fact,

451
00:13:56.501 --> 00:13:57.940
two days before trial,

452
00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:58.871
uh,

453
00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:00.310
that one of the prosecutors,

454
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.060
uh,

455
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.210
gave the crime laboratory report to another prosecutor.

456
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.950
Now that prosecutor later denied it.

457
00:14:05.951 --> 00:14:08.830
This is the report that said what the blood type,

458
00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:09.281
uh,

459
00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:10.114
was.

460
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:10.660
Uh,

461
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.770
before trial,

462
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:16.960
the prosecutors checked all of the evidence out of the property room of the

463
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:17.980
police department,

464
00:14:17.981 --> 00:14:22.030
except for that Swatch of fabric that had the blood on it.

465
00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:22.990
Uh,

466
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.220
Thompson goes to trial.

467
00:14:24.221 --> 00:14:25.690
This is in the arm robbery case.

468
00:14:25.691 --> 00:14:26.560
He's convicted.

469
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.450
That's then used against him.

470
00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:28.551
It,

471
00:14:28.551 --> 00:14:29.500
his capital case.

472
00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:31.360
So that he doesn't take the witness stand.

473
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:32.051
Uh,

474
00:14:32.051 --> 00:14:32.890
he's convicted,

475
00:14:32.891 --> 00:14:36.850
he sends to death and tea and spends 18 years in custody,

476
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:37.300
uh,

477
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.590
14 of those years,

478
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:39.051
uh,

479
00:14:39.051 --> 00:14:40.360
on on death row,

480
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.710
uh,

481
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.090
one of the prosecutors,

482
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.270
Jerry Degan,

483
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.980
uh,

484
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.390
learning that he had cancer and that he had a little time to live a admitted in

485
00:14:49.391 --> 00:14:54.391
1994 to another that he had suppressed the blood evidence and John Thompson's

486
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:55.880
case.

487
00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.650
But that of the prosecutor never disclosed that to the defense or for that

488
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:02.330
matter to anyone else.

489
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:03.111
Uh,

490
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:05.840
John Thompson was scheduled to die on May the 20th,

491
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:07.820
1999 and he almost did.

492
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:08.541
Uh,

493
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:10.520
what happened was that an investigator,

494
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.301
uh,

495
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:12.320
started looking,

496
00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:13.670
leaving no stone unturned,

497
00:15:13.671 --> 00:15:15.350
looking one last time,

498
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.951
uh,

499
00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:20.690
and went to the crime laboratory and discovered the blood report that had been

500
00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:22.280
there all along that said,

501
00:15:22.281 --> 00:15:27.080
the perpetrator had blood type B could have been John Thompson.

502
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.180
John Thompson's blood type was o.

503
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.640
And so once you have the blood report,

504
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.460
a Thomson could not have committed the crime.

505
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:35.211
Uh,

506
00:15:35.211 --> 00:15:35.901
and in fact,

507
00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:39.650
the arm robbery charges against John Thompson are dismissed.

508
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.430
The Louisiana Supreme Court then reversed the murder conviction,

509
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:44.300
uh,

510
00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.060
saying that because it was tainted by this earlier,

511
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.560
a conviction,

512
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:49.310
uh,

513
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:52.970
Thompson was entitled to a new trial and that the new trial,

514
00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:57.060
John Thompson testified a number of other people that knew about this incident

515
00:15:57.061 --> 00:15:58.670
and testified as it turned out,

516
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.050
and in all probability,

517
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:05.090
the person who had accused Thompson of the crime was probably the person who

518
00:16:05.091 --> 00:16:05.924
committed it.

519
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.000
He came closer to fitting the description.

520
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.260
Then Thompson did,

521
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:09.921
uh,

522
00:16:09.921 --> 00:16:10.551
at any rate,

523
00:16:10.551 --> 00:16:13.050
it took the jury just about a half an hour to acquit,

524
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:13.580
uh,

525
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.391
John Thompson.

526
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:17.270
So after 18 years in the custody of the state of Louisiana,

527
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:18.410
14 on death row,

528
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.100
John Thompson walks out a free man after he's acquitted,

529
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.690
but he does more than that.

530
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.840
Thompson sued the district attorney,

531
00:16:26.841 --> 00:16:27.561
Harry Connick,

532
00:16:27.561 --> 00:16:29.000
Sr and others,

533
00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:29.540
uh,

534
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.180
saying that misconduct by the prosecutor's office,

535
00:16:32.181 --> 00:16:37.130
basically the failure to disclose this blood report had cost him 18 years of his

536
00:16:37.131 --> 00:16:37.641
life in a,

537
00:16:37.641 --> 00:16:39.770
nearly resulted in his execution.

538
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:40.610
Uh,

539
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:44.750
prosecutors have complete immunity for what they do as prosecutors.

540
00:16:44.751 --> 00:16:49.751
So he couldn't directly sue the prosecutors who tried his case or a Harry

541
00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:50.990
Connick senior,

542
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.201
uh,

543
00:16:51.201 --> 00:16:52.460
the main prosecutor,

544
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.640
but he did sue Harry Connick and other people on a theory that there were so

545
00:16:57.981 --> 00:16:59.540
many of these violations.

546
00:16:59.541 --> 00:17:04.280
So many times when prosecutors in New Orleans had failed a turnover evidence,

547
00:17:04.281 --> 00:17:05.900
there'd been four cases reversed,

548
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.410
uh,

549
00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:07.790
before John Thompson's,

550
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.241
uh,

551
00:17:08.241 --> 00:17:09.380
for the same reason,

552
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.920
uh,

553
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.990
that he had failed to train as lawyers,

554
00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:12.390
uh,

555
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:16.190
so that they would be sure to find and turn this evidence over is they're

556
00:17:16.191 --> 00:17:19.880
required to do by the constitution of the United States.

557
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:25.250
A jury in New Orleans awarded John Thompson $14 million plus $1 million in

558
00:17:27.591 --> 00:17:28.520
attorney's fees,

559
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.630
but that was soon to be taken away from him,

560
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.080
uh,

561
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.860
by the Supreme Court of the United States and conduct versus Thompson.

562
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.330
A conic won at trial court of appeals split evenly on the case.

563
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:41.930
Uh,

564
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.520
but the Supreme Court granted,

565
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:44.120
uh,

566
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:44.953
review,

567
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.501
uh,

568
00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:50.501
and said that there was not enough reason for conic to require that his

569
00:17:51.631 --> 00:17:53.160
prosecutors be trained.

570
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:54.211
Uh,

571
00:17:54.211 --> 00:17:55.950
this is not like the court said,

572
00:17:55.951 --> 00:18:00.780
sending police officers out with weapons without training them on the

573
00:18:00.781 --> 00:18:03.540
constitutional limitations on the use of deadly force.

574
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:04.201
Uh,

575
00:18:04.201 --> 00:18:05.910
which police departments do.

576
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.570
The Supreme Court said that there was no reason to think,

577
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:10.291
uh,

578
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:10.621
the,

579
00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:13.650
the deputy district attorneys,

580
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:14.400
uh,

581
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.260
would need special training after all.

582
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:17.940
They had been to law school.

583
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:18.570
Uh,

584
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.780
they are responsible as lawyers to continue their education,

585
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:22.081
uh,

586
00:18:22.081 --> 00:18:23.250
after law school,

587
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:23.821
uh,

588
00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:26.910
and they learn on the job from other prosecutors.

589
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:27.871
Uh,

590
00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:28.231
of course,

591
00:18:28.231 --> 00:18:32.160
that was one of the problems that Thompson was raising that perhaps,

592
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:33.263
uh,

593
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:37.770
learning from other prosecutors in the Orleans parish district attorney's

594
00:18:37.771 --> 00:18:38.370
office,

595
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:38.730
uh,

596
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.070
was not really teaching the right lessons.

597
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.860
That is that this kind of evidence has to be disclosed,

598
00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:44.440
uh,

599
00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.950
as opposed to suppressed.

600
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.143
Um,

601
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.860
justice Ginsburg descendant,

602
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.390
she was joined by justices,

603
00:18:51.391 --> 00:18:53.130
Briar Sotomayor and Kagan.

604
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.661
Uh,

605
00:18:53.661 --> 00:18:55.290
so this was a very close case.

606
00:18:55.291 --> 00:19:00.291
John Thompson lost the $15 million by a five to four vote of the Supreme Court.

607
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:01.380
Uh,

608
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.170
justice Ginsburg and heard a sense said from top down,

609
00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:04.891
uh,

610
00:19:04.891 --> 00:19:07.950
the prosecutors did not understand their obligations.

611
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.280
They hid all kinds of exculpatory evidence,

612
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.570
not just the blood tests,

613
00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:15.180
but all kinds of evidence from Thompson,

614
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:15.930
uh,

615
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.060
which he had requested over two decades.

616
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.830
And it almost resulted,

617
00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:20.520
uh,

618
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.353
in his,

619
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:21.810
uh,

620
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:22.643
execution.

621
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.210
And another segment,

622
00:19:24.211 --> 00:19:25.920
we'll talk to John Thompson,

623
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:26.371
uh,

624
00:19:26.371 --> 00:19:27.930
about his experiences,

625
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:28.500
uh,

626
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.730
the trials he had,

627
00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:31.440
the time he spent on death row,

628
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.010
uh,

629
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:35.040
and his effort to hold the prosecutors accountable,

630
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.120
uh,

631
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.130
by filing this civil suit,

632
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.390
winning it initially,

633
00:19:39.391 --> 00:19:40.890
but then losing at the Supreme Court.
