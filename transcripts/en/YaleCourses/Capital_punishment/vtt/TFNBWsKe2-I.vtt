1
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.100
In death penalty cases.

2
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:15.540
In any criminal case,

3
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:19.620
one of the most critical procedures is the selection of the jury.

4
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:20.221
Of course,

5
00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:24.270
first jurors are asked questions to see if there's anything they know about the

6
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:27.570
case that would keep them from being fair and impartial or any reason that would

7
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:29.700
keep them from being fair and impartial.

8
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:32.160
And once a group of jurors has been selected,

9
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.240
uh,

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.540
who supposedly can be fair and impartial,

11
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.960
each side exercises what are called peremptory strikes.

12
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:41.700
Also discretionary strikes,

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.890
the number that each side has depends upon the state in which the case is tried.

14
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.180
And the state law,

15
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.250
one of the longstanding problems,

16
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.080
so peremptory strikes is that they've been used to exclude people of Color,

17
00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:58.350
African Americans in particular from jury service.

18
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.420
We want to talk about that today with [inaudible] who was a graduate of Yale law

19
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:05.460
school and who since 2008,

20
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.360
uh,

21
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.550
has been at the equal justice institute,

22
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.271
uh,

23
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:13.320
of Alabama and has been dealing with this issue,

24
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.233
uh,

25
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.450
all the time.

26
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.590
See a thank you for coming.

27
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.300
Thank you so much for having me.

28
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.720
First thing I'd like for you to do is just talk about Alabama and why juries and

29
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:27.450
who's on the jury might be important and Alabama.

30
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.951
<v 2>Sure,</v>

31
00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:28.551
absolutely.

32
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:29.384
So,

33
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.930
um,

34
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.920
in Alabama,

35
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.490
uh,

36
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.140
unlike sort of the trend that you see nationally where death sentencing is going

37
00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:36.651
down,

38
00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:39.320
Alabama beat the opposite is true.

39
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.290
They have extremely high death sentencing rate,

40
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.050
the highest per capita of any state in the country.

41
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.900
And in 2008 the year I started at Eji,

42
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.741
Alabama,

43
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:53.480
which has a population of around 4 million people sentenced more people to death

44
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:55.010
in raw numbers than Texas,

45
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.560
which has a population of over 23 million.

46
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.491
And you know,

47
00:01:58.491 --> 00:01:59.660
when I talk to people about this,

48
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:00.950
they sort of ask why,

49
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:01.191
you know,

50
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:04.340
why does Alabama have this rate that's so high?

51
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:07.730
And I think I just like to highlight three reasons before talking about jury

52
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:08.720
selection in the state.

53
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.710
Um,

54
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.580
so the first reason I think that Alabama's death sensing rate is so high is the

55
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:17.330
poor quality of defense lawyers and there's no statewide public defender system.

56
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.380
Um,

57
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.220
and they're,

58
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:23.810
the state relies solely on a sort of court appointed system of lawyers,

59
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:28.250
which means the judges have a list of lawyers who are available and they just

60
00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:33.251
call on those people who may have some but may have really no background in

61
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:34.880
trying a capitol case.

62
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.470
So that's a major problem.

63
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.030
The second is a really unique feature of Alabama's death penalty,

64
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.220
a law which is judge override.

65
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.840
So in Alabama,

66
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.950
a jury can give a life verdict in a death penalty case.

67
00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:53.750
They can sentence the defendant to life and a judge who's elected in the state

68
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.820
can set aside that verdict and overturn it simply because he or she disagrees

69
00:02:58.821 --> 00:02:59.890
with the jury finding.

70
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.880
Um,

71
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.140
and then the third reason,

72
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:07.141
I think the Justice Sotomayor recently pointed out that those overrides are

73
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:09.820
often politically motivated.

74
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.871
Absolutely.

75
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:11.681
I think you see,

76
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:14.200
so 2008 is a perfect example of that.

77
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.850
The statistics that I started out with,

78
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:17.020
that was an election year.

79
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.460
Um,

80
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.740
a lot of judges who were running for reelection and there've been,

81
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.490
you know,

82
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.340
quite extensive findings that in election years,

83
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:29.170
more judges as they're running for reelection override in capital cases because

84
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:31.600
they feel political pressure to do so.

85
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.080
Um,

86
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.570
and so right now it's not an insignificant number.

87
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:34.751
You know,

88
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:37.750
there's around 200 people on Alabama's death row.

89
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.110
Approximately 23% of those people on the death row now are there because of a

90
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:44.350
judge override.

91
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:47.500
So those are people who got life sentences from a jury,

92
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:52.270
but nevertheless are on death row because a judge overturned that verdict and

93
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:53.200
sentence them to death.

94
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.300
And then just the third reason,

95
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:58.780
which is particularly relevant to today's topic is racial bias.

96
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.760
And I just want to highlight a few features of Alabama system in this respect.

97
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:08.761
So the first is that of the 19 appellate judges in Alabama on the civil

98
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:10.121
appellate court,

99
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:11.260
the criminal appellate court,

100
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:12.160
and the Supreme Court,

101
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.800
none are people of color.

102
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.450
All of those judges are white.

103
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.080
Um,

104
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.920
which is unusual in a state that has a significant African American population

105
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:21.910
as Alabama does.

106
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.840
Um,

107
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.340
the second is that the overwhelming majority of elected trial judges in the

108
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:27.940
state,

109
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.330
um,

110
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.163
are white.

111
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.920
And then finally there,

112
00:04:30.921 --> 00:04:32.530
there are elected prosecutors,

113
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:35.140
district attorneys in each of Alabama's counties.

114
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:38.350
And so of the 42 elected prosecutors in the state,

115
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.810
only one is African American.

116
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.060
So when you zoom out and look at this,

117
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:48.061
what you see is a judicial system where almost all of the actors are white and

118
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:50.710
none of them are people of color.

119
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.410
And given this backdrop,

120
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.440
the jury becomes really significant as the one place in these courtrooms where

121
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:01.210
African American voices could be heard.

122
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.651
Um,

123
00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:05.320
and so it's something that we pay a lot of attention to in the cases at Eji that

124
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:10.180
we take is to make sure and try and ensure that African American voices are

125
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:12.580
being heard through the jury process,

126
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:15.910
especially against this backdrop where that's the only way their voices will

127
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:16.720
come in.

128
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.720
And yet what we've seen in Alabama is that even with this supreme court case,

129
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:27.220
Batson versus Kentucky in 1986 that outlawed racial discrimination in jury

130
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:28.054
selection.

131
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.220
Prosecutors are still routinely using their peremptory strikes,

132
00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:37.270
their discretionary strikes to remove jurors from jury service because they're

133
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:38.260
African American.

134
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.010
Um,

135
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.000
and just one dramatic example of that is a case that we litigated called

136
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:47.170
[inaudible] where the prosecutor in that case in Dallas County,

137
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:49.990
which is about 55% African American,

138
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.590
the prosecutor in that case eliminated 23 of 23 African American jurors who are

139
00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:58.000
eligible service.

140
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.490
And the defense lawyer in that case raise an objection and asked the prosecutor

141
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.020
to explain to the court why he was removing all of these African Americans.

142
00:06:08.021 --> 00:06:12.640
And the prosecutors exam explanation was that they appeared to be of low

143
00:06:12.641 --> 00:06:13.570
intelligence.

144
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.200
Um,

145
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.400
that was his purported race neutral reason for removing these jurors.

146
00:06:18.401 --> 00:06:23.350
And the trial judge presiding over that case accepted that as fine.

147
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.010
Um,

148
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.010
and this capital defendant went to trial before an all white jury in a county

149
00:06:29.381 --> 00:06:32.380
that's more than half African American and was sentenced to death.

150
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.940
And that's just an example of a case that Eji takes where despite this law and

151
00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:42.010
despite a very large population of eligible jurors,

152
00:06:42.011 --> 00:06:42.940
nevertheless,

153
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.180
we're seeing capital trials where people of color are going to trial before an

154
00:06:48.701 --> 00:06:49.534
all white jury.

155
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.910
<v 1>Let's back up just a minute and talk about that Supreme Court decision.</v>

156
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.240
A lot of people say or think that there's no longer race discrimination and

157
00:06:59.251 --> 00:07:00.570
selecting jurors by,

158
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.520
by these use of peremptory strikes.

159
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:03.121
But,

160
00:07:03.121 --> 00:07:04.260
but how exactly,

161
00:07:04.261 --> 00:07:07.620
just explain how exactly the bats and process works.

162
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.010
But in the case of course is Batson versus Kentucky,

163
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.100
a Supreme Court decision that dealt with,

164
00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:14.460
uh,

165
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.750
an old Alabama case,

166
00:07:15.751 --> 00:07:17.100
actually a,

167
00:07:17.101 --> 00:07:18.270
that had allowed,

168
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.900
uh,

169
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.210
prosecutors to structures for any reason,

170
00:07:21.211 --> 00:07:21.691
race,

171
00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:22.321
religion,

172
00:07:22.321 --> 00:07:25.680
or any other reason that they might have the supreme court.

173
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.080
1986 said no,

174
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.730
but what was the remedy?

175
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:30.331
<v 2>Right?</v>

176
00:07:30.331 --> 00:07:35.331
So what Batson sets out is a three step process that Judd trial judges have to

177
00:07:35.761 --> 00:07:36.594
apply.

178
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.860
And the holding of Batson is that you cannot discriminate.

179
00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:43.440
You cannot remove a juror because of race,

180
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.510
but you can remove a juror if you can provide the court with what's called a

181
00:07:48.511 --> 00:07:50.370
wrist neutral reason.

182
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.120
So there are other valid reasons to remove a juror other than their race.

183
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.820
Um,

184
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.770
and how this is applied in the courts is that jury selection begins.

185
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:03.210
The prosecutor is using his or her strikes and removes,

186
00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:06.330
let's say five eligible African Americans in a row.

187
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.790
The defense lawyer then bears the burden of objecting to what's happening and

188
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:13.680
putting the court on notice.

189
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:14.843
Um,

190
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.320
so the defense lawyer would say,

191
00:08:16.321 --> 00:08:18.720
I object under Batson versus Kentucky.

192
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.010
The prosecutor is striking five African American jurors at that point.

193
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.200
If the judge finds what's called a prime aphasia case of discrimination.

194
00:08:28.201 --> 00:08:33.201
So some minimal evidence that discrimination might be going on,

195
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.633
um,

196
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.493
<v 1>the burden,</v>

197
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.060
there's a disparate use,

198
00:08:37.061 --> 00:08:37.391
right?

199
00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:40.970
If they're striking far more African American jurors than white jurors,

200
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:42.280
even though African Americans,

201
00:08:42.281 --> 00:08:45.790
as you said in the mcgehee case where a minority,

202
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:46.810
uh,

203
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:51.160
but the prosecution used every single strike in that case against African

204
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:51.161
Americans.

205
00:08:51.161 --> 00:08:51.730
Right?

206
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:52.330
Exactly.

207
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:52.781
Exactly.

208
00:08:52.781 --> 00:08:53.200
So it led,

209
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.290
made out a pretty clear prime,

210
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:55.124
a Fisher case

211
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:56.960
<v 2>be a strong prima facia case,</v>

212
00:08:56.961 --> 00:08:58.400
but the language of the court,

213
00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.000
um,

214
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.250
and how it's been applied to something we can debate,

215
00:09:01.251 --> 00:09:06.251
but in theory it's supposed to be a relatively low bar that the defense lawyer

216
00:09:06.561 --> 00:09:07.394
has to meet.

217
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.390
And so if there's something going on that seemed suspicious to the defense

218
00:09:11.391 --> 00:09:12.170
lawyer,

219
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.200
he or she can object and then the trial judge will,

220
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.220
the burden will shift to the prosecutor if the trial judge finds a prima facia

221
00:09:19.221 --> 00:09:19.580
case.

222
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.600
And then at that point we moved to baton step two where the burden shifts to the

223
00:09:23.601 --> 00:09:28.601
prosecutor who then has to account for these strikes and explain why they are

224
00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:31.640
not the result of racial discrimination.

225
00:09:31.641 --> 00:09:36.641
And he or she does that by providing race neutral reasons for each strike.

226
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.580
Um,

227
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:42.580
so you would have to have an explanation for why you struck juror number five.

228
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.091
That is not,

229
00:09:44.091 --> 00:09:46.160
I struck the stir because they're African American.

230
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:46.993
You could say,

231
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.400
I struck this juror because this juror is a school teacher and there's some

232
00:09:52.401 --> 00:09:56.450
theory of my case that makes me think that's a valid reason to use the strike.

233
00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:57.590
Um,

234
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:02.060
and then the trial judge then would evaluate these reasons that the prosecutor

235
00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:06.380
has given and you either accept them or reject them as,

236
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:06.980
um,

237
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.810
as pretext jewel and not,

238
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.890
you know,

239
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:14.150
not reasons that sort of meet the burden and justify the use of the strikes.

240
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.000
And if that is the case,

241
00:10:17.001 --> 00:10:17.411
then the,

242
00:10:17.411 --> 00:10:17.930
the,

243
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:22.930
the judge will find that the Batson case has been violated and can,

244
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:24.231
you know,

245
00:10:24.231 --> 00:10:26.150
call back that juror who was struck.

246
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.060
<v 1>And you were saying it's three steps because the prosecutor gives the reason.</v>

247
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:31.380
And then at the third step,

248
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.200
the judge weighs all the evidence,

249
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:35.011
whatever it may be,

250
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:36.060
all the circumstances,

251
00:10:36.061 --> 00:10:37.830
how many strikes were used,

252
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:39.180
how disproportionate was,

253
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:44.250
how PauseAble the reasons are and decides whether there's race discrimination.

254
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:44.820
Right?

255
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:49.820
But even in a case where 23 out of 23 were used against African Americans to get

256
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.400
an all white jury and a majority Black County,

257
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.570
the judge upheld all 23 reasons.

258
00:10:57.571 --> 00:10:58.680
I want to ask you about this.

259
00:10:58.681 --> 00:11:00.890
Thurgood Marshall said when,

260
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:05.460
when Bateson was decided that any prosecutor would be able to think up reasons,

261
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:06.330
uh,

262
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.370
for striking African Americans,

263
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.653
uh,

264
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.970
do you see that that's come true?

265
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:12.770
Did he I

266
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:13.850
<v 2>predict that correctly.</v>

267
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.890
I think that's absolutely true.

268
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.220
I think that prosecutors have to do very little.

269
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:24.370
They have to basically say something of that's that's minimally acceptable and

270
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.220
they will not be found to have violated Batson.

271
00:11:28.221 --> 00:11:31.760
But I would even go further than that and use the mcgehee case as an example of

272
00:11:31.761 --> 00:11:32.001
this.

273
00:11:32.001 --> 00:11:37.001
So not only did the trial judge in that case with where there were 23 out of 23

274
00:11:37.041 --> 00:11:41.000
strikes and the reason was there appeared to be of low intelligence,

275
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:45.770
not only did the trial judge accept that as a reason that case was litigated

276
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:51.040
through every state court in Alabama and every state court in Alabama found no

277
00:11:51.321 --> 00:11:52.430
bats in violation.

278
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.760
And it only when the equal justice initiative had that case in the 11th Circuit

279
00:11:57.941 --> 00:11:58.960
Court of Appeals,

280
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.970
that it was reversed.

281
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.170
And that's significant because I think not only do you see trial judges

282
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.770
accepting reasons that really don't pass muster when you,

283
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.300
when you think about them carefully,

284
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.480
but appellate courts who are reviewing these cases on appeal often either except

285
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:17.080
reasons that are,

286
00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:17.890
you know,

287
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:22.890
don't really assume justifiable or they invent reasons after the fact that the

288
00:12:23.231 --> 00:12:25.390
prosecutor could have used the strike.

289
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.950
So they might look at a case where the prosecutor hasn't given any reasons but

290
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:30.640
say,

291
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.240
well,

292
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.780
maybe it could have been for this reason or that reason and supply some

293
00:12:34.781 --> 00:12:37.240
reasoning and then affirm the case.

294
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:39.420
And that's what happened in the gay.

295
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.641
He,

296
00:12:39.641 --> 00:12:39.851
they,

297
00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:42.490
these are sort of looked at the case and said,

298
00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:42.940
well,

299
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.000
there could have been some other reasons and kept the case,

300
00:12:46.001 --> 00:12:46.680
uh,

301
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.110
uh,

302
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.731
moving and,

303
00:12:47.731 --> 00:12:48.730
and didn't reverse it.

304
00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:51.250
And so I think you have the prosecutors,

305
00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:56.110
the trial judge's and the appellate courts all kind of together are part of the

306
00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.250
problem of why Batson isn't meaningful in practice in the states where I,

307
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:01.203
where I work.

308
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.760
<v 1>Well and then mega he,</v>

309
00:13:02.761 --> 00:13:04.410
you had this overwhelming case.

310
00:13:04.411 --> 00:13:07.140
So it finally gets to the very last federal court.

311
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.460
The trial court upheld the reasons the Alabama Court of criminal appeals,

312
00:13:11.461 --> 00:13:12.480
the Supreme Court,

313
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.580
the Federal District Court upheld the reason.

314
00:13:14.581 --> 00:13:15.090
Yeah.

315
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:20.040
So it was only when it got to the very last stage of the process that this

316
00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:24.750
overwhelming case was found and the reasons were found to be quite suspicious

317
00:13:24.751 --> 00:13:28.050
because the low intelligence in particular reason that was given.

318
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.440
But what about in a case where you don't have such an incredibly overwhelming

319
00:13:35.191 --> 00:13:35.701
case?

320
00:13:35.701 --> 00:13:37.560
What do we see happening in those cases?

321
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.231
<v 2>Right.</v>

322
00:13:38.231 --> 00:13:39.940
I think that's a great question because Miguel,

323
00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:44.290
he is the rare case where you have the prosecutor on the record first.

324
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:48.160
It's rare because the defense lawyer made an objection so often there's just no

325
00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:48.761
objection.

326
00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:53.761
So the courts never put on notice and doesn't Sua sponte get involved?

327
00:13:53.981 --> 00:13:54.850
And so we gay,

328
00:13:54.851 --> 00:13:58.030
he's rare because the defense lawyer said something which required the

329
00:13:58.031 --> 00:13:59.920
prosecutor to respond.

330
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.600
Um,

331
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.530
<v 1>and then your first point when we first started talking,</v>

332
00:14:02.531 --> 00:14:02.591
you,

333
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:05.130
you're talking about the quality of defense lawyers.

334
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.000
So if you have a poor defense lawyer who doesn't,

335
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.980
maybe it's never heard of the Batson case,

336
00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:12.780
this will never be raised.

337
00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.050
<v 2>It will never be raised.</v>

338
00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.460
And the problem with that is that you lose the most critical opportunity,

339
00:14:18.461 --> 00:14:22.540
which is in the courtroom while jury selection is happening to force the

340
00:14:22.541 --> 00:14:26.410
prosecutor to right then and there give their best reasons,

341
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:26.710
um,

342
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:27.640
if they have any.

343
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.100
And when you don't have that,

344
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.540
what happens is even if we are able years later as appellate lawyers to take the

345
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:36.730
case and send it back down,

346
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.940
the problem is years pass and the prosecutors can have a really long time to

347
00:14:41.951 --> 00:14:45.970
come up with reasons after the fact that these strikes were used.

348
00:14:45.971 --> 00:14:50.971
So we've had that where the defense lawyer maybe didn't know about Batson even

349
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.550
though it's been in effect for,

350
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:53.061
you know,

351
00:14:53.061 --> 00:14:53.600
now,

352
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.610
since 1986 so a long time.

353
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.660
Um,

354
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.530
and when the case,

355
00:14:57.531 --> 00:14:58.550
when we get the case in,

356
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:03.200
raise something and it's sent back the prosecutors write briefs explaining,

357
00:15:03.201 --> 00:15:07.460
well maybe this person had a traffic citation.

358
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.510
And that's why I struck them.

359
00:15:08.511 --> 00:15:13.340
And it's just a lot harder to engage in a meaningful and truthful back and forth

360
00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:15.110
about why these strikes were used.

361
00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:19.820
If it's not raised right then and there in the courtroom during jury selection.

362
00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:24.821
And even now in 2014 we see all too many cases where there's no bats in a

363
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.060
violation raised by the defense lawyer at trial.

364
00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:29.690
And it's,

365
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.470
it's a major problem both because you lose that reason and because on appeal

366
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:38.060
you're going to be held to a much higher standard of review if there was not an

367
00:15:38.061 --> 00:15:38.894
objection.

368
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.400
<v 1>Right.</v>

369
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.010
And often the appellate court is going to say the issue's waved.

370
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:42.321
Right.

371
00:15:42.321 --> 00:15:45.410
Did it can't be heard at all because there was an objection.

372
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:46.311
Absolutely.

373
00:15:46.311 --> 00:15:47.180
It's really only in

374
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.330
<v 2>death penalty cases where you might be able to get around that.</v>

375
00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:51.660
Um,

376
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.260
but even in those cases you're going to be held to a much higher standard if the

377
00:15:55.261 --> 00:15:56.580
defense lawyer didn't object.

378
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:57.900
But in most cases,

379
00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.810
if the defense lawyer doesn't object and most criminal cases,

380
00:16:00.811 --> 00:16:02.190
that issue is gone forever.

381
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:02.970
So no,

382
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:03.803
it could be,

383
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:04.180
you know,

384
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:09.060
25 out of 25 strikes if the defense lawyer doesn't object and it's not a death

385
00:16:09.061 --> 00:16:09.894
penalty case,

386
00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.990
no matter how compelling the bats in violation is.

387
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:13.680
Um,

388
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.513
there's really,

389
00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:15.750
there's nothing you can do

390
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.870
<v 1>on appeal and there must,</v>

391
00:16:17.871 --> 00:16:22.280
there are also some psychological things going on here,

392
00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:22.581
right.

393
00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:23.660
Then dynamics in play,

394
00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:27.530
because it may depend on the relationship between the defense lawyer and the

395
00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:32.531
prosecutor and the prosecutor and the judge in terms of what you're claiming in

396
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.520
a Batson objection.

397
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:39.890
Is that the prosecution intentionally discriminated on the basis of race.

398
00:16:39.891 --> 00:16:42.140
There's no getting around that it's intentional,

399
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:42.951
am I right?

400
00:16:42.951 --> 00:16:47.951
Racial discrimination and that the reasons given our pretextual and other words

401
00:16:48.981 --> 00:16:53.630
that the prosecutor is lie about the reasons I would think often judges and

402
00:16:53.631 --> 00:16:57.290
prosecutors who work together on case after case,

403
00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.240
that's going to be very hard finding,

404
00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:00.550
isn't it for a judge to ways.

405
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.401
It certainly is.

406
00:17:01.401 --> 00:17:02.270
And we've been,

407
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.660
you know,

408
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.590
in trainings and in meetings with defense lawyers if we're,

409
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:06.891
you know,

410
00:17:06.891 --> 00:17:09.110
looking at the cases on appeal and they'll say that,

411
00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:09.480
um,

412
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:09.860
you know,

413
00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.840
we'll talk to defense lawyers who will say,

414
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:17.230
I'm just not comfortable accusing this guy who I'm going to see at church or in

415
00:17:17.241 --> 00:17:19.880
the grocery store of deliberately

416
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.700
<v 2>know discriminating on the basis of race.</v>

417
00:17:22.701 --> 00:17:26.960
And we have to explain that no matter how uncomfortable it may feel,

418
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:30.170
your client has a right to a jury that is,

419
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.860
you know,

420
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:35.860
the product of a fair jury selection process and it's your job to raise the

421
00:17:36.051 --> 00:17:36.500
claim.

422
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:36.770
Um,

423
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:38.510
if you see evidence of discrimination.

424
00:17:38.511 --> 00:17:42.140
But I think especially in small counties where there is,

425
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:42.830
uh,

426
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:43.440
you know,

427
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.240
long standing relationships with the prosecutor and with the judge,

428
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.750
um,

429
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.480
people have a hard time raising Batson.

430
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.920
So some defense lawyers have never heard of it,

431
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.570
but I'd say an equal,

432
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:56.730
if not greater number have heard of the case.

433
00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:01.680
But just find it uncomfortable to make a Batson objection in court because of

434
00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:02.580
the reasons that you,

435
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:03.780
that you kind of pointed to.

436
00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.100
<v 1>And I just want to ask is 27 strikes?</v>

437
00:18:07.101 --> 00:18:09.860
It's an awful lot of strikes in a case.

438
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.760
Uh,

439
00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:15.200
does Alabama have a system which gives people more strikes than you would have?

440
00:18:15.201 --> 00:18:17.090
Like in Georgia for example,

441
00:18:17.091 --> 00:18:19.280
each side gets 10 strikes in Virginia,

442
00:18:19.281 --> 00:18:21.050
each side gets just three strikes.

443
00:18:21.051 --> 00:18:22.370
So Alabama,

444
00:18:22.371 --> 00:18:23.900
that's a lot of strikes.

445
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:24.271
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

446
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:26.100
Alabama has a unique system.

447
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.620
We have unlimited peremptory strikes,

448
00:18:28.621 --> 00:18:29.790
which means that,

449
00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.220
um,

450
00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:35.190
there's no sort of set number of strikes that either side has going in.

451
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:40.710
And that's why you see these cases with sometimes very large numbers like 23 out

452
00:18:41.071 --> 00:18:42.060
of 23 strikes.

453
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:46.350
And some courts in Alabama and other states have expressed concern about this.

454
00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:47.790
The Mississippi Supreme Court,

455
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:48.570
um,

456
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.680
in a Batson case,

457
00:18:49.681 --> 00:18:49.891
you know,

458
00:18:49.891 --> 00:18:51.810
in the last 10 years or so,

459
00:18:51.811 --> 00:18:56.220
express concern about peremptories and sort of threatened to eliminate them

460
00:18:56.221 --> 00:18:59.850
altogether because they're discrimination is still so rampant.

461
00:18:59.851 --> 00:19:04.350
And I think courts where they're effective trial and appellate lawyers are

462
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:05.910
seeing evidence of this.

463
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.000
But we as,

464
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:09.660
as lawyers representing,

465
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.080
uh,

466
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.080
people in capital cases became interested in sort of documenting this,

467
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:15.750
um,

468
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:20.310
as a phenomenon beyond the individual cases we were working on and have done a

469
00:19:20.311 --> 00:19:24.990
lot of research into sort of discrimination in jury selection in the south and

470
00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.340
found unfortunately,

471
00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:30.660
that this is something that is really widespread in Alabama and in other

472
00:19:30.661 --> 00:19:32.190
southern states particularly.

473
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:33.810
<v 1>And what did you find,</v>

474
00:19:33.811 --> 00:19:35.010
tell us about your findings.

475
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.440
<v 2>So in,</v>

476
00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:36.740
uh,

477
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.210
in 2009,

478
00:19:38.211 --> 00:19:43.211
Eji began a sort of year and a half long project to research and document a jury

479
00:19:45.321 --> 00:19:47.540
selection practices in southern states.

480
00:19:47.541 --> 00:19:48.770
And we looked at Arkansas,

481
00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:49.604
Alabama,

482
00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:50.840
uh,

483
00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:51.680
Louisiana,

484
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:52.700
South Carolina,

485
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:53.301
Tennessee,

486
00:19:53.301 --> 00:19:54.134
Florida,

487
00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.093
um,

488
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.330
and Georgia.

489
00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.200
And we looked at what was going on and whether,

490
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.501
you know,

491
00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:04.700
25 years after Bateson was Batson working,

492
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.580
was it doing what the Supreme Court intended it to do,

493
00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:12.581
which was prevent people from discriminating against African Americans and other

494
00:20:12.801 --> 00:20:14.930
racial minorities in jury selection.

495
00:20:14.931 --> 00:20:17.390
And what we found was really distressing,

496
00:20:17.391 --> 00:20:20.390
which was that this discrimination continues,

497
00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.273
um,

498
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.920
and it continues in quite dramatic fashion.

499
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:26.990
And we sort of,

500
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:27.981
we found,

501
00:20:27.981 --> 00:20:29.210
just to give you a few examples,

502
00:20:29.211 --> 00:20:34.211
we found a county in Alabama where nearly 80% of African Americans qualified for

503
00:20:35.991 --> 00:20:40.970
jury service has been eliminated from participating.

504
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:45.860
And we found majority black counties where it was routine for people to go to

505
00:20:45.861 --> 00:20:50.010
trial and face the death penalty in front of all white juries despite the fact

506
00:20:50.011 --> 00:20:52.170
that the counties were majority African American.

507
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.093
Um,

508
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:58.020
and we found to me one of the parts that was most kind of moving and interesting

509
00:20:58.021 --> 00:21:02.340
was that we went and talked to the jurors themselves.

510
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:07.370
So the people who had been called for jury service and then sent home on or

511
00:21:07.621 --> 00:21:12.621
excluded because of a reason that a court leader found was discrimination.

512
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.470
And so these are people who have been,

513
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:20.040
courts in America have found we're intentionally discriminated against by a

514
00:21:20.041 --> 00:21:20.701
prosecutor.

515
00:21:20.701 --> 00:21:25.701
And for me it was just fascinating to talk to these folks and hear from them

516
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.990
what their experiences were like.

517
00:21:27.991 --> 00:21:29.040
And it was really moving.

518
00:21:29.041 --> 00:21:29.281
I mean,

519
00:21:29.281 --> 00:21:33.030
I remember meeting a woman in Mississippi who'd lived through the civil rights

520
00:21:33.031 --> 00:21:33.620
movement,

521
00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:34.050
um,

522
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.850
who fought for the right to vote,

523
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:41.230
who had been called for jury service and then who'd been sent home for no reason

524
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.951
at all.

525
00:21:43.951 --> 00:21:45.840
And so when she spoke to me about it,

526
00:21:45.841 --> 00:21:46.170
she's,

527
00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:51.170
she became emotional talking about how much being an American meant to her and

528
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.470
how much the right to vote and the right to be a full citizen meant to her.

529
00:21:55.471 --> 00:22:00.471
And she really grew emotional recalling the sting of humiliation of being in

530
00:22:00.961 --> 00:22:05.310
that courtroom and being sent home and not being able to do anything about it.

531
00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:05.870
<v 1>Um,</v>

532
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.270
and let me just so we're clear on this,

533
00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:12.690
she was sent home because the prosecutor used a peremptory strike to remove her.

534
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:13.953
Yes.

535
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:19.100
And then gave her a reason to the judge who upheld that reason so that it was

536
00:22:19.241 --> 00:22:20.170
race neutral,

537
00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.850
but there were a lot of other African Americans who were being sent home for the

538
00:22:24.851 --> 00:22:25.684
same reason.

539
00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:26.170
Right,

540
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.003
right.

541
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.020
And are these reasons,

542
00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:34.021
are they any sort of protection to people like this woman that you saw or our

543
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:40.240
trial judges and state appellate courts upholding these reasons in most cases,

544
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.690
<v 2>cases there they're being upheld.</v>

545
00:22:42.691 --> 00:22:43.230
I mean we've,

546
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:43.441
we've,

547
00:22:43.441 --> 00:22:44.820
just to give you some examples,

548
00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:49.821
we've seen people dismissed because they're too old at 43 or two young at 28.

549
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:50.610
Um,

550
00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:54.060
because they wore eyeglasses because of the way they walked because they were

551
00:22:54.061 --> 00:22:54.894
single.

552
00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.010
They were married,

553
00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.600
they were divorced because they lived in a predominantly black neighborhood.

554
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:05.100
That's something that we've seen frequently upheld by appellate courts because

555
00:23:05.101 --> 00:23:07.230
they attended a historically black college.

556
00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:07.830
Um,

557
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:11.850
I mean these are reasons that prosecutors give in open court to justify using

558
00:23:11.851 --> 00:23:12.451
these strikes.

559
00:23:12.451 --> 00:23:17.400
And what was stunning to me was to talk to these jurors who explained how

560
00:23:17.401 --> 00:23:18.450
painful it was,

561
00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:19.500
um,

562
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.430
to go through this because I think people think of jury service sometimes as an

563
00:23:23.431 --> 00:23:24.330
obligation.

564
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.990
Um,

565
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:29.760
and even folks who have a lot of other things to do with their lives took it

566
00:23:29.761 --> 00:23:30.271
seriously.

567
00:23:30.271 --> 00:23:33.240
The fact that they were called to court and asked to participate in the process

568
00:23:33.241 --> 00:23:34.620
and they knew what was going on,

569
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:35.250
um,

570
00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.210
when they were sent home.

571
00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:39.630
And it's interesting cause jury selection is unique in that the supreme court

572
00:23:39.631 --> 00:23:44.250
has said that when intentional discrimination in jury selection occurs,

573
00:23:44.251 --> 00:23:46.880
it's not just the rights of the defendant who are affected.

574
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:48.890
It's the rights of the structure as well.

575
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:53.300
That juror has a right to sit on the jury and participate fully in their civic

576
00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:54.134
duty.

577
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.930
And so the discrimination impacts them as well.

578
00:23:56.931 --> 00:24:00.650
And so I just couldn't have found that to be more true when I spoke to people.

579
00:24:00.651 --> 00:24:05.651
I remember one woman I talked to was dismissed because the prosecutor said she

580
00:24:06.021 --> 00:24:10.490
belongs to a family that is a criminal family,

581
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:10.970
um,

582
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.250
in this county and that they engage in crime.

583
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.070
And she was humiliated by this.

584
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:20.120
There were people in court in her community who she knows she's never had

585
00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:21.230
problems with the law.

586
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.730
Her kids are,

587
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.150
um,

588
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.170
are good kids.

589
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:26.570
Her husband has never been in trouble with law enforcement.

590
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:31.700
This had happened years before and she said she still remembers this and is

591
00:24:31.701 --> 00:24:36.080
angry about it and felt really humiliated that the prosecutor was allowed to say

592
00:24:36.081 --> 00:24:36.914
that about her.

593
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:37.550
Um,

594
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:38.810
and get away with it.

595
00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:40.730
And I think that's another,

596
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:41.583
uh,

597
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:45.020
something else we discovered both from talking to the jurors themselves and from

598
00:24:45.021 --> 00:24:48.770
our research is that there really isn't prosecutorial accountability.

599
00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.310
Even when in the rare case like the [inaudible] case,

600
00:24:52.311 --> 00:24:53.870
you find dramatic evidence,

601
00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.330
there isn't accountability for prosecutors.

602
00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.193
Um,

603
00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.560
so what happened in [inaudible] when this court found discrimination is that

604
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.940
they reversed the case and he is entitled to a new trial because of that.

605
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.190
But nothing happens to the prosecutor.

606
00:25:07.191 --> 00:25:08.630
There's no discipline,

607
00:25:08.631 --> 00:25:09.980
there's no sanction,

608
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:11.750
they're not removed,

609
00:25:11.751 --> 00:25:12.890
they're not monitored.

610
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:13.460
Um,

611
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.930
and that in our opinion is sort of a big problem that recurs in a lot of these

612
00:25:17.931 --> 00:25:22.400
cases because you see the same offices doing the same thing over and over again.

613
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.060
And first it's hard to catch them doing it.

614
00:25:26.061 --> 00:25:27.350
But even if you do,

615
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:32.630
it's very hard to use that finding to prevent future problems with jury

616
00:25:32.631 --> 00:25:33.464
selection.

617
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:39.100
<v 1>And one thing we should just mention is that once a trial judge a pulses reasons</v>

618
00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:42.410
than all the courts that look at it after that give a great deal of it

619
00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.140
<v 2>deference to the trial judge.</v>

620
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:44.780
Right?

621
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:45.611
It's absolutely true.

622
00:25:45.611 --> 00:25:50.611
So once a trial judge agrees and finds there is no discrimination,

623
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:52.270
not only,

624
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.080
um,

625
00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:57.880
do you have the problem of sort of trying to get the prosecutor to explain what

626
00:25:57.881 --> 00:26:01.420
they did when the trial judge said they didn't have to the ones that travelers

627
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:02.620
has upheld what the,

628
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:03.910
what happened at trial?

629
00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:09.270
The appellate court will absolutely defer to what the trial judge did and they

630
00:26:09.581 --> 00:26:13.870
will only disrupt the trial judge's findings if there's really overwhelming

631
00:26:13.871 --> 00:26:14.704
evidence.

632
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:19.770
And the [inaudible] case was that rare example of overwhelming evidence that's

633
00:26:20.651 --> 00:26:23.290
so extreme and so extraordinary.

634
00:26:23.291 --> 00:26:28.291
The 11 circuit called it astonishing in its opinion that it got the court to

635
00:26:28.571 --> 00:26:31.240
revisit what the trial judge had done and overturn it.

636
00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.320
But that's a very,

637
00:26:32.321 --> 00:26:35.170
very high burden to meet on appeal.

638
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.100
<v 1>And,</v>

639
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.110
and we shoot this,

640
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.191
he cases,

641
00:26:39.191 --> 00:26:39.290
uh,

642
00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:42.070
is a really aberrational case that in most cases,

643
00:26:42.071 --> 00:26:42.431
in fact,

644
00:26:42.431 --> 00:26:44.380
I think not long after that,

645
00:26:44.381 --> 00:26:49.381
the 11th circuit had a case called [inaudible] versus commissioner where over 20

646
00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.630
strikes had been used against African Americans,

647
00:26:52.631 --> 00:26:56.800
basically every strike and the court upheld and it was upheld all the way

648
00:26:56.801 --> 00:26:59.200
through the Alabama courts and the federal courts.

649
00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:04.150
But of course the more typical cases where maybe eight strikes are used against

650
00:27:04.151 --> 00:27:06.700
the eight African Americans and the jury pool.

651
00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.490
And those are normally upheld or are they not?

652
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.111
<v 2>They are.</v>

653
00:27:10.111 --> 00:27:15.111
And I would just also add that often you don't need 23 strikes because African

654
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.690
Americans are being limited from jury selection in other ways,

655
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.470
um,

656
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.530
through the way that the jury pool is selected.

657
00:27:22.531 --> 00:27:23.860
So in counties there the,

658
00:27:23.861 --> 00:27:26.570
we call these under-representation problems.

659
00:27:26.571 --> 00:27:30.540
So there could be problems like they use voting list or driver's license,

660
00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:30.840
or there's,

661
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:34.740
there's certain ways of selecting juries that counties can employ that will lead

662
00:27:34.741 --> 00:27:39.150
to fewer African Americans ever being called for jury service in the first

663
00:27:39.151 --> 00:27:39.570
place.

664
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:40.170
Um,

665
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.020
and those are what we call under-representation problems.

666
00:27:43.021 --> 00:27:47.100
So what I see in a lot of Alabama cases is that even in counties with a very

667
00:27:47.101 --> 00:27:49.410
substantial African American population,

668
00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:53.940
you might see a jury pool in which out of a hundred people there are only four

669
00:27:53.941 --> 00:27:56.760
people called for jury service who are African American.

670
00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:57.931
In a case like that,

671
00:27:57.931 --> 00:28:00.420
the prosecutor doesn't need 23 strikes to remove them,

672
00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:01.070
right?

673
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.780
He or she only needs to use a couple and it's,

674
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:04.531
you know,

675
00:28:04.531 --> 00:28:07.590
you come up with a few reasons and then there's really very little,

676
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.570
we can do 'em on appeal.

677
00:28:09.571 --> 00:28:13.690
And I think that is a perfect example of why Mckay,

678
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:17.670
he really is the rare case because often it's four or five strikes and the

679
00:28:17.671 --> 00:28:20.550
courts will just defer to what the prosecutor did.

680
00:28:20.551 --> 00:28:25.290
So eji several years ago filed the lawsuit addressing these under-representation

681
00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:28.860
problems because there are African Americans in every county who've never been

682
00:28:28.861 --> 00:28:30.930
called for jury service.

683
00:28:30.931 --> 00:28:34.860
And so it's rare to have a situation where you have that many people in the

684
00:28:34.861 --> 00:28:35.570
pool.

685
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:35.910
Um,

686
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:37.770
and then the prosecutor strikes all of them.

687
00:28:37.771 --> 00:28:39.930
And then the prosecutor gives basically a,

688
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.450
a pretty outrageous region on the record.

689
00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:42.870
Um,

690
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:43.350
that's,

691
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:45.330
that's a unique situation.

692
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:46.050
So,

693
00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:46.310
yeah,

694
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:47.630
<v 1>and as a general rule,</v>

695
00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.890
the prosecutors strikes are not aggregated where we look from case to case to

696
00:28:51.891 --> 00:28:52.341
case.

697
00:28:52.341 --> 00:28:56.490
I know in North Carolina they put together all the strikes and death penalty

698
00:28:56.510 --> 00:29:01.510
cases of jurors and it was profound in terms of how a out of balance it was that

699
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.170
African American jurors were being struck so much more,

700
00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:06.780
uh,

701
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:07.820
than white jurors.

702
00:29:07.821 --> 00:29:08.360
But,

703
00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.140
and your lawsuit,

704
00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.600
you actually looked at one jurisdiction in Alabama.

705
00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:12.351
We did.

706
00:29:12.351 --> 00:29:13.180
So we,

707
00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.140
<v 2>Houston County,</v>

708
00:29:14.141 --> 00:29:14.974
Alabama,

709
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.490
which is a county with a very high capital sentencing rate,

710
00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.650
a large African American population,

711
00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:22.480
yet we're almost,

712
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:27.430
every death penalty case is tried before an all white or nearly all white jury.

713
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:27.790
Um,

714
00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.500
and that was the basis of the lawsuit.

715
00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.850
And I think what,

716
00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:31.690
um,

717
00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:36.690
what you see in a lot of these cases is there really isn't any mechanism for

718
00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:41.910
looking from case to case to case except we can allege as in support of our

719
00:29:42.761 --> 00:29:43.571
discrimination,

720
00:29:43.571 --> 00:29:48.571
we can urge the court to look back at previous findings of discrimination or at

721
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.710
um,

722
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.750
the extent to which these strikes are used.

723
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.820
So there are ways we can try to get that in.

724
00:29:54.821 --> 00:29:58.570
But I think one of the problems with the way Batson works now is that there

725
00:29:58.571 --> 00:30:00.760
isn't a mechanism for that.

726
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:02.740
And so in this report that Eji did,

727
00:30:02.741 --> 00:30:05.800
we urge people in communities to,

728
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.550
you know,

729
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:11.550
go into their courtrooms in their local towns and cities and watch what's

730
00:30:11.771 --> 00:30:16.210
happening in jury selection and document and monitor what the courts are doing

731
00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:16.590
and,

732
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:21.370
and publicizes as we're trying to do in our community in Alabama because the,

733
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.120
um,

734
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.980
one of the biggest challenges is that,

735
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.580
you know,

736
00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.890
this stuff happens behind closed doors,

737
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.120
often in small courtrooms where there aren't people watching and documenting

738
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:32.680
what's going on.

739
00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:35.620
And the results I think kind of speak for themselves.

740
00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:41.320
<v 1>Thurgood Marshall said in his pain and bats and the only solution was to</v>

741
00:30:41.901 --> 00:30:44.390
eliminate peremptory strikes.

742
00:30:44.391 --> 00:30:45.224
Was He right?

743
00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.120
<v 2>I,</v>

744
00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.590
I'm not sure he was right,

745
00:30:48.591 --> 00:30:51.960
but I think it's certainly if things continue the way they,

746
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:52.821
they have been,

747
00:30:52.821 --> 00:30:55.310
I think he will be proven.

748
00:30:55.311 --> 00:30:55.650
Right.

749
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:55.851
Um,

750
00:30:55.851 --> 00:31:00.851
I think the only way to kind of write the ship is to do several different things

751
00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:03.740
to improve accountability.

752
00:31:03.741 --> 00:31:07.880
And the reason I'm inclined to think Thurgood Marshall might be right is that I

753
00:31:07.881 --> 00:31:12.260
haven't seen much evidence of a commitment to doing the things we need to do to

754
00:31:12.261 --> 00:31:15.110
improve accountability and to eliminate racial discrimination.

755
00:31:15.111 --> 00:31:17.930
And I think training defense lawyers as part of this,

756
00:31:17.931 --> 00:31:22.670
I think I'm holding prosecutors accountable is a big part of it.

757
00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:23.780
I also think that,

758
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:24.643
um,

759
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:25.940
there are,

760
00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:30.950
there are procedural bars which are employed that you kind of alluded to

761
00:31:30.951 --> 00:31:31.401
earlier,

762
00:31:31.401 --> 00:31:36.110
that there are lots of technical reasons that make it hard for harder to prove

763
00:31:36.111 --> 00:31:38.750
discrimination and to get courts to do something about it,

764
00:31:38.751 --> 00:31:39.920
even if you do prove it.

765
00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.600
So there are people who have been executed,

766
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:42.440
um,

767
00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.790
despite overwhelming evidence that their jury was illegally selected.

768
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.780
And that's because we have these procedural bars that allow courts to say,

769
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:51.411
oh,

770
00:31:51.411 --> 00:31:52.670
this is a very valid claim,

771
00:31:52.671 --> 00:31:53.540
but it's too late.

772
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:56.450
You should have raised it earlier at trial and sorry,

773
00:31:56.451 --> 00:31:57.590
there's nothing we can do.

774
00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:02.600
And with that kind of attitude towards something as fundamental as having a fair

775
00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.930
jury of your peers decide whether you live or die,

776
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:07.250
it's hard to see,

777
00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.090
um,

778
00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:13.090
that were sort of making progress towards the aspiration of bats and becoming a

779
00:32:13.641 --> 00:32:15.950
reality for people who go to trial.

780
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:16.981
<v 1>Well,</v>

781
00:32:16.981 --> 00:32:18.570
thank you very much for talking to us.

782
00:32:18.571 --> 00:32:18.811
I mean,

783
00:32:18.811 --> 00:32:23.700
what we see is that people who for years were not allowed to vote and therefore

784
00:32:23.701 --> 00:32:27.120
weren't on the voter or the journalists at all.

785
00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.710
Now they're on the juror list,

786
00:32:28.711 --> 00:32:30.240
but they continue to be struck.

787
00:32:30.241 --> 00:32:33.660
So as you said about the people you talked to in the study,

788
00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:34.180
uh,

789
00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.630
they're still going home without serving as jurors,

790
00:32:36.631 --> 00:32:38.220
even though technically,

791
00:32:38.221 --> 00:32:39.910
legally they're to be.

792
00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:41.830
But because of these practices,

793
00:32:41.831 --> 00:32:42.611
we're still seeing,

794
00:32:42.611 --> 00:32:43.600
even in the deep south,

795
00:32:43.601 --> 00:32:44.321
even in the states,

796
00:32:44.321 --> 00:32:48.010
the old confederacy with very substantial African American populations,

797
00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.370
we're still seeing death pi cases tried to all white juries.

798
00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.420
Yes.

799
00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.253
And I think that's,

800
00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.790
that's something we see routinely,

801
00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:55.653
unfortunately.

802
00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:56.261
Well,

803
00:32:56.261 --> 00:32:57.430
thank you again for being willing.
