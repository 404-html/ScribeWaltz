1
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.120
Let's take a look at how the death police worked in the time since Furman versus

2
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:19.920
Georgia held that it was unconstitutional.

3
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.990
And then 1976,

4
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:23.400
Greg versus Georgia held,

5
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.970
uh,

6
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.470
that it was constitutional.

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.560
1976 the court upheld the so called guided discretion statutes let states have

8
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:34.530
the depth pony as long as jury's head discretion,

9
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:38.220
whether to impose it struck down the mandatory death pony statutes.

10
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.570
And those have been the case,

11
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:43.230
the statutes that we've had since 1976.

12
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.250
Uh,

13
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.910
there've been some reservations expressed about how well the death penalty has

14
00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:48.600
worked,

15
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.910
whether all of the fixes that,

16
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.830
uh,

17
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.320
were advocated to what it was said in 1976 that the problems that Fermin

18
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.173
identified,

19
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.250
the arbitrariness and the death pony,

20
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.760
the racial discrimination and other factors had been corrected.

21
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.990
Well,

22
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.321
uh,

23
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:09.321
in 1994 and probably one of the first major questionings of the death pony,

24
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.530
a Justice Harry Blackmun who was appointed to the Supreme Court,

25
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.320
uh,

26
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.370
by President Richard Nixon and who voted to uphold the death polling in the firm

27
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:22.530
and case was one of the four dissenters and Ferman voted to uphold the death

28
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:27.531
pony in all of the 1976 cases and repeatedly voted to uphold the death pony for

29
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:29.820
a number of years,

30
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.781
uh,

31
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:34.110
announced in the case of Collins Versus Collins,

32
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.891
uh,

33
00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:35.790
that he would,

34
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:36.421
as he said,

35
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:39.930
no longer tinker with the machinery of death.

36
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.800
Uh,

37
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.800
justice black when explained that the court's decisions that mitigating

38
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:47.100
circumstances,

39
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:51.510
anything about the life and background of the accused could be taken into

40
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:52.344
account,

41
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.280
uh,

42
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.280
made it almost impossible for there to be consistency in the imposition of the

43
00:01:58.771 --> 00:01:59.604
death penalty.

44
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.360
Uh,

45
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.360
he found the consistency was constitutionally required,

46
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.310
but he found that the requirement that anything be considered in mitigation,

47
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:08.911
uh,

48
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:11.640
really put these two constitutional guarantees,

49
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.230
intention with one another,

50
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.921
uh,

51
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:16.380
and made it almost impossible,

52
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.100
uh,

53
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.620
to have a consistently applied death pony.

54
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.221
Of course,

55
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:21.720
there are a lot of other reasons for that.

56
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:23.910
The discretion exercise by prosecutors,

57
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:27.300
the quality of lawyers better in some cases than others.

58
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.840
Uh,

59
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.210
lots of other factors that contributed to it.

60
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.750
Uh,

61
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.920
he also expressed,

62
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.610
uh,

63
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.810
his dismay,

64
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.680
uh,

65
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.680
that the court had gone back on some many of the procedural protections that

66
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:42.720
exist in particularly habeas corpus review,

67
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.020
which existed in 1976 but which the court kind of relentlessly cut back on until

68
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.760
1996 when Congress then,

69
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.540
uh,

70
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.390
past the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act,

71
00:02:57.391 --> 00:02:58.980
which greatly restricted,

72
00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.561
uh,

73
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:03.700
the power of the federal courts to grant review and cases.

74
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.120
So he comes to the conclusion that the death penalty for all these reasons.

75
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:11.210
Also the fact that race,

76
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.680
uh,

77
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.300
that didn't McCluskey versus Kemp,

78
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:18.040
the Supreme Court had said that a certain amount of racial discrimination was

79
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:18.874
tolerable,

80
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.271
uh,

81
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:20.800
in the imposition of the death penalty.

82
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.540
He says at this point,

83
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:26.260
I will no longer a tinker with a machinery of death.

84
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.251
Uh,

85
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:28.360
Justice Scalia,

86
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.141
uh,

87
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:30.790
response in a dissent,

88
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.960
uh,

89
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.960
he reasserts the position that he been asserting for some time before this case

90
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:40.930
came down in 1994 and that was,

91
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.441
uh,

92
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:46.210
that the court shouldn't allow sentences to consider anything about the life and

93
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:49.090
background of the defendant in mitigation,

94
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.800
that the state should be able to restrict what could be considered in

95
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:54.634
mitigation.

96
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.653
So,

97
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.350
uh,

98
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.900
basically there's a back and forth between the two of them.

99
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:03.250
This was not a case that the court decided this was a case in which the court

100
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:05.380
denied review of the case.

101
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.510
And Justice Blackmun wrote a dissenting opinion saying,

102
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.171
uh,

103
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:15.520
I would grant review and vacate the death penalty for all these reasons because

104
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.710
I think the death penalty is unconstitutional.

105
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.720
Justice Scalia just wrote a statement,

106
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:23.410
concurring saying that he did not agree with justice.

107
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:26.110
Blackmun's critique a of the death penalty.

108
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.591
I,

109
00:04:26.591 --> 00:04:28.030
this was going to happen again,

110
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.661
uh,

111
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:30.640
in the case of bass versus Reese,

112
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.360
uh,

113
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.260
which was,

114
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.101
uh,

115
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:35.440
the lethal injection case out of Kentucky,

116
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.540
uh,

117
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.110
in his opinion in which she upheld lethal injection,

118
00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:42.670
saying that under the court's precedent,

119
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:46.900
he thought that what Kentucky was doing did not violate the constitution.

120
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.770
Uh,

121
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.030
justice Stevens,

122
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.750
uh,

123
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.720
look back on his career on the court.

124
00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:54.970
He was appointed by President Ford.

125
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.720
Uh,

126
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.680
he served,

127
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.663
uh,

128
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.860
he was alive at the time of Greg,

129
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.761
uh,

130
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:02.470
and it's still alive.

131
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.230
Uh,

132
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.730
when,

133
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.560
when he handed down this decision in,

134
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:05.791
in,

135
00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:06.624
in Bays,

136
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:07.330
uh,

137
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.400
he said he had come to the conclusion,

138
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:10.310
uh,

139
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.830
that the problems with the death punny,

140
00:05:11.831 --> 00:05:15.910
that justice white identified in his concurring opinion in Furman versus

141
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:16.300
Georgia.

142
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.571
We're,

143
00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:19.720
we're in fact just as accurate today as they were then,

144
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.670
that the duck plenty was shoes.

145
00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:22.750
So Seldomly,

146
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:23.410
uh,

147
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.820
so arbitrarily,

148
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.660
uh,

149
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.493
that,

150
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.370
uh,

151
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.170
race was still a factor,

152
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.920
uh,

153
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.550
in,

154
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.120
uh,

155
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.580
whether or not the death penalty was used or not.

156
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.361
Uh,

157
00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:37.030
that as he put it,

158
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:42.031
the needless extinction of life with only marginal contributions,

159
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.940
uh,

160
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.940
to any discernible social or public purpose was patiently excessive and

161
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:48.731
violated.

162
00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:52.810
The eighth amendment that is there was just as just as white said,

163
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.660
the way in which the death planes being imposed is serving almost no value to

164
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.523
society.

165
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.610
Some people are getting it,

166
00:05:58.611 --> 00:05:59.540
some people aren't.

167
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.740
There's no reason,

168
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.500
principled reason why some are in some art,

169
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.720
and therefore it's an excessive and cruel and unusual punishment.

170
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.033
Um,

171
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.170
Justice Scalia responded to justice Stevens justice.

172
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.430
He had responded to justice Blackmun.

173
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:17.420
Uh,

174
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.961
he said,

175
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:21.920
would it look like what Stevens was saying was that if the punishment wasn't

176
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:23.120
retributive enough,

177
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.661
uh,

178
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:25.310
it wasn't retributive at all.

179
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.330
Uh,

180
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.920
he also said and made two arguments that the supporters of the death pony,

181
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.053
uh,

182
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.830
have made and continue to make,

183
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:39.070
one that some crimes are such an affront to humanity,

184
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.021
uh,

185
00:06:40.021 --> 00:06:42.680
that the only response is the death penalty.

186
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.400
A,

187
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.470
this is what Justice Stewart said,

188
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:46.040
uh,

189
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.750
way back in Greg versus Georgia,

190
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:48.111
that,

191
00:06:48.111 --> 00:06:48.500
uh,

192
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.640
they're just some crimes that this is the way they should be punished.

193
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:53.511
And finally,

194
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:56.720
he said that it should be left up to the legislatures.

195
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.711
Actually,

196
00:06:57.711 --> 00:07:01.400
a number of legislatures have taken action on the death penalty.

197
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:02.480
Uh,

198
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.200
five states that once had the death penalty have repealed it.

199
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.543
Uh,

200
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.080
in addition to that,

201
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:12.530
New York's Court of Appeals declared the New York death penalty

202
00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:13.760
unconstitutional,

203
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.780
uh,

204
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.860
in the 1990s,

205
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.401
uh,

206
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:18.830
has been no effort to bring the death pony back.

207
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.341
Uh,

208
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:20.180
in New York,

209
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.250
a governors of three states,

210
00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:22.971
Colorado,

211
00:07:22.971 --> 00:07:23.571
Oregon,

212
00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:24.500
and Washington,

213
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:25.070
uh,

214
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.540
have declared Moratoria on the death penalty in their states saying that they

215
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:30.261
were not,

216
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:32.210
it didn't stop the death plenty.

217
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.440
They didn't commute the sentences,

218
00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:34.274
but they said,

219
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.480
we're not gonna allow anybody else to be executed until we've studied and given

220
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:40.160
us a greater thought.

221
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:40.941
Uh,

222
00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:41.721
in addition,

223
00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:46.190
other people have raised reservations about the death pony.

224
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:51.191
President Jimmy Carter was governor of Georgia in 1973 when Georgia's death

225
00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:57.350
penalty law was passed after it had been declared unconstitutional the year

226
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:58.183
before in Fermin,

227
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.060
uh,

228
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.550
in November of 2013,

229
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:02.660
President Carter,

230
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.260
uh,

231
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.690
announced that he was opposed to the death pony.

232
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.760
He was opposed because it was,

233
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.040
he said it was being,

234
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:10.730
uh,

235
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.860
the people getting the death polling where the poor,

236
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:13.730
uh,

237
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:14.810
the mentally limited,

238
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:15.711
uh,

239
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:18.530
and because of race entering in to the factor,

240
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:18.920
uh,

241
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.120
entering in as a factor,

242
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:20.720
uh,

243
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.490
he made that speech at,

244
00:08:22.491 --> 00:08:23.120
uh,

245
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.010
the Carter Presidential Library.

246
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.030
Uh,

247
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.320
and it's on the website,

248
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:27.520
uh,

249
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.430
of the library.

250
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:29.181
Uh,

251
00:08:29.181 --> 00:08:30.980
other people have raised questions.

252
00:08:30.981 --> 00:08:33.950
A number of death sentences in the country has declined.

253
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:34.760
Uh,

254
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.760
so there will continue to be an ongoing debate in some legislatures and somewhat

255
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:40.904
in the courts,

256
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.481
uh,

257
00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:44.270
about the appropriateness of the death public.

258
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.820
The supporters of the death penalty,

259
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:47.720
uh,

260
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.650
say that it is appropriate in a few cases,

261
00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:53.600
particularly the heinous cases.

262
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:54.141
Of course,

263
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:57.570
we've seen that it's not always limited to those cases,

264
00:08:57.571 --> 00:08:59.820
but the argument of course is that it should be.

265
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:00.770
Uh,

266
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.310
but of course when each prosecutor gets to decide in each judicial district all

267
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:06.150
over the country,

268
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.370
that may not always happened.

269
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.200
The violent crime rate,

270
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:10.650
uh,

271
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.780
particularly for murder has gone down.

272
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.620
Uh,

273
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.880
some attribute that,

274
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.660
uh,

275
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.580
to the presence of the death penalty,

276
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:18.330
uh,

277
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.440
some say that these trends are irrelevant to the death penalty.

278
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.280
Uh,

279
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.280
some prosecutors have argued that they have to have the death penalty in order

280
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:32.430
to get plea bargains to life imprisonment without parole.

281
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.780
That the death penalty can be used as sort of bludgeon people into guilty pleas.

282
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:37.711
Of course,

283
00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:40.830
there are a number of states that no longer have the death penalty,

284
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:41.600
uh,

285
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.080
that seemed to get plea bargains,

286
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:43.710
uh,

287
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:44.730
even without it.

288
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:45.660
Uh,

289
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.190
and there's some ethical moral question about whether the death plenty can be

290
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:51.024
used.

291
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:51.520
Uh,

292
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.270
just to try to get plea bargains out of people,

293
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:54.690
uh,

294
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.770
to say to someone,

295
00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:57.600
if you don't take the plea offer,

296
00:09:57.601 --> 00:09:58.830
we're going to get the death penalty,

297
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.100
give you the death pony.

298
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.010
Because if that's the case,

299
00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:06.780
if the person turns down the plea offer a then the prosecutor has to seek the

300
00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:08.370
death penalty to make good on the,

301
00:10:08.371 --> 00:10:09.204
on the threat.

302
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:13.080
And someone who was never really seen as appropriate for the death.

303
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:15.060
Pawnee ends up on death row.

304
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:15.990
Uh,

305
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.823
so,

306
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:17.783
uh,

307
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.201
Josh,

308
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:19.981
Marcie has said,

309
00:10:19.981 --> 00:10:20.161
well,

310
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.570
the depth pony is arbitrary,

311
00:10:21.571 --> 00:10:23.280
but so is homicide.

312
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:24.390
Uh,

313
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.650
deaths are arbitrary.

314
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:26.580
Uh,

315
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.100
so we shouldn't worry as much about the death penalty.

316
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:29.941
Uh,

317
00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:34.050
there's of course a debate about whether innocent people have been executed.

318
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:34.890
Uh,

319
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.870
many of the proponents of depth,

320
00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:39.900
plenty say there has never been justice Scalia particularly.

321
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:43.650
You said there's never been innocent person executed.

322
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:44.580
Uh,

323
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:49.440
some of the opponents have taken exception to that and say Carlos de Luna that

324
00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:52.800
if you read what Jim Liebman and others have written about Carlos de Luna,

325
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:53.670
uh,

326
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.410
he was probably the wrong man.

327
00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:58.890
It was probably another man named Carlos who committed the crime.

328
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.510
A Todd Willingham,

329
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:00.831
the,

330
00:11:00.831 --> 00:11:02.370
the fellow convicted of arson,

331
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.120
uh,

332
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.890
killing his own children in Texas.

333
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:05.580
Uh,

334
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.990
it may have been an accidental fire,

335
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.040
may not have been arson,

336
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.540
but these arguments,

337
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:10.290
uh,

338
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.580
continue to,

339
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.150
uh,

340
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.020
go on,

341
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.273
um,

342
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.110
DNA evidence.

343
00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:16.890
Uh,

344
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.330
now that we have DNA evidence,

345
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:20.730
we don't make as many mistakes as we used to make.

346
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:26.210
Woody and evidence DNA evidence has certainly shown that a lot of mistakes had

347
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:27.384
been made,

348
00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.170
uh,

349
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.650
in capital and non capital criminal cases.

350
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:32.340
Uh,

351
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.570
the problem is the DNA evidence and bodily fluids that are subject to DNA

352
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:39.900
evidence are only available in about 10% of cases.

353
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.910
So in those cases,

354
00:11:41.911 --> 00:11:46.911
there's blood or hair or semen or some other bodily fluid or hair,

355
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.710
whatever,

356
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:50.130
uh,

357
00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.270
which can be tested.

358
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.350
Uh,

359
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.830
but in the other 90%,

360
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.270
there isn't a,

361
00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:59.830
and we still have the issues of misidentification and a false testimony from

362
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:04.831
informants and other things that contribute to innocent people being accused and

363
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.040
sometimes,

364
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:06.880
uh,

365
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.331
uh,

366
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:08.620
convicted of crimes.

367
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:09.610
Uh,

368
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:14.410
the other argument is that there's this review of the death by automatic appeal

369
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:16.270
once somebody sends to death at trial.

370
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.060
There's an automatic appeal to the state Supreme Court.

371
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:24.330
There's a long drawn out review process in both the state courts and then in the

372
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:26.523
Federal Habeas Corpus courts.

373
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.831
Chris,

374
00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:29.080
one of the reasons that Justice Blackmun,

375
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:29.981
uh,

376
00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:34.981
announced his opposition to the death pony after going along with it for so many

377
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:40.230
years was the fact that Habeas Corpus review had been cut back so much and would

378
00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:45.100
be cut back even more with the passage of the antiterrorism and effective death

379
00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:45.934
penalty act,

380
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.990
which established the statute of limitations which has been missed.

381
00:12:49.991 --> 00:12:52.480
And over 50 death penalty cases,

382
00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:55.960
meaning people got no review whatsoever if their cases,

383
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:56.620
uh,

384
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.730
by the federal courts.

385
00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:58.330
Uh,

386
00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:59.260
but in theory,

387
00:12:59.460 --> 00:12:59.871
uh,

388
00:12:59.871 --> 00:13:01.510
that review as possible,

389
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:01.961
of course,

390
00:13:01.961 --> 00:13:04.570
the court's review only the issues that are preserved,

391
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.340
the issues where objections were made,

392
00:13:06.341 --> 00:13:07.174
where,

393
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:07.630
uh,

394
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.463
something was,

395
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:09.040
uh,

396
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:09.873
challenged,

397
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:10.630
uh,

398
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.950
somebody has a bad lawyer,

399
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:12.460
uh,

400
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:13.293
very often,

401
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.350
unfortunately,

402
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:14.651
uh,

403
00:13:14.651 --> 00:13:15.850
that doesn't happen.

404
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:16.871
Uh,

405
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:17.890
and then finally,

406
00:13:17.891 --> 00:13:20.260
the high quality of representation,

407
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.940
uh,

408
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.130
for people facing the death pony.

409
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:29.680
I don't mean to take these apart just for the sake of doing it.

410
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:30.580
Uh,

411
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.150
but unfortunately the quality of lawyers representing people in the death

412
00:13:34.151 --> 00:13:35.470
penalty cases,

413
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:36.070
uh,

414
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.270
has been a disgrace.

415
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.110
A three cases in Houston where lawyers slept during the trial,

416
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:41.651
uh,

417
00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:45.730
cases where lawyers who missed the statute of limitations were then appointed to

418
00:13:45.731 --> 00:13:48.070
represent people at trial where people who,

419
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:48.731
uh,

420
00:13:48.731 --> 00:13:53.731
were just absolutely a incompetent by any standard continue to be appointed in

421
00:13:55.841 --> 00:13:57.490
case after case after case,

422
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.180
uh,

423
00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.000
by,

424
00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.350
uh,

425
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:04.000
judges particularly in Texas and Alabama and some of the states that send the

426
00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:05.200
most people to death row.

427
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.170
I think when it comes to the support for the death pony,

428
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:13.380
you come back to the two points that Justice Scalia made a in the base case,

429
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:14.231
uh,

430
00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:14.980
one,

431
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.341
uh,

432
00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:20.341
that there are some crimes that are just so heinous that some people would say

433
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.630
those crimes have to be punished,

434
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.110
uh,

435
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.100
with the death penalty.

436
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:24.971
Uh,

437
00:14:24.971 --> 00:14:25.631
and second,

438
00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:27.160
that it's up to the legislature's,

439
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:27.701
uh,

440
00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:28.630
to decide,

441
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.080
uh,

442
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.240
whether or not society should have the death,

443
00:14:31.241 --> 00:14:31.721
plenty of not,

444
00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:34.870
or whether or not a particular state should have the death penalty or not.

445
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.800
Uh,

446
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.870
but there have to be caveats with that,

447
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:38.680
uh,

448
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.990
that if there are those crimes,

449
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:41.740
uh,

450
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.440
that are so heinous that the death penalty is imposed,

451
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:49.830
then there needs to be amendments to definitely statutes to limit the death

452
00:14:50.141 --> 00:14:50.850
penalty,

453
00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:51.290
uh,

454
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.340
to those crimes.

455
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.001
Uh,

456
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:53.870
right now,

457
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:54.651
uh,

458
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:55.940
convenience store robbery,

459
00:14:55.941 --> 00:14:57.560
somebody goes into a convenience store,

460
00:14:57.561 --> 00:14:58.610
robs a store,

461
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:00.830
police officers respond,

462
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:03.290
or the person at the store,

463
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.980
uh,

464
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:08.150
responds or a customer comes in for whatever reason someone is killed.

465
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:09.410
And the process of that,

466
00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:10.100
it's horrible,

467
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:10.933
tragic.

468
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.320
And the person should be prosecuted and the person should certainly be punished

469
00:15:15.321 --> 00:15:16.250
for what they did.

470
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.150
Uh,

471
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.480
but there are a lot of cases like that and only a few of them,

472
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.260
uh,

473
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.490
end up with a death pony.

474
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.080
So those are not that,

475
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:25.161
uh,

476
00:15:25.161 --> 00:15:26.360
the serial killers,

477
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.270
the mass murders are people like that.

478
00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:29.760
Uh,

479
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.920
Timothy Mcveigh's,

480
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:31.460
uh,

481
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.900
that people imagine a,

482
00:15:32.901 --> 00:15:37.490
for the death pony when they say it's reserved for certain cases where only the

483
00:15:37.491 --> 00:15:39.710
death penalty should be imposed.

484
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:40.390
Uh,

485
00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:44.540
and the other is there certainly has to be a commitment to make sure that in

486
00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:46.070
every death penalty case,

487
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.170
the person who's facing the death,

488
00:15:48.171 --> 00:15:52.280
Tony is adequately represented at every stage of the process.

489
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:56.090
If people are not represented by competent counsel at trial,

490
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:56.750
uh,

491
00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:00.710
if they're given an incompetent lawyer for the review process,

492
00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:02.720
who misses the statute of limitations,

493
00:16:02.721 --> 00:16:07.250
thereby depriving them of any review of their case by the federal courts,

494
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.270
uh,

495
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:12.140
then a lot of these arguments drop out of the picture,

496
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.950
uh,

497
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:13.783
because,

498
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.240
uh,

499
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.140
they're not there.

500
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.041
Uh,

501
00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:18.680
and yet there's not really,

502
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:19.600
uh,

503
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.600
the effort about the land and in the states that still have the death point to

504
00:16:24.621 --> 00:16:29.180
try to limit it to the absolute worst of the worst,

505
00:16:29.181 --> 00:16:30.560
the most heinous cases.

506
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:31.310
Uh,

507
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.420
and in many places,

508
00:16:32.421 --> 00:16:34.220
particularly the ones that impose it more,

509
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.150
most often,

510
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.390
Texas being the most often,

511
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.170
uh,

512
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.940
the quality of legal representation,

513
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:41.870
uh,

514
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:42.703
is dismal.

515
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.890
And so that's where we are with the death.

516
00:16:45.891 --> 00:16:47.120
Plenty of the United States,

517
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:47.691
uh,

518
00:16:47.691 --> 00:16:49.040
it has a lot of problems.

519
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:49.791
Uh,

520
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:51.110
it's still arbitrary.

521
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.130
Uh,

522
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.800
it's still imposed primarily upon poor people,

523
00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:58.700
upon people who commit their crimes against white people,

524
00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.300
uh,

525
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.120
much more often against people of color,

526
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.440
people of African American,

527
00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:04.274
Mexican,

528
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.293
Hispanic,

529
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.160
other,

530
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:06.560
uh,

531
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.460
ethnicities.

532
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:08.241
Uh,

533
00:17:08.241 --> 00:17:11.960
and very often as was dealt with in another segment,

534
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.123
uh,

535
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.310
imposed upon people who are intellectually disabled.

536
00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:17.690
It is mentally retarded,

537
00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.260
or people who are profoundly mentally ill.

538
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.460
Uh,

539
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.450
and so,

540
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:24.710
uh,

541
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:25.860
that's the death only,

542
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.540
uh,

543
00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.360
that we have in the United States of America today.
