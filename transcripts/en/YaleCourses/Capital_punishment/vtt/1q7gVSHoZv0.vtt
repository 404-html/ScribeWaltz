1
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.440
In the 1960s,

2
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.580
uh,

3
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.730
the decision was made in the United States to d institutionalized.

4
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:19.530
Many people who were in mental hospitals.

5
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:23.850
There were a huge number of people over 500,000 who were in mental hospitals.

6
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.830
And because of the new drugs that were available to treat people because of

7
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:29.760
other developments,

8
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.130
most of those people were released,

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.671
uh,

10
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:34.710
for those who had families and support.

11
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.260
Uh,

12
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.260
they were able often to make it in the community and to continue to have a

13
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.941
lives,

14
00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:42.810
sometimes a very productive ones,

15
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.321
uh,

16
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:44.430
for people who are poor,

17
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.331
uh,

18
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:48.450
for people who had no one to make sure they took their medicine,

19
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.171
uh,

20
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:50.880
no one to look after them.

21
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.330
Uh,

22
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.920
many of them ended on the streets,

23
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:54.090
ended up on the streets.

24
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.631
Uh,

25
00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:57.270
and many ended up in prisons and jails.

26
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.320
Today,

27
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.320
the largest mental institution in any community is the local jail or the local

28
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:05.220
prison.

29
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.270
So we're going to look today at some of the issues that arise and all kinds of

30
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:10.021
criminal cases,

31
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:12.120
but obviously we'll focus on the ones that come up,

32
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.601
uh,

33
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:13.860
in death penalty cases.

34
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.000
Uh,

35
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.620
all kinds of people with mental disorders come into the criminal justice system.

36
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.350
Some with major disorders,

37
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.860
uh,

38
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.390
some with less,

39
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:28.140
some who commit major crimes and some who commit petty crimes.

40
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:30.690
It can range from the homeless person,

41
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:31.380
uh,

42
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.640
suffering from schizophrenia who camps out on the street or goes in the bus

43
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:38.580
station and won't leave because that's where they keep warm.

44
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:40.470
And those kind of people may be arrested,

45
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.071
uh,

46
00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:43.920
and may cycle in and out of jail all the time.

47
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.611
Uh,

48
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:46.740
it may be a person who has manic episode,

49
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:48.990
someone who may at a time,

50
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.560
uh,

51
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.550
spend money they don't have or steal cars or,

52
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.540
or steal anything for that matter.

53
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.290
Uh,

54
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.570
but then once they're restored to their medication,

55
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.080
uh,

56
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.010
they may be,

57
00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.610
uh,

58
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.170
able to avoid the mood swings of being very manic on one hand being very

59
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:05.130
depressed on the other,

60
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:06.750
sometime when those people are arrested,

61
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.300
uh,

62
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.570
they become incredibly depressed,

63
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.960
uh,

64
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.080
which may affect how they deal with their criminal cases.

65
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.011
And then of course,

66
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:19.011
there can be the person that believes that another person is controlling them

67
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:20.850
through their dental work,

68
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.481
uh,

69
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:23.850
and is causing them all sorts of,

70
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:24.120
uh,

71
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.230
to hear all sorts of voices to have all sorts of delusions and basically thinks

72
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:32.820
they're tormenting them and walks into the person's office and fires and kills

73
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:33.511
that person.

74
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:34.740
So we have a murder case,

75
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.341
uh,

76
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:40.341
that is a product or a result of someone suffering from mental delusions,

77
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.790
uh,

78
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.140
say a person suffering from schizophrenia in capital cases.

79
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.951
Uh,

80
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:49.440
of course all the cases are going to involve murders.

81
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.820
They're going to involve homicides,

82
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.511
uh,

83
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:53.550
and vary from time to time.

84
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:54.241
Not very often,

85
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:55.350
but from time to time,

86
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.090
uh,

87
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.160
they're going to be cases where their mental health issues,

88
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.340
which go to the issues I'm about to talk about their competency for trial.

89
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.413
Uh,

90
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.550
it may be their future dangerousness,

91
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.450
uh,

92
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.200
for,

93
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.590
uh,

94
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.170
whether or not they're going to be a continuing danger to society.

95
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:16.171
And so the question really can come down to is this person so ill that society

96
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.050
treats them or so dangerous that society kills them?

97
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.320
And we'll look at how these issues arise in the criminal justice process that a

98
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.030
lot of difficulty,

99
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.940
uh,

100
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.700
in dealing with mental disorders,

101
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:35.410
regardless of what kind of case it is,

102
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:37.240
and regardless of what the issue is,

103
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.320
let's look at some of the difficulties that the courts have in dealing with

104
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.670
people with mental disorders,

105
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.990
any kind of mental disorders from a,

106
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.150
in any kind of cases,

107
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:48.130
whether they be small cases or,

108
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.571
or,

109
00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:50.020
or very serious cases.

110
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.890
Uh,

111
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.521
for one thing,

112
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:52.990
a person may be brilliant,

113
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.410
uh,

114
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.700
one day maybe you bring in composer or may just be a normal average person one

115
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:58.330
day,

116
00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.661
uh,

117
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:02.410
and may be totally out of touch with reality fluidly.

118
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.100
Uh,

119
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.180
floridly psychotic,

120
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.540
uh,

121
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.410
the next day.

122
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.920
Uh,

123
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.460
mental illness varies greatly from time to time.

124
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.940
Uh,

125
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.540
people can live normally for some period of time and then suddenly have a break

126
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:14.410
with reality,

127
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.950
uh,

128
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.000
when things happen.

129
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.430
So this makes it very hard to sort out later on.

130
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.300
Uh,

131
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.300
whether the person is acting out as a result of a mental illness or has just

132
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:29.800
chosen to do some bad thing and murder somebody or whatever.

133
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.820
Uh,

134
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.430
the severity of the mental illness may vary.

135
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.210
Uh,

136
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.830
may be the nature of the impairment,

137
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:37.870
what kind of mental illness the person has.

138
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.440
Uh,

139
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.760
maybe some people are more responsive to medication and then two others,

140
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.130
uh,

141
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.020
than others are.

142
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.530
Uh,

143
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.310
some people would take medication and it will work for a while,

144
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.731
uh,

145
00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:50.110
but it may produce side effects.

146
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.160
And so the person stops taking it because they don't like the side effects.

147
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.400
And then they slowly descend again into schizophrenia,

148
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.820
bipolar,

149
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.910
whatever it may be that they suffer from and their actions change as a result of

150
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:07.180
that.

151
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.481
Uh,

152
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:11.200
and it may be stress factors that a person under a tremendous amount of stress,

153
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.950
uh,

154
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.820
who has,

155
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.450
uh,

156
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:14.980
some pathology,

157
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.461
uh,

158
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:17.410
with regard to their brain functioning,

159
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.010
uh,

160
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.350
does not function well under stress.

161
00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:23.470
And it's sometimes the problems they have,

162
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:24.670
the mental problems,

163
00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:28.420
they have a sort of make it difficult for them to deal with a situation.

164
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.350
Uh,

165
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.550
initial always.

166
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.331
Uh,

167
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:31.931
not always,

168
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:34.630
but very often in cases of mental illness is,

169
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:39.310
is the person really mentally ill or is the person malingering that is just

170
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:41.650
pretending to be mentally ill?

171
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.040
And this can often be a very complicated issue because most mentally ill people

172
00:05:47.051 --> 00:05:48.550
that I've encountered at least,

173
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.241
uh,

174
00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:54.160
are very invested in people not thinking they're mentally ill.

175
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.110
They want people to see them as normal.

176
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.620
So they may say,

177
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.581
well,

178
00:05:58.581 --> 00:05:59.690
I was just pretending,

179
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.350
uh,

180
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.790
or I was just acting crazy,

181
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.331
uh,

182
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:05.870
when I did whatever the person may have done a week before.

183
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.800
Uh,

184
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.120
and so there were two ways to look at that.

185
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:08.954
One,

186
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.200
uh,

187
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.220
this is a very mentally ill person trying to convince you that he or she is not

188
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:17.690
mentally ill or this is a person telling you they're not really mentally ill at

189
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:18.350
all,

190
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.030
but that they were just pretending.

191
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.720
Uh,

192
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.270
when they engaged in some bizarre activity,

193
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.660
uh,

194
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.850
beforehand and it very difficult,

195
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:29.060
it may be impossible to know which is the answer.

196
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.150
Many cases will go to trial where witnesses for the defense will testify that

197
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:37.490
this person suffers from a major mental illness.

198
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.361
For example,

199
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:39.194
schizophrenia,

200
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.830
uh,

201
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.650
and other witnesses will testify for the prosecution.

202
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.290
This person doesn't have schizophrenia.

203
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.720
This person was malingering pretending,

204
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.381
uh,

205
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:49.214
at the time.

206
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.140
And the jury has to sort that out.

207
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.970
And decide based on all the evidence,

208
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:54.470
not just the expert testimony,

209
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:55.580
but all the evidence,

210
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.030
uh,

211
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.720
whether or not the person actually has the mental illness.

212
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.470
Uh,

213
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.430
the other question is whether we're really talking about illnesses here,

214
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:05.660
something that's,

215
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:06.733
uh,

216
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:07.190
uh,

217
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.030
subject to diagnosis by doctors,

218
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.700
uh,

219
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.200
or whether we're labeling,

220
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.950
uh,

221
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:13.783
behavior,

222
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:14.360
uh,

223
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.470
that goes on,

224
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.280
uh,

225
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:16.611
in,

226
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:16.851
in,

227
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:17.930
in people's lives.

228
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.130
Uh,

229
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.870
psychiatrist may say that after examining a person I diagnose this person is

230
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:25.760
suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.

231
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.790
They have delusions that people are after them,

232
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:33.110
and it's because of a problem in their brain,

233
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.770
which makes them paranoid and delusional.

234
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:37.701
Uh,

235
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:39.830
another person may look at a person and say,

236
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:39.981
well,

237
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:42.020
this person ran away from home,

238
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.670
was truant from school,

239
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.470
shoplifted as a child.

240
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.980
Uh,

241
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.290
did some other things after a certain age.

242
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.190
Uh,

243
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.070
and they will say that because of those behaviors,

244
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.260
that person is a,

245
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:54.771
uh,

246
00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:56.360
antisocial personality.

247
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:57.560
Uh,

248
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:57.840
just,

249
00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.190
uh,

250
00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:58.540
uh,

251
00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.750
a personality problem.

252
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:00.290
Uh,

253
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.240
not that there's any mental illness there.

254
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:02.781
Uh,

255
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:07.340
and depending upon what is determined by the court,

256
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:08.240
uh,

257
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.380
if you're antisocial,

258
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:10.970
it may be they're just a bad person.

259
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.410
You don't have a conscience.

260
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.420
And so you engage in illegal behavior,

261
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:14.860
uh,

262
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.720
and that's not going to be looked upon very sympathetically.

263
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:18.771
On the other hand,

264
00:08:18.771 --> 00:08:22.460
if the person is suffering from a major mental illness like schizophrenia,

265
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.730
then we may look at that person very differently and realize no one chooses to

266
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:28.821
be mentally ill.

267
00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:32.090
No one chooses a to have schizophrenia.

268
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:32.781
Uh,

269
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:37.640
and so there may be a different result in the way we look at a person like that.

270
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:38.753
Um,

271
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:43.100
and finally the different language that's used by the mental health profession.

272
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.881
Uh,

273
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:45.740
and by the legal profession,

274
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.370
uh,

275
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.630
doctors talk and psychologists talk and social workers,

276
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:51.560
uh,

277
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.680
with one set of terms about people's behavior,

278
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:55.260
uh,

279
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.820
try to assess their behavior,

280
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.110
the reasons for it,

281
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:58.561
uh,

282
00:08:58.561 --> 00:08:59.640
what to do about it.

283
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.950
And the legal system we're dealing with,

284
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:04.530
concepts that I'm going to talk about in just a moment.

285
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:05.041
Uh,

286
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:07.320
is a person competent for trial.

287
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:08.020
Uh,

288
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.810
that's not a medical diagnosis.

289
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:11.790
That's a legal determination.

290
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:13.470
Is a person competent for trial.

291
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:14.041
Uh,

292
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:14.874
and so,

293
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.380
uh,

294
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.260
the medical,

295
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:16.830
uh,

296
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.310
people maybe talking past the legal people sometimes,

297
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:22.200
and we may see some examples of that.

298
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:22.710
Uh,

299
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.311
as we,

300
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:24.780
as we look at these cases,

301
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:25.470
uh,

302
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.690
but it's not always going to be,

303
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:32.970
a lot of doctors do testify frequently in the courts and are familiar with the

304
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:33.960
legal standards,

305
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:34.740
uh,

306
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.880
but at the same time,

307
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:36.390
uh,

308
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:36.881
as I say,

309
00:09:36.881 --> 00:09:39.270
they may not be speaking exactly the same language.

310
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.140
And so what the courts are going to look at is what does that person actually

311
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:48.141
say about the person and how their thought process works and whether they have a

312
00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:50.970
thought disorder and if so,

313
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:52.630
how it affects their behavior.

314
00:09:52.631 --> 00:09:54.180
A person can have a thought disorder,

315
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.510
which doesn't necessarily cause them to commit a murder.

316
00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.231
Uh,

317
00:09:58.231 --> 00:09:59.070
on the other hand,

318
00:09:59.071 --> 00:10:00.990
a person may have a thought disorder,

319
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.030
say paranoid schizophrenia is,

320
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:05.520
we'll talk about with one of our cases today,

321
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:06.270
uh,

322
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:11.270
in which the person's actions are the result of the paranoid fears that they

323
00:10:12.181 --> 00:10:13.014
have.

324
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.760
I want to take just a quick look,

325
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.481
uh,

326
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:19.980
at the issues that come up a pretrial and after trial,

327
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:20.491
uh,

328
00:10:20.491 --> 00:10:23.220
with regard to mental illness,

329
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:23.940
uh,

330
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.440
involuntary commitment,

331
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:26.010
uh,

332
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.150
to a mental hospital.

333
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.260
I just touch on for a second because many people who come before the courts

334
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.050
charged with capital offenses,

335
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:34.770
uh,

336
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.550
may have been at some point in their life committed to a mental hospital.

337
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.990
That means a court has found that they are a danger to themselves or others.

338
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.130
And as a result,

339
00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:45.630
their freedom has been taken away.

340
00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:47.040
Their liberty has been taken away,

341
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.140
but they've been confined not in a prison,

342
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.490
but in a hospital.

343
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:51.360
Uh,

344
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.360
sanity at the time of the act defined different ways by different states.

345
00:10:57.271 --> 00:11:01.080
But basically did the person know the difference between right and wrong?

346
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:01.740
Uh,

347
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.390
could the person appreciate,

348
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.140
uh,

349
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.040
the criminality,

350
00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:10.041
the wrongfulness of what they did or did they have the ability to conform their

351
00:11:11.521 --> 00:11:13.650
behavior to the law?

352
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.521
Uh,

353
00:11:14.521 --> 00:11:16.920
and in some jurisdictions will ask,

354
00:11:16.921 --> 00:11:19.650
did they act out of an irresistible impulse?

355
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.950
All of these questions and determining is this person responsible for the crime

356
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:31.490
or is this person is suffering from a mental illness which caused them to commit

357
00:11:32.341 --> 00:11:33.174
the crime?

358
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.103
Uh,

359
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.410
not many successful insanity defenses.

360
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.270
It requires a lot of experts.

361
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.140
Uh,

362
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.560
juries tend to be prejudiced against the insanity defense.

363
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.440
Often think the person is going to be released into the community,

364
00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:47.460
if not immediately,

365
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.110
sometime fairly soon.

366
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:49.741
Uh,

367
00:11:49.741 --> 00:11:50.574
and so,

368
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:51.210
uh,

369
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.230
insanity defense,

370
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.460
not a successful,

371
00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:55.990
but some cases are so clear,

372
00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:56.690
uh,

373
00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:01.690
that the government may even stipulate that the person was acting by reason of

374
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:02.801
insanity.

375
00:12:02.801 --> 00:12:04.870
That is as a result of a thought disorder.

376
00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:05.320
Uh,

377
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.040
when they,

378
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.850
when they acted a lot of states adopted statutes,

379
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:10.330
uh,

380
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:15.330
guilty but mentally ill after John Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of

381
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:20.980
insanity for shooting President Reagan to impress the actress Jodie foster.

382
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:21.551
Uh,

383
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:25.210
the feeling of a lot of people was that now a lot of people are going to be

384
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:27.430
found not guilty by reason of insanity.

385
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:27.910
Uh,

386
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.990
the John Hinckley's family had a lot of money and they were able to hire the

387
00:12:31.991 --> 00:12:33.400
absolute top notch,

388
00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:33.820
uh,

389
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.310
mental health experts to testify in his case,

390
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.210
in the case of a poor person in any kind of case,

391
00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:41.560
but facing the death police,

392
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.160
uh,

393
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.810
the ability to hire,

394
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.530
uh,

395
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:49.530
experts as many and of the caliber as Hinkley's is very,

396
00:12:50.111 --> 00:12:51.250
very unlikely.

397
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.010
But a lot of legislatures pass laws that said,

398
00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:56.860
if a person has found a person can be found guilty,

399
00:12:56.861 --> 00:12:57.940
but mentally ill,

400
00:12:58.330 --> 00:12:58.511
uh,

401
00:12:58.511 --> 00:12:59.560
what does that mean?

402
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:00.340
Uh,

403
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.330
basically the hope is that instead of finding the person not guilty by reason of

404
00:13:04.331 --> 00:13:05.164
insanity,

405
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.190
there'll be found guilty,

406
00:13:06.191 --> 00:13:07.180
but mentally ill.

407
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:08.020
Uh,

408
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.030
but the result is the same.

409
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:10.720
Uh,

410
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.210
the person can still be subject to the death penalty.

411
00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.440
That's not the case.

412
00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:16.480
If they're not guilty by reason of insanity,

413
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:17.171
uh,

414
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:19.120
the person can still be sent to prison.

415
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:19.961
Uh,

416
00:13:19.961 --> 00:13:21.310
and in theory,

417
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:21.770
uh,

418
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:25.090
they may get some mental health treatment if they're in prison,

419
00:13:25.091 --> 00:13:25.590
but,

420
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.840
uh,

421
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.800
that may be in theory,

422
00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:29.560
it may be actual what actually happens.

423
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:30.610
Uh,

424
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.100
the other one is a,

425
00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.710
is the person competent to waive their rights when a person has told,

426
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.813
uh,

427
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.301
you know,

428
00:13:37.301 --> 00:13:38.560
you have a right to remain silent,

429
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:39.880
you have a right to a lawyer,

430
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.470
all of the Miranda rights,

431
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.100
and the person decides to waive those rights and give a confession to the

432
00:13:45.101 --> 00:13:45.820
police.

433
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.150
Uh,

434
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.990
did that person do so with a knowing,

435
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.660
understanding of their rights?

436
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.480
Or when the person said wave,

437
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.820
did they think of somebody waving goodbye?

438
00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:58.750
Uh,

439
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.720
did they really understand what the rights were?

440
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.501
Uh,

441
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:06.790
if a person is operating under a delusional system,

442
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:07.330
uh,

443
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.730
they may have a completely different understanding of,

444
00:14:10.731 --> 00:14:11.870
of what the rights are.

445
00:14:11.871 --> 00:14:16.240
And the same thing for rights to allow the police to search a house or other

446
00:14:16.241 --> 00:14:20.590
things rights that individuals give up sometimes during an investigation,

447
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:21.281
uh,

448
00:14:21.281 --> 00:14:22.480
of a criminal case.

449
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:23.500
Uh,

450
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.990
most important competency for trial,

451
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:26.591
uh,

452
00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:29.380
this is the issue that's critical in many cases.

453
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:34.381
Whether the defendant has the ability to comprehend the proceedings,

454
00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:35.830
to know what's going on,

455
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.210
know that there's a judge,

456
00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:42.160
a prosecutor or a jury that the defense lawyers there to help that person and

457
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.440
have the ability to cooperate with council.

458
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.410
And that's the issue that we will take up first here.

459
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:47.621
Well,

460
00:14:47.621 --> 00:14:49.030
the penalty phase issues,

461
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:49.930
uh,

462
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.040
that come into play,

463
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:51.920
uh,

464
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.510
an aggravation of mitigation,

465
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.630
the person's mental health may be important.

466
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.780
It may be important if they're a future danger to society.

467
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:01.670
The question I raised earlier,

468
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.240
uh,

469
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.650
is this a person so dangerous that we are going to execute them?

470
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:11.240
Or is this a person so impaired that we don't hold them to the same degree of

471
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:12.770
culpability of other people?

472
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:13.731
Uh,

473
00:15:13.731 --> 00:15:15.230
and that's the second part,

474
00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:17.240
the mitigating aspect of it.

475
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:17.990
Uh,

476
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.630
that we don't hold people who are,

477
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.500
uh,

478
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:26.450
mentally ill too or that that may be a mitigating factor that will result in a

479
00:15:26.451 --> 00:15:31.100
sentence less than death at the penalty phase of a capital trial after trial is

480
00:15:31.101 --> 00:15:31.311
over.

481
00:15:31.311 --> 00:15:32.330
They're still mental issues,

482
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:32.800
uh,

483
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.550
which are going to come up from time to time.

484
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.713
Uh,

485
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:36.560
person,

486
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:36.940
uh,

487
00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.450
we've talked in these sessions about the post conviction review process that

488
00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:44.180
after a person's been convicted and it's been upheld,

489
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:49.390
they go through a process of review or they can challenge their conviction.

490
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:50.563
Uh,

491
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.150
they file federal Habeas Corpus actions,

492
00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:56.750
which go to a federal district court and the court of appeals and couldn't be,

493
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:57.883
uh,

494
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.500
it can seek review in the United States.

495
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:01.334
Supreme Court.

496
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.390
Supreme Court said,

497
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:02.901
uh,

498
00:16:02.901 --> 00:16:05.490
in 2013 in case called Ryan versus Gonzales,

499
00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.310
the person does not need to be competent.

500
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:12.170
So unlike trial where a person has to understand what's going on in the

501
00:16:12.171 --> 00:16:14.480
proceedings and has to be able to cooperate with counsel.

502
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.140
Uh,

503
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.510
the court in Ryan says,

504
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:17.960
uh,

505
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.980
that because,

506
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.530
uh,

507
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:24.530
this is a backward looking process in which it's mostly record based person does

508
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:26.450
not have to be competent.

509
00:16:26.451 --> 00:16:27.380
You can go ahead,

510
00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:28.010
uh,

511
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.460
but they're decisions that may be made along the way,

512
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.030
which we'll get to competency to waive post conviction review.

513
00:16:35.031 --> 00:16:38.270
The person decides I don't want to appeal any further.

514
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.900
I want to give up my appeals and be executed and get it over with.

515
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:43.341
Generally,

516
00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:44.630
when those issues come up,

517
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.900
there's an issue of mental health involved.

518
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.840
And so very often the question it's going to be,

519
00:16:50.841 --> 00:16:52.280
is that person competent?

520
00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:57.140
Does that person have the capacity to make the decision to give up further

521
00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:02.290
litigation or is that person a acting because of their mental illness?

522
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.943
Uh,

523
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
and then competency to be executed a is the person aware of the punishment,

524
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.081
uh,

525
00:17:12.081 --> 00:17:14.870
and understands that they're being put to death,

526
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:15.370
uh,

527
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:17.570
bill cause of the crime they committed.

528
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:18.620
Uh,

529
00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.590
and we'll elaborate on that a in another session.

530
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:22.760
Um,

531
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.593
the remedies,

532
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.290
uh,

533
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.780
for these various findings,

534
00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:31.190
a about a person if a person is found to be not guilty by reason of insanity,

535
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.520
uh,

536
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.370
they're committed to a mental hospital for treatment.

537
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.250
A person who's found incompetent for trial,

538
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.791
uh,

539
00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:42.791
is sent to a state mental institution and treated and may become competent for

540
00:17:43.431 --> 00:17:44.210
trial.

541
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:44.721
Uh,

542
00:17:44.721 --> 00:17:47.360
and one of the cases,

543
00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:47.880
uh,

544
00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:52.880
in the readings involves a person who was found incompetent and then 18 years

545
00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:54.870
later was found competent.

546
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.260
So a person can be restored to competency.

547
00:17:58.570 --> 00:17:58.890
Uh,

548
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.730
but there are some people who are,

549
00:18:00.731 --> 00:18:03.120
the courts find will never regain competence.

550
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.253
Uh,

551
00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:09.420
a person who is incompetent to waive their post-conviction proceedings,

552
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.120
those proceedings are going to go ahead,

553
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.470
but someone is going to step in for that person and next friend and maybe their

554
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:17.011
parents,

555
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:18.030
maybe their spouse,

556
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.140
maybe their child,

557
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.920
someone very close to that person may be able to carry on the litigation.

558
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:23.821
Uh,

559
00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:26.490
and then finally in competence to be executed,

560
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:30.390
a person who does not understand why it is they're being put to death and that

561
00:18:30.391 --> 00:18:31.740
it's punishment for the crime.

562
00:18:31.741 --> 00:18:32.574
They committed,

563
00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:32.970
uh,

564
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.620
that person to be committed.

565
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:35.141
Uh,

566
00:18:35.141 --> 00:18:36.960
usually to a mental institution,

567
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:37.771
uh,

568
00:18:37.771 --> 00:18:40.260
and there'll be treated and if they're restored to competence,

569
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.890
if they can understand why it is that they're being put to death,

570
00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:44.520
uh,

571
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.140
then they can be put to death.

572
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.711
Uh,

573
00:18:46.711 --> 00:18:48.030
one question that comes up there,

574
00:18:48.031 --> 00:18:53.031
can a person be forcibly medicaid to make them competent to be executed?

575
00:18:54.001 --> 00:18:57.030
Some courts have said yes and some courts have said no.

576
00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:01.320
But that's sort of an overview of the different legal issues that come up

577
00:19:01.321 --> 00:19:02.730
involving mental health.

578
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:03.300
Uh,

579
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.660
some cases may involve a number of these issues may be a question of whether the

580
00:19:06.661 --> 00:19:08.520
person was sane at the time of the crime,

581
00:19:08.521 --> 00:19:09.840
competent for trial,

582
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:13.500
a future danger to society and competent to be executed.

583
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:14.071
Uh,

584
00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:17.580
it may be that it only will be one competency for trial,

585
00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:18.414
for example,

586
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:22.500
or it may be that after deteriorating on death row after being there for a

587
00:19:22.501 --> 00:19:23.820
substantial period of time,

588
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:24.330
uh,

589
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.840
there may be a question of whether the person is competent to be executed.

590
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.300
Let's say a quick look at just a,

591
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.590
what we're talking about here.

592
00:19:31.591 --> 00:19:33.030
Competency for trial,

593
00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:38.460
a rational as well as a factual understanding of the proceedings and sufficient

594
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.440
present ability to talk with a lawyer to consult with a lawyer with a reasonable

595
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.190
degree of rational understanding.

596
00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.870
This was in a case called Dusky versus United States.

597
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.390
It was a very short opinion by the Supreme Court.

598
00:19:54.391 --> 00:19:55.530
There's two or three paragraphs.

599
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.120
It was a case that came up,

600
00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:57.600
uh,

601
00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.000
on the question of whether Dusky,

602
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:00.661
uh,

603
00:20:00.661 --> 00:20:02.520
was competent for trial or not.

604
00:20:02.521 --> 00:20:06.720
And the court in a procurian that is just by the court decision,

605
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.440
uh,

606
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.190
said,

607
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.431
uh,

608
00:20:08.431 --> 00:20:09.960
the lower court was determined,

609
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:10.351
uh,

610
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:13.830
whether Dusky was competent for trial using this standard.

611
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.083
Um,

612
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.660
the court has also held at the trial of an incompetent person,

613
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.840
a violates due process that if there is a bonafide doubt about the competency of

614
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.290
a person on trial,

615
00:20:25.291 --> 00:20:25.831
the judge,

616
00:20:25.831 --> 00:20:30.120
if the judge sees some indication that this person may have some mental health

617
00:20:30.121 --> 00:20:30.930
issues,

618
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:31.350
uh,

619
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.440
then the judge is to suicide.

620
00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:35.520
Ponti raise the competency issue.

621
00:20:35.521 --> 00:20:36.570
More often than not,

622
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.960
the competency issue is going to be raised either by the crime in any bizarre

623
00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:42.910
aspects,

624
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.910
the crime behavior by the defendant after arrest or be raised by one of the

625
00:20:47.921 --> 00:20:48.341
parties,

626
00:20:48.341 --> 00:20:52.480
the defense lawyer or the prosecutor who notices that there may be a question

627
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:57.430
about whether the defendant understands the proceedings and can relate to his

628
00:20:57.431 --> 00:20:58.264
lawyers.

629
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.610
Let's take an example of one of these cases.

630
00:21:00.611 --> 00:21:01.810
Richard Allen Morin.

631
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.501
Uh,

632
00:21:02.501 --> 00:21:03.260
it was,

633
00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:03.520
uh,

634
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.780
facing the death penalty,

635
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:05.561
uh,

636
00:21:05.561 --> 00:21:08.380
and he decided he was found competent for trial.

637
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:09.310
Uh,

638
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.380
he decided he didn't want a lawyer.

639
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:12.640
He wanted to fire,

640
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.540
uh,

641
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.550
his public defender,

642
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:16.120
uh,

643
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.410
and represent himself.

644
00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:20.980
And the court found that he was competent to for trial,

645
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.630
uh,

646
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.520
allowed him to fire the lawyer.

647
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.150
Uh,

648
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:30.040
he then entered guilty pleas and pled the three charges of capital murder right

649
00:21:30.041 --> 00:21:31.690
then and were sentenced to death.

650
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.040
This was to avoid a,

651
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:40.080
any investigation of his case or any presentation of mitigating evidence.

652
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:40.931
Uh,

653
00:21:40.931 --> 00:21:45.931
there was some concern about whether mental factors may have been a part of this

654
00:21:47.171 --> 00:21:47.681
decision.

655
00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:50.110
He had tried to commit suicide just three months earlier.

656
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.251
Uh,

657
00:21:51.251 --> 00:21:54.370
and the question that the Supreme Court looked at,

658
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:54.941
uh,

659
00:21:54.941 --> 00:21:59.110
in his case got an as versus Moran a was the question of,

660
00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.213
uh,

661
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
was the standard once he was competent to stand trial,

662
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:10.690
was he also competent to then take over the case and represent himself?

663
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:11.321
Uh,

664
00:22:11.321 --> 00:22:12.250
the court said,

665
00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:12.791
uh,

666
00:22:12.791 --> 00:22:16.930
Justice Thomas writing for the court said that he was a person who is competent

667
00:22:16.931 --> 00:22:17.764
for trial,

668
00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:18.070
uh,

669
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.600
can waive a lawyer,

670
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:20.080
uh,

671
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.580
and plead guilty person has a right to represent themselves under the case of

672
00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:26.110
for versus California,

673
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.960
which had been decided many years before.

674
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.740
Uh,

675
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.560
and then once the person represents themselves,

676
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.410
they can waive all their other constitutional rights as long as they're advised

677
00:22:37.411 --> 00:22:38.110
of their rights.

678
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:39.100
They have a right to a trial,

679
00:22:39.101 --> 00:22:39.851
right to a lawyer,

680
00:22:39.851 --> 00:22:40.690
right to conference,

681
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.080
uh,

682
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.180
confront witnesses to appeal.

683
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.980
And if the person makes the knowing intelligent voluntary decision to waive

684
00:22:47.981 --> 00:22:48.814
those rights,

685
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.073
uh,

686
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:51.230
he,

687
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:52.063
in this case,

688
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:56.740
Richard Donner Moran is free to enter a guilty plea right then and the judge

689
00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.380
sentenced him to death.

690
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:00.221
Uh,

691
00:23:00.221 --> 00:23:01.690
justice Blackmun dissented,

692
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:02.560
uh,

693
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.150
had some difficulty,

694
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:04.960
uh,

695
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.800
with this,

696
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.940
uh,

697
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:07.840
he said,

698
00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:08.531
first of all,

699
00:23:08.531 --> 00:23:10.150
when the judge took the guilty plea,

700
00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:10.900
uh,

701
00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.810
he asked Moran if he was taking any drugs and he said,

702
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:13.931
oh,

703
00:23:13.931 --> 00:23:15.370
just what they give me it to jail.

704
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.130
And the judge went right on is it's just as probably when he said,

705
00:23:18.131 --> 00:23:18.230
well,

706
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:22.360
he sort of stopped there and seeing what were the drugs and what were the side

707
00:23:22.361 --> 00:23:23.410
effects of the drugs,

708
00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.770
which the justice Blackmun sets out in his opinion,

709
00:23:26.771 --> 00:23:31.120
and expresses a concern that these drugs may have affected the way.

710
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.960
Uh,

711
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.100
Moran was thinking,

712
00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:33.560
uh,

713
00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.960
at the time he did this.

714
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:35.680
Uh,

715
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.330
but he also said our definition of competency is the ability to consult with

716
00:23:40.331 --> 00:23:41.164
counsel.

717
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.130
So that sort of assumes there'll be counsel to consult with a,

718
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.670
it doesn't mean that person's going to be,

719
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.510
uh,

720
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.520
running the case all by themselves.

721
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.331
Uh,

722
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:53.540
and then he also points out competency to play basketball,

723
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:54.441
uh,

724
00:23:54.441 --> 00:23:56.450
is not competency to play the violin.

725
00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:00.500
A that a person may be competent to be tried.

726
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.150
They may understand the proceedings,

727
00:24:02.151 --> 00:24:04.070
they may be able to relate to their lawyer.

728
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:05.030
Uh,

729
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:09.110
but whether or not that means they can take over the case,

730
00:24:09.111 --> 00:24:12.590
fire their lawyer and decide what to do,

731
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:13.490
plead guilty,

732
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:14.750
go to trial,

733
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:15.890
whatever else.

734
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.053
Uh,

735
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.000
just the fact that they're confident for Tro,

736
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.120
competent for trial doesn't mean they're competent to do those functions.

737
00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.170
Well.

738
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.760
A short time later,

739
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:29.180
a Amod Edwards a comes before the court,

740
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:29.750
uh,

741
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.490
he's found competent for trial.

742
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.600
Uh,

743
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.670
but he wanted not to plead guilty,

744
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.000
but to represent himself at his trial for attempted murder.

745
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.991
Uh,

746
00:24:38.991 --> 00:24:40.730
the judge in Indiana wouldn't allow it.

747
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.650
He assigned him a lawyer,

748
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.280
uh,

749
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.870
much to Edwards dismay.

750
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:45.380
Uh,

751
00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:50.380
the lawyer would not raise the defense that Edwards wanted to raise in the case.

752
00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:51.531
Uh,

753
00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:56.000
and so Edwards appeals the case all the way to the United States Supreme Court

754
00:24:56.001 --> 00:25:01.001
where it decides this question whether the constitution permits a state to

755
00:25:01.731 --> 00:25:02.181
limit.

756
00:25:02.181 --> 00:25:03.740
And actually it's more than limit.

757
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:08.740
It's really override a defendant's decision to represent himself,

758
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.943
uh,

759
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:15.130
on the grounds that the defendant lacks the mental ability to conduct a trial to

760
00:25:16.011 --> 00:25:16.970
be his own lawyer.

761
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.360
A supreme court decides a with Justice Briar writing for the court that yes.

762
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:27.590
What Indiana did was permissible and it affirms the conviction in Edward's case,

763
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.341
uh,

764
00:25:28.341 --> 00:25:29.720
the court points out that,

765
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:30.170
uh,

766
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:33.080
conducting a trial is very different from pleading guilty,

767
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:37.700
although pleading guilty is certainly a momentous decision which gives up every

768
00:25:37.701 --> 00:25:39.350
right a person has it trial.

769
00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.131
Nonetheless,

770
00:25:40.131 --> 00:25:44.570
the court drew a distinction there and said Moran was just pleading guilty and

771
00:25:44.571 --> 00:25:45.770
that was all there was to it.

772
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.600
This involves conducting a trial,

773
00:25:47.601 --> 00:25:48.680
examining witnesses,

774
00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:49.520
opening statement,

775
00:25:49.521 --> 00:25:50.420
closing argument.

776
00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:51.683
Uh,

777
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:55.130
the court also talked about the nature of mental illness,

778
00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:55.940
uh,

779
00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.940
and it's concern about the spectacle of some mentally ill person like Edwards

780
00:26:01.131 --> 00:26:02.840
conducting his own trial,

781
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:03.630
uh,

782
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:07.790
and says this may be more humiliating than ennobling.

783
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:08.870
Uh,

784
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:13.190
the question comes up here of the dignity of a person.

785
00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.660
Does the person,

786
00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:20.050
is the dignity of a person offended when they make a fool of themselves trying a

787
00:26:20.391 --> 00:26:23.750
case when they don't have any idea what they're doing and they're mentally ill

788
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:27.740
or is the dignity that they have a right to make their own decision about how

789
00:26:27.741 --> 00:26:29.840
their case is going to be handled?

790
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:31.490
Well,

791
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.590
justice briar also said for the majority,

792
00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:34.070
uh,

793
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.350
we want trials to appear fair.

794
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.950
So we want when people see what's going on,

795
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:44.580
we don't want the spectacle as we've seen in some cases of mentally ill people

796
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:46.230
representing themselves at trial.

797
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.010
Uh,

798
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:48.630
we want it to appear fair.

799
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:49.800
Uh,

800
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.170
Justice Scalia dissents,

801
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:52.890
uh,

802
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.170
joined by Justice Thomas,

803
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:55.680
uh,

804
00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.540
he says the dignity it stake here is the dignity of being master of your fate.

805
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.400
That if you're competent for trial,

806
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.740
then you can make the decision,

807
00:27:04.741 --> 00:27:05.490
plead guilty,

808
00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:06.420
go to trial.

809
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.220
And if you want to represent yourself,

810
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:09.300
uh,

811
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.890
you'll have a right to defendant,

812
00:27:10.891 --> 00:27:15.891
has a right to do that and that it's unfair to impose a lawyer on a defendant

813
00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:17.250
who doesn't want one.

814
00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.200
A particular,

815
00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:24.270
particularly a lawyer who won't raise the defense that the defendant wants

816
00:27:24.271 --> 00:27:25.104
raised.

817
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:25.471
Uh,

818
00:27:25.471 --> 00:27:26.550
he says this is,

819
00:27:26.551 --> 00:27:27.300
um,

820
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.410
basically to imprison a man in his privileges and call it a constitution.

821
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:32.430
Uh,

822
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.810
but this was a pretty lopsided decision,

823
00:27:34.811 --> 00:27:38.700
seven to two with only justices Scalia and Thomas descending.

824
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:43.940
And the result of this case is that more often when people with mental illness

825
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.490
found competent for trial,

826
00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.590
one represent themselves at trial,

827
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.440
judges going to be much easier for judges to say,

828
00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.130
uh,

829
00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.600
we're gonna make,

830
00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.130
make you have a lawyer,

831
00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:56.760
uh,

832
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:57.780
at your trial.

833
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:59.940
And these things don't come up that often,

834
00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:01.860
but they do come up from time to time.

835
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:02.610
Uh,

836
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.120
and,

837
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.360
uh,

838
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.650
judges generally don't particularly like pro se defendants.

839
00:28:07.651 --> 00:28:09.480
That is people who represent themselves.

840
00:28:09.481 --> 00:28:10.740
They don't follow the procedures,

841
00:28:10.741 --> 00:28:11.810
they don't know what's going on,

842
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.120
they testify and opening statement and things like that.

843
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:15.650
Uh,

844
00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:16.440
so,

845
00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:16.920
uh,

846
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.540
this gives judges,

847
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.021
uh,

848
00:28:19.021 --> 00:28:20.160
an ability to do that.

849
00:28:20.161 --> 00:28:25.161
The question one might ask is if Edwards is not competent to conduct a trial

850
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.520
here,

851
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:26.971
uh,

852
00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:28.980
is he really competent at all?

853
00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:29.450
Uh,

854
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.230
why are we trying Edwards,

855
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:31.861
uh,

856
00:28:31.861 --> 00:28:36.000
when he could be a committed to a mental institution and perhaps,

857
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:37.110
uh,

858
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:41.400
treated and become capable of working with a lawyer and,

859
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.360
and presenting the defense that he wanted to present or understanding why he

860
00:28:45.361 --> 00:28:48.480
should not present the defense that he wanted to present.

861
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.720
But that's not what the court did in this particular case.

862
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.350
Just want to spend a minute on forced administration of drugs.

863
00:28:55.351 --> 00:28:57.150
A defendant is not competent,

864
00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:01.590
but if you give the defendant a psychotropic drugs,

865
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:02.693
uh,

866
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.070
he or she may become competent.

867
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:05.610
Uh,

868
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.140
this came up in the Riggins case.

869
00:29:07.141 --> 00:29:08.310
Riggins vs Nevada.

870
00:29:08.311 --> 00:29:13.311
He was taking 800 milligrams of a mellow real a day.

871
00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.410
A one doctor said that's enough to tranquilize an elephant.

872
00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:17.101
Uh,

873
00:29:17.101 --> 00:29:21.480
and the result of it being that the defendant Reagan's is sitting at council

874
00:29:21.481 --> 00:29:22.260
table,

875
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.093
uh,

876
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.790
looking like a Zombie because he's taken so much drugs.

877
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:27.511
Uh,

878
00:29:27.511 --> 00:29:29.100
and the jury looks at them and thanks guys.

879
00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:30.720
They got it looks like a cold blooded killer.

880
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.750
He doesn't look like he cares about anything that's going on,

881
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:35.790
but that's not really Riggins.

882
00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.300
That's the medicine that's causing him to look that way.

883
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.510
Justice O'connor writes for the court and she says that forced medication

884
00:29:43.511 --> 00:29:44.344
involves,

885
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:44.951
uh,

886
00:29:44.951 --> 00:29:49.450
an interference with the liberty interest that people have a protected by the

887
00:29:49.451 --> 00:29:53.700
due process clause of the 14th amendment a and a defendant.

888
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:56.320
She looks at the case of Washington versus Harper,

889
00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:00.340
which had to do with forced medication of people in prisons,

890
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:01.230
uh,

891
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.780
and even a person in prison has some liberty interest in their bodily integrity,

892
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:05.471
uh,

893
00:30:05.471 --> 00:30:08.560
that unless the person is a danger to himself or others,

894
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:09.730
uh,

895
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:12.790
and there is a determination of medical appropriateness,

896
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.420
uh,

897
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.830
then a person should not be forcibly medicated.

898
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.290
Uh,

899
00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:22.290
this is summarized a w justice Kennedy a concurring,

900
00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:23.260
uh,

901
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.930
makes another couple of points with regard to this,

902
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:26.560
uh,

903
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.080
first that there's serious due process concerns,

904
00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:29.831
uh,

905
00:30:29.831 --> 00:30:33.220
when the state can manipulate how the defendant looks or how the defendant

906
00:30:33.221 --> 00:30:33.761
behaves,

907
00:30:33.761 --> 00:30:38.200
that trial by the drugs the state gives them and of course the defendants in the

908
00:30:38.201 --> 00:30:39.130
custody of the state.

909
00:30:39.131 --> 00:30:42.940
And it's a state that decides what medication he or she's going to have.

910
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:46.000
A and because of the side effects,

911
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:46.570
uh,

912
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.120
which are quite substantial for many of these drugs,

913
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:49.871
uh,

914
00:30:49.871 --> 00:30:51.880
involuntary administration of drugs,

915
00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:52.450
uh,

916
00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:57.450
is acceptable only by showing that the side effects won't have an impact on the

917
00:30:57.971 --> 00:30:58.700
defendant.

918
00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.710
His reaction to things in court or his ability to work with,

919
00:31:02.711 --> 00:31:03.544
with council.

920
00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:04.960
This is summarized,

921
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:05.621
uh,

922
00:31:05.621 --> 00:31:09.430
in the case of cell versus United States came down in 2003,

923
00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:12.040
a where the court said we can medicate of court,

924
00:31:12.041 --> 00:31:13.480
can medicate only,

925
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:14.560
uh,

926
00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.360
if it is medically appropriate,

927
00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:21.610
the person is substantially unlikely to have side effects that will affect the

928
00:31:21.611 --> 00:31:22.780
fairness of the trial.

929
00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:23.651
Uh,

930
00:31:23.651 --> 00:31:28.651
and the court takes into account all the less intrusive measures that might be,

931
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.440
uh,

932
00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.380
considered before forcible medication.

933
00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:33.310
Uh,

934
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:35.710
court also appoints had just as a practical point,

935
00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.010
if this person's going to be held in a mental institution for a long time,

936
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.581
uh,

937
00:31:39.581 --> 00:31:43.000
the community is going to be protected and it may not be that urgent,

938
00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:43.600
uh,

939
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.640
to forcibly medicate them for trial.

940
00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:47.043
Um,

941
00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:48.790
let's talk about sanity and mitigation.

942
00:31:48.791 --> 00:31:49.624
Finally,

943
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:50.320
uh,

944
00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.170
both of these we find in the case of James Eugene Biggby,

945
00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:54.800
uh,

946
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.690
in Texas,

947
00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:56.320
uh,

948
00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.460
like all of these cases,

949
00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:59.200
a sad and tragic case.

950
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.160
Uh,

951
00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.080
Mr Biggby,

952
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:01.900
uh,

953
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:06.900
suffers from schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder depending on which doctor

954
00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:08.920
has diagnosis.

955
00:32:08.921 --> 00:32:11.590
You take a severe depression.

956
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:12.220
Uh,

957
00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.250
he was hospitalized three times in mental institutions.

958
00:32:15.251 --> 00:32:18.310
He was given electroshock treatments three times.

959
00:32:18.311 --> 00:32:19.600
He was given medication.

960
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:20.290
Uh,

961
00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:21.430
but it didn't work.

962
00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:22.623
Uh,

963
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:24.490
he has a delusion,

964
00:32:24.491 --> 00:32:26.710
which nobody disagrees with.

965
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:29.570
Mr Biggby believes a,

966
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:32.860
that people at Frito lay are trying to kill him.

967
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:33.851
Uh,

968
00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:37.810
he thinks they're sending this green gas through the air conditioners.

969
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:38.320
Uh,

970
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:42.770
they also think they're electronically monitoring his movements.

971
00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:43.491
Uh,

972
00:32:43.491 --> 00:32:45.710
and he's convinced that his friend,

973
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.460
uh,

974
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.240
Mike,

975
00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:47.870
uh,

976
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:52.870
treacle is involved somehow in all of this struggle is his friend is fixing

977
00:32:53.181 --> 00:32:53.980
dinner,

978
00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:54.260
uh,

979
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.280
for Mr Biggby.

980
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:56.420
Uh,

981
00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:01.420
Mr Biggby kills him and also his 16 month old son wraps the sun and cellophane.

982
00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:08.180
So Mr Big B goes to trial and presents an insanity defense.

983
00:33:08.181 --> 00:33:11.600
Three doctors testified that he can't distinguish right from wrong.

984
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:17.110
It gives you a sense of how difficult these decisions are because here you see,

985
00:33:17.811 --> 00:33:19.250
some doctors said,

986
00:33:19.251 --> 00:33:19.431
well,

987
00:33:19.431 --> 00:33:22.790
he knew his conduct was illegal or he knew that it was,

988
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.100
or he didn't know that it was morally wrong.

989
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:25.611
Uh,

990
00:33:25.611 --> 00:33:27.650
so there are all kinds of slicing,

991
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:28.430
uh,

992
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:32.240
what it means that he did not know the difference between right and wrong.

993
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.990
Uh,

994
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:37.010
two other doctors say that he can distinguish right from wrong,

995
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:37.461
uh,

996
00:33:37.461 --> 00:33:41.090
and his father testifies that he can distinguish right from wrong.

997
00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:41.781
Uh,

998
00:33:41.781 --> 00:33:44.660
so the jury rejects the insanity defense.

999
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.621
Uh,

1000
00:33:45.621 --> 00:33:50.300
the Texas Court of criminal appeals takes a look at it and decides that it's not

1001
00:33:50.301 --> 00:33:51.890
going to interfere with the verdict of the jury,

1002
00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:53.870
which is almost always going to be the case,

1003
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.681
uh,

1004
00:33:54.681 --> 00:33:58.190
and affirms both the conviction and the death sentence.

1005
00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:01.820
But then Mr [inaudible] case goes to federal court and in federal court,

1006
00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:06.821
he raises the question that the jury could not consider his very obvious and

1007
00:34:07.161 --> 00:34:12.161
well established mental illness in mitigation because of the three questions

1008
00:34:12.741 --> 00:34:14.690
that Texas asked juries to decide,

1009
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.231
uh,

1010
00:34:15.231 --> 00:34:16.820
in death penalty case was it,

1011
00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:17.810
uh,

1012
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:21.140
was a provocation as the person in the future dangers.

1013
00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.340
And was it deliberate?

1014
00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:23.091
Uh,

1015
00:34:23.091 --> 00:34:26.510
and the judge basically told the jury if you think that mental illness,

1016
00:34:26.890 --> 00:34:27.470
uh,

1017
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:29.780
was such that he shouldn't get the death penalty.

1018
00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.100
Just answer one of those questions.

1019
00:34:31.101 --> 00:34:31.934
No.

1020
00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:32.450
Uh,

1021
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:36.080
the Supreme Court had already decided in the case of a Penry,

1022
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.570
John Paul Penry,

1023
00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:37.940
uh,

1024
00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:38.810
that you can't do that,

1025
00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.200
uh,

1026
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:39.411
that,

1027
00:34:39.411 --> 00:34:41.080
that asked the jury to do things.

1028
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.440
Two things that are contradictory.

1029
00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.141
Uh,

1030
00:34:43.141 --> 00:34:44.360
you've got to answer the questions.

1031
00:34:44.361 --> 00:34:45.051
Honestly.

1032
00:34:45.051 --> 00:34:45.471
Yes.

1033
00:34:45.471 --> 00:34:46.450
If the answer's yes,

1034
00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:46.810
uh,

1035
00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:48.380
you can't just tell them to answer it.

1036
00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:48.990
No.

1037
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:49.250
Uh,

1038
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.390
because of one factor.

1039
00:34:50.391 --> 00:34:54.230
So the court vacates the death sentence in the case opposed the conviction,

1040
00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:55.400
but since it back,

1041
00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:56.030
uh,

1042
00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:00.590
to give Mr Begbie a new sentencing trial where his mental illness will be

1043
00:35:00.591 --> 00:35:02.210
considered as a mitigating factor.

1044
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:03.170
Well,

1045
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:06.860
you look at these cases and it shows you the tremendous challenges.

1046
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.551
Uh,

1047
00:35:07.551 --> 00:35:08.331
two lawyers,

1048
00:35:08.331 --> 00:35:08.871
judges,

1049
00:35:08.871 --> 00:35:09.381
jurors,

1050
00:35:09.381 --> 00:35:14.381
the whole legal system in dealing with people who have a mental illness or a

1051
00:35:15.411 --> 00:35:16.400
thought disorder.

1052
00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:17.180
Uh,

1053
00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.040
there's not a lot of agreement,

1054
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:19.820
uh,

1055
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.310
in many cases among mental health professionals,

1056
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:22.960
uh,

1057
00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.230
about the diagnosis,

1058
00:35:24.231 --> 00:35:25.400
about the severity,

1059
00:35:25.401 --> 00:35:28.400
about the extent to which the mental illness affected behavior.

1060
00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.211
Uh,

1061
00:35:29.211 --> 00:35:34.211
and so sorting this out for judges and juries can be immensely difficult.

1062
00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:36.163
Um,

1063
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.200
and we don't always know,

1064
00:35:38.201 --> 00:35:38.741
of course,

1065
00:35:38.741 --> 00:35:41.680
that the decision's made were the right ones.

1066
00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.570
A one wonders also,

1067
00:35:43.571 --> 00:35:47.440
as you look at these cases and hear about people like Mr Biggby,

1068
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.310
uh,

1069
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:51.040
should courts really be making these decisions,

1070
00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:51.681
uh,

1071
00:35:51.681 --> 00:35:53.980
at least in the very close cases,

1072
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.641
uh,

1073
00:35:54.641 --> 00:35:59.641
where there's little or no understanding of the person's mental disability,

1074
00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:01.000
mental disorder,

1075
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:01.841
uh,

1076
00:36:01.841 --> 00:36:04.600
and whether some of these problems and some of these individuals,

1077
00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:05.140
uh,

1078
00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:09.310
might not better be dealt with outside of the legal system.

1079
00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:10.533
Uh,

1080
00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:11.710
for example,

1081
00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:12.130
uh,

1082
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:12.940
through,

1083
00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:13.360
uh,

1084
00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.730
dealing with them in mental hospitals or whatever,

1085
00:36:15.731 --> 00:36:16.380
like,

1086
00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:16.660
uh,

1087
00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.810
Mr. Edwards from Indiana who wants to try his own case.

1088
00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:20.561
Uh,

1089
00:36:20.561 --> 00:36:23.890
other difficult issues are also presented by mental illness.

1090
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.901
Uh,

1091
00:36:24.901 --> 00:36:29.110
the people that have been convicted and after their trials,

1092
00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:31.660
a questions of whether they want to give up their appeals,

1093
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:32.201
uh,

1094
00:36:32.201 --> 00:36:34.330
whether they understand why they're going to be executed.

1095
00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:34.891
Uh,

1096
00:36:34.891 --> 00:36:36.160
and we will take up those,

1097
00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:36.670
uh,

1098
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:37.271
issues.

1099
00:36:37.271 --> 00:36:38.110
And another session.
