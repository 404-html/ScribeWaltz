00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.440
One of the most basic constitutional responsibilities that are prosecutor has is

2
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:20.760
to disclose or to turn over to the defense exculpatory evidence.

3
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:24.630
That is evidence that might suggest that the person accused of the crime is

4
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:26.220
actually innocent of the crime.

5
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.070
The Supreme Court has held that that's a constitutional responsibility of

6
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.980
prosecutors.

7
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.910
That failure to turn over that evidence has often been what's led to the

8
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:37.890
conviction of innocent people.

9
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.500
One of those innocent people as John Thompson,

10
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.310
uh,

11
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.143
who was,

12
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.570
uh,

13
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.880
arrested on January,

14
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.160
1985 in New Orleans when he was just 22 years old,

15
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.290
accused in two separate crimes,

16
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:52.020
one of arm robbery and the other of murder,

17
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.040
uh,

18
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.890
ultimately convicted of those crimes.

19
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.620
He spent 18 years in the custody,

20
00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:59.270
uh,

21
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.920
of the Louisiana prison system,

22
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.750
14 of those years on death row and he came very close to being executed on May

23
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:07.381
the 20th,

24
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:09.210
1999.

25
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.980
I want to ask John Thompson what happened to pick up the story at this point and

26
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:18.981
tell us what happened just as he was there within a month of execution.

27
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.580
Uh,

28
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.450
John Thompson,

29
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.081
welcome.

30
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:23.280
Thank you for joining us.

31
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:27.630
Could you pick up the story and tell us what happened there in the days right

32
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:30.450
before you were to be put to death by the state of Louisiana?

33
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.810
<v 2>Oh,</v>

34
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.643
well,

35
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.121
well,

36
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:35.150
you know how much

37
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.980
he was interested in the DC there,

38
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.490
it'll to the fact that we had nearly exhausted all my remedies,

39
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.930
all a with the cold house.

40
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.770
Um,

41
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.770
it was nothing else for them to do other than trying to find a way to maybe even

42
00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:51.470
filed ineffective sister.

43
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.870
The is on themselves.

44
00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:53.081
These,

45
00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:56.110
this was trying to look at the feeling that I did.

46
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.660
They'd be down the feel me.

47
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.790
So the first thing they told me that when he was trying to do is I was kind of

48
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.460
shocked and I asked him not to do that to himself,

49
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.770
but hire some more investigators.

50
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.210
And that's what they did,

51
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.900
um,

52
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.201
with,

53
00:02:11.201 --> 00:02:12.730
with nothing else left to do.

54
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.140
We had two cases,

55
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.110
our own robbery case when I received it,

56
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:17.370
49 and a half years.

57
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:21.430
But it happened maybe two weeks after the murder happened.

58
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.070
Um,

59
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.700
um,

60
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.060
[inaudible] was looking for a five feet,

61
00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.520
seven description with a big Bush.

62
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.181
Um,

63
00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:29.680
the murder suspect was,

64
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.801
uh,

65
00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:31.520
six feet tall with about,

66
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.410
hey,

67
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.711
um,

68
00:02:32.711 --> 00:02:36.040
so the city's two incidents happen two weeks apart.

69
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.170
My lawyer was really,

70
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.830
you know,

71
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.171
a meal.

72
00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:43.630
It's about the fact that he prosecuted the same individual at both descriptions.

73
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.330
And so I was always trying to prove it's hard.

74
00:02:46.331 --> 00:02:48.040
Like it's one of the,

75
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.460
it's hard to try to convince a group of lawyers that you're innocent of one

76
00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:53.170
charge that's Donald to say,

77
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.010
hold out,

78
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.800
I'm going to send that both of these charges.

79
00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.990
It really didn't have them really take to really won the fight it at first until

80
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.750
everything else was out the door.

81
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.490
My murder case was drew.

82
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.020
So once we decided to take a bone and they hired another investigator that can

83
00:03:10.021 --> 00:03:11.730
come in with totally new eyes,

84
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.663
totally new view,

85
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.830
it would just basically,

86
00:03:13.831 --> 00:03:18.831
because I was totally out of any other appeals or any other opportunity for the

87
00:03:19.141 --> 00:03:19.980
say and my like,

88
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.173
um,

89
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.220
holding the whole riding off the top.

90
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.580
At the first beginning of the transcript of my transcript,

91
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.460
what was asked was it was a tricky situation.

92
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.220
It was emotion to emotion.

93
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.140
I was just going to in the arrangement to plead guilty or not guilty to the

94
00:03:37.141 --> 00:03:40.700
murder charge and they'll still in the course to meet going into the courtroom

95
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.740
to plead guilty to the murder charge three their kids was in a coat and identify

96
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.890
me at that time and said that I am an appropriate training and robbed them.

97
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.140
The district attorney and let it be known that I was identified and open code

98
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.880
and survivor suspect.

99
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.860
My attorneys at the time was thinking,

100
00:03:58.861 --> 00:04:02.220
I'm just going in there for arrangement for the murder and so they started

101
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.270
arguing the case with the district attorney and the judge saying that this is a

102
00:04:06.271 --> 00:04:08.360
very unfair identification.

103
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.350
Mr. Thompson coming in the code by herself,

104
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.010
but deep thinking that I was being identified in the murder case,

105
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.023
but I will.

106
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.340
<v 1>Are you sure you're brought into court?</v>

107
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.810
You're the only person who's a defendant and these three witnesses are there and

108
00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:25.620
they identify you as being the perpetrator of this crime.

109
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.971
<v 2>The crown,</v>

110
00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:30.830
I'm on robbing him right now given take debt.

111
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.040
The DVD stop.

112
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.450
The perpetrator has been five feet,

113
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:35.980
seven with a big Bush.

114
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.163
Right.

115
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.260
Although that one wasn't my height and my test out at the time when I was a

116
00:04:43.531 --> 00:04:44.330
restaurant.

117
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.980
Right.

118
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.230
They look you down a five to seven man with a ball.

119
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.093
Hey,

120
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.780
because the system,

121
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:51.220
when you first get arrested,

122
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.210
the first thing he did,

123
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:57.130
and he was put on my hell because he was trying to make me look like the safe

124
00:04:57.131 --> 00:04:58.180
speed tall ball.

125
00:04:58.181 --> 00:04:58.930
Hey man,

126
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.900
the committed the murder rate and I lose them.

127
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.123
All right.

128
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.490
<v 1>Crimes.</v>

129
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.840
There are two weeks apart.

130
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.490
One is the arm robbery and one is the murder when they're saying the same person

131
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:11.680
can commit both crimes,

132
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:13.780
even though the descriptions were completely different,

133
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.230
<v 2>completely different.</v>

134
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.300
The murder happened first decent.

135
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.230
The robbery happened second.

136
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.560
So when you arrested me,

137
00:05:21.561 --> 00:05:23.630
when you realized that I don't have no,

138
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.690
so what happened was in the course of them being on evaluating how to proceed

139
00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:33.020
with this particular case,

140
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.160
the District Attorney Office,

141
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.750
I'm sorry,

142
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.250
I'm speaking,

143
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.410
turns up deep,

144
00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:38.000
brought me into this.

145
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.840
Um,

146
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.900
very um,

147
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.690
how they favorable to them.

148
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.360
Suggestion of identifying me as a perpetrator,

149
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.410
but because of my lawyer's in them thinking that I was being identified as a

150
00:05:48.411 --> 00:05:49.160
murder,

151
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.570
the argument case,

152
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.200
Dni really paying attention to what the other district attorney is asking.

153
00:05:54.201 --> 00:05:55.034
The judge,

154
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.600
the other district attorney is asking the to help all of my blog withdraw,

155
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.913
right.

156
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.040
Because uh,

157
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.910
evidence obviously that was definitely in the scene of the crime.

158
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.210
And so what happened was,

159
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.613
um,

160
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.780
my lawyers will sit so busy argue with them about the identification.

161
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.670
He didn't even hear the request,

162
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.350
but once he realized in my lawyers came to conclusion that this wasn't about the

163
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:22.184
murder,

164
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.900
not even all the way back,

165
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.510
all the way up deed,

166
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.830
it backed up off the arguments and getting them back.

167
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.700
They went to saying,

168
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.881
oh,

169
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:30.910
we can't be on this case no longer.

170
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.220
We don't want to represent Mr. Thompson no longer.

171
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.450
That's what the conversation went to wall once g real and I just was totally

172
00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:37.940
different.

173
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.440
There was about a whole new issue.

174
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.350
Then it was the same saying where we out to get it to other cases.

175
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:44.270
We needed to get off of this case right now.

176
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.020
And the judge refused to let them off the case and he made them be my attorney.

177
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.550
But go back to the original thing was dia Pernick,

178
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.470
this deputy public defender Office to represent me in these robbery cases,

179
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.360
that same public defender off it.

180
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:01.820
They say he couldn't represent me in a murder case.

181
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.740
That's was why I was here with,

182
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.540
that's is why it was two weeks.

183
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.110
Two weeks later I'm at this arrangement for my murder.

184
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.640
I had to go through finding me private at the tournaments because the public

185
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:18.230
defender office say he couldn't represent me in this murder case because I was

186
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.370
someone that,

187
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:19.940
um,

188
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.380
he offers building that I was guilty and he feels his office building like that.

189
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.000
They know the victim family.

190
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.240
So Mr Bartaile said,

191
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:27.951
not only could,

192
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:28.940
I can't represent them,

193
00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:32.370
I don't believe nobody in my office could represent him in this matchup.

194
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.760
<v 1>So the blood turned out to be very important evidence in the last days of what</v>

195
00:07:38.371 --> 00:07:40.260
was supposed to be the last days of your life.

196
00:07:40.261 --> 00:07:41.010
Right,

197
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.731
<v 2>exactly.</v>

198
00:07:41.731 --> 00:07:42.091
So,

199
00:07:42.091 --> 00:07:42.421
so,

200
00:07:42.421 --> 00:07:47.421
so how to process when we are assuming I'm just a sec of exception now.

201
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.620
Dad,

202
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.930
I was bonding Charity Hospital Walden's,

203
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:52.560
you know,

204
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.360
so it wasn't hard for them to find out what my blood type was.

205
00:07:57.361 --> 00:08:00.320
As the district attorney on thing you got to do is call and we'll just call the

206
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.930
hospital and realize you just ask him about my blood type.

207
00:08:03.931 --> 00:08:05.520
We need to them and for me.

208
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:11.790
So we had the district attorney and never following up that request that he made

209
00:08:12.121 --> 00:08:12.751
from the judge.

210
00:08:12.751 --> 00:08:14.190
They have my blood with drunk.

211
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.600
He found out that that answer without having my blood drawn,

212
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:23.810
so the d d d I didn't take this armed robbery case and pursue it before he

213
00:08:25.081 --> 00:08:26.310
pursued the murder case.

214
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.610
So they decided to prosecute me for this armed robbery case.

215
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.920
You got three little kids saying that I'm the one Robin.

216
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:33.601
They got Newman,

217
00:08:33.601 --> 00:08:33.960
Brodie,

218
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.800
I represented me.

219
00:08:34.801 --> 00:08:38.220
Mister Birkdale office claimed that he couldn't represent me in the murder,

220
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.600
but all of a sudden he could represent me,

221
00:08:39.601 --> 00:08:41.130
not in this robbery kid.

222
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.470
I tried to protest it.

223
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.810
It didn't go because I couldn't afford attorney Cosa,

224
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.290
you're going to get with Dakota Punch him.

225
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.630
So I was supposed to go to trial with mister Bartell.

226
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.620
Mr. Bird tell,

227
00:08:49.621 --> 00:08:51.930
waiting til the last day of the trial,

228
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.100
the day before my trial to come and see me for the before your trial.

229
00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:56.760
They did.

230
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.470
Before my child was the first time I seen him.

231
00:08:58.471 --> 00:08:59.001
Mr. Byrd.

232
00:08:59.001 --> 00:08:59.970
Tell your lawyer,

233
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.440
your defense lawyer at the trial.

234
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:03.000
The first time you saw your defense lawyer,

235
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:06.240
the trial was the night before your trot fill my job.

236
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.410
Lucy was the first time when this incident happened.

237
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.650
Wendy said just robbery spool the head to the place.

238
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.400
So once he told me when the robbery took place,

239
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:22.430
I would just feel back and relief because I realized where I was at democratic

240
00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:23.010
in the day.

241
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.780
I knew I was at work and I know I a coop.

242
00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:25.590
I was at work.

243
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.250
I know I could have witnesses to come and testify that I was at work and that's

244
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:30.090
just what happened.

245
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:30.980
I was able to tell him,

246
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:31.561
Mr Borcella,

247
00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:34.530
where to go and find my way to see who the Brennon Ducote and how to talk to

248
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:34.601
them.

249
00:09:34.601 --> 00:09:35.280
They're fine.

250
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.950
And that one night he was able to do just that.

251
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.300
So he was able to bring him back to testify that next day in coke for me,

252
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.700
four or five of them are cool workers,

253
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.410
time seats,

254
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.360
my supervisor and all.

255
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.150
So these kids said he was robbed by the Super Dome.

256
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.550
I was working at the Mr. Ball,

257
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.180
the turtle that night.

258
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.740
It was December the 28th when he said [inaudible] Tornado,

259
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.620
that's the first start of Mardi gras season.

260
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.600
So I know where I was at Delta by grabbed Grandpa,

261
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:02.730
I'm just to get paid five,

262
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:04.290
$600 cash money.

263
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.420
Why would I go out and try to ride kids?

264
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:07.190
Alright,

265
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.520
so they tried to say,

266
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:09.660
I changed you in the phones.

267
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.980
I put it on from black to two genes and go ride the kids who come back and

268
00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:15.360
change back into telling you on the phone.

269
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.400
They made it seem like these people have worked.

270
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.100
Couldn't actually account for me for eight hours.

271
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.270
Go on and say I was there and he seen me at one given time.

272
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:25.200
But the DAC,

273
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.440
I left and ran into Robert Kids and came back.

274
00:10:28.441 --> 00:10:28.891
And do it.

275
00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:30.280
That's how he went off and Spanish.

276
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.700
The German bleed you because the three kids were saying,

277
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:33.923
I did it.

278
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:38.040
Never at my trial did anything about blood came up.

279
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.500
No nothing.

280
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:43.320
And then blood evidence was touching him from the scene of the crime.

281
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.470
Doug was saying that we heard about a struggle to plagues,

282
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:49.080
but nothing was saying about blood evidence or anything.

283
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.900
Come to find out the day of my trial,

284
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.310
they just took attorney,

285
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.680
went to the evidence room,

286
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.880
the collect all the physical evidence and through the physical evidence of

287
00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:00.390
weight,

288
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.530
drew the blood pants,

289
00:11:01.531 --> 00:11:02.550
tennis shoes away,

290
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.350
drew the blood,

291
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.020
uh,

292
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.531
pants,

293
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:04.801
leg,

294
00:11:04.801 --> 00:11:07.890
the weight that was confiscated from the crime scene when,

295
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.600
when the robbery first took place,

296
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.010
when the robbery took place,

297
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:13.620
it was a scuffle between the perpetrator and the victim.

298
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.990
One of the victims,

299
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:16.680
excuse me,

300
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.180
that struggled led to,

301
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.050
um,

302
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.020
blood being left on the victim pants,

303
00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:23.070
leg and tennis shoes.

304
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.690
That was from the perpetrator.

305
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.350
Um,

306
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.590
the police confiscated that blood immediately.

307
00:11:28.591 --> 00:11:29.790
Time he came to the scene.

308
00:11:29.791 --> 00:11:32.700
At the time that blood went straight to the crime,

309
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:33.780
they have to be tested.

310
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.400
That's why the DA,

311
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.450
the first question was from the district attorney during the course of me being

312
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:44.070
identified in Oakland coat to have my requesting that the judge had my blood

313
00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:48.050
withdraw to what's the judge granted that motion to the defense.

314
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.793
Um,

315
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.640
and I can say them just investigate it.

316
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.710
They quickly recognize

317
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.860
our request for my blood was me at the beginning of,

318
00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.890
of her transcript when she first began my investigation.

319
00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:01.810
When it's charged,

320
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.020
it's first came about.

321
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.600
So she looked at the transcript to find out what happened.

322
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.240
And when I was first initially charged with this case,

323
00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.560
my first court appearance,

324
00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:14.600
and that's the first thing she recognized the coke was Sam has a dead tied dead

325
00:12:14.601 --> 00:12:15.900
into play.

326
00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.230
Even though all the other argument was going on,

327
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:23.320
she did type in the request that the da May in the judge responds granting him

328
00:12:24.261 --> 00:12:26.600
that request to have my blow withdraw.

329
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.380
All right.

330
00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.720
Never did he ever come to have my glove withdrawal?

331
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:34.750
Never did Mr and ever knew anything about blog existed in this crime at all.

332
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:38.383
Um,

333
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.880
when to see is when all this was first discovered when,

334
00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:46.460
when we first discovered the blog was evidence he did have blood out with them.

335
00:12:46.461 --> 00:12:48.530
So they win first day and he went back to do it.

336
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.430
They'll get their evidence.

337
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.370
We went straight to the with and seeing all the evidence that was collected,

338
00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.950
<v 1>police reports and so forth.</v>

339
00:12:54.951 --> 00:12:55.630
Right,

340
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:56.291
<v 2>exactly.</v>

341
00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:57.820
Then we recognize in a,

342
00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.280
in a bunch of the murder

343
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:06.340
and the murder trial in a bunch of the Nada police repurposed a lot of different

344
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.290
cool police reports with stuff in it.

345
00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:12.150
It really just didn't make sense to the murder case when we were quickly,

346
00:13:12.151 --> 00:13:15.600
they realize that's where it did me simply because it belonged in a robber.

347
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.810
So it was obviously that dude was stuffing it in the murder trial to try to keep

348
00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:22.480
it out of the robbery.

349
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:23.733
Um,

350
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:24.740
police report in,

351
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:24.990
in,

352
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.060
in breakfast at the district.

353
00:13:26.061 --> 00:13:26.510
We turn it off.

354
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.260
It was all right,

355
00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.600
but so when we really went through it and realize that this is what happened,

356
00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.510
dance was taking him the physical evidence to the crime that she went straight

357
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:37.120
to the cloud and they have been to pick out where the evidence was,

358
00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:37.954
what was happening.

359
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.490
We realized that the blood evidence had been tested and he had a final result of

360
00:13:42.491 --> 00:13:45.850
the blood test and it was good and it was sent to the district attorney office

361
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:46.570
himself.

362
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.170
One of the district attorney himself wouldn't sign for the results of the

363
00:13:50.171 --> 00:13:54.100
evidence and the end and so he claimed that he placed it on the Hay just to

364
00:13:54.101 --> 00:13:57.850
return and dentist the head district attorney claim and he never seen me before,

365
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:02.020
but what did it say it that Mr. Thompson was exclusive?

366
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.340
I wasn't responsible.

367
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.450
It wasn't my blood.

368
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.610
<v 1>Neither one was your blood type</v>

369
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:08.301
<v 2>me.</v>

370
00:14:08.301 --> 00:14:09.650
It just so half a month,

371
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.920
three is God.

372
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.460
My blood type was the same as the victim

373
00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:19.710
and the perpetrator blood title was totally different and so it was that.

374
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:24.620
It was just a blessing that mean the victim had the same type of love.

375
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.540
Because if I had that other blog,

376
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:31.070
like the perpetrator hae like a lot of like majority of the people do have,

377
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.440
I think it was [inaudible].

378
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.070
I can't remember which way it was,

379
00:14:34.071 --> 00:14:34.730
but I,

380
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:38.270
I know me and the victim is having a rare blood and you say we not,

381
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:38.570
you know,

382
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:42.110
normally the ones that you use to be a plentiful the other way around.

383
00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.310
So I could easily been switched over on that side and out of being dead for a

384
00:14:46.311 --> 00:14:47.390
crime I didn't commit.

385
00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:54.470
<v 1>What relationship time was there between when this was discovered that you could</v>

386
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:58.760
not have possibly done this robbery and your execution date?

387
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:02.200
<v 2>Maybe about,</v>

388
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.530
I haven't gotten within 35 days I had to receive the date.

389
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.981
You know,

390
00:15:05.981 --> 00:15:07.510
you can't give you the execution day.

391
00:15:07.511 --> 00:15:09.440
You got to be 35 days and one right.

392
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:14.450
I hadn't received it 35 and the execution date I was scheduled to die me the

393
00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:17.920
21st my son was scheduled to graduated me to talk to you.

394
00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:23.780
<v 1>So the result of that is your convictions for both the armed robbery and the</v>

395
00:15:24.001 --> 00:15:24.361
murder.

396
00:15:24.361 --> 00:15:28.770
Of course the arm robbery was used at your murder trial to convict you and also

397
00:15:28.771 --> 00:15:30.150
to keep you from testifying.

398
00:15:30.151 --> 00:15:30.984
Is that right?

399
00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:31.331
<v 2>Yes.</v>

400
00:15:31.331 --> 00:15:31.630
Uh,

401
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:32.710
that was the whole block.

402
00:15:32.711 --> 00:15:34.270
That was the whole strategy plan.

403
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.270
It was weird because even after the conviction,

404
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.760
so not as the Birch Hill fighting,

405
00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:39.041
right.

406
00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:42.900
Because now he realized that y'all are trying to railroad this innocent man.

407
00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:46.360
He angled his people telling y'all he was at work and y'all still trying to

408
00:15:46.361 --> 00:15:47.194
prosecute them.

409
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:48.520
So now this man,

410
00:15:48.521 --> 00:15:50.980
they think I'm guilty of a murder nine.

411
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.520
He trying to fight when he just got too much against him.

412
00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.940
It was like he had all the evidence.

413
00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.920
Da deliberately went through it.

414
00:15:59.921 --> 00:16:03.590
The physical evidence of weak it makes sure that he could never find that out

415
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.100
with this had never been returned back to the evidence room.

416
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:06.780
Um,

417
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:11.170
and I'm trying to figure out how deep just conspiracy it really was because you

418
00:16:11.171 --> 00:16:14.920
got a person that work in the evidence room that that's his only job is when

419
00:16:14.921 --> 00:16:17.470
people sign in and signing out the evidence.

420
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:19.890
So if you assign something that with this out,

421
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.250
they never bring him back.

422
00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.690
No alarm doesn't go off.

423
00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:24.250
He don't tell nobody that.

424
00:16:24.251 --> 00:16:27.730
These district attorneys came and took some blood and with Dennis away from the

425
00:16:27.731 --> 00:16:32.530
evidence room and didn't return it and we'll tell them nobody in his right now

426
00:16:32.531 --> 00:16:35.140
he's back date having evidence.

427
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.981
I'm kind of like,

428
00:16:35.981 --> 00:16:36.814
what kind of,

429
00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:37.541
what?

430
00:16:37.541 --> 00:16:42.310
Why do we have this procedure here if you're not going to notify someone when

431
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.570
someone lie to do not return physical evidence back and this,

432
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.121
that is a,

433
00:16:46.121 --> 00:16:49.960
to me embarrassing to all come to justice system that caught alone.

434
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.200
We ain't got to go through nobody else bring the with.

435
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.910
That would have killed anything that was going on if he would've did this job.

436
00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:01.450
Nobody even questioned him about his job as to this day.

437
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:06.660
He had yet to answer to why he did not notify someone when the district attorney

438
00:17:07.391 --> 00:17:09.760
office didn't bring them that physical evidence back.

439
00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:10.773
But at,

440
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.470
<v 1>well I was just going to say tell us this.</v>

441
00:17:13.471 --> 00:17:16.470
I mean now you had a retrial right on both these charges,

442
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.200
right?

443
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:17.920
<v 2>Yes.</v>

444
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.753
And what happened

445
00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:21.640
all the way during the robbery,

446
00:17:21.641 --> 00:17:23.050
after the robbery conviction,

447
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.270
everybody understood I hadn't had the condition.

448
00:17:25.271 --> 00:17:25.741
I wasn't,

449
00:17:25.741 --> 00:17:26.561
I was a clean,

450
00:17:26.561 --> 00:17:28.760
I had a decent rep.

451
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:34.140
So what happened was the my lawyers at my murder trial tried to ask the judge,

452
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.451
not the loud,

453
00:17:37.451 --> 00:17:40.930
that conviction to be held against me because I want to take the stand and my

454
00:17:40.931 --> 00:17:41.764
murder case.

455
00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:42.030
Right.

456
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.350
And just to see if he'd take the stand,

457
00:17:44.351 --> 00:17:45.820
I'm going to outlive the deed it using.

458
00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:46.790
That's the law.

459
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.010
My Law told him,

460
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.960
my lawyer was kind,

461
00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.930
smart Patrick fan who was a seasoned vet.

462
00:17:51.931 --> 00:17:52.720
So Pat,

463
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.100
pat came back and told him,

464
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:54.993
well,

465
00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:58.600
I won't put a writ to the full circuit court of appeal because this is not a

466
00:17:58.601 --> 00:17:59.620
final conviction.

467
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.450
How can you use a condition that's not violent?

468
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.000
It hadn't even been on the pill yet.

469
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:04.730
Right.

470
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:05.531
And so in,

471
00:18:05.531 --> 00:18:05.851
in,

472
00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:06.160
in,

473
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.150
in the judge say,

474
00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:07.451
well,

475
00:18:07.451 --> 00:18:08.440
if he get on that stand,

476
00:18:08.441 --> 00:18:09.550
I'm allowed in the user,

477
00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:10.900
take your Rick.

478
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.030
And so that's the best thing that could've happened to me.

479
00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:13.901
Back to fandom.

480
00:18:13.901 --> 00:18:16.130
Took that Richard the full sir and action.

481
00:18:16.131 --> 00:18:18.940
Then I'm not allowed to cope to use that conviction against me.

482
00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:22.870
The Pole circuit agreed with the judge and said that if I take the stand,

483
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.310
the DA got a right to use it.

484
00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:25.860
<v 1>This isn't your first trial.</v>

485
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:27.480
This is a trial where you were convicted,

486
00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:28.190
right?

487
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.220
<v 2>Charles got convicted.</v>

488
00:18:29.221 --> 00:18:32.270
So now when I get the reversal flow design robbing,

489
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.380
it automatically opened up the door.

490
00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.540
Doesn't the review my murder case dino,

491
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.900
would you just not see?

492
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.570
I requested through the coke represent all of that.

493
00:18:42.571 --> 00:18:44.640
I wanted to testify in my own behalf.

494
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.120
Right.

495
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.810
Would you determine them to say that you are going to use this conviction

496
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.220
against me in depth?

497
00:18:50.221 --> 00:18:53.310
Will you define me and my right to testify on her own behalf.

498
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.890
And so the full circle to bill came back and see.

499
00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:56.290
Yeah,

500
00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.210
lose a part of that.

501
00:18:57.211 --> 00:18:59.910
And guess what y'all told me y'all was gonna use it against him.

502
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:01.500
So he needs everyone new trial.

503
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:03.810
So now going back to a new trial,

504
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:07.620
it's a whole different ball game now because now I'm just with the murder.

505
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.830
So not even know they don't have a case against me because they know the

506
00:19:10.831 --> 00:19:14.160
perpetrator who committed the crime was the one that he cut the deal with Kevin

507
00:19:14.161 --> 00:19:14.730
[inaudible].

508
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:15.470
They know

509
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.380
<v 1>he was the person who accused you.</v>

510
00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:18.920
<v 2>You're the person that kills me.</v>

511
00:19:18.921 --> 00:19:19.401
He fixed it.

512
00:19:19.401 --> 00:19:20.480
The shift and six feet tall,

513
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.343
medium build,

514
00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.111
bald head.

515
00:19:22.111 --> 00:19:26.270
He fit the full description of all live witnesses a little we'll give,

516
00:19:26.271 --> 00:19:28.380
districts are not saying anybody to have it.

517
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:28.760
Jill.

518
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.190
The fact that I didn't want to say that he did it,

519
00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:36.550
that being ignored case and so the had to use him against me then because he had

520
00:19:36.891 --> 00:19:37.820
to make a prohibition.

521
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.860
They didn't worry about that for once.

522
00:19:39.861 --> 00:19:41.940
I wouldn't testify the way they want it.

523
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.670
That's when we put on robberies on me.

524
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:44.211
One,

525
00:19:44.211 --> 00:19:46.990
I wouldn't tell them that Kevin Freeman did it.

526
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.030
He wanted me to say Kevin Freeman did it and I was there and I know it.

527
00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:50.961
I don't know nothing.

528
00:19:50.961 --> 00:19:52.040
I don't know Kevin Freeman did.

529
00:19:52.041 --> 00:19:52.874
I wasn't with him.

530
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:54.440
If you know he did it,

531
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:55.783
convict him then

532
00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.310
<v 1>let me be sure I understand.</v>

533
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.080
If you had been willing to say that Kevin had committed the crime and then you

534
00:20:03.081 --> 00:20:03.914
were there,

535
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:05.420
they would've cut a deal with you.

536
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.530
Yes,

537
00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:10.280
and instead they cut a deal with Kevin who apparently was the person who

538
00:20:10.281 --> 00:20:11.210
committed the crime,

539
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:12.860
who got out of it by saying,

540
00:20:12.861 --> 00:20:13.371
you did it.

541
00:20:13.371 --> 00:20:14.204
Is that right?

542
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.590
<v 2>Guest symbol as simple as ABC it was.</v>

543
00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:18.620
I can say one thing.

544
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:19.420
I do look at it,

545
00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.050
look at it.

546
00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:24.850
Before anybody was caught with all the witnesses were saying how to perpetrate

547
00:20:24.851 --> 00:20:24.941
it.

548
00:20:24.941 --> 00:20:25.330
Look,

549
00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.000
and we just gave the same description.

550
00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:28.571
Dean,

551
00:20:28.571 --> 00:20:29.770
say the one person,

552
00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:29.980
I mean,

553
00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.000
no two people did it.

554
00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:31.940
He said one,

555
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.390
Kevin Freeman with don of course,

556
00:20:34.391 --> 00:20:36.790
and they put two people at the scene of the crime.

557
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.281
<v 1>Well,</v>

558
00:20:37.281 --> 00:20:39.140
what happened at your second trial?

559
00:20:39.141 --> 00:20:40.450
What happened when the jury,

560
00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.420
you testified,

561
00:20:41.421 --> 00:20:41.721
right,

562
00:20:41.721 --> 00:20:44.690
and you told him you weren't there and and so forth.

563
00:20:44.691 --> 00:20:45.330
Right.

564
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.470
<v 2>I testify.</v>

565
00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:47.280
Well,

566
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.800
only that we found we had,

567
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:50.011
you know,

568
00:20:50.011 --> 00:20:51.520
it was a lot more than about the blood.

569
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:52.001
They have a dense,

570
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:53.250
it's so much physical evidence,

571
00:20:53.251 --> 00:20:55.950
ones going to tell from us and the robbery case as well.

572
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.780
Especially all of these other witnesses.

573
00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.150
We didn't even know these other witnesses took place.

574
00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.370
We didn't know they had all of these other witnesses and give different

575
00:21:02.371 --> 00:21:03.030
descriptions.

576
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.730
We know we ain't nobody to hit all of these other witness.

577
00:21:05.731 --> 00:21:07.980
Some witnesses was so scared that the move,

578
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.030
because you told the da they ain't demand.

579
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.890
I seen him running away and the da just ignored that witness.

580
00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.570
And the witness got so scared,

581
00:21:15.571 --> 00:21:18.600
did nothing to Walgreen's because you're saying that that man,

582
00:21:18.601 --> 00:21:18.741
no,

583
00:21:18.741 --> 00:21:21.300
I seen him and them ain't gonna come back and get me,

584
00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:21.660
you know,

585
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:26.060
we had some incredible witness that can testify to things that,

586
00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.070
that was withheld from us by these same district attorneys.

587
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.990
And so like you got right now,

588
00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.960
the jury took less than the,

589
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:34.021
it took 30,

590
00:21:34.021 --> 00:21:36.840
about 35 minutes all together after,

591
00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:37.121
you know,

592
00:21:37.121 --> 00:21:41.700
the best value for you to pick,

593
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:42.150
um,

594
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:44.580
a juror's hormones and all of that,

595
00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:45.970
and then go over the evidence.

596
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:48.880
But I'm willing to show it by the two disciplines,

597
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.510
put it in the final foaming and the jury.

598
00:21:51.511 --> 00:21:54.280
Then it took him to come back with a verdict and you know,

599
00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.173
um,

600
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.200
<v 1>they found you not guilty in 35 minutes.</v>

601
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:00.543
Yes sir.

602
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:01.301
Good.

603
00:22:01.301 --> 00:22:06.301
Spent 18 years in prison and 14 of those years on death row and the jury took 35

604
00:22:08.501 --> 00:22:09.161
minutes to say,

605
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:09.994
you are not guilty.

606
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:14.290
<v 2>[inaudible] all would happen.</v>

607
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.730
All with the da Di [inaudible].

608
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.130
We was allowed because Freeman,

609
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.550
the person who testified,

610
00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.960
it gives me to first job was d he was,

611
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.030
he was killed robbing somebody else.

612
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:25.571
You know,

613
00:22:25.571 --> 00:22:30.130
people don't understand when we have these wrongful convictions.

614
00:22:30.131 --> 00:22:33.430
And then you hear these stories like mine because he got some storage.

615
00:22:33.431 --> 00:22:34.650
This is incredible.

616
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:35.111
Their mind,

617
00:22:35.111 --> 00:22:35.860
you know this.

618
00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:36.830
So when,

619
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:40.600
when we hit these acts are these district attorneys and we see this,

620
00:22:40.601 --> 00:22:41.730
we don't look at,

621
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.060
I went,

622
00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:48.060
this perpetrator did to someone else who gave him the right to unleash just

623
00:22:48.101 --> 00:22:50.140
individual on the rest of the [inaudible] side.

624
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:50.651
So we,

625
00:22:50.651 --> 00:22:52.390
and when we saying that we would all,

626
00:22:52.391 --> 00:22:54.610
he destroyed in this one individual life,

627
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.050
we just looking at it like that.

628
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.670
But whatever that perpetrator,

629
00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:58.561
he allowed to go.

630
00:22:58.561 --> 00:23:02.740
I didn't command continue to hurt our society to tend to her sister.

631
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.920
This man was killed robbing someone else.

632
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:07.300
So someone else,

633
00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.040
<v 1>Ben convicted originally of this crime,</v>

634
00:23:10.041 --> 00:23:12.020
he would have never been out on the streets.

635
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:13.400
<v 2>So now I live with this man,</v>

636
00:23:13.401 --> 00:23:14.740
got to do this man.

637
00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:17.090
Now I got to deal with the fact that he didn't kill the man,

638
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:18.251
just just,

639
00:23:18.251 --> 00:23:19.460
we'll just just attorney to put it on.

640
00:23:19.461 --> 00:23:22.520
This man killed the man that shouldn't even been outside,

641
00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.400
shouldn't even been three to rock around the hurt anybody again.

642
00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.680
And he could have probably been very well lost.

643
00:23:27.681 --> 00:23:32.090
His life was made him decide he needed to use physical force to kill them.

644
00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.100
So it's so much debt,

645
00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.450
so much responsibilities go into these cases and for us to say that we don't

646
00:23:38.451 --> 00:23:40.940
have a system now that that decide,

647
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:45.230
we didn't seem enough crazy cases to us as adults and as,

648
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:45.591
as,

649
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:46.100
as,

650
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.830
as people that shouldn't be responsible for criminal justice system.

651
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:53.060
We didn't seem enough outrageous behavior on just with the attorney to see this

652
00:23:53.061 --> 00:23:53.894
do happen.

653
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.180
And it happened on a lot.

654
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.411
<v 1>Well let me ask you this.</v>

655
00:23:56.411 --> 00:23:56.701
You,

656
00:23:56.701 --> 00:23:59.410
you tried to hold the prosecutor accountable here,

657
00:23:59.411 --> 00:23:59.741
right?

658
00:23:59.741 --> 00:23:59.941
You,

659
00:23:59.941 --> 00:24:04.390
you sued the District Attorney's office and you claim that not only had they

660
00:24:04.391 --> 00:24:06.850
withheld this evidence in your case,

661
00:24:06.851 --> 00:24:10.090
but that there was a whole group of cases there in New Orleans.

662
00:24:10.091 --> 00:24:15.070
This was in New Orleans and this was a parish Orleans parish district attorney's

663
00:24:15.071 --> 00:24:15.850
office,

664
00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:20.020
which had had a number of cases reversed because of hiding evidence and

665
00:24:20.021 --> 00:24:22.450
withholding evidence that showed innocence.

666
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.380
Uh,

667
00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:23.920
tell us,

668
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.080
just got a limited amount of time,

669
00:24:26.081 --> 00:24:27.340
but tell us what happened,

670
00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:27.971
uh,

671
00:24:27.971 --> 00:24:29.350
with regard to your lawsuit.

672
00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:30.810
<v 2>You know,</v>

673
00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:31.643
there's Kinda,

674
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:32.950
he's of weird,

675
00:24:32.951 --> 00:24:33.520
cause it was,

676
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.160
it was a power clean in every aspect of it.

677
00:24:36.161 --> 00:24:36.580
You know,

678
00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.440
it was so politically he got to the parent with what was at stake hidden and

679
00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:45.450
lost his value on what was really at stake hit and lost his value from the fact

680
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:50.820
that I come in and out of the all these Paris wellness happening,

681
00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:53.380
most cases don't even make it to the docket.

682
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:58.480
Most kids get totally turned down saying that prosecutors have immunity.

683
00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:59.343
All right.

684
00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:03.790
This was so outrageous case and it was not only was this outrageous,

685
00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:07.960
we had a former district attorney who had kind of had higher,

686
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:12.430
the oversee of grand jury investigation of his own office,

687
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.180
can't took conclusion that I can indict these five of y'all.

688
00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:17.770
Why haven't these district attorneys,

689
00:25:17.771 --> 00:25:21.400
Mr Carmine and Mr [inaudible] refused to accept him,

690
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.280
allow him that opportunity to do just that.

691
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.480
So he resigned.

692
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:28.570
We had him as our chief witness.

693
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.550
He was too sick.

694
00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.570
All the corrupt nature that was happening inside of that system.

695
00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.430
That's what the jury believed.

696
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.560
Not nothing that was said,

697
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:41.260
but what he invested in and what he discovered.

698
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.430
And when he said,

699
00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:45.450
so the jury has said that it's no one to where Mr Kinda,

700
00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.370
y'all continue to do this over and over and over again.

701
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.181
There's no inner world.

702
00:25:49.181 --> 00:25:50.750
We are going to allow them to get away with this.

703
00:25:50.751 --> 00:25:53.680
Here we gonna show y'all who was who'll just sit.

704
00:25:53.681 --> 00:25:55.660
It's where this would it be and with the school to represent.

705
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:59.590
And so when the them responsible and rewarded us,

706
00:25:59.591 --> 00:26:03.910
this what was amazing from there was the fifth circuit court of Appeals.

707
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:07.270
He's coming the first round of appeals where I win

708
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.910
<v 1>back up the jury,</v>

709
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:11.470
Greg gave you a verdict,

710
00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.300
a $14 million,

711
00:26:13.301 --> 00:26:14.134
is that right?

712
00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.280
And add another million dollars to pay for the attorney's fee.

713
00:26:17.281 --> 00:26:19.630
So you had a verdict of $15 million,

714
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.740
you appeared the state appeal that to the Orleans parish,

715
00:26:23.741 --> 00:26:25.510
to the court of appeals,

716
00:26:25.511 --> 00:26:25.841
which,

717
00:26:25.841 --> 00:26:27.190
which divided evenly.

718
00:26:27.191 --> 00:26:28.450
So that was upheld.

719
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:29.171
Uh,

720
00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:30.004
and then it went to the

721
00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:31.350
<v 2>part of the United States.</v>

722
00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.690
That's it corrupts of the stone up in up edge.

723
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.300
You got to realize what we do in the winter,

724
00:26:39.301 --> 00:26:41.250
especially when I feel circuit court of Appeals.

725
00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.100
We got the night,

726
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.240
we don't know with it,

727
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:46.120
with his stuffed it in his messed up because just what happened,

728
00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.280
my first round of appeals,

729
00:26:48.281 --> 00:26:52.030
I wanted three Oh three judges was in my favorite deep,

730
00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:52.361
the,

731
00:26:52.361 --> 00:26:53.650
the bond hearing on them.

732
00:26:53.651 --> 00:26:58.651
Three judges who was kind of override or the brother judges had been agreed that

733
00:26:58.661 --> 00:26:59.494
this was less.

734
00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.940
So somebody,

735
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:01.990
however he is done,

736
00:27:01.991 --> 00:27:06.760
I don't know what the process is that we can override.

737
00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:07.810
Three of our brothers,

738
00:27:07.811 --> 00:27:11.500
dad made the decision on this case because when you call the Humboldt here,

739
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:12.670
that's what you was trying to do,

740
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.890
trying to override this decision.

741
00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.780
So if that's a place out,

742
00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:17.141
of course,

743
00:27:17.141 --> 00:27:17.831
if I were right there,

744
00:27:17.831 --> 00:27:18.880
that should be alone.

745
00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:21.250
Is that a place where our criminal justice system is?

746
00:27:21.251 --> 00:27:25.030
That's how our system was set up because some other judges don't agree with with

747
00:27:25.031 --> 00:27:26.050
with these street judges,

748
00:27:26.051 --> 00:27:29.920
who would we give a lifetime commitment to to do this job?

749
00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:30.341
We say,

750
00:27:30.341 --> 00:27:30.461
oh,

751
00:27:30.461 --> 00:27:31.221
we didn't satisfy.

752
00:27:31.221 --> 00:27:31.951
What did you send you?

753
00:27:31.951 --> 00:27:33.730
So we're going to challenge the precision.

754
00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:35.380
So we try to override it,

755
00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:36.290
right?

756
00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:38.900
And then we still hung with a divided coat.

757
00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.460
So that's kind of crazy how you don't think,

758
00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.630
think about that concept.

759
00:27:43.631 --> 00:27:44.560
What this mean.

760
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.970
What I'm asking is this deep plane is kind of a game with that's important.

761
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:49.690
That's meaning,

762
00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:51.040
it's not the people charged.

763
00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:51.760
It's not.

764
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.020
It's not the will of the people.

765
00:27:53.021 --> 00:27:54.850
If you go use your political power,

766
00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:57.400
I would like to know who had that kind of power.

767
00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:01.180
We need to know who the people are because if there's some decisions that really

768
00:28:01.181 --> 00:28:02.380
affect the people,

769
00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:04.540
this is how he set up this system in the world.

770
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:08.920
Not for you to have some other political power to pull that strength if you want

771
00:28:08.921 --> 00:28:12.550
them and you just having to try to pull this down that you just didn't win,

772
00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:13.271
but it was eight,

773
00:28:13.271 --> 00:28:15.280
eight that's still messed up.

774
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:18.950
Came out when the jury verdict sustained,

775
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:19.793
right?

776
00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.960
So what that means to the United States Supreme Court.

777
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:24.520
He shouldn't even been looking at it.

778
00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.780
This isn't even a case.

779
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:27.520
United now are we to call it Haiyan.

780
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.100
It shouldn't be a case than United States supreme coaching even been trying to,

781
00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:34.210
trying to see a hill,

782
00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:37.450
but of course the concern with a dream,

783
00:28:37.451 --> 00:28:38.350
nothing verdict.

784
00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:40.540
Some buys this,

785
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.510
it was a state matter state issue itself.

786
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.160
[inaudible] itself.

787
00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:49.210
It didn't come in there to the one with that one having a powerful pinion dead.

788
00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:49.721
You know what?

789
00:28:49.721 --> 00:28:52.830
We need to intervene here if three nothing.

790
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.350
They shouldn't even be reviewing it at all.

791
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:56.710
It was,

792
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:57.730
it was kind of crazy.

793
00:28:57.731 --> 00:29:00.340
That deal was even revealing this at all period.

794
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:01.730
<v 1>Let me ask you,</v>

795
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:02.721
let me ask you this,

796
00:29:02.721 --> 00:29:03.554
John Thompson,

797
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:04.271
uh,

798
00:29:04.271 --> 00:29:04.530
when,

799
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:05.770
when were you released from,

800
00:29:05.771 --> 00:29:05.970
uh,

801
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:06.950
from death row?

802
00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.120
<v 2>Um,</v>

803
00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.460
two or three made it feel coming up,

804
00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:12.590
coming up next month.

805
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:18.890
<v 1>Tell us what you've been doing and what adjustments you have been making to</v>

806
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.420
going from being locked down and,

807
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.210
and Gola they're notorious who he is.

808
00:29:24.211 --> 00:29:25.650
Yana state penitentiary.

809
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:26.610
Uh,

810
00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:27.990
since you've been in the free world.

811
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.251
<v 2>Well,</v>

812
00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:29.690
one of the,

813
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:34.460
one of the things we do is he falls lead to fight the system.

814
00:29:34.461 --> 00:29:35.294
You know what,

815
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:35.481
you know,

816
00:29:35.481 --> 00:29:39.600
once I took on the lawsuit and we conferenced stains that most people save,

817
00:29:39.601 --> 00:29:41.200
it couldn't be done right now.

818
00:29:41.201 --> 00:29:43.850
We got the whole world looking at wrongful conviction now,

819
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:44.380
you know,

820
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.080
we got them looking at prosecutor misconduct now we,

821
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.400
I didn't have a pound.

822
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:51.400
I didn't help pounders and maybe five or six different states.

823
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.860
Right now with the innocent project we've been on focusing on accountability put

824
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:56.381
on the arm,

825
00:29:56.381 --> 00:29:58.080
you could go to the prosecutor oversight,

826
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.620
um,

827
00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.010
and see some of the,

828
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.903
um,

829
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:02.470
with the people that's holding,

830
00:30:02.471 --> 00:30:04.450
supposed to be holding these people accountable.

831
00:30:04.451 --> 00:30:05.290
What they are saying,

832
00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.200
why are they not holding them accountable?

833
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:08.590
And you'll be shocked if,

834
00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:08.980
you know,

835
00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:09.820
if a judge said,

836
00:30:09.821 --> 00:30:12.520
well I could see this district attorney don't know this bad stuff,

837
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.850
but I just kind of disciplining them because I know his family,

838
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.070
this is how eat,

839
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:17.690
you know,

840
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:18.401
in and in,

841
00:30:18.401 --> 00:30:19.600
in reality of,

842
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:24.010
well forget about him killing an innocent man you are worrying about that's how

843
00:30:24.011 --> 00:30:25.060
he takes care of his family.

844
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.150
So that is a real part of society that,

845
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:31.210
so it then God deep that we got to deal with.

846
00:30:31.211 --> 00:30:31.651
We got done,

847
00:30:31.651 --> 00:30:33.280
understand we got to learn.

848
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:38.460
So that been my biggest passion right now to like educate society about in most

849
00:30:39.281 --> 00:30:41.410
cases we'd given these guys our life,

850
00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.750
putting our life in the hands.

851
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:48.550
Surely we need to hold them accountable and we can't keep playing with this

852
00:30:48.551 --> 00:30:51.760
premeditated thought of murder because when we can say,

853
00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:56.020
of course it could pre plan and kill someone and you got a prosecutor who got to

854
00:30:56.021 --> 00:30:59.260
use that same strategy to do that same thing.

855
00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:03.850
If we could pull overwhelmingly that he had inflammation in his possession,

856
00:31:03.851 --> 00:31:05.230
that this man was innocent.

857
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:05.651
Yeah,

858
00:31:05.651 --> 00:31:07.480
he still pursued Mr. Bright.

859
00:31:07.481 --> 00:31:09.720
You do know that since it's in phases,

860
00:31:09.721 --> 00:31:11.290
it's a totally different trial.

861
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.490
So you to come out of that criminal and getting that conviction.

862
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:17.680
If as a prosecutor,

863
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:18.581
if you don't know,

864
00:31:18.581 --> 00:31:19.780
you convicted in as a man,

865
00:31:19.781 --> 00:31:21.220
you should have no by that time.

866
00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:21.960
Right.

867
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:26.050
So if you're going to still use bad judgment from then on because you got a

868
00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:26.884
conviction,

869
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.370
you got them off the streets for you to pursue the kill them.

870
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.251
You know,

871
00:31:32.251 --> 00:31:33.640
it's kind of hard for me to person.

872
00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.720
In your case,

873
00:31:34.721 --> 00:31:36.220
it was pretty clear from the start.

874
00:31:36.221 --> 00:31:37.750
Once they got those blood results,

875
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.610
you could not have committed that crime.

876
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.920
So here we got Jim Williams,

877
00:31:41.921 --> 00:31:44.440
Jim prosecuted eight of us on debt,

878
00:31:44.441 --> 00:31:46.480
put us all on death row out of Orleans parish,

879
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.250
even from holiday to Jefferson Paris.

880
00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:49.250
Oh,

881
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:52.450
what's this home free right off of death row.

882
00:31:52.451 --> 00:31:54.790
All of them that received some farmer reversal,

883
00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:58.240
so that's just one man name is seven or eight different cases.

884
00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.040
Then I look around and look at some of the other,

885
00:32:00.041 --> 00:32:02.860
I see Jack people name and all of these other cases.

886
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:07.690
So you got individuals that deliberately did this over and over and over again

887
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:08.690
for our high end.

888
00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.720
Cool look at this information and say,

889
00:32:10.721 --> 00:32:10.871
oh,

890
00:32:10.871 --> 00:32:12.070
this is not going on.

891
00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:12.281
Oh,

892
00:32:12.281 --> 00:32:17.281
y'all need to show a pattern for for how your to reverse eating one of these

893
00:32:17.381 --> 00:32:21.520
cases on these type of serious issues and for the Bar Association or the

894
00:32:21.521 --> 00:32:25.310
disciplinary board not to take up on himself at that punk.

895
00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:28.240
It's doing complaint needs to be filed for as I'm concerned,

896
00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.081
the how you cool.

897
00:32:29.081 --> 00:32:34.081
Just not told you what happened to me that couldn't afford an attorney at all.

898
00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.790
Why should it be on me to file a complaint against this a Tony?

899
00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:41.610
Because it's obviously I didn't have a Tony before the court apparently mean

900
00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.070
each Tony that I had.

901
00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.910
So you asking me to file a complaint after all of this happened to me.

902
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.790
It's the only way you can consider

903
00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:54.130
putting this person then discipline and I'm putting us in person and check,

904
00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:57.330
no matter how many times he abuse it,

905
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:59.350
no matter how many times you tried to kill,

906
00:32:59.351 --> 00:32:59.570
you know,

907
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:03.430
some people come on the rest of the respect yourself then you know,

908
00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:06.850
however many times a day and showed up in these reversible cases at the same

909
00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:07.270
name.

910
00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:08.410
This man had a problem.

911
00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:09.383
He should.

912
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:16.360
<v 1>You told us a great deal about a failure to disclose and turn over evidence of</v>

913
00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:17.980
innocence.

914
00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:22.690
You told us about accountability and about just a remarkable experience,

915
00:33:22.691 --> 00:33:27.040
18 years of your life being taken away and the work you're doing now,

916
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:27.890
uh,

917
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:28.140
to,

918
00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.570
to try to hold people accountable and to try to deal with this problem.

919
00:33:31.571 --> 00:33:32.111
And as you say,

920
00:33:32.111 --> 00:33:34.630
there are a number of other exonerated people.

921
00:33:34.631 --> 00:33:37.540
And I know one of the other things you've been doing is working with people

922
00:33:37.541 --> 00:33:41.110
who've been exonerated and are now released into the community.

923
00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:42.040
Uh,

924
00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:47.040
but I want to thank you for taking your time and being with us here today and

925
00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.560
letting us know from a personal experience of someone who went through this and

926
00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:51.394
experience this,

927
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:52.720
what it was like.

928
00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.710
Thank you very much.

929
00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:55.020
<v 2>Thank you man.</v>

930
00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:56.363
Good to talk.

931
00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:58.841
I love it.

932
00:33:58.841 --> 00:34:02.090
Y'All report till y'all did an excellent report on prosecutor accountability

933
00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:02.933
here.

934
00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:04.403
I love you.

935
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.593
Thank you.

936
00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:07.100
All right.
