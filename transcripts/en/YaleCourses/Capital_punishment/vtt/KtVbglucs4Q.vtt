1
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.290
In this session today,

2
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:14.101
we're going to talk about it,

3
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:15.810
aggravating circumstances.

4
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:16.501
Uh,

5
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:20.460
and we looked at the cases in 1976 when the supreme court upheld the death

6
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:21.294
penalty.

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.880
And as we saw in every state,

8
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:24.271
Florida,

9
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:24.841
Georgia,

10
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:25.351
Texas,

11
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:26.550
the ones that were upheld,

12
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.271
uh,

13
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:30.660
it was the death penalty was upheld not only for murder,

14
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:31.950
but with one other thing,

15
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:33.990
murder and the commission of an arm robbery,

16
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.320
murder that was particularly a heinous,

17
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:38.790
atrocious and cruel,

18
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.371
uh,

19
00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:42.360
those kinds of additional factors.

20
00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:44.160
A murder of a police officer.

21
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.850
Uh,

22
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.900
we saw that some states put those at the penalty phase of the trial.

23
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:50.220
And we saw that other states,

24
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.821
uh,

25
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:51.654
put those,

26
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.300
uh,

27
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.681
at,

28
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:52.981
at,

29
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:53.551
at the,

30
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:54.450
at the guilt phase,

31
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:55.560
such as in Texas,

32
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:56.394
where one of the,

33
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.440
in order to be convicted of capital murder,

34
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:00.290
it has to be murder of a police officer,

35
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.260
a murder in the commission of another felony where there were a lot of issues

36
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:08.490
that remained about whether these aggravating circumstances actually do what the

37
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:09.720
court said they're supposed to do.

38
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.660
And that is to guide the discretion of the jury.

39
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.640
The idea of the aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances is that

40
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:18.181
the jury,

41
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:21.990
unlike in the preferred days before Furman versus Georgia,

42
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.760
when a jury just decided without any guidance whether to impose death or not,

43
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.800
now the discretion of the jury was going to be clearly guided,

44
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.130
like clear and objective standards that we'll see.

45
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.080
And that's to prevent the arbitrariness.

46
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:37.914
We'll see that,

47
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.341
uh,

48
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:42.450
the court retreats from that quite a bit as we look at these cases.

49
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.160
Uh,

50
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.430
today in this session,

51
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.070
uh,

52
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.900
Zant versus Stevens is the first case I'd like to take a look at.

53
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:53.670
This is a case that sort of illustrates how the Georgia death penalty statute

54
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:53.941
work.

55
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:58.200
There were three aggravating circumstances alleged by the prosecutor murder with

56
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:03.201
a prior capital felony or a person with a prior history of a serious sexual,

57
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.583
uh,

58
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.453
assaults.

59
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.000
Uh,

60
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.833
the [inaudible].

61
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.010
This is the broad,

62
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.940
uh,

63
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.361
vile,

64
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:10.240
horrible inhuman.

65
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.090
The murderer was outrageously wantingly,

66
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:12.451
vile,

67
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:12.961
horrible,

68
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:13.794
and inhuman.

69
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.370
Uh,

70
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.080
and third mercy murder by a person who escaped from lawful custody.

71
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.950
Uh,

72
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.300
Zan argued that,

73
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.960
uh,

74
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.430
Fermin was violated,

75
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:24.080
uh,

76
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.040
because the jury had complete unbridled discretion once it found one of these

77
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:30.390
aggravating circumstances.

78
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.350
But it got even a little more complicated than that because when the case went

79
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:36.030
to the Georgia Supreme Court,

80
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.170
it struck,

81
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:37.261
well,

82
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:37.651
first of all,

83
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:40.560
the jury didn't find the middle circumstance,

84
00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:41.400
the B seven,

85
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:42.930
the outrageously wantonly vial,

86
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:43.890
Harbin and human.

87
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.820
It only found two when the case went to the Supreme Court of Georgia.

88
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.860
It found that one of those,

89
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.310
uh,

90
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.050
was unconstitutionally vague.

91
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:53.400
So it struck that down.

92
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.700
But it's still upheld Stephen's death sentence based on the one remaining

93
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:02.710
aggravating circumstance that had been submitted to the jury.

94
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.310
Uh,

95
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.290
Steven's challenges that he says,

96
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:06.124
first of all,

97
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.180
as I said before,

98
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:10.930
the jury has given complete discretion just like in Furman versus Georgia,

99
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:11.860
it can decide

100
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.620
to give death or life.

101
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:15.161
Uh,

102
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:15.601
and,

103
00:03:15.601 --> 00:03:16.660
and secondly,

104
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.370
he was worried that the jury may have given weight to that aggravating

105
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:25.780
circumstance that was later declared unconstitutional because the jury might

106
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:27.800
think logically if they're too,

107
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.800
that must be worse than having one.

108
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.100
And that might've contributed to his death since,

109
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.610
uh,

110
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.050
well the supreme court rejected that and an opinion by justice Stevens,

111
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.440
uh,

112
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.273
for,

113
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.820
uh,

114
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.960
seven justices.

115
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:44.500
The court asked Georgia to explain how the system worked.

116
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.850
And the Georgia Supreme Court wrote back or wrote an opinion that said,

117
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:49.684
basically,

118
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.980
we have a pyramid in which all the murders at the bottom of the pyramid.

119
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.881
Uh,

120
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:56.170
then there's some that are,

121
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.243
uh,

122
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.671
what,

123
00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:59.470
what Georgia calls malice murderer,

124
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.320
some that are in a second higher level.

125
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.900
And once a murderer's in that level,

126
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.560
if there is one or more aggravating circumstances,

127
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.660
it goes to the very top of the pyramid.

128
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.400
And there the jury has complete and absolute discretion to decide whether or not

129
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:16.360
to impose the death poem.

130
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.670
A lot of people thought when they said that,

131
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.910
that it did sound an awful lot like Fermin.

132
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.080
And that may be,

133
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.590
uh,

134
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.570
the Georgia death pony was in jeopardy.

135
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:26.410
Once again,

136
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.191
uh,

137
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:28.630
but the justices,

138
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:29.440
uh,

139
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.610
seven justices,

140
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.880
uh,

141
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.920
and in this opinion by justice Stevens,

142
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.371
uh,

143
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:35.920
embrace that and basically said,

144
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.700
uh,

145
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.720
that this,

146
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.100
uh,

147
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.151
scheme,

148
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:40.984
this pyramid,

149
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.823
uh,

150
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.020
system that Georgia had as long as no special weight is given to any one

151
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:48.400
aggravating factor.

152
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.271
Uh,

153
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:49.641
and there's,

154
00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:52.150
there's no weighing in Georgia we talked about before,

155
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:55.570
there's some states where they weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

156
00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:59.950
And Georgia is once an aggravating circumstances found,

157
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.360
the jury has complete discretion to impose whatever sentence it wants to.

158
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.733
Um,

159
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.930
and so what the court finds is that there is a narrowing that is the aggravating

160
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:15.370
circumstances narrowed the group of people who were eligible for the death

161
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:16.204
public.

162
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.440
And now we learned that's all the eighth amendment requires just simply

163
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.320
narrowing a Justice Marshall descents,

164
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.011
uh,

165
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:27.490
he points out that this is no different than Furman versus Georgia.

166
00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:30.610
Once the jury has reached that top level of the pyramid,

167
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:32.980
it has complete and unbridled discretion.

168
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.990
And he said the idea that we adopted in our 19,

169
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.060
uh,

170
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.320
76 cases,

171
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.011
uh,

172
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:46.120
was that the jury's discretion would be guided by clear and objective standards.

173
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.343
Um,

174
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.260
the court next takes us up in law and fell versus Phelps,

175
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.800
which is a case in which the same factor,

176
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.210
the guilt phase,

177
00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:57.070
the person was eligible for death.

178
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.290
If they killed or inflicted inflicted great bodily harm to more than one person,

179
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.300
then you go to the penalty phase.

180
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.811
Uh,

181
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:10.280
and that same factor is an aggravating factor at the penalty phase.

182
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.010
Uh,

183
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.400
law and fellows arguing this can't be right.

184
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:16.100
It can't be that you can duplicate a,

185
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:19.220
what's part of the crime at the guilt phase and make it an aggravating

186
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:23.600
circumstance at the penalty phase because it's sort of automatic aggravating

187
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:24.434
circumstance.

188
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.951
Again,

189
00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:25.730
the court says,

190
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.750
no problem with this as long as it narrows the class.

191
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.350
Uh,

192
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.131
Louisiana,

193
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:32.540
which is where this case came from,

194
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:37.541
could narrow the class at the guilt phase by making this capital murder or it

195
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:39.920
could do it at the penalty phase.

196
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.013
Um,

197
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.300
as long as the narrowing function was served,

198
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.051
uh,

199
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:45.884
the jury,

200
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.893
uh,

201
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.331
was,

202
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:49.550
was within the eighth amendment requirements,

203
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.971
uh,

204
00:06:49.971 --> 00:06:50.721
Justice Marshall,

205
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:53.750
again to sense for basically the same reason,

206
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:54.200
uh,

207
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.340
that he had before.

208
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.720
The other issue,

209
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.351
uh,

210
00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:57.830
that,

211
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.371
that is,

212
00:06:58.371 --> 00:06:59.204
uh,

213
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.040
we think about with these a aggravating circumstances is do they really narrow

214
00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:04.731
the class?

215
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:04.981
Do they,

216
00:07:04.981 --> 00:07:05.210
the,

217
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.660
the idea is that the death pony is reserved for the worst of the worst,

218
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.990
only for the most incorrigible offenders who commit the most heinous crimes.

219
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.351
Uh,

220
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:20.351
but yet almost every state has some kind of broad catchall aggravating factor,

221
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.273
uh,

222
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.330
in,

223
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.600
uh,

224
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.320
Georgia,

225
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.153
Virginia,

226
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.551
uh,

227
00:07:25.551 --> 00:07:28.130
whether the murder is outrageously wantonly,

228
00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:28.521
vile,

229
00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:29.001
horrible,

230
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:29.834
and inhuman,

231
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.501
uh,

232
00:07:30.501 --> 00:07:35.501
in that it involved torture a depravity of mind or an aggravated battery that

233
00:07:35.841 --> 00:07:40.700
actually gives you some individuals specific factors,

234
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.563
torture,

235
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.100
an aggravated battery.

236
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:43.610
Uh,

237
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.800
but a lot of the others like Florida and Oklahoma,

238
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:46.701
heinous,

239
00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:47.990
atrocious and cruel.

240
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:48.750
Well,

241
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:49.850
every murder is heinous,

242
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:51.140
atrocious and cruel.

243
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.220
So does that really limit who gets the death pony and who does not?

244
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:55.731
Uh,

245
00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:56.690
Arizona,

246
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.920
very similar,

247
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.660
especially heinous,

248
00:07:59.661 --> 00:08:03.110
cruel or deprived as opposed to cruel.

249
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:03.711
Uh,

250
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:07.820
and then Idaho has a circumstance which the court will look at utter disregard

251
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
for human life to these really narrow the class of people that can be sentenced

252
00:08:13.071 --> 00:08:13.470
to death.

253
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.800
The defendants who can get the death point well,

254
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:18.050
the court first seems to say yes,

255
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:18.531
uh,

256
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:19.550
and ultimately,

257
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:20.000
uh,

258
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.900
seems to,

259
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.280
uh,

260
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:21.770
uh,

261
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:22.850
back off from that,

262
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:23.290
uh,

263
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.650
Robert Godfrey's case,

264
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:25.371
uh,

265
00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:27.560
was a man who killed a terrible crime,

266
00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:31.070
killed both his wife and his mother-in-law by just coming in and shooting him

267
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:31.904
with a shotgun.

268
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.140
Only one aggravating circumstance was alleged by the prosecutor in that case.

269
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:39.350
And it was the outrageously wantonly vile,

270
00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:41.600
horrible end and human circumstance.

271
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.710
Uh,

272
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:43.910
there was no torture,

273
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.830
so there was no aggravated battery.

274
00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:46.101
That was,

275
00:08:46.101 --> 00:08:49.370
I said the two things where at least gives the jury,

276
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:50.721
you know,

277
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:54.080
particular crimes that are part of that aggravating circumstance.

278
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.320
Uh,

279
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.280
and so the jury is just given the words of the statute.

280
00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.133
Nothing more.

281
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.001
Uh,

282
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:02.640
Supreme Court reverses a justice.

283
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:04.980
Stewart writes the plurality opinion.

284
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:07.500
He's joined by Justice Blackmun Powell and Stevens.

285
00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:07.971
Uh,

286
00:09:07.971 --> 00:09:08.471
and then of course,

287
00:09:08.471 --> 00:09:11.910
the Brennan and Marshall Join based on their view that the death penalty is

288
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:13.380
always unconstitutional.

289
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:14.190
Uh,

290
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.990
but justice towards says a person of ordinary sensibilities is going to consider

291
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.380
any murder to be outrageous.

292
00:09:21.381 --> 00:09:21.550
Leap,

293
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:22.030
vile,

294
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.863
harban human.

295
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.900
He credits the Georgia Supreme Court with narrowing it in other cases,

296
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.591
uh,

297
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:33.060
that there has to be torture or there has to be aggravated battery or that it is

298
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:36.420
defined depravity of mind in a way,

299
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:37.171
uh,

300
00:09:37.171 --> 00:09:37.770
that,

301
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:38.340
uh,

302
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.210
means that,

303
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:39.931
uh,

304
00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:40.764
it's the,

305
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:41.840
uh,

306
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.710
mental state needed to commit either the torture or the aggravated battery,

307
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:48.120
which we don't have here.

308
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.680
And Robert Godfrey's case,

309
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.903
um,

310
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.960
the Georgia Supreme Court didn't do that in this case though,

311
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.580
when the case was on appeal,

312
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:57.010
uh,

313
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:59.250
the Georgia Supreme Court just simply affirmed it.

314
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:04.460
And the court says there's no principled way to distinguish this case in which

315
00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:07.350
the death penalty was imposed from the many cases.

316
00:10:07.351 --> 00:10:07.951
It was not.

317
00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:09.420
This is justice white.

318
00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:09.730
That's,

319
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:10.350
uh,

320
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:15.060
quoting from justice white's concurring opinion in Furman versus Georgia.

321
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:15.901
Uh,

322
00:10:15.901 --> 00:10:20.310
Justice Marshall joined by Justice Brennan a concur.

323
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:21.001
But once again,

324
00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:26.001
Justice Marshall makes the point that the jury must be instructed that the jury

325
00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:27.000
has to.

326
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:27.570
Uh,

327
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.080
he also disagrees that the Ma with the majority saying that,

328
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.530
uh,

329
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:35.070
the Georgia Supreme Court has limited this to a,

330
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:35.973
uh,

331
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.160
select a group of cases.

332
00:10:38.161 --> 00:10:43.161
He said it's applied to just about every case and then reminds the court of what

333
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.210
it had said and mcgautha versus California,

334
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:50.211
that it really is not possible to figure out what factors call for the death

335
00:10:50.281 --> 00:10:52.050
Poli and do not,

336
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:53.543
um,

337
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:54.720
uh,

338
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.880
chief justice burger to sense as if ever there is a,

339
00:10:57.881 --> 00:10:59.940
a horrible crime are hideous crime.

340
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.140
Even Godfrey himself,

341
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:01.740
uh,

342
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:02.071
said.

343
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:02.730
So.

344
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.400
Also what we see in the descending opinions here,

345
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.600
first from Burger,

346
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.710
the courts are not to second guess the jury's or the state courts.

347
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:11.281
Uh,

348
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:13.800
justice white joined by Justice Rehnquist.

349
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:14.640
Uh,

350
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.640
the Georgia Supreme Court has responsibly reviewed these cases and this is an

351
00:11:20.371 --> 00:11:23.550
unwarranted invasion in invasion into state law.

352
00:11:23.551 --> 00:11:24.121
Once again,

353
00:11:24.121 --> 00:11:28.590
this tension between what do we leave to the states and what does the Supreme

354
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.210
Court and the federal courts do,

355
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:30.811
uh,

356
00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:33.510
in terms of trying to a cabin,

357
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:34.344
the death penalty.

358
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:35.280
Uh,

359
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.380
the next case is Maynard versus Cartwright.

360
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.570
Here we have a Wayne state.

361
00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:39.811
Now,

362
00:11:39.811 --> 00:11:40.680
unlike Georgia,

363
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:45.690
we have a state in which the jury is total way the aggravating circumstances

364
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.670
against the mitigating circumstances.

365
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.390
And here the jury found too aggravating factors.

366
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.620
Great risk of death to more than one person and heinous,

367
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:55.150
atrocious and cruel.

368
00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.550
And they found that those two aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating

369
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:01.384
factors.

370
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:02.501
Very interesting.

371
00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:07.501
Justice white who had filed a descent and Godfrey is now writing for seven

372
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:09.790
members of the court,

373
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.140
uh,

374
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:11.951
with a concurrence.

375
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:13.930
It says basically unanimous opinion.

376
00:12:13.931 --> 00:12:15.730
Justice Brennan and Marshall Concur,

377
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:16.511
he says,

378
00:12:16.511 --> 00:12:19.230
Godfrey controls this case got reversed.

379
00:12:19.231 --> 00:12:20.064
This Georgia,

380
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:20.690
uh,

381
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.830
there's no narrowing of this term,

382
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.401
heinous,

383
00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:25.690
atrocious and cruel.

384
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:26.680
Uh,

385
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.600
so they don't adequately informed the jury of what it's supposed to find.

386
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:32.550
Uh,

387
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:37.550
the Dustin's is not saved like it was in Zahn versus Stevens by the other

388
00:12:38.561 --> 00:12:42.790
aggravating factor because here the jury weights in Georgia,

389
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:45.510
as long as there was one valid aggravating factor,

390
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.050
the jury could consider it a death.

391
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.010
But in,

392
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:48.281
uh,

393
00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:48.821
Oklahoma,

394
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:51.790
the jury ways and if one of those factors is invalid,

395
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.810
then that means either you have to go back and,

396
00:12:54.811 --> 00:12:57.580
and the state has to go back and try the case again.

397
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:02.660
Or maybe in some states that the state supreme court can,

398
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.670
can reweigh.

399
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.450
Uh,

400
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.410
so we get into this,

401
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:06.263
uh,

402
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:09.460
sort of discussion of the weighing and non wing states,

403
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:09.820
uh,

404
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.653
at this point.

405
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.090
And we'll come back to that in just a minute.

406
00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:14.470
In Brown versus Sanders,

407
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:15.693
uh,

408
00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.150
in,

409
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.170
in two cases,

410
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:18.100
out of Arizona,

411
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:18.851
uh,

412
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:21.010
Walton versus Arizona and,

413
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.340
uh,

414
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.480
Louis versus Jeffrey's,

415
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.201
uh,

416
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:28.150
the court looks at Arizona's especially a heinous,

417
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:28.901
cruel,

418
00:13:28.901 --> 00:13:29.860
or depraved,

419
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.420
a aggravating factor.

420
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:32.081
Again,

421
00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:34.360
the challenge that it's so broad,

422
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:38.170
it doesn't really narrow the class of people eligible for the death penalty.

423
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:43.030
The court looks to how the Arizona Supreme Court has construed this or has

424
00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:46.150
applied this in cases it finds that it has said,

425
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:51.390
especially cruel applies to cases where the defendant suffered mental anguish

426
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:57.690
and especially deprived applies where the defendant relishes or had a sense of

427
00:13:58.541 --> 00:13:59.374
pleasure,

428
00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:00.281
uh,

429
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:01.114
from,

430
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:01.600
uh,

431
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.081
the,

432
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:02.320
uh,

433
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.070
murder,

434
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:03.520
uh,

435
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.540
indicating the basement or perversion on the part of the person.

436
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.320
Uh,

437
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.280
based upon these,

438
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.730
uh,

439
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.110
narrowing constructions.

440
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:11.600
Uh,

441
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.790
the court upholds,

442
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:13.480
uh,

443
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:13.781
the,

444
00:14:13.781 --> 00:14:14.740
that statute.

445
00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:16.600
And then we come to a Ravi versus Creech,

446
00:14:16.601 --> 00:14:17.490
which is the I,

447
00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:17.980
uh,

448
00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:22.000
Idaho Supreme Court talking about its utter disregard,

449
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:23.950
a aggravating factor,

450
00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.510
utter disregard for human life.

451
00:14:25.511 --> 00:14:30.511
Why wouldn't anybody who commits a murder show utter disregard for human life?

452
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:31.810
Uh,

453
00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.630
the Idaho Supreme Court says this is the highest,

454
00:14:34.631 --> 00:14:35.590
the utmost,

455
00:14:35.591 --> 00:14:38.140
the most callous disregard for human life.

456
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.310
The cold blooded pitiless slayer,

457
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:42.250
uh,

458
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:43.570
who kills without,

459
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.230
uh,

460
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.640
feeling or sympathy.

461
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:46.953
Um,

462
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:47.920
uh,

463
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.371
again,

464
00:14:48.371 --> 00:14:49.360
the question becomes,

465
00:14:49.361 --> 00:14:50.081
in these cases,

466
00:14:50.081 --> 00:14:55.081
are we just on adjectives one after another or are we really distinguishing some

467
00:14:57.081 --> 00:15:02.030
groups of murders as being more aggravated than some others?

468
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:02.930
Uh,

469
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:03.531
court says,

470
00:15:03.531 --> 00:15:05.030
not all Idaho,

471
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.780
uh,

472
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.261
murders.

473
00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:06.861
I like this.

474
00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:07.940
They're not all cold blooded.

475
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:08.774
They're not all,

476
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:09.470
uh,

477
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.120
without feeling or sympathy.

478
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:11.661
Uh,

479
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:13.160
and the Supreme Court of the United States,

480
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:18.170
a majority of the court at least says this narrows the class of people a

481
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.490
sufficiently,

482
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:20.121
uh,

483
00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:20.900
that,

484
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.733
uh,

485
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.500
it,

486
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.470
it passes constitutional muster.

487
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:25.610
Notice here,

488
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.810
it's not that the jury had these definitions in these cases.

489
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.021
Well,

490
00:15:30.021 --> 00:15:32.450
in Arizona was the judge sentencing state at the time.

491
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:33.050
Uh,

492
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:33.591
but in,

493
00:15:33.591 --> 00:15:33.861
in,

494
00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:34.694
in Idaho,

495
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:39.830
it's that the state supreme court can provide a construction,

496
00:15:39.831 --> 00:15:44.390
can narrow it on appeal from the trial court's decision.

497
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:45.230
Uh,

498
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.063
something,

499
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:46.490
uh,

500
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:46.941
that,

501
00:15:46.941 --> 00:15:47.421
uh,

502
00:15:47.421 --> 00:15:49.040
is somewhat controversial.

503
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:50.240
Uh,

504
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.560
finally we come to a brown,

505
00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:52.400
uh,

506
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.390
versus Sanders,

507
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:53.751
uh,

508
00:15:53.751 --> 00:15:57.440
which is a case which in some way it takes away a lot of what we've been talking

509
00:15:57.441 --> 00:15:58.274
about.

510
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.581
Uh,

511
00:15:58.581 --> 00:15:59.580
in California,

512
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.160
jury must first find eligibility factors at the guilt phase.

513
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:04.611
As we know,

514
00:16:04.611 --> 00:16:06.680
there are two phases to any death pony case.

515
00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:06.981
First,

516
00:16:06.981 --> 00:16:10.010
the question of can the death only be imposed or not?

517
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.060
And then secondly,

518
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.163
uh,

519
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.160
what's sentenced life imprisonment without the possibility of release or the

520
00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:16.994
death pony.

521
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:17.781
Uh,

522
00:16:17.781 --> 00:16:18.471
in this case,

523
00:16:18.471 --> 00:16:22.580
the jury found four factors at the guilt phase robbery,

524
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.380
a burglary,

525
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:29.660
a which was later declared invalid by the California Supreme Court witness

526
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:30.620
elimination.

527
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:31.370
Uh,

528
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:32.540
and finally the heinous,

529
00:16:32.541 --> 00:16:37.100
atrocious and cruel circumstance just like the one that Florida and Oklahoma

530
00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:37.750
hat,

531
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:37.941
uh,

532
00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:39.950
that also is declared invalid,

533
00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:40.580
uh,

534
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.520
by the California Supreme Court in its review,

535
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.043
uh,

536
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.870
after the jury comes back with a finding of guilty,

537
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.440
it's told to weigh these factors and the circumstances of the crime,

538
00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:56.960
the background of the defendant and determine penalty.

539
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.011
Uh,

540
00:16:58.011 --> 00:17:02.090
and so after the California Supreme Court finds the burglary in the heinous,

541
00:17:02.091 --> 00:17:04.040
atrocious and cruel to be invalid,

542
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.050
the argument is,

543
00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:06.670
uh,

544
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.510
but because these are invalid,

545
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.760
the death pony can no longer stand.

546
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.761
Uh,

547
00:17:11.761 --> 00:17:15.020
and the supreme court has been treating these differently.

548
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.860
Uh,

549
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.090
the weighing states,

550
00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:17.990
uh,

551
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.250
states like Oklahoma,

552
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:19.850
uh,

553
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.940
where you weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

554
00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:26.630
The court has said that if one is invalid,

555
00:17:26.631 --> 00:17:28.850
if one aggravating factor is invalid,

556
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.900
that skews the process and therefore you have to either go back and do it again.

557
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.040
Or as I said earlier,

558
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.960
the State Supreme Court has to do it.

559
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.560
Uh,

560
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.080
but in the non weighing states like Georgia,

561
00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:39.771
uh,

562
00:17:39.771 --> 00:17:42.470
the death pony is only set aside a,

563
00:17:42.471 --> 00:17:46.520
if the jury could draw an adverse inference,

564
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:51.150
a from some constitutionally protected activity that somehow labeled an

565
00:17:51.151 --> 00:17:56.151
aggravating factor or a considerations of the aggravating factor allowed the

566
00:17:56.701 --> 00:18:00.220
jury to consider evidence that otherwise wouldn't have been before.

567
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.200
So Justice Scalia takes these and decides,

568
00:18:04.201 --> 00:18:08.850
now we're going to eliminate the distinction between the weighing states and the

569
00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:12.840
non wink states and we're going to look at what evidence was admitted so that

570
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:15.540
even if an aggravating factor is invalid,

571
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.510
the court can still uphold the death sentence.

572
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.640
And so the question is,

573
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:21.870
was the evidence,

574
00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:22.530
uh,

575
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:23.670
properly admitted?

576
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:24.601
In other words,

577
00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:28.200
the evidence may have come in for any number of reasons and then the jury may

578
00:18:28.201 --> 00:18:32.820
have been told about these in California what are called special circumstances

579
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.540
and what in most of the countries called aggravating circumstance,

580
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.650
uh,

581
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:42.300
if the invalid aggravating factor allowed evidence that wouldn't have otherwise

582
00:18:42.301 --> 00:18:43.500
come before the jury,

583
00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:44.881
uh,

584
00:18:44.881 --> 00:18:45.714
or,

585
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:47.030
uh,

586
00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.810
then that's a due process violation.

587
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:50.010
Uh,

588
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:54.210
so if there's an invalid aggravating circumstance that lets some evidence that

589
00:18:54.211 --> 00:18:56.160
wouldn't otherwise be before the jury come in,

590
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.680
that would require the case to be set aside.

591
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.053
Um,

592
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:01.170
also,

593
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.160
um,

594
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:07.160
if the factor added in an improper element to the balancing stage,

595
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.220
uh,

596
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.053
then,

597
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:09.631
uh,

598
00:19:09.631 --> 00:19:10.021
the,

599
00:19:10.021 --> 00:19:12.330
that would be a improper,

600
00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:15.270
but unless one of those things happens,

601
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:16.141
uh,

602
00:19:16.141 --> 00:19:16.441
the,

603
00:19:16.441 --> 00:19:18.330
the court can just simply affirm,

604
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.600
even though there's an invalid aggravating circumstances,

605
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.060
other justices would take a different approach.

606
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:28.080
Stevens and Souter say this is not just about eligibility,

607
00:19:28.081 --> 00:19:30.720
but it's about how you impose the death pony.

608
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:31.861
Uh,

609
00:19:31.861 --> 00:19:32.671
if you,

610
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:36.310
the non weighing states a finding of four,

611
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.280
four aggravating factors ought to be,

612
00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.000
uh,

613
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.120
have greater legal significance than a finding of three.

614
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:42.781
Uh,

615
00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:44.010
in the weighing states,

616
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:44.641
uh,

617
00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:45.360
the,

618
00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:45.870
uh,

619
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:46.681
ag weighted,

620
00:19:46.681 --> 00:19:48.660
the aggravating factors determined sin.

621
00:19:48.661 --> 00:19:50.190
So if one of them is invalid,

622
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.280
then that would be presumptively harmful.

623
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:53.691
This is,

624
00:19:53.691 --> 00:19:55.800
this is not the majority opinion.

625
00:19:55.801 --> 00:19:56.670
This is just what,

626
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.270
uh,

627
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.661
the,

628
00:19:57.661 --> 00:19:59.490
these two justices think.

629
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.021
Uh,

630
00:20:00.021 --> 00:20:00.870
and then justice,

631
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:01.320
uh,

632
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.430
Bryer and Ginsburg,

633
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:03.150
uh,

634
00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:06.720
would not make a distinction between the wing and non wing states.

635
00:20:06.721 --> 00:20:07.800
They would simply say,

636
00:20:07.801 --> 00:20:11.040
if there is an invalid aggravating factor,

637
00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.150
uh,

638
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.090
then you just look to see if it was harmless or not.

639
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.111
Uh,

640
00:20:16.111 --> 00:20:17.250
and that would be,

641
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.210
uh,

642
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:19.500
how did it affect,

643
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:20.101
uh,

644
00:20:20.101 --> 00:20:20.341
the,

645
00:20:20.341 --> 00:20:23.640
either the wing or the decision making process of the jury?

646
00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:24.510
Uh,

647
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.920
they say this is about,

648
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:26.490
uh,

649
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:31.490
the importance that the jury attaches to admissible evidence at the end of the

650
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:32.880
day.

651
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.570
Uh,

652
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:37.170
we see this about a aggravating circumstances.

653
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.303
Uh,

654
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.400
the court backs off of its earlier language about clearly guiding the discretion

655
00:20:43.831 --> 00:20:48.831
of the jury and talks about it must genuinely narrow the class of people who can

656
00:20:48.971 --> 00:20:49.810
get the death Poli.

657
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.951
Uh,

658
00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:55.951
the State Supreme Court can narrow it by the way that it could construes the

659
00:20:58.451 --> 00:21:00.460
aggravating factor when it's on appeal.

660
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.730
Now this is despite the language and Maynard versus Cartwright,

661
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:05.050
that seemed to say,

662
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:05.650
uh,

663
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:10.650
that the jury's had to be advised with regard to the definition of these heinous

664
00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:16.330
crochets and cruel or other catch all aggravating circumstances.

665
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.530
Um,

666
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:18.363
but,

667
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:19.953
um,

668
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.590
the federal court is not going to be able to do much if the state supreme court

669
00:21:23.591 --> 00:21:24.424
has limited it.

670
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.510
But finally,

671
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:26.141
uh,

672
00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:28.600
we see there's going to be little chance of reversal,

673
00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:29.050
uh,

674
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:30.340
regardless of that.

675
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:31.001
Uh,

676
00:21:31.001 --> 00:21:33.630
because of the Supreme Court's decision,

677
00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:38.260
Brown vs Sanders as a completely different kind of aggravating factor,

678
00:21:38.261 --> 00:21:40.330
which we'll take up in the next segment.

679
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:41.050
Uh,

680
00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:42.220
future dangerousness,

681
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:42.791
uh,

682
00:21:42.791 --> 00:21:45.370
which is used in Texas and some other states.
