1
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.320
My guest is penny white.

2
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.350
Professor at the University of Tennessee College of law.

3
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.380
Uh,

4
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.030
justice wider was justice wide on the Tennessee Supreme Court.

5
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:22.920
Started out in Johnson City,

6
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:23.461
Tennessee,

7
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:24.750
which is where she grew up.

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.290
I was elected to the trial court there and presided over,

9
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:28.800
uh,

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.150
all kinds of cases,

11
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:32.160
criminal and civil as a trial judge.

12
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.450
But in a very short time,

13
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:37.440
she was appointed by the governor of Tennessee to the intermediate appellate

14
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:38.260
court.

15
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.460
Uh,

16
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.850
that's the court between the trial court and the Tennessee Supreme Court.

17
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.930
She served there and then was appointed to the Tennessee Supreme Court.

18
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.710
Uh,

19
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.810
she was about to become the first,

20
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.680
uh,

21
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.680
woman chief justice in the history of Tennessee,

22
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.550
uh,

23
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.020
when there was a campaign,

24
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.560
uh,

25
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.393
to,

26
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.610
uh,

27
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.160
prevent her retention on the ballot as a justice of the,

28
00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:00.994
of the court.

29
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.430
And we've asked justice white professor white to come and talk with us about,

30
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.941
uh,

31
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:07.650
issues of judicial independence.

32
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.401
Uh,

33
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.980
and maybe just tell us a little bit about what happened,

34
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.930
uh,

35
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.430
when you thought you were on the ballot,

36
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.400
didn't anticipate any problems and what happened?

37
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.820
<v 2>Well the best way to describe it as a perfect storm,</v>

38
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.790
I found myself as the loan candidate on the ballot.

39
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.520
That's because I was serving an unexpired term.

40
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:28.260
So that's the way it works in Tennessee.

41
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.610
So an easy target.

42
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.720
Um,

43
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.720
the campaign against me began six weeks to the day of the retention race.

44
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.380
So an unexpected,

45
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.071
uh,

46
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:38.761
development,

47
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:40.500
which we weren't prepared to,

48
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:41.334
um,

49
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.390
to counter.

50
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.613
And the,

51
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.430
the surrogate,

52
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.111
the what,

53
00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:48.030
what the opponents used was a capital case,

54
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:52.770
a case in which air court had remanded for a new sentencing based on a really

55
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:57.300
fundamental evidence ruling that was incorrect as well as a,

56
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.661
uh,

57
00:01:57.661 --> 00:01:59.790
an interpretation of state law.

58
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.180
We had remanded that capital case for new sentencing.

59
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.480
And that case was used by my opposition to paint me as a soft on crime anti

60
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:16.380
death penalty judge and to convince the voters really that the only way to have

61
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:20.280
capital punishment in Tennessee would be to remove me from the bench.

62
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.910
Um,

63
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.750
ironically it was the first capital case as an appellate judge that I had ever

64
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.540
sat on at that level.

65
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.231
Uh,

66
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:29.010
so,

67
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.850
so really the,

68
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.660
the caricature that they painted of me was a false one,

69
00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:35.550
but it certainly was one that stuck.

70
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.380
<v 1>Now when you sue is in Christ,</v>

71
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:40.770
you meant the trial judge's ruling was incorrect and that's why the court,

72
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.200
one of the two reasons the court set aside,

73
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.900
<v 2>right?</v>

74
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.171
The,

75
00:02:44.171 --> 00:02:47.290
the trial judge's ruling was incorrect on an evidence matter.

76
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.270
Basically just,

77
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:49.120
just letting,

78
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.660
um,

79
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.650
in a capital case,

80
00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:54.640
of course the jury has the right to know the good and the bad about a person

81
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:56.200
whose life is in their hands.

82
00:02:56.201 --> 00:02:57.430
And in this particular case,

83
00:02:57.431 --> 00:02:58.690
the judge had excluded,

84
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.010
uh,

85
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.710
about some of the mitigating circumstances.

86
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.140
And so that was one of the reasons for saying,

87
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.180
for our court saying that the case needed to go back for a new sentencing wasn't

88
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:12.790
that the court was setting aside the death sentence.

89
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.950
It was just that the court was telling the trial,

90
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:15.281
judge,

91
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:16.360
you made a mistake.

92
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.370
Now let's try this case fairly.

93
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.600
But rather than portray the case in that light,

94
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.840
the opposition and those who wanted to remove me from the bench portrayed it as

95
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:33.061
if it were a stance against capital punishment per se in Tennessee had had not

96
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.060
executed.

97
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.320
Many people at that time had not executed anyone really since forming versus

98
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.960
Georgia came down for the United States Supreme Court.

99
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.060
And so people were a little antsy.

100
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:51.061
We had almost a hundred inmates on death row and there was a contingency of

101
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.490
individuals who wanted to see,

102
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:55.331
uh,

103
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:58.120
the death penalty working more quickly.

104
00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.630
Uh,

105
00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.530
and so it was an,

106
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.610
an easy,

107
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.690
a emotional issue for those who wanted to remove me from the bench to latch

108
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.483
onto.

109
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.970
Uh,

110
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.350
it,

111
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.100
it,

112
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.840
it plays not only in my case,

113
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:13.330
but in other cases where we've seen judges around the country,

114
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:14.800
it plays on people's fear,

115
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.390
on their anxiety,

116
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.610
and it's very hard to stand up and,

117
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.211
uh,

118
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:21.970
run against that kind of rhetoric,

119
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.420
uh,

120
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.840
because if you say that you intend to be fair,

121
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.500
uh,

122
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.940
very often that is misread or misheard as being soft on crime.

123
00:04:30.941 --> 00:04:31.840
And once,

124
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.720
once you get labeled with a soft on crime label,

125
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:36.250
it is very hard,

126
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.060
uh,

127
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.890
to get rid of it.

128
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.190
And case in point in,

129
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:44.191
in my situation I had decided hundreds of appellate decisions and if you looked

130
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:49.531
at them and can kind of categorize them into which ones I had sided with the

131
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:52.360
defendant and which ones I had sided with the,

132
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.740
with the prosecution,

133
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.070
the overwhelming number way over three quarters,

134
00:04:57.071 --> 00:05:02.071
approximately 85% of the time I had agreed with the state yet this one case,

135
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.710
uh,

136
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.031
was,

137
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:04.360
uh,

138
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.193
was,

139
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.540
was what was used to paint me as the,

140
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.450
as the soft on crime judge.

141
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.330
And it's such an actually she didn't reverse the conviction.

142
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.253
Exactly.

143
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.591
No,

144
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:19.030
the conviction stood and the only thing that the court did was remand the case

145
00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:24.031
for a new Senate saying the capitol proceeding being a bifurcated or two step

146
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:25.210
process.

147
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.901
Uh,

148
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:29.420
so we only reversed it four or remanded it rather for,

149
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.940
for a re sentencing.

150
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.050
Um,

151
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.450
the individual was against sentence to death.

152
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:34.750
And,

153
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.871
uh,

154
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:35.291
again,

155
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:39.760
ironically the case went back up on appeal several years after I had left the

156
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:40.594
bench.

157
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.630
The court reversed it again and this time without any publicity or public outcry

158
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.541
at all,

159
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:51.541
which just further confirms that the case was basically just being used to

160
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:55.270
manipulate the public in that election.

161
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.290
Now since the time you've taught,

162
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.070
you continue to

163
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.870
<v 1>teach with the judicial college,</v>

164
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:04.370
you teach judges and Tennessee and you've also talked a lot about judicial

165
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:04.941
independence.

166
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:06.710
Do you see this sort of thing going on,

167
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.470
uh,

168
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.220
in other parts of the country and another judicial races?

169
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.590
<v 2>Unfortunately it is,</v>

170
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.270
it is all too common.

171
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.080
Um,

172
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.080
and I think what is really important to communicate is that while crime may be

173
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.801
the,

174
00:06:20.801 --> 00:06:21.430
um,

175
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.750
the story or the topic that is used to attack a judicial candidate,

176
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.590
it is rarely what the opposition is really interested in.

177
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.180
Most often these,

178
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.960
these types of campaigns are waged by big dollar interest,

179
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.890
um,

180
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.600
sometimes by insurance companies,

181
00:06:37.601 --> 00:06:41.560
sometimes by special interest groups that have agendas related to family law

182
00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:42.394
issues.

183
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.760
But those issues are harder to ignite and fuel and anger and scare the

184
00:06:49.241 --> 00:06:50.140
electorate with.

185
00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:55.141
So crime is used as as the surrogate and often a judge,

186
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.191
any judge,

187
00:06:57.191 --> 00:06:58.450
any appellate judge who's,

188
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.200
who's done her job will have reversed cases.

189
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.530
Judges,

190
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.300
trial judges make mistakes,

191
00:07:04.301 --> 00:07:06.040
prosecutors make mistakes.

192
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.420
The law changes.

193
00:07:07.421 --> 00:07:12.130
And the appellate courts are there for that very purpose to make sure that that

194
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.630
errors are corrected.

195
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.230
So any judge who sat on the bench for anytime at all,

196
00:07:17.231 --> 00:07:22.231
we'll have had a case or two or 10 or 20 in which they have fighted with the

197
00:07:23.381 --> 00:07:24.250
accused.

198
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.510
And so it's very easy to pluck those individual cases and,

199
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.790
and really magnify them and make them,

200
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.000
make them look like they are the whole of the judge's record.

201
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.360
And once a judge gets attacked on an issue like that,

202
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.100
trying to respond,

203
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.550
it puts you on the defensive,

204
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.640
makes you look like you're making excuses or trying to distance yourself from

205
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:48.640
the decisions,

206
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.570
but you aren't.

207
00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:52.750
You're simply trying to get the public to look at your entire record.

208
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:53.590
So it's,

209
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:54.423
it's so,

210
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.290
so to be more direct to your question,

211
00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:56.591
yes,

212
00:07:56.591 --> 00:07:57.940
it's happening all too.

213
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:02.800
All too frequently and it's often happening in just the way it happened.

214
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.730
In my case only with millions and millions of dollars now,

215
00:08:06.731 --> 00:08:08.020
which was not something that,

216
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.790
that I had to contend with.

217
00:08:09.791 --> 00:08:14.791
Judges today are finding themselves having to work while they're on the bench to

218
00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:17.080
stay on the bitch at the next election,

219
00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:18.550
building up a war chest,

220
00:08:18.551 --> 00:08:19.750
building up support,

221
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.650
which obviously is taking their attention away from their duties.

222
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.220
Uh,

223
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:24.791
and so it,

224
00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:25.181
it is,

225
00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:25.480
uh,

226
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:25.910
it is,

227
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.290
uh,

228
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.130
a serious threat to the independence of the judiciary into the separateness of

229
00:08:30.131 --> 00:08:32.020
the judicial branch of government.

230
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.400
<v 1>And how does it affect the judges who remain on the bench?</v>

231
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:40.810
The cases that have people voted off are usually criminal cases.

232
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:44.860
So the courts sitting on a controversial criminal case.

233
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:46.170
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

234
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:47.003
Huh.

235
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.391
Well,

236
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:48.224
I mean,

237
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.670
I think just just from a point of view of,

238
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:53.990
of practicality,

239
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.950
even given the judge a judge with the utmost integrity,

240
00:08:59.010 --> 00:08:59.161
uh,

241
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:03.810
judge who's trying her best to be ethical and to follow the rule of law,

242
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.120
there is that nagging,

243
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.240
nagging thought in the back of her head that what will happen if I decide the

244
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:14.970
case in this way?

245
00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.310
I don't want to be heard to say that.

246
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:20.370
I think all judges compromise themselves in that way.

247
00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:20.970
I don't,

248
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.650
I think many struggle daily,

249
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:23.221
not too.

250
00:09:23.221 --> 00:09:27.270
And I think the best judges are those who take the bench and say,

251
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:32.271
I'm going to rule correctly every day that I'm here and if I'm removed for rule

252
00:09:32.391 --> 00:09:32.941
incorrectly,

253
00:09:32.941 --> 00:09:33.810
so be it.

254
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:34.470
But,

255
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.400
but when a judge takes the bench in this and gives up a law practice,

256
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:40.110
gives up a lucrative career,

257
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.370
has family,

258
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:41.781
uh,

259
00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:42.040
and,

260
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.770
and wants to build a pension,

261
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:45.690
wants to build a retirement and,

262
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.440
uh,

263
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:46.890
uh,

264
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:47.131
you know,

265
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:48.450
tenure on the court,

266
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.660
that idea of deciding cases consistent with the public will and not inconsistent

267
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:56.790
with some special interest groups agenda,

268
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:57.451
uh,

269
00:09:57.451 --> 00:09:57.990
can,

270
00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.150
can definitely influence decision making.

271
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.870
<v 1>And very often these like,</v>

272
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.051
oh,

273
00:10:03.051 --> 00:10:03.741
let's take the,

274
00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:04.850
not too long ago,

275
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.103
uh,

276
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:07.460
just justice,

277
00:10:07.461 --> 00:10:07.820
uh,

278
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.730
Kilbride was on the ballot in Illinois,

279
00:10:10.731 --> 00:10:11.061
again,

280
00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:11.821
like your election,

281
00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:13.040
it was a retention election.

282
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:18.860
That election was really about a vote he had made in a case about punitive

283
00:10:18.861 --> 00:10:20.870
damages are limits on damages.

284
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:21.501
Uh,

285
00:10:21.501 --> 00:10:23.060
but the campaign was mostly about,

286
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.020
uh,

287
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.430
criminal cases that he had set up.

288
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:26.421
<v 2>Right.</v>

289
00:10:26.421 --> 00:10:26.661
And,

290
00:10:26.661 --> 00:10:27.220
and in,

291
00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.340
in a couple of,

292
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:31.670
of of observations about that race as well.

293
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.480
You mentioned that it was a retention race where the voters simply have to vote

294
00:10:35.481 --> 00:10:36.314
yes or no.

295
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.240
And in the past,

296
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:38.840
uh,

297
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.390
not,

298
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.520
not the distant past.

299
00:10:40.521 --> 00:10:45.260
In the early two thousands and certainly in the 1990s when we talked about money

300
00:10:45.261 --> 00:10:46.310
in judicial campaigns,

301
00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:51.170
we generally we're talking about money being spent in states that had partisan

302
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:55.300
judicial elections so that the political parties would be involved in racing and

303
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.730
great deal of money lawyers and business interests would raise a great deal of

304
00:10:58.731 --> 00:10:59.360
money.

305
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.680
But what we've seen is that this money is now infiltrating not only partisan

306
00:11:03.681 --> 00:11:06.530
judicial races where it might be somewhat more expected,

307
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.220
but also nonpartisan judicial races and retention races.

308
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.560
And when you're running a retention race,

309
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.690
you're running against nobody.

310
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:19.750
So the only thing the opposition has to do is put a black mark on you and then

311
00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:23.120
the public really when they vote,

312
00:11:23.121 --> 00:11:23.954
no,

313
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:24.500
they're,

314
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.400
they're not.

315
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.930
There's not a way to compare your credentials or your experience or your

316
00:11:29.931 --> 00:11:31.790
background with another candidate.

317
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
You're running against this great idea that whoever takes the bench after you

318
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:42.110
won't have whatever the fault is that the opposition has tried to suggest you

319
00:11:42.111 --> 00:11:42.501
have.

320
00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:43.070
So,

321
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.060
so it's a harder rice to,

322
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.190
to run really,

323
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.581
uh,

324
00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:50.060
even though you only have to get yes votes.

325
00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:50.771
Uh,

326
00:11:50.771 --> 00:11:53.470
additionally on the justice Kilbride situations,

327
00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:53.681
I mean,

328
00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:55.330
thankfully he was able to,

329
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.020
to win his election with millions,

330
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:01.780
literally more than more than $2 million spent.

331
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:02.680
But,

332
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.680
but the public believed that they were voting on that they were led to believe

333
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:12.640
by the commercials that they were voting based upon his record on criminal

334
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:13.181
cases.

335
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:14.260
As you suggested,

336
00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:14.690
the,

337
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:15.730
the advertisements,

338
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:18.260
which I think maybe in maybe in the material,

339
00:12:18.261 --> 00:12:20.620
certainly people can find those advertisements are,

340
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.370
are,

341
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:21.820
are,

342
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.660
are scary,

343
00:12:22.661 --> 00:12:23.140
are,

344
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.270
are threatening and frightening and,

345
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.373
and really,

346
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:26.890
um,

347
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:27.820
it's tasteless,

348
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.620
just really tasteless.

349
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:34.890
But the real reason that the money was spent against justice Kilbride was

350
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:40.270
because insurance companies disagreed with a ruling that he made in a tort case.

351
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.190
And very often tort cases,

352
00:12:42.191 --> 00:12:46.270
limits on damages are the issues that bring out the money.

353
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.910
And most of the ways that public gets their information about judges when

354
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:53.740
they're up for his 32nd

355
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:55.960
yeah,

356
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.540
there are states that are doing a lot to,

357
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.340
to do better than that,

358
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.580
but the public has to put forth a little bit of effort.

359
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:04.691
For example,

360
00:13:04.691 --> 00:13:07.390
a number of states do have voter guides.

361
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.890
A number of states have what are called judicial performance evaluation systems

362
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:16.891
where judges who were on the bench are evaluated based upon criteria that is

363
00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:18.520
essential to judging,

364
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:22.990
not based upon political stances or philosophies.

365
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.180
And so these,

366
00:13:24.181 --> 00:13:24.610
um,

367
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.260
evaluations are then produced in voter guides,

368
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:27.810
uh,

369
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:28.643
of different,

370
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.970
of different lengths and different types.

371
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:35.970
And in some states they're available on a website for the state judicial branch.

372
00:13:36.761 --> 00:13:37.571
In other states,

373
00:13:37.571 --> 00:13:38.091
I will ask her,

374
00:13:38.091 --> 00:13:38.741
for example,

375
00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:40.660
they're mailed to every household.

376
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.960
So if the public will go to the internet or receives one of these voter guides

377
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:47.480
and we'll take the time to,

378
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.401
to read.

379
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:49.540
In some of those states,

380
00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:51.430
there is more information available.

381
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.100
But what studies tell us is that,

382
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:54.761
you know,

383
00:13:54.761 --> 00:13:55.490
the,

384
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:56.110
the,

385
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.500
I mean,

386
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.490
what we're doing right now,

387
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.450
the media,

388
00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.500
the media works,

389
00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:00.550
the publicity works,

390
00:14:00.551 --> 00:14:01.810
that commercials work.

391
00:14:01.811 --> 00:14:02.950
And if you look at the,

392
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:07.900
at the quadrupling amount of money that's been spent in judicial races in the

393
00:14:07.901 --> 00:14:08.800
last 10 years,

394
00:14:08.801 --> 00:14:11.530
you'll see that that's where that money is going there,

395
00:14:11.531 --> 00:14:15.730
raising money in order to run more television advertisements and television

396
00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:16.451
advertisements,

397
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:20.860
which used to never be used in judicial racist or only in the most rare cases

398
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.550
are now almost mandatory if you're going to seek and appellate,

399
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:24.820
uh,

400
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.653
position,

401
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:26.320
um,

402
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.370
on a state court.

403
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.870
So more money,

404
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.490
more television advertisement,

405
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:35.910
basically crowding out the messages that might be more salient about what is

406
00:14:36.761 --> 00:14:38.050
important about a judge.

407
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:38.890
Um,

408
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:39.340
but,

409
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.280
but an a voter who wants to be informed,

410
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:43.900
who will dig around a little bit,

411
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.090
can get more meaningful information.

412
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:51.420
It's just that it's easier to get to absorb the information that's right there

413
00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:57.260
in front of you on your television set on the 32nd and the 32nd answer,

414
00:14:57.261 --> 00:14:58.160
often much more,

415
00:14:58.161 --> 00:14:58.994
um,

416
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.780
uh,

417
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.860
interest provoking than a pamphlet that you get in the mail that tells you how

418
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:06.740
many cases judge Brown has decided in the last year.

419
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.020
<v 1>And of course there are lots of,</v>

420
00:15:08.021 --> 00:15:08.750
uh,

421
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.880
issues and a lot of candidates on the ballot.

422
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:15.710
So judges are just one of maybe 20 or 30 people running the election,

423
00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:16.180
right?

424
00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.530
<v 2>And not even in an,</v>

425
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.900
not even in different kinds of elections,

426
00:15:19.901 --> 00:15:21.190
but in some jurisdictions,

427
00:15:21.191 --> 00:15:21.821
large cities.

428
00:15:21.821 --> 00:15:22.654
For example,

429
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:23.320
um,

430
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.900
I come from Tennessee and in,

431
00:15:24.901 --> 00:15:28.120
in 2014 in Shelby County,

432
00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:31.540
you will be in judicial races alone.

433
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:36.570
You will be asked to vote on something like 70 candidates from the supreme court

434
00:15:36.851 --> 00:15:38.710
all the way down to the lower court judges,

435
00:15:38.711 --> 00:15:42.010
so like 70 different judicial offices alone,

436
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.220
and then add to that bow at all the other offices.

437
00:15:45.221 --> 00:15:46.054
So it's it,

438
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:51.100
it really does take a vigilant citizenry who cares about their courts,

439
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.000
uh,

440
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.211
to,

441
00:15:52.211 --> 00:15:54.540
to dig in and figure out who needs to be on the bed.

442
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:55.340
<v 1>Sure.</v>

443
00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:55.971
One last thing.

444
00:15:55.971 --> 00:16:00.971
With all the concern about money now in judicial elections about distortions in

445
00:16:01.131 --> 00:16:05.420
the ads and good people getting voted off the bench and people may be being a

446
00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:07.700
reluctant to be judges because of these things.

447
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:08.570
Uh,

448
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.160
do you see any prospect that,

449
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:10.820
uh,

450
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.800
electing judges will change in the near future in any places?

451
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:16.460
Well,

452
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:16.761
<v 2>you know,</v>

453
00:16:16.761 --> 00:16:21.740
there are lots of heavy weight people working on that issue.

454
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.633
Um,

455
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.980
Justice Sandra Day O'connor,

456
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:25.521
many,

457
00:16:25.521 --> 00:16:28.610
many former justices from state courts,

458
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.780
people all around the country working on the issue of reforming the way judges

459
00:16:32.781 --> 00:16:33.650
are selected.

460
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:38.950
And fortunately we haven't seen a trend in any state toward um,

461
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:44.330
changing the selection system to either a merit selection or uh,

462
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.600
a long term appointment renewal system.

463
00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:51.500
The what trends we have seen are in the other direction.

464
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:52.040
Um,

465
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.980
unfortunately I live in one of those states who has had a very,

466
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:55.580
uh,

467
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:59.660
very good merit based evaluation system for judges.

468
00:16:59.661 --> 00:17:04.661
And now the ideal is to take it to a completely politically controlled system

469
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:09.110
where the governor will appoint and the legislature will confirm so that the,

470
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:13.160
the idea that the judiciary is a third separate and independent branch of the

471
00:17:13.161 --> 00:17:15.170
government will basically be meaningless.

472
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.221
And there is a,

473
00:17:16.221 --> 00:17:17.600
another state Kansas,

474
00:17:17.601 --> 00:17:20.000
which is also considering that type of change.

475
00:17:20.001 --> 00:17:21.080
So we have not,

476
00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.940
we have not gotten any traction in getting states to change.

477
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.830
I have hope because I think that that for years,

478
00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:32.720
the money issues and the,

479
00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:32.901
the,

480
00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:36.350
the large amount of money being spent in the negative campaigning with

481
00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.370
centralized in about six to eight states and now it's spreading.

482
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.900
And I hope that as people see the results and ramifications of that kind of

483
00:17:44.901 --> 00:17:49.160
money and the influence on air at courts and how it takes judges time,

484
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:50.460
attention from the bench

485
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.040
<v 1>and reduces the caliber of people who serve on the bench.</v>

486
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:55.500
That may be we'll wake up and,

487
00:17:55.501 --> 00:17:57.060
and the trend will shift,

488
00:17:57.061 --> 00:17:58.410
but I don't see that yet.

489
00:17:59.100 --> 00:17:59.221
Well,

490
00:17:59.221 --> 00:18:03.630
it's certainly an important issue in capital cases and all kinds of criminal

491
00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:04.464
cases,

492
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.150
and we're very grateful,

493
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:06.570
uh,

494
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:10.020
professor wide for you to take time and to come from Tennessee and talk to us

495
00:18:10.021 --> 00:18:14.190
about this and share the insights that you've had as a result of working on this

496
00:18:14.191 --> 00:18:14.980
issue,

497
00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:15.510
uh,

498
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.520
over the last 20 years.
