1
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.670
The statutes adopted by the states and upheld by the Supreme Court in 1976 the

2
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:18.930
most prevalent,

3
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.273
uh,

4
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.650
system that's used as a Wayne Statute,

5
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.280
uh,

6
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.590
like Florida had an Oklahoma had and,

7
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.310
uh,

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.710
California and others where the jury ways,

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.860
the aggravating factors against the mitigating factors.

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.821
Uh,

11
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:33.250
and,

12
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.083
and then the,

13
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.910
it's also the Georgia approach,

14
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:38.760
which is once the jury finds an aggravating circumstance,

15
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.161
uh,

16
00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:42.660
it has complete discretion whether or not to impose the death pony or not.

17
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.320
Uh,

18
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.840
but Texas took a very different approach,

19
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.441
uh,

20
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:47.161
and it's death.

21
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:52.140
Plenty was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1976 in George versus Texas,

22
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.131
first of all,

23
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:57.690
Texas defined capital murder at the guilt phase of the trial,

24
00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:00.750
that there were five different crimes that if you committed those crimes,

25
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:02.490
they were called capital murder.

26
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.030
And if a person was convicted of any one of those,

27
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.740
then the case went to the,

28
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.610
uh,

29
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.830
jury for a penalty determination.

30
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.960
And the jury was asked three questions.

31
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.561
Uh,

32
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:14.550
was it deliberate?

33
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.331
Uh,

34
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:18.480
would the defendant be a future danger?

35
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:18.901
That is,

36
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:23.820
is there a probability that the defendant will commit acts of violence?

37
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:27.510
That would constitute a continuing threat to society.

38
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.531
And third,

39
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:33.531
was it reasonable in re in response to any provocation by the victim,

40
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:35.970
which usually doesn't apply.

41
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.630
Uh,

42
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.000
generally the first and the third didn't apply.

43
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.661
Uh,

44
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:44.661
and so the case comes down to the jury's determination of future dangerousness.

45
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Notice that what the jury's ask here is to find beyond a reasonable doubt that

46
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:53.760
there is a probability that the defendant will,

47
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.410
and of course the question comes,

48
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.590
what is a probability if there's a 20% probability that it will rain tomorrow,

49
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.810
as we are sometimes told,

50
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.561
uh,

51
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:09.561
is that a probability is if there's a 20% probability that the defendant will

52
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:12.240
commit future acts of violence?

53
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.720
Uh,

54
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.420
does that make the person eligible for the death pony?

55
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.360
Jurors are never really told the answer to that question.

56
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.960
Uh,

57
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.710
but it troubled some members of the Texas Court of criminal appeals when the

58
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.790
case was there,

59
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
but ultimately it was upheld by the Supreme Court and,

60
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.780
and injured versus Texas,

61
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.321
uh,

62
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:34.200
by the court comes back to a couple of questions that weren't answered then.

63
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.101
Uh,

64
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:39.120
and that's the question of psychiatrist testifying.

65
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.850
Uh,

66
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.070
in these cases,

67
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.970
uh,

68
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.430
because what we're talking about here is the future,

69
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.510
not the past.

70
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:46.344
These are not,

71
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.101
uh,

72
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:52.101
all of our other aggravating circumstances look to the defendant had a record of

73
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.830
prior assaultive behavior or a prior,

74
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.580
uh,

75
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.670
murder conviction or sometimes they're descriptive.

76
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.241
Uh,

77
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:06.241
but this aggravating circumstance is basically a prediction of the future.

78
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:08.180
And the question becomes,

79
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.430
can you really do that?

80
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.040
And,

81
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.140
and if you can,

82
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.710
can you rely upon a mental health expert,

83
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:16.030
usually a psychiatrist,

84
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:17.770
but possibly a psychologist,

85
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.310
uh,

86
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.050
to make a prediction of how this person is going to behave in the future?

87
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.681
Well,

88
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:24.250
that'd became,

89
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.080
that's a controversial issue.

90
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.760
And it came to the Supreme Court,

91
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.331
uh,

92
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:30.550
in the case of a man named Thomas Barefoot.

93
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.510
Uh,

94
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.090
he was sentenced to death in Texas.

95
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:35.470
And normally,

96
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.360
only one psychiatrist testified if you were prosecuted in one part of Texas,

97
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:42.850
you'd be Dr Grigson would testify.

98
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.420
Uh,

99
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.021
another part,

100
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:45.010
doctor Holbrook would,

101
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:47.380
but for some reason they both testified,

102
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.831
uh,

103
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:49.630
and Thomas barefoots case,

104
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.300
too controversial parts of it.

105
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.990
One,

106
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.750
they never examined Thomas Barefoot.

107
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.450
Uh,

108
00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.710
they just testified that he would be a future danger.

109
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.160
Uh,

110
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.210
based on hypothetical questions that were asked,

111
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.720
uh,

112
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.950
by the prosecutor,

113
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.791
uh,

114
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:07.361
and,

115
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:08.100
um,

116
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.290
uh,

117
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.600
and then so too controversial things.

118
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:11.200
One,

119
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.640
the prediction itself.

120
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.570
And second,

121
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.090
based upon a hypothetical question,

122
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.430
without ever having met Thomas Barefoot,

123
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.610
given him any tests talked to him at all,

124
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.080
in this particular case,

125
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.260
the defense offered no evidence with regard to are no expert testimony with

126
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:30.340
regard to future dangerousness.

127
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.090
Uh,

128
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.620
this is Dr. James Grigson,

129
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.720
a trout all over Texas testified with sometimes testify and two or three cases

130
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:38.770
in the same week.

131
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.581
Uh,

132
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:40.414
and in,

133
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.643
uh,

134
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.910
Thomas barefoots case,

135
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:45.400
which sort of illustrates what this testimony was like,

136
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.560
he was asking a hypothetical question,

137
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:50.950
which incorporated all the facts of the crime that had been proven,

138
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.480
uh,

139
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.630
at the guilt phase.

140
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.201
Uh,

141
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:58.201
and then he testified with a reasonable and psychiatric certainty that barefoot,

142
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.150
uh,

143
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.640
was fairly classical typical,

144
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.270
so,

145
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.920
so pathic personality.

146
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.360
Uh,

147
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.710
secondly,

148
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.341
uh,

149
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:13.450
that he was in the most severe category of Solo SLAs.

150
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:14.201
Uh,

151
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:14.771
and,

152
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:15.131
uh,

153
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:17.260
that on a scale of one to 10,

154
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.330
barefoot was above a 10.

155
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.051
Now,

156
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:21.550
the jury and Thomas Barefoot is case.

157
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:23.830
Didn't know that this was a favorite little,

158
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.850
uh,

159
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.960
technique that Dr Grigson used whenever he testified or in many cases where he

160
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:31.420
testified to say on a scale of one to 10,

161
00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:32.220
the person,

162
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.410
uh,

163
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.520
was over a 10.

164
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.120
Uh,

165
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.090
but you can imagine the impact that it would have on a jury,

166
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.090
uh,

167
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.900
in,

168
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.570
in hearing that testimony.

169
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.261
Uh,

170
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:46.210
and then he testified remarkably that there was a 100%,

171
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.841
uh,

172
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:51.841
an absolute a chance that he would commit future acts of violence.

173
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:54.160
This is what gets really controversial.

174
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:57.070
Can any doctor predict that,

175
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.183
um,

176
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.990
that a person is going to commit these future acts of violence that will make

177
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:05.630
them a continuing threat to society?

178
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.710
Well,

179
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.800
at the Habeas Corpus hearing was held later,

180
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.491
uh,

181
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:13.430
and both sides put on evidence with regard to this question.

182
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:15.830
The state put on Dr. George Parker.

183
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.780
He was a psychologist and Dr Coons who was a psychiatrist and they testified,

184
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.020
first of all that accurate predictions can be made,

185
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.710
uh,

186
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.140
that psychiatrists can make predictions.

187
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:27.861
Uh,

188
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:28.730
and second,

189
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.331
uh,

190
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:31.280
one who fills the,

191
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.930
has the characteristics summed up in the hypothetical question asking Thomas

192
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:36.890
barefoots case,

193
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.671
uh,

194
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:40.790
is a person who would commit future acts of violence?

195
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.271
Well,

196
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:44.180
barefoot puts on a some testimony as well.

197
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:45.980
First he has doctor Faison,

198
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:48.320
who's a psychiatrist and he says,

199
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:53.950
no doctor should be giving a diagnosis based simply on a hypothetical question.

200
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.671
He said,

201
00:06:55.671 --> 00:06:57.650
one of my medical students comes to me and he says,

202
00:06:57.651 --> 00:06:58.191
here's what,

203
00:06:58.191 --> 00:07:00.230
and he tells me three or four things about the person.

204
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:02.900
I may make a tentative diagnosis,

205
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:03.270
uh,

206
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.880
but I'm going to see that patient,

207
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.200
examine the patient,

208
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:09.620
talk to the patient before I make a diagnosis.

209
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.960
A Dr. Dickerson testified,

210
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.800
uh,

211
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.633
that,

212
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:14.563
uh,

213
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.380
no reliable prediction can ever be made.

214
00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:22.760
That it's just simply not possible to predict whether somebody's going to be

215
00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:23.500
violent,

216
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:23.750
uh,

217
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.490
in the future or not.

218
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.091
Uh,

219
00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:27.050
and then in fact,

220
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.310
people are wrong two times out of three when they try to make those predictions.

221
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:32.001
Uh,

222
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:32.960
and finally,

223
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.300
a doctor Moynihan,

224
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.930
who thought when he started working on it that it was not possible to predict

225
00:07:38.931 --> 00:07:40.040
future dangerousness.

226
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.340
He comes to the conclusion that it may be that in some circumstances a

227
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.950
prediction may be possible,

228
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:49.400
uh,

229
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.960
and maybe ethically appropriate because one of the questions that was raised in

230
00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:58.790
the American psychiatric association was whether or not it was ethical for

231
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.880
psychiatrists to be testifying about this.

232
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:02.870
Um,

233
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.870
so the questions presented to the court in the barefoot case,

234
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.460
is it reliable?

235
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:08.361
Uh,

236
00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:12.560
and the court has said that because death is different because the death plenty

237
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:13.760
is unlike any other penalty,

238
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:18.620
there's a greater need for reliability and whether or not to impose the death.

239
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:19.454
Pauline.

240
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:20.623
Secondly,

241
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.950
can you have this testimony based just on hypothetical questions,

242
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:25.551
uh,

243
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:28.820
without any examination of the defendant.

244
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:29.931
Now,

245
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:33.530
the reason there was no examination of the defendant is the supreme court had

246
00:08:33.531 --> 00:08:34.940
held in an earlier case,

247
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:35.570
uh,

248
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.590
that unless,

249
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:37.430
uh,

250
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.670
the person was given their Miranda warnings.

251
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:41.301
Uh,

252
00:08:41.301 --> 00:08:43.940
and unless the lawyer was notified,

253
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:44.570
uh,

254
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.790
these kind of impersonal examinations,

255
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:48.590
which Dr Grigson used to do,

256
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:49.011
a,

257
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:50.060
we're not permissible.

258
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:50.900
Once that happened,

259
00:08:50.901 --> 00:08:51.980
that pretty much ended,

260
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:52.820
uh,

261
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.571
access,

262
00:08:53.571 --> 00:08:53.870
uh,

263
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.070
by the psychiatrist,

264
00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:55.620
uh,

265
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.450
to the defendants if the defendant were to call his own psychiatrist.

266
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.300
And have that psychiatrists do an examination,

267
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.760
then the state would be entitled to do an examination.

268
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:09.240
But most of the time there's not going to be an examination later.

269
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.660
Uh,

270
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.470
the question will come up whether or not group characteristics can you base the

271
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:16.800
future dangerousness on ethnicity or race.

272
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.170
But we'll get to that later.

273
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:21.810
Right now we look at these first two questions,

274
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:22.270
uh,

275
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.080
that the supreme court is asked to decide.

276
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:29.490
Let's go back to the testimony and doctor [inaudible] and Dr. Thomas Barefoot

277
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.350
case by doctor,

278
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.183
Doctor Grigson.

279
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.010
Uh,

280
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.990
he was asking about these studies,

281
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:34.650
uh,

282
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.650
both doctors where he was asking about these studies demonstrating that a future

283
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.350
predictions of future dangerousness are often unreliable.

284
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:44.180
Uh,

285
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.120
Dr Griggs and said,

286
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:45.870
well,

287
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.260
there are a few people that think that it's a minority group within the

288
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:53.280
profession and it's certainly not the American psychiatric association that

289
00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:54.114
believes that.

290
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:54.931
Well,

291
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:56.070
and the barefoot case,

292
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:56.640
uh,

293
00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.290
the American psychiatric association files a brief to the supreme court and its

294
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:02.220
brief says,

295
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:03.031
uh,

296
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:06.210
that the unreliability of these predictions,

297
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:06.901
uh,

298
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:11.901
for longterm future dangerousness is clearly a established as a unreliable

299
00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:15.000
within the profession.

300
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.111
Uh,

301
00:10:16.111 --> 00:10:19.200
and that two out of three predictions are wrong.

302
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.570
So the question comes up to the court,

303
00:10:21.571 --> 00:10:24.840
are we going to allow this testimony even though it's wrong?

304
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.670
Two Times out of three,

305
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:32.290
the Supreme Court says yes and an opinion by justice white for the majority,

306
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:33.990
uh,

307
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.440
sort of says at the very start looking back to Jurich,

308
00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:40.950
this is almost like asking us to reinvent the wheel.

309
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:41.963
Um,

310
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.750
it's a little something of an odd statement to make because what really was an

311
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:49.170
issue here was the reliability of the evidence that was coming in,

312
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:49.740
uh,

313
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.970
with regard to this.

314
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.103
Um,

315
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.930
the fact that it is a difficult one.

316
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.010
Justice white says,

317
00:10:56.011 --> 00:10:58.290
doesn't mean that it can't be made.

318
00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.250
Uh,

319
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.470
he said it's made another context.

320
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.221
Uh,

321
00:11:02.221 --> 00:11:04.080
and it is with regard to,

322
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:04.500
uh,

323
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.810
committing people to mental health institutions.

324
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.830
Usually that's based on the expert testimony of a psychiatrist,

325
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.371
uh,

326
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:14.640
that the person is a danger to themselves or others.

327
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.930
Uh,

328
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.830
whether or not someone's released is based upon a prediction of whether when

329
00:11:19.831 --> 00:11:22.140
released there'll be a danger to themselves or others.

330
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:22.861
Uh,

331
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:23.694
also,

332
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:24.211
uh,

333
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:26.100
with regard to preventative detention,

334
00:11:26.101 --> 00:11:27.270
which is to be very rare,

335
00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:30.120
but now it's more common in criminal cases.

336
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:30.751
But again,

337
00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:33.180
this involves a fairly short period of time.

338
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:33.840
Uh,

339
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.670
preventive detention is detaining a person pending their trial instead of

340
00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:39.990
releasing them on bail.

341
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.640
And it's based on a determination that the court thinks the person may be a

342
00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:48.330
danger to the community or it will be a danger to the community and therefore

343
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:52.530
they're held in jail as opposed to allow a released.

344
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.733
Um,

345
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.843
uh,

346
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:56.643
finally,

347
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:57.280
uh,

348
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.290
diagnosis as a sociopath,

349
00:11:59.560 --> 00:11:59.910
uh,

350
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.360
based on prior behavior.

351
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:01.781
He says,

352
00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:02.320
if you,

353
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.870
if you can say looking at what this person has done,

354
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.420
that they have acted as a sociopath,

355
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:07.940
a,

356
00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.820
then you can say that in the future.

357
00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:10.750
Uh,

358
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.250
he goes on to say basically,

359
00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:13.300
and here's where the case,

360
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:14.261
uh,

361
00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:15.730
the ultimate holding in the case,

362
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.610
let the adversary system sorted out.

363
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.490
We'll let the prosecution puts on its evidence and the defense can cross

364
00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:23.091
examine.

365
00:12:23.091 --> 00:12:23.201
It,

366
00:12:23.201 --> 00:12:25.270
can bring out these studies if it wants to.

367
00:12:25.271 --> 00:12:26.800
It can put on its own experts.

368
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:27.610
Uh,

369
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:32.350
but the jury often in a case gives more credence to one expert than another.

370
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.010
Uh,

371
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.240
nothing wrong with that.

372
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:37.060
And so we'll let the jury's a sorted out.

373
00:12:37.061 --> 00:12:37.361
Of course.

374
00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:40.630
The question here is how does the jury sorted out?

375
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.100
How do they do that?

376
00:12:42.101 --> 00:12:47.101
Is it depend on if you've got a witness like doctor Grigson who even though what

377
00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:51.400
he was saying was not approved by the American Psychiatric Association,

378
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:52.260
uh,

379
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.470
but very articulate,

380
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.000
very charismatic,

381
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:55.660
uh,

382
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.080
has this way of testifying that really connected with jurors.

383
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:00.303
Um,

384
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.350
and then of course prejudices and,

385
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:03.101
uh,

386
00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:06.220
about psychiatry and the law and crime and so forth.

387
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:06.760
Uh,

388
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.830
do those come into play?

389
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.263
Well,

390
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.530
the close case,

391
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.430
uh,

392
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:17.110
justice Blackmun dissented joined by Justice Brennan and Marshall,

393
00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:17.950
uh,

394
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:22.420
basically saying the court has got to act as a gatekeeper.

395
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.510
We can't let evidence that's wrong.

396
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.070
Two out of three times,

397
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:27.700
uh,

398
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.930
come before juries.

399
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.570
Uh,

400
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:32.440
he points out that not a single reputable,

401
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:37.680
reputable scientific source confirms or says,

402
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:38.390
uh,

403
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:41.680
that future dangerousness is acceptable.

404
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.190
They all agree that it's going to be wrong two times out of three.

405
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:45.971
Uh,

406
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:50.971
and so he's concerned about the risk that the death penalty will be imposed

407
00:13:51.281 --> 00:13:56.281
because the jury will be incapable of separating this myth from reality.

408
00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.900
And that in fact the,

409
00:13:58.930 --> 00:13:59.281
the,

410
00:13:59.281 --> 00:14:02.860
the predictions of future dangerousness two out of three times are not even

411
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:03.790
going to be accurate.

412
00:14:03.791 --> 00:14:07.720
So the jury is going to be relying upon a inaccurate information,

413
00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:09.430
very important case,

414
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.160
uh,

415
00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.810
because allowing this testimony in and allowing Dr Grigson and others to

416
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:14.680
testify,

417
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.131
uh,

418
00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:18.580
this is one reason why so many people have been sentenced to death in Texas.

419
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.270
Uh,

420
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.010
once you get to the penalty phase,

421
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:23.380
the jury was asked these three questions.

422
00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:24.161
Yes,

423
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:24.521
yes,

424
00:14:24.521 --> 00:14:24.911
yes.

425
00:14:24.911 --> 00:14:26.320
If the answer all three questions,

426
00:14:26.321 --> 00:14:26.920
yes.

427
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.750
Including this future dangerousness one,

428
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.430
then the person sentence sentenced to death.

429
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.590
There's not nearly the flexibility in Texas a and it wasn't until the later

430
00:14:35.591 --> 00:14:36.011
case,

431
00:14:36.011 --> 00:14:36.880
which we'll get to.

432
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:38.030
Uh,

433
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:43.030
there was very little flexibility for the jury once it found those three things

434
00:14:43.661 --> 00:14:46.630
is deliberate future danger to society.

435
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:47.231
Uh,

436
00:14:47.231 --> 00:14:48.820
and that the victim of the crime,

437
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:49.570
uh,

438
00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:50.680
did not provoke,

439
00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.060
uh,

440
00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.340
the defendant and the response was a appropriate for provocation,

441
00:14:55.341 --> 00:14:56.330
which is I said to sell,

442
00:14:56.331 --> 00:14:58.550
I'm going to be an issue in a case.

443
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.241
Well,

444
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:00.740
how reliable is this evidence?

445
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:01.850
Judge Garcia,

446
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.120
a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the fifth circuit,

447
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:05.660
uh,

448
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:10.040
takes a look at it in a concurring opinion in a case called Flores versus

449
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:10.640
Johnson.

450
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.060
Uh,

451
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.740
he looks at another doctor who testifies regularly with regard to future danger.

452
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:16.574
Clay Griffith,

453
00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:17.271
uh,

454
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:22.271
he's testified 22 times for the state of Texas and he's always found future

455
00:15:22.281 --> 00:15:23.990
danger every single time.

456
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:24.670
So I guess,

457
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:24.830
uh,

458
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.530
whether or not you can predict future dangerousness or not,

459
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:32.390
you can certainly predict how Dr. Griffin will testify with regard to future

460
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:32.961
dangerousness.

461
00:15:32.961 --> 00:15:34.370
He's always going to say,

462
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:34.840
uh,

463
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.331
and again,

464
00:15:35.331 --> 00:15:38.150
he testifies based on hypothetical questions.

465
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:38.990
Uh,

466
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.740
Judge Garza points out that if you look at what the federal courts,

467
00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:47.630
the standards set by a case called Dahlberg vs Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,

468
00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.490
uh,

469
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:49.323
as a case,

470
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.020
not a constitutional case,

471
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:56.000
but a case based on what evidence is admissible in the federal courts.

472
00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:01.510
And it's set up a five part test that judges were to use before allowing a

473
00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:03.380
expert testimony to come in.

474
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:04.310
Uh,

475
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.143
he looks at it,

476
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.610
no testing of the theories have been done here.

477
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.090
Uh,

478
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:09.380
that was one of the requirements,

479
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.020
uh,

480
00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:10.611
under,

481
00:16:10.611 --> 00:16:11.310
under,

482
00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.143
uh,

483
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:13.200
under Dow.

484
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.323
Um,

485
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.270
the extent to which has been peer review.

486
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:17.841
Well,

487
00:16:17.841 --> 00:16:19.100
there's been peer review,

488
00:16:19.101 --> 00:16:20.150
a future dangerousness,

489
00:16:20.151 --> 00:16:21.950
but it's all been negative.

490
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:22.581
Uh,

491
00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:25.580
so that would be a factor for exclusion.

492
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:26.340
Uh,

493
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.300
the rate of error is greater than 50%.

494
00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:30.140
In fact,

495
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.400
it's two out of three,

496
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:32.773
um,

497
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.060
standards of controlling and testing or nonexistent normally for evidence to

498
00:16:38.061 --> 00:16:38.750
come in.

499
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:43.750
There has to be some way to have controls and standards in terms of how this

500
00:16:43.851 --> 00:16:44.660
evidence comes,

501
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.493
comes in.

502
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:45.961
Uh,

503
00:16:45.961 --> 00:16:46.820
and finally,

504
00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.300
instead of being accepted in the scientific community,

505
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:53.150
which is required for evidence to come and in federal courts,

506
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:53.751
uh,

507
00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:57.860
it's been uniformly rejected by the scientific community.

508
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.150
So why is it still allowed a while the,

509
00:17:02.151 --> 00:17:02.950
uh,

510
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:03.783
uh,

511
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.830
he points out one of the thing that I should mention,

512
00:17:05.831 --> 00:17:10.130
you're making a prediction without even meeting the defendant is seen as

513
00:17:10.131 --> 00:17:11.600
inherently unreliable,

514
00:17:11.601 --> 00:17:12.530
unscientific,

515
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:13.730
and unethical.

516
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:15.020
Uh,

517
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:19.940
Dr. Griffin said here that there was no remorse because there was no evidence,

518
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.750
uh,

519
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.360
from which he could deduce remorse.

520
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:22.821
But of course,

521
00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:23.750
he'd never talked to the man.

522
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.370
So how would he know if there was any remorse or not?

523
00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.593
Uh,

524
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:33.710
so why doesn't a doctoral Griffin's testimony?

525
00:17:33.711 --> 00:17:35.150
Why isn't it excluded?

526
00:17:35.151 --> 00:17:36.260
It's unreliable.

527
00:17:36.261 --> 00:17:37.820
He didn't examine the person,

528
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.480
uh,

529
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.320
in person.

530
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:44.030
It's not accepted under any of the five factors in the Daubert case.

531
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.080
And yet a Daubert applies to the federal courts.

532
00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.010
It does not to Texas.

533
00:17:50.011 --> 00:17:54.150
The ultimate decider of what evidence is at middle,

534
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:58.590
admissible in Texas courts is the Texas Court of criminal appeals and the Texas

535
00:17:58.591 --> 00:17:59.424
Supreme Court.

536
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.043
But it's not,

537
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.110
uh,

538
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.421
the,

539
00:18:02.421 --> 00:18:04.470
the Daubert standards not been adopted,

540
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:04.980
uh,

541
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.370
in Texas a and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals,

542
00:18:08.371 --> 00:18:10.710
the court that decided the forest case,

543
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.221
uh,

544
00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:13.380
it's bound by the barefoot case.

545
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.630
So if Texas allows this testimony,

546
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:16.590
then,

547
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:17.220
uh,

548
00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.570
then it's going to be upheld.

549
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.840
And Flores Dustin's is affirmed by the court.

550
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.213
Um,

551
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.610
now we come to Victor Sal Domino's case.

552
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:27.930
Uh,

553
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:28.711
in this case,

554
00:18:28.711 --> 00:18:33.711
the psychiatrist Doctor [inaudible] testifies that Sodano is a future danger in

555
00:18:35.461 --> 00:18:37.710
part of that's based on the circumstances of the crime.

556
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.461
Uh,

557
00:18:38.461 --> 00:18:39.091
and,

558
00:18:39.091 --> 00:18:39.900
uh,

559
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:40.500
his,

560
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:40.951
again,

561
00:18:40.951 --> 00:18:45.210
we have lack of remorse testified to by Dr who never examined him.

562
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:49.800
But what's controversial is he also testifies that there's the testicle

563
00:18:49.801 --> 00:18:54.801
likelihood based on 24 factors that he will be a future danger.

564
00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.390
And one of those factors,

565
00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:58.170
uh,

566
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.540
is that Sodano is Hispanic.

567
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:02.880
So he's saying that he,

568
00:19:02.881 --> 00:19:07.620
we know he's more likely to be with future danger because he's Hispanic.

569
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.520
The defense lawyer fails to object.

570
00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.220
Uh,

571
00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.160
so the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals,

572
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:15.420
uh,

573
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.820
says it's waived.

574
00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.140
The Texas attorney general,

575
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.610
that time later,

576
00:19:20.611 --> 00:19:21.780
Senator John Cornyn,

577
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:22.710
uh,

578
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:27.710
confessors era in all the cases in which doctor Akil Hano has testified,

579
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.100
uh,

580
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:33.930
saying we can't allow people to go to death row based upon a expert testimony

581
00:19:33.931 --> 00:19:37.920
that they're more dangerous because of their ethnicity or their race.

582
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:38.551
Uh,

583
00:19:38.551 --> 00:19:41.010
and even though the state confessors era,

584
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.190
the Texas Court of criminal appeals rejects it,

585
00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:44.821
uh,

586
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:46.050
in the Sodano case,

587
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:50.910
ultimately the federal courts grant relief to people who have been sentenced in

588
00:19:50.911 --> 00:19:51.301
this way,

589
00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:52.320
except for one man,

590
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.333
Dwayne Buck.

591
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.390
Uh,

592
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.320
Dwayne buck was,

593
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.310
uh,

594
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.641
again,

595
00:19:56.641 --> 00:19:58.860
doctor to Ohana and testified,

596
00:19:58.861 --> 00:20:03.330
and he said that African Americans like Duane buck were statistically more

597
00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:06.600
likely than the average person to engage in crime.

598
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:12.230
But the wrinkle in this case is that he was called nod by the prosecution to put

599
00:20:12.481 --> 00:20:13.380
this evidence on,

600
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.510
but by Dwayne Bucks,

601
00:20:15.511 --> 00:20:17.250
lawyer by the defense.

602
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:18.703
Um,

603
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.280
so the question becomes,

604
00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.530
are we going to set the case aside anyway,

605
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:27.770
a or not a supreme court denies review of the case Justice Alito,

606
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:28.891
uh,

607
00:20:28.891 --> 00:20:32.460
rights saying that if it hadn't been for the fact that the defense lawyer

608
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:33.330
presented this,

609
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:34.200
uh,

610
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.010
we wouldn't,

611
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:35.430
uh,

612
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:36.810
we would reverse this case.

613
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.033
Um,

614
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:43.100
justice Sotomayer joined by Justice Kagan says a Texas admitted era in two other

615
00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:46.110
cases where the defense lawyer call this doctor,

616
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:47.200
uh,

617
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.200
and the prosecutor ask about race on cross examination and later referred to it

618
00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:54.370
in closing argument.

619
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:55.803
Um,

620
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:57.063
finally,

621
00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.470
what about future dangerousness?

622
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:05.010
Justice Marshall points out that in the case of Wilbert Lee Evans here since to

623
00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:10.480
death in Virginia,

624
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.970
which also uses a future,

625
00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:14.680
dangerousness is an aggravating factor.

626
00:21:14.681 --> 00:21:16.720
That's the only basis for sentencing him to death.

627
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.640
While he's on death row,

628
00:21:18.641 --> 00:21:19.810
there's an escape attempt.

629
00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:20.141
In fact,

630
00:21:20.141 --> 00:21:22.720
it's an a successful escape attempt.

631
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.921
Uh,

632
00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:25.780
and while that's going on,

633
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:26.560
uh,

634
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.050
he,

635
00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:28.630
six inmates involved in that,

636
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:29.800
uh,

637
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:32.980
Evans took decisive steps,

638
00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:33.611
uh,

639
00:21:33.611 --> 00:21:35.170
to calm the riot.

640
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.020
He saved several of the hostages.

641
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.330
He prevented the rape of a nurse.

642
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:44.710
And over the time that he was in a prison in Texas,

643
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:45.490
uh,

644
00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:46.323
his,

645
00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:47.500
uh,

646
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.060
behavior was exemplary.

647
00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:50.290
Uh,

648
00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:51.850
and so justice Marshall says,

649
00:21:51.851 --> 00:21:56.200
the sole basis for syncing this man to death,

650
00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.200
that he was a future danger is dead wrong.

651
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.690
Not only was he not a future danger,

652
00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:02.230
uh,

653
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.700
he took heroic steps,

654
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:04.331
uh,

655
00:22:04.331 --> 00:22:08.320
to save lives and prevent sexual assault on this nurse.

656
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:08.830
Uh,

657
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:09.663
nevertheless,

658
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:10.540
uh,

659
00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.380
governor wilder,

660
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.240
Virginia did not commute the sentence.

661
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.373
Uh,

662
00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:18.250
Wilbur Lee Evans was executed by the state of Virginia.

663
00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:18.880
Uh,

664
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.691
he said that,

665
00:22:19.691 --> 00:22:19.990
uh,

666
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.460
Justice Marshall's dissent,

667
00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:22.390
uh,

668
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:23.590
gave him great comfort.

669
00:22:23.591 --> 00:22:23.851
He,

670
00:22:23.851 --> 00:22:24.700
he wrote on it,

671
00:22:24.701 --> 00:22:29.650
bury me with this and put it in his pocket right before he went into the

672
00:22:29.651 --> 00:22:30.640
execution chamber.

673
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:31.570
Uh,

674
00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.490
so future dangerousness continues,

675
00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:34.240
uh,

676
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.170
to be used,

677
00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:35.741
uh,

678
00:22:35.741 --> 00:22:36.071
in,

679
00:22:36.071 --> 00:22:36.520
in,

680
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.390
in some states,

681
00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:37.991
a handful,

682
00:22:37.991 --> 00:22:38.824
not that many.

683
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:39.370
Uh,

684
00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:40.450
but certainly in Texas,

685
00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:43.960
which of course carries out far more executions than any other state.

686
00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.600
And has a large number of people sentenced to death,

687
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.220
very controversial,

688
00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.600
but allowed in the courts.

689
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:50.530
