00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.670
William neil moore

2
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.410
pled guilty to murder in the commission of an armed robbery in 1974 and was

3
00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:21.890
sentenced to death in Georgia.

4
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.680
He spent 16 and a half years on death row.

5
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.970
Eight times execution dates were set to carry out his execution.

6
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.500
He once came within seven hours of being executed by the state of Georgia.

7
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.910
Uh,

8
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.840
I want to welcome him.

9
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.400
And why don't you start Mr more by just telling us how it was that you were

10
00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:41.234
sentenced to death.

11
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.143
<v 2>Um,</v>

12
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.200
I committed a murder and armed robbery and I pled guilty.

13
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.290
My family hired a lawyer that they pay $9,000 to and after he had came to the

14
00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:54.240
county jail to talk to me,

15
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:54.541
he said,

16
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:54.721
well,

17
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:58.290
I seen a confession and basically nothing I can do about it,

18
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.740
but my brother is a judge and we will talk to this other guy.

19
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:04.200
And you plead guilty and we could chill life sentence.

20
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.190
So on July 17th,

21
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.820
1974 when I went into the courtroom and to plead guilty when the judge came in

22
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:12.390
the courtroom.

23
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.170
Actually he already,

24
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.170
he actually already had my death sentence typed up before we even went to trial.

25
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.733
Um,

26
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.090
wasn't much of a trial.

27
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.680
He was a prosecutor actually basically rehearsing my confession,

28
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.510
everything that I said.

29
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.780
And uh,

30
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.430
after that,

31
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.080
the judge asked my attorney,

32
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.340
what is your defense?

33
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:32.970
And he said,

34
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.330
drama.

35
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.021
We plead guilty,

36
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:34.854
talked to Billy.

37
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.870
And I got on the stand explaining to the judge how wrong I was.

38
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:40.920
I Sar was,

39
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:41.970
I gave the money back.

40
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:46.230
And the reason why I pled guilty because I was in fact guilty when I,

41
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:48.000
that I did not mean to commit the murder,

42
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:49.770
but I'm totally responsible.

43
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.510
And he said,

44
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.750
did I did a good and honorable thing and they giving him the money back by

45
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:55.650
pleading guilty.

46
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:59.220
But on Friday the 13th of 1974,

47
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:01.690
I'll be taken to the state prison and execute it.

48
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.961
<v 1>All right,</v>

49
00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:04.310
let me back you up just a little.

50
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.290
Tell us just a little about the crime and about how you felt after you had

51
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:10.124
committed it.

52
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.300
<v 2>Well,</v>

53
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.710
committing a crime was,

54
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.810
first of all was into financial need in which is not an excuse.

55
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.160
There's never an excuse for murder.

56
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.500
But the background information is,

57
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:26.420
I was trying to get some money to be able to take care of my son and I met this

58
00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:27.740
guy and he said he knew a man.

59
00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:31.010
He kept $30,000 in his house and we can take it.

60
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:31.844
So,

61
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.840
uh,

62
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.500
the plan,

63
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.670
nobody was to get hurt.

64
00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:35.900
We just take the money.

65
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.540
But in the course of trying to get the money,

66
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.290
uh,

67
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.771
Mr Staple,

68
00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:44.210
when it came out in his bedroom with the shotgun and the chug on bro hit me in

69
00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:48.000
the leg and it scared him and he fired the shotgun and it scared me enough,

70
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.750
fired a pistol and I shot him and killed him.

71
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.190
And um,

72
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.051
after that,

73
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:55.340
it was like 30,

74
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:56.041
40 minutes.

75
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:57.470
I'm back at my trailer.

76
00:02:57.471 --> 00:02:58.100
I'm sitting here,

77
00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.711
<v 1>let me ask you,</v>

78
00:02:58.711 --> 00:02:59.990
is you've under the influence of any

79
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.823
<v 2>alcohol or drugs?</v>

80
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.520
Yeah,

81
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.820
we are.

82
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.040
We smoked a lot of pot and drink a whole fifth of Jack Daniels.

83
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:06.874
I mean to,

84
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.380
to commit any type of crime.

85
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.640
Uh,

86
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.040
most guys get high because you're conscious,

87
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.883
you know,

88
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.150
a person doesn't have to be religious to know what is right and wrong.

89
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.590
Your conscious tells you.

90
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.720
And the reason why people get high before they commit crimes,

91
00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:23.800
and so that they can stop hearing that voice in the back of their mind,

92
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:24.250
nagging the,

93
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.050
and telling them this is wrong.

94
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:26.884
Don't do it.

95
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.701
Because if you do it,

96
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:28.660
you gonna get in trouble.

97
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.050
And so to negate that you get high and so that you can go ahead and do what you

98
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:34.990
know you shouldn't do.

99
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.020
<v 1>And after you were arrested,</v>

100
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:39.340
you gave a full confession.

101
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.770
<v 2>I gave it two and a half hour confession to the Gbi.</v>

102
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.120
He said to me,

103
00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:46.650
Georgia Bureau of Investigation,

104
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.140
yeah,

105
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.150
he said to me,

106
00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:48.984
um,

107
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.060
if you are so sorry about the crime,

108
00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:52.680
then why don't you tell us about it?

109
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.791
And I said,

110
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:54.230
okay,

111
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.521
God,

112
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:56.430
I tell you everything that I can remember.

113
00:03:56.431 --> 00:04:01.431
What was so reposting and shocking to me was the fact that while I'm telling

114
00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:02.160
them,

115
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.610
it's like I'm really seeing it for the first time myself.

116
00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:07.380
Actually what I actually did,

117
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.860
and it's just hard to deal with the fact that I had shot someone and and killed

118
00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:14.280
somebody for some money.

119
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.410
<v 1>Now later you,</v>

120
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.303
uh,

121
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.790
B you got the police reports and so forth in the case,

122
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:22.624
is that right?

123
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:23.241
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

124
00:04:23.241 --> 00:04:24.380
after uh,

125
00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.520
being sentenced to death and the judge telling me that I'm going to be executed

126
00:04:28.521 --> 00:04:29.930
on Friday and you're 13,

127
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.030
well,

128
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.360
my lawyer didn't explain any anything to me about there being a pill process.

129
00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:35.750
So,

130
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.991
you know,

131
00:04:35.991 --> 00:04:36.710
Friday,

132
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:37.191
September,

133
00:04:37.191 --> 00:04:37.851
Friday the 13th,

134
00:04:37.851 --> 00:04:41.900
I'm sitting on my bed waiting to be executed and nobody shows up.

135
00:04:41.901 --> 00:04:45.350
And so I'm thinking I'm be executed Saturday or Sunday.

136
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.840
So you just waiting,

137
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.480
we just anticipation for the guards and every time you hear him and then they

138
00:04:50.481 --> 00:04:53.030
just pass by and don't send it to me.

139
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.781
Monday,

140
00:04:53.781 --> 00:04:55.580
they give me a letter and my lawyer's like,

141
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.121
oh Golly,

142
00:04:56.121 --> 00:05:00.230
I forgot to tell you that you're not going to be executed on Friday the 13th.

143
00:05:00.231 --> 00:05:01.940
Your cases going on the appeal.

144
00:05:01.941 --> 00:05:02.331
And,

145
00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:02.810
um,

146
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.170
I need you to tell your sister to give me $3,000 to do this.

147
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.350
So I was pretty upset at that and I told my sister,

148
00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:09.681
listened,

149
00:05:09.681 --> 00:05:12.530
you fired this guy and then I will represent myself.

150
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.570
And in doing so,

151
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.900
I filed a petition to the court and got my transcript and a police report came

152
00:05:20.931 --> 00:05:22.690
along with the transcript and he's doing,

153
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.110
I was going through the police report,

154
00:05:24.111 --> 00:05:27.260
I saw all the names of the members of the victim's family.

155
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.250
And I knew at that point did I had to try to do something.

156
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.440
You can't bring a person back,

157
00:05:33.441 --> 00:05:34.251
you can't help.

158
00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:36.510
But in apologizing,

159
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.430
it really helps.

160
00:05:37.431 --> 00:05:40.970
So I wrote the family and ask them if they could find it in her heart to forgive

161
00:05:40.971 --> 00:05:41.091
me,

162
00:05:41.091 --> 00:05:42.110
I would appreciate it.

163
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.190
And,

164
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.380
and to my surprise,

165
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.430
within the next week,

166
00:05:46.431 --> 00:05:49.730
I began to get letters back and they told me that they did forgive me.

167
00:05:49.731 --> 00:05:53.510
And actually that started a correspondence with the victim's family.

168
00:05:53.511 --> 00:05:57.140
And I write letters for the whole 16 and a half years that I was on death row.

169
00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.020
And how

170
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.230
<v 1>many letters did you write there initially to the victim's families?</v>

171
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.870
There's about 30 letters.

172
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.860
About 30 letters.

173
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.550
Yeah.

174
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.750
And you told each one of them?

175
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.100
<v 2>I told each one I'm individual individually that I was sorry.</v>

176
00:06:11.101 --> 00:06:13.010
And if they could find it in their heart to be giving me.

177
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.853
I appreciate it.

178
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.230
And I got letters back from just about everybody.

179
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.960
<v 1>And you remained in correspondence with them throughout the time and are you</v>

180
00:06:21.961 --> 00:06:23.130
still in touch with them today?

181
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.120
<v 2>Even to this day?</v>

182
00:06:24.121 --> 00:06:24.571
We,

183
00:06:24.571 --> 00:06:24.990
uh,

184
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.280
talked about telephone,

185
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.091
uh,

186
00:06:27.091 --> 00:06:32.091
I have been down to rinse to visit him a couple of times and their family.

187
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.473
<v 1>Right.</v>

188
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.380
They're like your family.

189
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.453
Yes.

190
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.190
And we should put this where this case took place.

191
00:06:38.191 --> 00:06:40.380
This was in the ton of Lewisville,

192
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.490
which was in Jefferson County,

193
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.343
Georgia.

194
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.180
And you were serving in the military,

195
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.111
you and Augusta,

196
00:06:46.111 --> 00:06:47.490
Georgia and what?

197
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.570
You were in Fort Benning?

198
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.730
Fort Gordon Ford.

199
00:06:50.731 --> 00:06:50.971
Gordon,

200
00:06:50.971 --> 00:06:51.470
I'm sorry,

201
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.991
Fort Gordon,

202
00:06:51.991 --> 00:06:52.171
right?

203
00:06:52.171 --> 00:06:52.890
Yeah,

204
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:53.551
that's in Columbus.

205
00:06:53.551 --> 00:06:54.384
Fort Benning.

206
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.290
And um,

207
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:56.563
uh,

208
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.560
touched this a little bit about your military career.

209
00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.521
<v 2>Well,</v>

210
00:06:59.521 --> 00:07:04.500
I that joined the army because I wanted to get away from the people in the

211
00:07:04.501 --> 00:07:07.140
neighborhood because the neighborhood was violent.

212
00:07:07.141 --> 00:07:07.381
You know,

213
00:07:07.381 --> 00:07:07.810
when,

214
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:08.430
uh,

215
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.720
I didn't want to go to jail.

216
00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:11.520
They want to get messed up on drugs.

217
00:07:11.521 --> 00:07:12.211
I had friends,

218
00:07:12.211 --> 00:07:14.790
it was getting killed and we're going to prison.

219
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.391
And I said,

220
00:07:15.391 --> 00:07:15.870
well,

221
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.430
I'm getting away from all of that and just joined the military and make a career

222
00:07:20.431 --> 00:07:21.264
out of that.

223
00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.770
Where you were from Columbus,

224
00:07:22.771 --> 00:07:23.220
Ohio,

225
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.611
Columbus,

226
00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:24.040
Ohio.

227
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.570
Yes.

228
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:24.871
And,

229
00:07:24.871 --> 00:07:25.704
um,

230
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.701
I really,

231
00:07:26.701 --> 00:07:27.870
really liked the military.

232
00:07:27.871 --> 00:07:28.704
I mean,

233
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:29.191
I,

234
00:07:29.191 --> 00:07:34.191
it was help for me because I think it gave me the discipline and sorta like the

235
00:07:36.151 --> 00:07:40.560
fatherly advice that I didn't get because my father went to prison when I was

236
00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:40.951
four,

237
00:07:40.951 --> 00:07:42.480
so he wasn't there.

238
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:43.591
And so,

239
00:07:43.591 --> 00:07:43.800
uh,

240
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.633
to me

241
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.280
also is like a game.

242
00:07:47.281 --> 00:07:50.490
Everything to me at that time was sort of like a game.

243
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.490
I'm always going to be the best at it and do the best that I could.

244
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.340
And so I liked the,

245
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.270
the physicality of the military.

246
00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.470
I liked the fact that,

247
00:07:58.471 --> 00:07:59.304
um,

248
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.690
I will take you to different countries and places that I would never go if I

249
00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:04.680
wasn't in the military,

250
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.830
were just serve before you came to Fort Gordon.

251
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.720
I served three years in Germany.

252
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:10.891
I was,

253
00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:11.724
uh,

254
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.230
Xcel is trained to be a heavy equipment operator and I really didn't want to do

255
00:08:16.231 --> 00:08:17.670
that in Germany.

256
00:08:17.671 --> 00:08:19.460
So they let me out today,

257
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.410
allow me to Oj t as a military police.

258
00:08:22.411 --> 00:08:27.411
So first I worked in a stuck aid as a guard for 16 months and then I worked as

259
00:08:28.301 --> 00:08:33.300
the mail clerk because I told the captain of the prison did,

260
00:08:33.301 --> 00:08:35.340
I didn't like that type of job being a guard.

261
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.600
It bothered me having to lock of the soldiers up and uh,

262
00:08:39.601 --> 00:08:43.320
I felt that I wanted to be somewhere where I could sort of help them.

263
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.640
And being a male clerk,

264
00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:45.451
I felt that I was,

265
00:08:45.451 --> 00:08:49.140
could help them with getting mail and getting people in their visiting list.

266
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.490
And so that helped.

267
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.780
Then our company moved from Frankfurt to often,

268
00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.320
we switched with another company and when we switched,

269
00:08:59.321 --> 00:09:01.210
they moved me to the seven oh ninth.

270
00:09:01.211 --> 00:09:04.810
And big company to send me your exactly right back to Frankfurt where I was in

271
00:09:04.811 --> 00:09:05.644
the beginning.

272
00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:07.240
And in that company,

273
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:07.960
uh,

274
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.490
that's where you've worked on the streets.

275
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.980
<v 1>So you had actually been the equivalent of a prison guard while you were in the</v>

276
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.600
military

277
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.590
<v 2>prison guard,</v>

278
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:16.370
uh,

279
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:17.203
police.

280
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.133
Yep.

281
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.430
<v 1>And when you came to death row,</v>

282
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.670
you now had a very different relationship with the guards.

283
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:24.941
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

284
00:09:24.941 --> 00:09:27.820
cause I was the inmate and they were the guards.

285
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:33.090
But I think that experience of being a guard really helped me understand of how

286
00:09:33.101 --> 00:09:34.490
to relate to them and to,

287
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.220
and to be able to talk with them,

288
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:41.380
especially when you have guards that are always mean and,

289
00:09:41.381 --> 00:09:42.340
and uh,

290
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.960
wanting to do stuff to inmates.

291
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.870
Being able to explain to other guys while,

292
00:09:46.871 --> 00:09:47.170
you know,

293
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:51.130
you got to understand that this is the only job that this guy can get it.

294
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:52.030
Uh,

295
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.460
most of the guys that are guards couldn't,

296
00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.640
could make it as police officers couldn't pass those tests stuff.

297
00:09:57.641 --> 00:09:58.840
So now they're here.

298
00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.550
So they're like a police,

299
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.181
but the,

300
00:10:01.181 --> 00:10:03.250
not the police did they want it to be,

301
00:10:03.251 --> 00:10:04.660
or a highway patrolman.

302
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.370
And they got an attitude about it.

303
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.960
And so you have to learn how to,

304
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.060
to deal with them.

305
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:15.120
And I think the only thing that really helps them is when you show them respect

306
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.570
for who they are as a person and their position.

307
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.820
<v 1>And you did that while you were yeah,</v>

308
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.830
I did it all the time because I was on the other side as being a guard in the

309
00:10:29.031 --> 00:10:29.864
military.

310
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.140
Now you came very close to execution.

311
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.910
Could you tell us about that?

312
00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:35.801
<v 2>Yes.</v>

313
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.480
In 1984,

314
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:38.421
uh,

315
00:10:38.421 --> 00:10:43.421
I had lost all of my pills and I got an execution date for May the 24th,

316
00:10:44.501 --> 00:10:48.220
1984 actually judge Mcmillan's sit me,

317
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.900
and this was sort of crazy cause he sent me a letter and an execution date.

318
00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:58.210
He sent me a letter and in the letter he said that he did not want to set a

319
00:10:58.211 --> 00:10:59.044
date,

320
00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.950
but the attorney general's office was pressing him to set a date.

321
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.740
So he set this date that he setting,

322
00:11:05.741 --> 00:11:09.040
he's given me the maximum amount of time that he can,

323
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.010
that he waited two months before he said it.

324
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.240
And then he gave me the maximum amount of time in setting it.

325
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.221
He said,

326
00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:18.051
did he did everything,

327
00:11:18.051 --> 00:11:19.510
did he could in,

328
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.410
in doing this?

329
00:11:20.411 --> 00:11:20.770
I mean,

330
00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:24.040
he could have just changed it and it gave me a life sentence.

331
00:11:24.041 --> 00:11:24.910
He could have did that.

332
00:11:24.911 --> 00:11:25.870
But this is,

333
00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:26.710
I dunno,

334
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:27.290
this was here,

335
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.510
I guess he felt like he was cleaning his sore or something

336
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.430
<v 1>for say the maximum amount of time.</v>

337
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:36.150
You mean from the date of the order until the date in which you'd be executed?

338
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:36.870
Yes.

339
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:37.920
He give you as much time,

340
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:39.860
most times the law.

341
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:40.490
Loud.

342
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:40.670
<v 2>And,</v>

343
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.900
and,

344
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.710
and he was saying that he held off two months.

345
00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.130
Right.

346
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.250
They just harassed him for two months before he did that.

347
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.780
Right.

348
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.120
And,

349
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.080
and so,

350
00:11:49.081 --> 00:11:49.914
um,

351
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:50.461
I said,

352
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:50.611
all right.

353
00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:53.680
So I knew that this was common cause,

354
00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:56.020
so I had the date before the state head d day.

355
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.970
And so when they came and said,

356
00:11:57.971 --> 00:11:58.381
okay,

357
00:11:58.381 --> 00:11:59.214
um,

358
00:11:59.330 --> 00:11:59.590
uh,

359
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.300
this is the 21st of May,

360
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:03.610
you've got an execution date for the 24th.

361
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.833
Uh,

362
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.101
they took him,

363
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:09.070
packed all my stuff up and took me to the captain's office and say,

364
00:12:09.071 --> 00:12:10.510
here's the execution warrant.

365
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.490
We want you to read it and tell us,

366
00:12:12.491 --> 00:12:14.140
you understand we're going to kill you.

367
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:17.680
It on the 24th at 12:00 PM,

368
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.950
you understand that this is what the state is ordered.

369
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.900
And they wanted me to sign it.

370
00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:24.310
And then also they say,

371
00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:24.581
well okay,

372
00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:25.600
here's another form.

373
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.020
What do you want us to do with your bottom?

374
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.370
We kill you do,

375
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:30.940
we can bury you here at the state,

376
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:35.320
at the cemetery to state has or your family can come and get your body and then

377
00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:39.730
you have to sign another form is who do you want to be the chaplain with you now

378
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.970
they idea was you can choose from their captains and they had like,

379
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:49.720
like five and none of their chapters really did anything in interacting with us

380
00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:50.560
on death row.

381
00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.860
And so when I read what the rules was,

382
00:12:53.861 --> 00:12:55.630
I told him one of the rules so I can have any chocolate.

383
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.090
It doesn't specify as did they have to work here?

384
00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.770
So Wharton,

385
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.820
the captain and I went round and round when I told him that I was going to call

386
00:13:03.821 --> 00:13:08.680
my lawyer and we file a lawsuit and that would get this execution stayed.

387
00:13:08.681 --> 00:13:09.221
And they said,

388
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:09.641
okay,

389
00:13:09.641 --> 00:13:11.320
you just have whoever you want.

390
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:12.611
And I saw,

391
00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:17.020
I asked for my friend Murphy Davis who works in Atlanta who represented,

392
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:18.250
well she's not a lawyer,

393
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.700
but she helps death row inmates and sister,

394
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.941
she,

395
00:13:20.941 --> 00:13:22.180
she's a mentor and Minister.

396
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.490
Right,

397
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.930
right,

398
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:23.180
right,

399
00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.010
right.

400
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:24.671
And so,

401
00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:25.480
uh,

402
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.520
after that they take all your clothes and give you a jumpsuit and said,

403
00:13:29.521 --> 00:13:32.350
this is the one we're going to execute you in a new pair of boots.

404
00:13:32.351 --> 00:13:33.280
It no strings,

405
00:13:33.281 --> 00:13:34.114
no belt.

406
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.520
And then I was taking the death watch.

407
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.090
That is a sale that is like a regular sale.

408
00:13:40.091 --> 00:13:44.050
But there's two officers that sit right in front of it that record your every

409
00:13:44.051 --> 00:13:44.471
move,

410
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:49.120
every single thing that you say and do for those 72 hours is recorded.

411
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.261
And I'd asked,

412
00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:50.711
the guy said,

413
00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:50.801
well,

414
00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:50.971
what,

415
00:13:50.971 --> 00:13:51.761
what is this about?

416
00:13:51.761 --> 00:13:52.001
He said,

417
00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:52.121
oh,

418
00:13:52.121 --> 00:13:57.121
this is our proof to society to show them that we treated you nice before we

419
00:13:57.401 --> 00:13:58.234
killed you.

420
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.240
And you said there are two guys,

421
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:02.140
what are these two?

422
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:03.880
Well,

423
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.620
both of these guard correction officers,

424
00:14:05.621 --> 00:14:09.580
they just sit at the table d well these were the two that puts the change and

425
00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:12.340
stuff on me and brought me to the death watch sale.

426
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.780
These were the same two guys that stopped me in front of the electric chair

427
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.000
said,

428
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.340
well and pull the sheet off of his ability.

429
00:14:18.341 --> 00:14:22.180
We want you to see this and see that this is the chair that you're going to be

430
00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:25.570
sitting in 72 hours from now and just look at it.

431
00:14:25.571 --> 00:14:26.560
Explain how that happened.

432
00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:28.990
They actually took her to the execution chamber,

433
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:29.590
right?

434
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:34.590
Instead of the two guys bringing me to the death watch sale out of the back door

435
00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:35.740
of the captain's office,

436
00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:37.150
which leads right to the sale.

437
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.530
So that's what cell block.

438
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.600
They took me all way around the prison and brought me into the viewing room

439
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.290
that,

440
00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:44.681
uh,

441
00:14:44.681 --> 00:14:48.940
the prosecutors or the victim's family or the defendant families come in and sit

442
00:14:48.941 --> 00:14:50.020
and view the execution.

443
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:54.380
And so as we come into this room is just amazing to me because it looks like a

444
00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:54.801
church.

445
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:59.510
You got pews on this side and deciding on a red carpet and as you walked down

446
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:00.560
the middle of this carpet,

447
00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:04.760
there was a podium at the end and you can tell you that it's an electric chair

448
00:15:04.761 --> 00:15:05.301
was under,

449
00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:07.220
but it had a big white sheet over it.

450
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:12.490
So these two guys walked me right up to the chair and unexpectedly,

451
00:15:12.651 --> 00:15:14.890
one guy just snatched the sheet off of is ability.

452
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.801
Look at this.

453
00:15:15.801 --> 00:15:18.920
This is where you're going to be sitting in the next 72 hours.

454
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.290
And then they took you to the cell.

455
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.650
Then they took me to the death watch sale and put me in.

456
00:15:24.651 --> 00:15:25.770
And uh,

457
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.980
the captain came by and he explains,

458
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:28.981
this is these,

459
00:15:28.981 --> 00:15:30.080
these are your rights.

460
00:15:30.081 --> 00:15:31.640
If you want to watch the television,

461
00:15:31.641 --> 00:15:33.760
you tell them to turn it on cost.

462
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:37.130
It may be news about your case or any updates about your case.

463
00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:37.850
Uh,

464
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.370
and same as with the radio or the newspapers.

465
00:15:40.371 --> 00:15:42.530
But if you don't want these items on,

466
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.970
the guards won't turn them on.

467
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.680
They can't turn one unless you say so,

468
00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:46.514
basically.

469
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.250
Right.

470
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:52.250
<v 1>And so a lot of the time they're up until you got word obviously that you've got</v>

471
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:53.654
to stay,

472
00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:54.800
uh,

473
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.100
you spent your time visiting with people.

474
00:15:57.101 --> 00:15:57.320
Uh,

475
00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.340
just describe that.

476
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.800
<v 2>Well,</v>

477
00:15:58.800 --> 00:15:59.720
the first part,

478
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:00.613
um,

479
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:05.680
I was sort of being somewhat terrorized by the guards because after the captain

480
00:16:07.431 --> 00:16:07.651
left,

481
00:16:07.651 --> 00:16:12.440
the guards asked me to turn the TVs on and I told him I wasn't watching the TV

482
00:16:12.441 --> 00:16:13.700
that didn't care net and they're bad it.

483
00:16:13.701 --> 00:16:14.780
So they said,

484
00:16:14.781 --> 00:16:15.141
okay,

485
00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:18.530
since you won't allow us to be entertained by the television,

486
00:16:18.531 --> 00:16:19.820
then we will entertain you.

487
00:16:19.821 --> 00:16:24.821
So they opened up their green log books and began to tell me what each of the 13

488
00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:26.360
inmates who had been executed,

489
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:30.440
what they did it a line by line with how they move,

490
00:16:30.441 --> 00:16:31.670
what they said,

491
00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:33.830
what they did for the whole 72 hours.

492
00:16:33.831 --> 00:16:34.410
And

493
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.990
<v 1>this is the time leading up to each of their execution.</v>

494
00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:37.820
<v 2>Yes.</v>

495
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.290
The 72 hours at each one of them went through

496
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.440
live with each one.

497
00:16:43.441 --> 00:16:45.450
I'm for at least 10 years,

498
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.720
knew him very well and that was really,

499
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.370
really disturbing to hear that.

500
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.470
And for them to even do something like that.

501
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.010
Why,

502
00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:56.380
why would guards went to a terrorize you and

503
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:04.970
just to hear friends how they reacted and the things that they went through the

504
00:17:05.311 --> 00:17:06.960
last 72 hours of their life.

505
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:09.740
<v 1>And um,</v>

506
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.520
tell us about your lawyers.

507
00:17:11.521 --> 00:17:12.510
What was your,

508
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.760
you had a bad experience with your first lawyer.

509
00:17:14.761 --> 00:17:15.690
You're fired him.

510
00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:20.460
He took over your own case to do finally find some lawyers that you were

511
00:17:20.461 --> 00:17:21.480
satisfied with.

512
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:21.931
<v 2>Well,</v>

513
00:17:21.931 --> 00:17:22.500
yes.

514
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.090
The second lawyer that I had,

515
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:24.570
uh,

516
00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:29.070
was from Athens law school and he came about because actually my mother in law,

517
00:17:29.071 --> 00:17:32.250
she wrote the Naacp in New York.

518
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:32.911
She told them,

519
00:17:32.911 --> 00:17:33.051
said,

520
00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:33.331
listen,

521
00:17:33.331 --> 00:17:35.560
I've been supporting you guys forever.

522
00:17:35.561 --> 00:17:37.390
And my son in law was on death row.

523
00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.191
He didn't have a lawyer.

524
00:17:38.191 --> 00:17:40.680
Y'all going to help him where I'm coming to New York and there's going to be

525
00:17:40.681 --> 00:17:41.790
some trouble up in,

526
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.390
in New York when she get there.

527
00:17:43.391 --> 00:17:44.224
And so,

528
00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:44.580
uh,

529
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.420
some kind of way.

530
00:17:45.421 --> 00:17:47.430
They talked to Athens law,

531
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.820
uh,

532
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.250
law school at University of Georgia

533
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:51.280
<v 1>law school at Athens.</v>

534
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:51.880
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

535
00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.280
And so I,

536
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.400
Laurie came by and he'd said,

537
00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:55.631
yeah,

538
00:17:55.631 --> 00:17:56.200
he's going to take,

539
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.250
he wanted to take the case.

540
00:17:57.251 --> 00:17:57.611
And I said,

541
00:17:57.611 --> 00:17:57.881
well,

542
00:17:57.881 --> 00:17:58.151
you know,

543
00:17:58.151 --> 00:17:59.140
before you do that,

544
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.360
I'm just not just giving it to anybody.

545
00:18:01.361 --> 00:18:02.560
We're going to do this together.

546
00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:04.170
And he was all agreeable.

547
00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:04.361
So,

548
00:18:04.361 --> 00:18:04.841
yeah.

549
00:18:04.841 --> 00:18:07.300
And let me explain to you what we're going to do is we're going to lay the

550
00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.670
foundation here in the state courts.

551
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:13.270
We're going to file all these issues so that when the state deny him,

552
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.530
because we know they are,

553
00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.140
we'll have this when we get to the federal court.

554
00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.790
And what happened is while the case was in the federal state courts,

555
00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:22.421
uh,

556
00:18:22.421 --> 00:18:24.670
there was a ruling from the federal court.

557
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:29.620
The made their office ended up with 250 state havens says he was just three

558
00:18:29.621 --> 00:18:30.840
lawyers and so on.

559
00:18:30.841 --> 00:18:31.601
My lawyer wrote me,

560
00:18:31.601 --> 00:18:31.811
he said,

561
00:18:31.811 --> 00:18:31.901
well,

562
00:18:31.901 --> 00:18:34.900
I just can't do all this stuff I need to do with your case,

563
00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.580
so I'm going to just drop.

564
00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.900
He just dropped eight of the issues and I amended the issues back to the

565
00:18:40.901 --> 00:18:42.790
petition and our petitions to the judge.

566
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:43.720
Uh,

567
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.810
let me fire him if he can't help me to where I needed to be.

568
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:47.260
Uh,

569
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.700
he don't need to be on the case.

570
00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:53.730
And so the judge would not let me fire him and actually had him come and they

571
00:18:54.401 --> 00:18:55.234
had a hearing.

572
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.160
And out of all the issues,

573
00:18:57.161 --> 00:19:00.850
I had the only argued one hearing and one issue.

574
00:19:00.851 --> 00:19:02.740
And I tried to get up and talking to judge,

575
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.830
said the next time that I would say something and he'd have me gag because I'm

576
00:19:05.831 --> 00:19:07.450
not a lawyer and I can argue it.

577
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.070
So that really,

578
00:19:09.071 --> 00:19:12.550
really made me upset about attorneys and stuff.

579
00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:17.551
And so I finally got him off the case and I was doing it myself until I got

580
00:19:17.591 --> 00:19:22.460
attorney Dan [inaudible] from a northeastern university who came in in

581
00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:25.000
[inaudible] 79 and began to help me out.

582
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.900
<v 1>Dan [inaudible] was ultimately the dean.</v>

583
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:28.950
Uh,

584
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:30.240
at northeastern law school.

585
00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.060
<v 2>Right.</v>

586
00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:31.331
Right.

587
00:19:31.331 --> 00:19:32.320
When he first started,

588
00:19:32.321 --> 00:19:36.820
he was just one of the professors and I think after two years when the case,

589
00:19:36.821 --> 00:19:40.780
he became the dean and they have a death penalty clinic at the school.

590
00:19:40.781 --> 00:19:42.790
So I guess a lot of his students was helping.

591
00:19:42.791 --> 00:19:45.190
They working on my case and he was,

592
00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.660
he really helped me though,

593
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.370
not just working on a case.

594
00:19:48.371 --> 00:19:53.371
He really helped me as a person to rehabilitate me and from not liking and

595
00:19:54.101 --> 00:19:55.200
lawyers because I just

596
00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.043
<v 1>didn't trust him.</v>

597
00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:56.680
Right,

598
00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.070
right.

599
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.450
Because of all these bad experiences.

600
00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.200
Right,

601
00:19:59.200 --> 00:19:59.890
right.

602
00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:03.010
And ultimately also John Charles Boger,

603
00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:03.941
uh,

604
00:20:03.941 --> 00:20:08.500
the head of the Naacp legal defense and Educational Fund became one of your

605
00:20:08.501 --> 00:20:09.040
lawyers.

606
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:09.381
<v 2>Right.</v>

607
00:20:09.381 --> 00:20:11.920
Because when I first started representing myself,

608
00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.990
I wrote John Boger,

609
00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:14.893
a row,

610
00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.310
millet farmer and our,

611
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.041
I can't remember,

612
00:20:18.041 --> 00:20:21.250
this other professor was in one of the law books I had.

613
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:21.790
Right.

614
00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.900
And so I wrote him and they were giving me information and uh,

615
00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.800
Jack and I got to be close and Jack Bogle,

616
00:20:29.801 --> 00:20:33.310
we got to be close and he was giving me information and telling me what I should

617
00:20:33.311 --> 00:20:34.840
do with this issue.

618
00:20:34.841 --> 00:20:36.440
Or maybe it's just your might work.

619
00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.293
It doesn't work.

620
00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.610
And then in around,

621
00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:44.640
I think like 83 he actually start assisting Dang available on your case.

622
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:46.650
It'd be good.

623
00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:47.483
<v 1>Cause your</v>

624
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.420
<v 2>ultimately actually was taken by the Supreme Court of the United States,</v>

625
00:20:51.421 --> 00:20:52.000
right?

626
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:52.451
Yes.

627
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:53.970
There was taking that as the cream some.

628
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:54.610
Yeah.

629
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:55.031
<v 1>And,</v>

630
00:20:55.031 --> 00:20:56.830
and Jack Boger argued the case.

631
00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:01.970
<v 2>He argued before the Supreme Court and what the issues as a supreme court that</v>

632
00:21:02.641 --> 00:21:07.110
the state was pushing because I had gotten relief in the district court.

633
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:07.973
Right.

634
00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.550
And lost the relief in 11th circuit.

635
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:16.410
So the argument at the Supreme Court became a successive petition.

636
00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:21.120
That's what the argument was that I have filed a successive petition and had all

637
00:21:21.121 --> 00:21:25.410
these other issues that I'm bringing late in.

638
00:21:25.411 --> 00:21:28.620
Actually all the issues that they say I'm bringing late was in the initial

639
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:33.621
petition that judge Edenfield refused to hear when he granted me relief on the

640
00:21:34.231 --> 00:21:39.120
first issue and he said he didn't have to look at the rest of them in the 11th

641
00:21:39.121 --> 00:21:39.451
circuit,

642
00:21:39.451 --> 00:21:40.350
agreed with him.

643
00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.090
And so that caused the problem.

644
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.360
And so we were telling him to the Supreme Court,

645
00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:47.370
we didn't abused a writ,

646
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.930
we didn't cause the problem.

647
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.130
The state caused the problem and we wouldn't be here if they would just say

648
00:21:53.131 --> 00:21:53.460
went,

649
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.840
let me go back and had these other issues her because there was at least three

650
00:21:57.841 --> 00:22:02.841
other issues within that group that was qualified enough to overturn the death

651
00:22:03.001 --> 00:22:03.834
sentence.

652
00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.150
<v 1>And just so we're clear,</v>

653
00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:10.420
judge Edenfield was the United States district judge and he granted you relief

654
00:22:10.431 --> 00:22:13.180
when you first were under death sons?

655
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.610
Yes.

656
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:17.420
And then you're a case went back and forth between panels of the 11 circuit that

657
00:22:17.421 --> 00:22:21.290
is three judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th circuit went

658
00:22:21.291 --> 00:22:25.060
on box so that the entire 12 member court examined it all.

659
00:22:25.061 --> 00:22:26.510
It only went to the supreme court.

660
00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:27.410
But the Supreme Court,

661
00:22:27.411 --> 00:22:30.910
after hearing the argument sent the case back without making a decision.

662
00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.830
I said to consider it in light of another decision.

663
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.530
And ultimately,

664
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:37.370
uh,

665
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:38.420
you lost on,

666
00:22:38.421 --> 00:22:40.190
on that decision at the 11th circuit.

667
00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:40.910
<v 2>Well,</v>

668
00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:41.091
yeah,

669
00:22:41.091 --> 00:22:41.631
I lost,

670
00:22:41.631 --> 00:22:41.930
I haven't,

671
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.250
but they never really heard it,

672
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.940
uh,

673
00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:48.170
because the Supreme Court told them to look at it from the perspective of tig

674
00:22:48.171 --> 00:22:48.861
versus lane,

675
00:22:48.861 --> 00:22:53.450
the new case that they had decided on the year prior and when it went back to

676
00:22:53.451 --> 00:22:54.320
the 11th circuit,

677
00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:55.550
they didn't even look at that.

678
00:22:55.580 --> 00:23:00.580
They went back to the issues of 1984 when I had the execution date.

679
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.950
And from there they just didn't denied.

680
00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.950
And I got a new execution date for August the 22nd,

681
00:23:06.951 --> 00:23:07.784
1990

682
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.060
<v 1>and uh,</v>

683
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:12.310
that turned out to be the critical time,

684
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:13.290
right?

685
00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:13.630
Yeah,

686
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:14.321
<v 2>absolutely.</v>

687
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:15.154
Yeah.

688
00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:15.730
Um,

689
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:20.730
on the 21st of August at 10 30 in the morning to assistant warden came,

690
00:23:21.521 --> 00:23:25.150
I was in the visiting room and he told me that the United States Supreme Court

691
00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:30.570
had given me a 30 day stay and I called my lawyer Dang developer and he said,

692
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.690
Yup,

693
00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.130
we got a 30 day stay.

694
00:23:33.131 --> 00:23:33.731
And you know,

695
00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:36.280
since the court has my case,

696
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:41.080
the Georgia border part in paroles would not look at it because the case is

697
00:23:41.081 --> 00:23:44.590
being reviewed by the Supreme Court because they never,

698
00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:48.410
they never interfere with any of the courts there was looking at the case

699
00:23:48.411 --> 00:23:53.360
because the pro board is like the rat last resort in Georgia anyway.

700
00:23:53.361 --> 00:23:55.430
So we're like,

701
00:23:55.431 --> 00:23:55.821
fine,

702
00:23:55.821 --> 00:23:56.070
you know,

703
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.170
Supreme Court got it.

704
00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.820
So I go back to the visiting room and while I'm in the visiting room that day,

705
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:06.500
somehow the parole board decided that they would hear my case and everybody

706
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:11.180
involved was notified and the victim's family came to the parole board on their

707
00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:16.181
own without any coaching from anyone and said that we've been writing Billy for

708
00:24:16.191 --> 00:24:19.520
the last 16 and a half years and he is our brother and you cannot kill him.

709
00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.530
We lost one family member.

710
00:24:21.531 --> 00:24:25.160
We don't want to lose another one as well as,

711
00:24:25.161 --> 00:24:25.994
um,

712
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.640
my dad testifying and my sister,

713
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.040
even the first lawyer that I had,

714
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:36.610
he came and he testified and explained to the parole board why it was his

715
00:24:37.191 --> 00:24:38.510
decision to plead me guilty.

716
00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:42.050
Now he didn't tell the truth about his brother being a judge and all that.

717
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.800
The story he told them was that he felt,

718
00:24:45.801 --> 00:24:50.801
because in Jefferson county there had been another robbery of a banker and his

719
00:24:52.461 --> 00:24:52.851
wife,

720
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:57.851
they had been tortured and killed in your house was six months prior to my

721
00:24:57.951 --> 00:24:58.640
crime.

722
00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.760
And that the key felt that the county was still in such an uproar,

723
00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.610
that nobody could get a fair trial that county.

724
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.091
It had.

725
00:25:05.091 --> 00:25:06.620
I went to a jury,

726
00:25:06.621 --> 00:25:11.210
I would have been sentenced to death and he said that was his reasoning and that

727
00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:14.810
when he thought that by going directly to the judge,

728
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.070
he felt that the judge it understand that this is not a death penalty case and

729
00:25:19.071 --> 00:25:20.540
would give me a life sentence.

730
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:25.380
But he didn't take any consideration nor understand that the sheriff ran the

731
00:25:25.381 --> 00:25:28.460
county and at the sheriff told the judge is giving me a death sentence.

732
00:25:28.461 --> 00:25:29.294
And that was it.

733
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:30.610
Uh,

734
00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:35.320
<v 1>also the judges are elected so the judge is going to stand for reelection after</v>

735
00:25:35.321 --> 00:25:36.154
he sends us you.

736
00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:36.940
Yeah.

737
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.121
Yeah.

738
00:25:37.121 --> 00:25:38.600
So that probably was a factor as well.

739
00:25:38.601 --> 00:25:42.520
And I'm mother Theresa was also involved in the parole.

740
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:43.580
<v 2>Yup.</v>

741
00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:48.320
A friend of mine named John Deere who was a high school student when I started

742
00:25:48.321 --> 00:25:48.681
writing.

743
00:25:48.681 --> 00:25:49.430
Yeah.

744
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:54.430
Had went to high school college and he became a Jesuit priests and he went and

745
00:25:54.981 --> 00:25:57.770
spent a couple of years in India with Mother Teresa.

746
00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:03.050
And so he was writing me from India and so she was well aware of my situation.

747
00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:07.790
So John is back in the United States by this time and I got this new execution

748
00:26:07.791 --> 00:26:09.260
date and he finds out,

749
00:26:09.261 --> 00:26:12.290
so he calls her and asked her to call me.

750
00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:12.831
I mean,

751
00:26:12.831 --> 00:26:15.680
he caught a parole board and she tells him that,

752
00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.290
well,

753
00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:18.680
if they want to talk to her Dynisha call her.

754
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:19.460
Well,

755
00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.410
I don't know how it came about,

756
00:26:21.411 --> 00:26:21.990
but,

757
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:25.070
but they tell me since I was in a busy room and I had no idea it's,

758
00:26:25.071 --> 00:26:25.940
this is happening,

759
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.170
that uh,

760
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:31.820
the chairman of the parole board stopped the hearing and had a press conference.

761
00:26:31.821 --> 00:26:36.080
You said mother Theresa wanted to talk to him and he calls her and she tells him

762
00:26:36.081 --> 00:26:38.300
that he needed to do what Jesus would do.

763
00:26:38.301 --> 00:26:43.290
And then all five members of the parole board folk to commute my sentence from a

764
00:26:43.291 --> 00:26:44.910
death sentence to her license.

765
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:45.600
Okay.

766
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.460
<v 1>So suddenly you're no longer under death sin.</v>

767
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.663
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

768
00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:50.751
All of a sudden,

769
00:26:50.751 --> 00:26:51.400
just,

770
00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.510
just like that one day your death row inmate,

771
00:26:53.511 --> 00:26:54.470
the next day you're not,

772
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.760
<v 1>one day you're in chains.</v>

773
00:26:56.761 --> 00:26:58.830
You can't move anywhere without two guards.

774
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:02.400
The next day they give you a piece of paper and tell you to go to another part

775
00:27:02.401 --> 00:27:02.920
of the person.

776
00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.753
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

777
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.120
Now only that the,

778
00:27:05.121 --> 00:27:07.090
when I got off death row,

779
00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:07.590
uh,

780
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:11.770
one of the captains who used to work on death row came down to the cell block

781
00:27:11.771 --> 00:27:14.590
that I was in and he told the guard,

782
00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.750
the guard to bring me out of cell block.

783
00:27:16.751 --> 00:27:17.111
And he said,

784
00:27:17.111 --> 00:27:17.381
Billy,

785
00:27:17.381 --> 00:27:21.070
you've been here 10 years and you have only seen death row.

786
00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:21.401
He said,

787
00:27:21.401 --> 00:27:22.990
you see this long hallway?

788
00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:23.980
He said,

789
00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.300
I'm over this hallway,

790
00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:27.200
and he gave me a broom and he said,

791
00:27:27.201 --> 00:27:28.930
he just got in this hall all day.

792
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:29.910
He said,

793
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:31.610
if anybody say anything to you,

794
00:27:31.611 --> 00:27:32.351
you tell him,

795
00:27:32.351 --> 00:27:33.041
come see me.

796
00:27:33.041 --> 00:27:35.560
So I go from being locked up too.

797
00:27:35.561 --> 00:27:40.180
Now I'm out in the hallway by myself up to nine o'clock at night,

798
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.130
just walking back and forth with a broom.

799
00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.570
<v 1>Now you said you'd been there 10 years.</v>

800
00:27:44.571 --> 00:27:47.780
That's because you started out on the old death row in Reidsville,

801
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.490
the Georgia state prison.

802
00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.380
And then after six years it moves

803
00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.860
<v 2>to the Georgia diagnostic prison,</v>

804
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.870
which is in Jackson,

805
00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.340
Georgia.

806
00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.270
While I'll stay in the county jail three years.

807
00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:57.780
Right.

808
00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.300
I was in the county jail three years in Reidsville,

809
00:28:00.301 --> 00:28:02.880
three years and then we were all moved to Jackson.

810
00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:03.470
Right,

811
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:04.303
right.

812
00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.420
Let me just one other last pieces

813
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:07.790
<v 1>does that hadn't been mentioned,</v>

814
00:28:07.791 --> 00:28:07.991
but,

815
00:28:07.991 --> 00:28:10.010
but certainly should be a,

816
00:28:10.011 --> 00:28:11.270
is your faith

817
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.050
<v 2>and spirituality.</v>

818
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.943
How,

819
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.290
how did that come into play in your case?

820
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.513
Well,

821
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.410
what happened when I was in the county jail,

822
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.210
my cousin wrote me a letter and she said,

823
00:28:21.211 --> 00:28:21.690
Billy,

824
00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:25.620
I know you have a death sentence and you need to accept Christ in your life

825
00:28:25.621 --> 00:28:26.940
since you're going to be executed.

826
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.280
And so I'll flip it.

827
00:28:29.281 --> 00:28:30.480
And I wrote her back and told her,

828
00:28:30.481 --> 00:28:30.840
I don't,

829
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.673
you know,

830
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.581
I'm getting ready to die.

831
00:28:32.581 --> 00:28:33.810
What I need to do this for.

832
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:34.530
Well,

833
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:35.700
she never wrote me back.

834
00:28:35.701 --> 00:28:39.660
She just told her pastor in Ohio who called a pastor in Rome,

835
00:28:39.661 --> 00:28:40.494
Georgia,

836
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:45.660
and this pastor and his wife drove 250 miles to the county jail,

837
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.580
didn't have an appointment,

838
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.200
didn't tell anybody who was coming.

839
00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:51.040
Just showed up and in.

840
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.730
That's amazing to me because this sheriff was so mean.

841
00:28:53.731 --> 00:28:55.920
He didn't let nobody do anything.

842
00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.510
But however they convinced him to bring me downstairs from matter of fact,

843
00:29:00.511 --> 00:29:02.430
he came upstairs personally and got me.

844
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:02.911
He said,

845
00:29:02.911 --> 00:29:03.211
listen,

846
00:29:03.211 --> 00:29:05.160
there's a preacher downstairs and went to see you.

847
00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.050
And so when I came down,

848
00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:07.700
uh,

849
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:08.461
Bishop Guthrie said,

850
00:29:08.461 --> 00:29:08.761
listen,

851
00:29:08.761 --> 00:29:09.110
son,

852
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:12.810
we know that you killed a man and that you've been sentenced to death,

853
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:17.100
but we want you to know that there was a just judge and his name is Jesus

854
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:17.430
Christ.

855
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:18.600
And God always does.

856
00:29:18.601 --> 00:29:19.434
Right?

857
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:20.460
And He loves you.

858
00:29:20.461 --> 00:29:25.080
And what really touched my heart was the fact that here's the people telling me

859
00:29:25.081 --> 00:29:26.670
that even though you killed somebody,

860
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.130
God still loves you and we love you.

861
00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.190
It's piece somebody who accepted me for me,

862
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:31.890
for,

863
00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:32.371
for me,

864
00:29:32.371 --> 00:29:34.350
being who I was at that point,

865
00:29:34.351 --> 00:29:36.660
at the lowest point in my life.

866
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.750
And it made such an impact that it,

867
00:29:38.751 --> 00:29:39.810
it changed my life.

868
00:29:39.811 --> 00:29:40.321
And I said,

869
00:29:40.321 --> 00:29:41.154
well,

870
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.040
what they have is what I need.

871
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:49.180
And accepting Christ changed my life dramatically.

872
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.260
Dropped dramatically.

873
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.640
And you actually taught Bible study classes while you were on death row?

874
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:55.121
Yeah.

875
00:29:55.121 --> 00:29:55.850
Not only that,

876
00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:59.500
teach Bible study classes I studied and I got a bachelor's degree while I was on

877
00:29:59.501 --> 00:30:00.730
death row in theology.

878
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:01.990
But it helped me.

879
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:07.880
The only way you can do prison time is helping others because the more used to

880
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:10.360
thinking about yourself and think about your situation,

881
00:30:10.361 --> 00:30:11.350
the harder it is,

882
00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.540
the more you give out and help others,

883
00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:14.410
the easier it is.

884
00:30:14.411 --> 00:30:14.541
And,

885
00:30:14.541 --> 00:30:14.771
and,

886
00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:16.630
and actually it's that way in life too.

887
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:22.020
And so teaching a Bible class has really helped me because anytime you got to

888
00:30:23.891 --> 00:30:24.820
teach somebody something,

889
00:30:24.821 --> 00:30:27.550
you have to know more than what you know more than what you teach it.

890
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:29.110
He's got to know more on what they know.

891
00:30:29.111 --> 00:30:30.430
So you have to study more.

892
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:35.760
And it really helped me and it gave me something quality to do and to see

893
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:40.270
inmates life change really,

894
00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:41.170
really helped me.

895
00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.240
And let me ask you this,

896
00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:48.241
a year after the board committed your sentence from death to life imprisonment,

897
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.460
it parole to yes.

898
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:52.390
Which was,

899
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.310
which was a miracle.

900
00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:54.960
Yeah,

901
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.470
a miracle in itself because when they said that they commuted the sentence,

902
00:30:59.471 --> 00:31:04.471
they also said I have to serve 25 more years before they would think about

903
00:31:04.511 --> 00:31:05.560
looking at my case.

904
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.210
Now let me ask you this,

905
00:31:07.211 --> 00:31:10.150
to the minister who are Bishop Guthrie,

906
00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.390
the person who first came to see you first got arrested.

907
00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.230
Did he play any role once you were released?

908
00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:18.221
What?

909
00:31:18.221 --> 00:31:19.480
Not only once I was released,

910
00:31:19.481 --> 00:31:22.550
but all through he constantly visit and he constantly wrote.

911
00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:23.560
He never stopped.

912
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:28.630
And so the day that I got out he was there and they picked me up and took me up

913
00:31:28.631 --> 00:31:29.464
to Rome.

914
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.513
Uh,

915
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:33.310
and by the time we got back to Rome,

916
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:37.750
it was like 11 o'clock at night and he took me to his house.

917
00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.171
He said,

918
00:31:38.171 --> 00:31:38.411
all right,

919
00:31:38.411 --> 00:31:39.820
take those prison clothes off.

920
00:31:39.821 --> 00:31:40.654
Did they give you,

921
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.660
and his is like the first suit I ever had in my life.

922
00:31:43.661 --> 00:31:45.430
He gives me some about the same size,

923
00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:46.720
give me some new shoes.

924
00:31:46.721 --> 00:31:47.021
And he said,

925
00:31:47.021 --> 00:31:47.231
all right,

926
00:31:47.231 --> 00:31:48.064
come with me.

927
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:50.440
And then he takes me to the church and I'm trying to figure it out.

928
00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:55.110
Who goes to church at like 11 o'clock at night and he said,

929
00:31:55.111 --> 00:31:56.680
we're going into the church and it's dark,

930
00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:56.951
you know,

931
00:31:56.951 --> 00:31:59.380
so I'm still wondering what is going on.

932
00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:01.870
And we go through the church into the saints,

933
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:02.701
into the sea,

934
00:32:02.701 --> 00:32:06.730
the fellowship hall and airs like 300 people sitting there.

935
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.450
So he walked me up to the front and sits me over to the side and he start

936
00:32:10.451 --> 00:32:11.231
talking to the people,

937
00:32:11.231 --> 00:32:11.411
said,

938
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:12.080
listen,

939
00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:12.380
uh,

940
00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:17.380
I want you to know that we had been praying for Billy moral for the last 17 and

941
00:32:17.381 --> 00:32:18.310
a half years.

942
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.950
And a lot of times we pray,

943
00:32:20.951 --> 00:32:25.600
we don't see our answer are we prayed and we hope God too to give us an answer.

944
00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:26.141
He said,

945
00:32:26.141 --> 00:32:30.230
but I want you people to know that your prayers are answered because here's

946
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.300
Billy right here.

947
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:32.400
And he said,

948
00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.250
I come here.

949
00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:35.110
And from that point to this,

950
00:32:35.111 --> 00:32:36.330
I've been talking to people.

951
00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:37.251
That's how the,

952
00:32:37.251 --> 00:32:38.320
that's how that started.

953
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:40.040
And he also gave you a job.

954
00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:40.610
Yeah,

955
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.710
my job was his personal chauffeur.

956
00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.240
How would you live in his house?

957
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:45.680
I lived in this house.

958
00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:51.220
And you have basically been involved in a ministry ever since you were released.

959
00:32:51.861 --> 00:32:52.850
Is that a fair statement?

960
00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:53.421
Well,

961
00:32:53.421 --> 00:32:56.420
it's a fair statement for me being bombed in Mr and the outside,

962
00:32:56.421 --> 00:32:59.040
but I was involved in the ministry on the inside too.

963
00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:00.231
Yeah.

964
00:33:00.231 --> 00:33:05.231
So for the last almost four years I've been in ministry in trying to help people

965
00:33:07.701 --> 00:33:11.090
know that the change that will really change somebody's got in their life.

966
00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.200
All right,

967
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.651
Billy Moore,

968
00:33:12.651 --> 00:33:14.730
thank you for coming and thank you for sharing a,

969
00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:19.730
an a remarkable story of your time on death row and ultimately your commutation

970
00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:22.490
and in the life you've lived in the community since that time.
