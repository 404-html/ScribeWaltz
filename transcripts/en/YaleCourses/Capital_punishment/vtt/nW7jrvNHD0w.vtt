1
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.450
In this segment of the class.

2
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:16.230
What I would like to do is take a look at the sort of geography of the death

3
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:17.280
penalty and most importantly,

4
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:20.010
the historical factors that led to that.

5
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.383
Uh,

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.060
there's a lot of information about the death pony available,

7
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.631
uh,

8
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:25.464
on the,

9
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.070
uh,

10
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.290
website of the death penalty information center,

11
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:31.810
which www death penalty info.org g,

12
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.340
uh,

13
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.580
I would refer you to that for things like which states have the death penalty,

14
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:36.570
which states don't,

15
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.200
uh,

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.240
how many people are on death row in each state,

17
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.440
how many executions.

18
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.140
All of that sort of information is collected there.

19
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.601
Uh,

20
00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:44.520
there's also evidence,

21
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:44.800
uh,

22
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.301
or excuse me,

23
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:46.230
information about,

24
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.710
uh,

25
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.710
some of what we will be talking about over the course@asecondclassjustice.com.

26
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.970
Uh,

27
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.160
but I just want to mention a couple of things.

28
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.640
Uh,

29
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.460
first to look at executions by regions.

30
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.000
Uh,

31
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.140
in the United States is,

32
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:01.974
we can see,

33
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.320
and this is since 1976 as I said,

34
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:08.880
the death penny was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1972 in

35
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:11.820
the case of Furman versus Georgia 1976,

36
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:13.650
the supreme court upheld the death penalty,

37
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.210
at least have some states.

38
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.901
Uh,

39
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:20.730
and so we really measure the modern death Polly by what's happened,

40
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.180
uh,

41
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.180
since 1976 under the new statutes that we'll be talking about in the next

42
00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:27.114
session.

43
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.013
Um,

44
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.470
uh,

45
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.430
since that time,

46
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:33.480
this is from 1976 until the end of 2012.

47
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.583
Uh,

48
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.430
so you can see over a thousand executions in the south,

49
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.061
uh,

50
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:41.000
only 155 in the Midwest,

51
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.680
82 in the west and only for a in the northeast.

52
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.290
Uh,

53
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.290
if we look at the states that have carried out over 50 executions to since 1976,

54
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:53.130
we see Texas,

55
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.700
uh,

56
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.660
by far in a way,

57
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:55.770
almost 500.

58
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:57.330
At the end of 2012,

59
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.590
only two other states,

60
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:00.570
over a hundred Virginia in Oklahoma.

61
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.111
Uh,

62
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:01.890
and then,

63
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.161
uh,

64
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:02.994
other states,

65
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.810
uh,

66
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.643
that have,

67
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.980
uh,

68
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.220
are above Georgia 50 to Alabama and 55 Missouri.

69
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.671
Uh,

70
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:09.990
it's 68 in Florida.

71
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:10.890
It's 74,

72
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.380
uh,

73
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.450
that are above that level.

74
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.000
Uh,

75
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.220
this is an interesting way to look at how the death penalty is imposed in the

76
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:18.054
United States.

77
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.880
This is less than 1% of all the counties in the United States.

78
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.421
In fact,

79
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:26.100
it's less than 1% of the counties in states that have the death penalty.

80
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:26.281
I mean,

81
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:28.110
here's another way to look at it.

82
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.170
All of the counties in red are Texas counties.

83
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.891
Uh,

84
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:33.480
and you see out of the top 10,

85
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.480
only Oklahoma City and Saint Louis County,

86
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:37.314
Missouri,

87
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.801
uh,

88
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:38.271
are,

89
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:40.770
are in the highest number of counties.

90
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.461
Uh,

91
00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.020
and then when we get to the last five,

92
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:44.490
we do have counties of Arizona,

93
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:44.970
Ohio,

94
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.190
Alabama to Alabama counties there.

95
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.731
Well,

96
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:48.210
what,

97
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.780
what's the reason for the fact that so many of these executions are in the south

98
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:54.120
that our largest death rows or in the south?

99
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.380
Uh,

100
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.060
well,

101
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.400
uh,

102
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.080
part of the reason is slavery.

103
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.050
Uh,

104
00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.780
the,

105
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.220
uh,

106
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.480
fact of the matter was,

107
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.400
uh,

108
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.440
the time of slavery in this country.

109
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.560
The southern states had to deal with the captive population.

110
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.480
There was always a threat of some sort of slavers revolt or organizing of

111
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:14.300
slaves.

112
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.510
Uh,

113
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.880
in three of the southern states,

114
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:20.170
there were actually more Africans in slavery than there were white people.

115
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.360
So it was a very delicate,

116
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.230
uh,

117
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.590
situation in terms of a controlling these people.

118
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:27.550
And as a result,

119
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:28.071
uh,

120
00:03:28.071 --> 00:03:29.380
a number of,

121
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.980
uh,

122
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.510
death polling provisions applied to slaves and even freed slaves,

123
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.070
many capital statutes,

124
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.821
uh,

125
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:37.654
applied,

126
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.960
uh,

127
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.250
only two blacks,

128
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.790
uh,

129
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.470
whether slaves or free.

130
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.521
Uh,

131
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:43.061
and,

132
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:43.600
uh,

133
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.931
of course,

134
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:46.900
in colonial times when the country first started,

135
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.591
uh,

136
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:48.720
we didn't have any prisons.

137
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.270
Uh,

138
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.700
the only way you punish people was by killing them,

139
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.390
uh,

140
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.500
cutting off their fingers,

141
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:54.340
branding them,

142
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.510
a whipping them,

143
00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:56.330
which was a,

144
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.400
a punishment at that time,

145
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:58.480
putting people in stocks.

146
00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.050
Uh,

147
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.050
any of those punishments today would seem pretty primitive.

148
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.530
Uh,

149
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.880
but the one that we still have,

150
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.430
uh,

151
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.880
is the death pony a lot.

152
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.500
We will see in the northern states,

153
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.730
uh,

154
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.770
once prisons became available,

155
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.050
the great decline in the use of the death Poli.

156
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.740
Uh,

157
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.750
but that was not the case in the south.

158
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.130
And the reason for that,

159
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.760
uh,

160
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.450
was,

161
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:19.750
uh,

162
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.583
slavery.

163
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.981
Uh,

164
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:25.981
what the northern states did was move away from the death pony.

165
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:27.810
In fact,

166
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.001
uh,

167
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:29.230
even before the civil war,

168
00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:31.000
Michigan in 1946,

169
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.570
uh,

170
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.870
later Rhode Island and Wisconsin abolish the death penalty altogether.

171
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.760
But in the other northern states,

172
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:40.870
the death penalty was increasingly limited only to murder cases,

173
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:41.980
homicide cases,

174
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.761
uh,

175
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:43.990
whereas in the south,

176
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.591
uh,

177
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:49.300
although the legislature's did away with the death pony for some crimes against,

178
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.810
uh,

179
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.640
it's because,

180
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.010
uh,

181
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.270
crimes committed by whites.

182
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.901
Uh,

183
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:57.901
it was still used for all sorts of crimes against black people because it was

184
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:04.381
seen as in dispensable to managing 2 million people who were in slavery.

185
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.861
Uh,

186
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:06.700
and so,

187
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:07.061
uh,

188
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:11.050
even distributing leaflets was a capital crime and Louisiana,

189
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.591
uh,

190
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:14.050
as well as all sorts of other crimes like burglary,

191
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.753
larceny,

192
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:16.623
robbery,

193
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.501
rape,

194
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:17.951
of course,

195
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:18.311
was a,

196
00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:20.560
it was a capital crime and many people were,

197
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.130
uh,

198
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.620
either lynched or sentenced to death for,

199
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.340
uh,

200
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.173
for lynching.

201
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.040
So that resulted in the end of the war comes and,

202
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.000
uh,

203
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.840
the southern states still have capital punishment and it becomes even more

204
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:35.860
important perhaps,

205
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.311
uh,

206
00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:37.144
after,

207
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.931
uh,

208
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:38.764
the war,

209
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:39.281
uh,

210
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:41.050
the Supreme Court that's keeps me,

211
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:45.700
the Congress passed the 14th amendment to the United States constitution,

212
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:50.701
providing that no state would co denying any person the equal protection of the

213
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:51.221
law.

214
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:53.350
This is adopted in 1868.

215
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.760
Uh,

216
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.760
and the hope of this was that the free blacks in the south would be protected by

217
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.370
federal enforcement under the equal protection clause.

218
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:08.570
And that the state would,

219
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:13.160
is a no state shall deny any person the equal protection of the law.

220
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.121
However,

221
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:16.760
that didn't really last too long.

222
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.750
Uh,

223
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.910
not long afterwards.

224
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.030
The Colfax massacre in Louisiana where a group of black people who have been

225
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:25.610
deputized were holed up in the court house.

226
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:26.270
Uh,

227
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.590
they were attacked by whites.

228
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.050
A number of the blacks were killed.

229
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.273
Uh,

230
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.930
very few people were prosecuted.

231
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:36.860
But one of the prosecution's made its way to the Supreme Court of the United

232
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:37.130
States.

233
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.581
Uh,

234
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:38.540
and the court said,

235
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.500
you can't prosecute this because the amendment says no state.

236
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.491
Well,

237
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:46.270
the people who attacked the courthouse,

238
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.630
we're not the state.

239
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.553
It was a mob,

240
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.330
a Klu Klux Klan.

241
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.870
Uh,

242
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.703
basically.

243
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.251
Uh,

244
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:56.810
and so the clause was interpreted in a way that actually protected the Klu Klux

245
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.170
Klan,

246
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.530
uh,

247
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.530
rather than holding the local officials responsible for not having a,

248
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.890
enforced the law and protected the people at the courthouse.

249
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.630
But the case that really caused the most damage was one that came a little

250
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:11.631
later.

251
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:12.710
United States versus,

252
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.450
uh,

253
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.283
Reece,

254
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:14.900
uh,

255
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.830
which involves some people in Kentucky who were refusing to register black

256
00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:19.664
people to vote,

257
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.661
uh,

258
00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:22.160
and they were prosecuted for that.

259
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.630
And the Supreme Court,

260
00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:24.890
United States versus Reese,

261
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.400
uh,

262
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.180
said,

263
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:26.870
uh,

264
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.960
when do you not only have to show that they intended to do that,

265
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.170
but that their motive was race.

266
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.030
Now this is a very difficult thing to prove in all criminal prosecutions.

267
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:42.920
Generally you prove intent that a person intended the national natural and

268
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:45.170
probable consequences of their action,

269
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.390
but proving why someone acted,

270
00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:49.430
did they act for racial reasons.

271
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.001
This,

272
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:53.000
as we will see all the way through the course,

273
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:53.631
uh,

274
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:57.950
becomes a tremendous hurdle to enforcing a,

275
00:07:57.951 --> 00:08:01.580
or preventing racial discrimination from taking place,

276
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:02.151
uh,

277
00:08:02.151 --> 00:08:03.350
in the criminal courts,

278
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:04.603
um,

279
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:05.820
after,

280
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.380
uh,

281
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.161
the civil war.

282
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:07.994
Of course,

283
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:08.923
a lynching,

284
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:09.620
uh,

285
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.453
terrorism,

286
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.210
uh,

287
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.043
became,

288
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:12.680
uh,

289
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.390
quite common as a way to preserve white supremacy as a way to keep the newly

290
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:18.350
freed slaves.

291
00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:19.700
And pretty much the,

292
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.660
uh,

293
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.680
the bondage that,

294
00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:22.610
that they had been in,

295
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:23.510
uh,

296
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.340
this,

297
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:24.710
uh,

298
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.500
phenomenon and the fact that it happens so much inspired,

299
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.190
uh,

300
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.090
Billie holiday,

301
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:29.841
uh,

302
00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:30.674
to,

303
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:31.543
uh,

304
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.440
perform this song.

305
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.023
Strange fruit.

306
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.953
Yes.

307
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.713
Yeah.

308
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.740
Black body swinging.

309
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:56.853
<v 0>Ooh.</v>

310
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.350
In the summer.

311
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.990
Strange food.

312
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:04.900
Hang in.

313
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:11.650
Ron Pastors scene.

314
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.133
MMM.

315
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.533
Jean

316
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.730
missed it.

317
00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.360
Set up men.

318
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:38.920
No.

319
00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:39.753
Yeah.

320
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.223
Sweet.

321
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:53.403
Huh?

322
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.180
He's a fruit.

323
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:03.551
Oh,

324
00:10:03.551 --> 00:10:05.020
the curl.

325
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.423
Well,

326
00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:11.763
yeah.

327
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:15.300
Oh,

328
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.150
no way.

329
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.273
Ah,

330
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:26.660
Bra

331
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.230
two.

332
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.620
John [inaudible]

333
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:44.463
Niche,

334
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.133
correct.

335
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.670
Ah,

336
00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.600
<v 1>strain fruit was written by,</v>

337
00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:03.190
uh,

338
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.490
Abel Marpol under the name Louis Allen.

339
00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:07.450
Uh,

340
00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.030
Billie holiday performing this song brought a lot of attention.

341
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:10.660
Uh,

342
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.493
to lynching,

343
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:11.961
uh,

344
00:11:11.961 --> 00:11:15.640
as did the work of Ida B wells and the Naacp,

345
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.300
uh,

346
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.850
as this was happening so frequently,

347
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:19.360
uh,

348
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.620
during this time period,

349
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.340
uh,

350
00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.730
strange fruit actually made it to the 16th place on the charts,

351
00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:25.451
uh,

352
00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:27.580
in music in 1939.

353
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:28.993
Uh,

354
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.170
this is a execution or this,

355
00:11:32.171 --> 00:11:32.530
uh,

356
00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.120
hanging of a Reuben Stacey,

357
00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:34.781
uh,

358
00:11:34.781 --> 00:11:35.471
in Florida.

359
00:11:35.471 --> 00:11:39.910
And I just offered to show the little girls dressed up in their Sunday best who

360
00:11:39.911 --> 00:11:40.560
are here,

361
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:40.780
uh,

362
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:41.613
watching,

363
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:41.800
uh,

364
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.300
this lynching in Fort Lauderdale,

365
00:11:43.301 --> 00:11:44.020
Florida.

366
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:44.300
Uh,

367
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.550
in 1935,

368
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.420
uh,

369
00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.040
often lynchings were,

370
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.420
uh,

371
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.020
somewhat of a carnival type event where the families coming,

372
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.840
people bring in picnics and all of those sorts of things.

373
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.520
A lot of the leading citizens,

374
00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:58.150
uh,

375
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.960
there,

376
00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.230
uh,

377
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.580
but almost no prosecutions.

378
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:02.920
Almost every report of a lynching would say,

379
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:03.410
uh,

380
00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.480
that it was conducted,

381
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.200
uh,

382
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.240
at the hands of a party's unknown.

383
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.781
Uh,

384
00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:12.410
even though it had all been public and everybody knew exactly who had had,

385
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.390
had been participating.

386
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.220
This is launching here is of um,

387
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.553
um,

388
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:17.763
uh,

389
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.420
Jesse Washington and Waco,

390
00:12:19.421 --> 00:12:19.931
Texas,

391
00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:22.870
15,000 people were there for it,

392
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:23.441
uh,

393
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:26.050
in the readings that accompany the classes.

394
00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:30.850
A lot more information both about lynching and about the efforts to end it by

395
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.220
Ida B wells and the Naacp and,

396
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:34.181
and others.

397
00:12:34.181 --> 00:12:35.560
And some statistics about it,

398
00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:36.160
uh,

399
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.750
from the Tuskegee Institute,

400
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:38.320
uh,

401
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:38.651
which,

402
00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:39.940
which started monitoring,

403
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.180
uh,

404
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:40.990
lynchings.

405
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.241
Uh,

406
00:12:41.241 --> 00:12:46.241
the point worth mentioning here is that Congress never passed an anti-lynching

407
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:46.970
act.

408
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:47.200
Uh,

409
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.940
even when President Truman asked for it,

410
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.600
a congress didn't pass an anti lynching act even though there's terrorism was

411
00:12:52.601 --> 00:12:53.261
going on.

412
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:57.220
And you look today when we pass terrorism hacks without a great deal of thought

413
00:12:57.221 --> 00:12:57.881
going into them,

414
00:12:57.881 --> 00:12:58.660
perhaps,

415
00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:59.440
uh,

416
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.790
over and over again,

417
00:13:00.791 --> 00:13:01.181
it was,

418
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:01.930
uh,

419
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:02.111
uh,

420
00:13:02.111 --> 00:13:04.360
efforts were made to pass anti-lynching laws.

421
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:04.901
Uh,

422
00:13:04.901 --> 00:13:07.720
but the southern senators led by Richard Russell of Georgia,

423
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.501
uh,

424
00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:10.150
would always oppose them,

425
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:10.800
uh,

426
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.530
and all its opposed them under the guise of the constitution.

427
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.390
Federalism states rights.

428
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.380
A lot of the arguments that we're going to hear all through the course with

429
00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:21.280
regard to,

430
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:21.820
uh,

431
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.320
the role of the federal government's.

432
00:13:23.321 --> 00:13:26.830
In reviewing a capital cases and so forth.

433
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.293
Uh,

434
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.570
these two lawyers are worth mentioning as people who stand out in the history of

435
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.170
this troubled time.

436
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.040
Uh,

437
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:37.360
Noah partner and styles.

438
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:38.180
Hutchins,

439
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:38.830
uh,

440
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.150
Ed Johnson was,

441
00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:40.510
uh,

442
00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.390
convicted of a crime of rape and Chattanooga,

443
00:13:43.391 --> 00:13:44.224
Tennessee.

444
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.220
These two African American lawyers had somehow managed to have a successful law

445
00:13:48.221 --> 00:13:49.960
practice in Chattanooga,

446
00:13:49.961 --> 00:13:51.850
Tennessee at the turn of the century,

447
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:52.780
around 1900.

448
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:53.830
Uh,

449
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.120
somehow they were,

450
00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.020
uh,

451
00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.190
succeeding in that.

452
00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.060
Uh,

453
00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:03.060
ed Johnson's father comes and talks to Noah parden about taking the case of Ed

454
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:04.480
Johnson.

455
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.140
Uh,

456
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.910
he goes to his partner styles.

457
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:07.331
Hutchins.

458
00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:10.000
They have to know that if they take this case,

459
00:14:10.001 --> 00:14:12.340
nothing is ever going to be the same again.

460
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.530
And yet styles Hutchson says,

461
00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.460
uh,

462
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.460
to us much it's been given and much is required.

463
00:14:18.461 --> 00:14:19.540
They take the case,

464
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.120
no pardon goes to Washington,

465
00:14:22.121 --> 00:14:25.510
argues before Justice Harlan obtains a stay of execution.

466
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:29.560
A mob that night breaks into the jail,

467
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.270
takes that Johnson out,

468
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.830
hangs him over the bridge there in Chattanooga,

469
00:14:35.831 --> 00:14:38.710
the river that goes through town riddled with bullets.

470
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:39.790
Uh,

471
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.320
and just a short time after that,

472
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.190
uh,

473
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.480
Noah parden in styles,

474
00:14:43.481 --> 00:14:47.140
Hutchins had to close their law practice and leave Chattanooga and neither ever

475
00:14:47.141 --> 00:14:47.974
came back again.

476
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.030
Uh,

477
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.500
I would come into your book by,

478
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:50.940
uh,

479
00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.000
Leroy Phillips and Mark Cureton,

480
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.040
a contempt of court,

481
00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:00.020
which describes this case and the historic work of these two lawyers who long

482
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:00.854
forgotten,

483
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.053
but who really,

484
00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:02.690
uh,

485
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.730
answered the call,

486
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.510
uh,

487
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.460
to stand up for justice in this particular case at enormous cost to them.

488
00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:10.970
Uh,

489
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:11.803
personally.

490
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:12.980
Um,

491
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.980
the next part a and an a coming this time of lynching was convict leasing.

492
00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:24.461
I recommend a couple of books on this to really get an in depth a sense of how

493
00:15:24.771 --> 00:15:27.020
pervasive convict leasing was.

494
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.281
Two books here,

495
00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:29.750
slavery by another name,

496
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:30.460
uh,

497
00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:31.670
and worse than slavery,

498
00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.940
a worse than slavery is by David Oshinsky and slavery by another name by Douglas

499
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:37.280
Blackmon,

500
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:37.641
uh,

501
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:38.930
which won the Pulitzer Prize.

502
00:15:38.931 --> 00:15:40.250
There's also a website,

503
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:40.881
uh,

504
00:15:40.881 --> 00:15:42.170
for slavery by another name,

505
00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:44.060
which has a great deal of information in it.

506
00:15:44.061 --> 00:15:44.240
And,

507
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.380
and I would recommend it,

508
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.593
uh,

509
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:46.970
uh,

510
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.570
this is about the practice that the criminal courts were engaged in,

511
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:51.763
uh,

512
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.040
after the civil war of leasing prisoners,

513
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.930
almost all black prisoners,

514
00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:57.620
uh,

515
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:02.180
leasing them to the plantations and the Turpentine camps and the railroads and

516
00:16:02.181 --> 00:16:03.860
the coal mines around Birmingham,

517
00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:04.694
Alabama,

518
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:05.300
uh,

519
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.133
to,

520
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.830
uh,

521
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:07.760
to do labor.

522
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:11.540
And the reason it was worse than slavery is because when people had slaves,

523
00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:13.790
they at least had some interest in their property.

524
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.331
Uh,

525
00:16:14.331 --> 00:16:15.410
the slave is property.

526
00:16:15.411 --> 00:16:16.670
But when you had convicts,

527
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.610
you literally had people who are disposable,

528
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.540
you could send the convicts in the mind and if the mine collapsed and killed

529
00:16:23.541 --> 00:16:24.374
them all,

530
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:28.370
it just simply a went to the sheriff and got some more.

531
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:29.421
Uh,

532
00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:29.931
and,

533
00:16:29.931 --> 00:16:30.081
uh,

534
00:16:30.081 --> 00:16:30.501
this,

535
00:16:30.501 --> 00:16:30.650
uh,

536
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.770
very brutal practice went on right up until the 1940s,

537
00:16:33.771 --> 00:16:34.221
after,

538
00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:34.940
uh,

539
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:35.271
uh,

540
00:16:35.271 --> 00:16:36.500
up until World War Two,

541
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.190
uh,

542
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:38.720
in Alabama,

543
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:39.441
uh,

544
00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:42.470
convicts were moved from job to job and rolling cages.

545
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.230
And not only was this the way they were moved from job to job,

546
00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:46.790
this was also their housing.

547
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:48.350
This was in Pitt County,

548
00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:49.990
North Carolina in,

549
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.560
um,

550
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:50.960
uh,

551
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.950
1910.

552
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.180
Uh,

553
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.350
this is the living quarters of a convict's working in coal mines near

554
00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:58.723
Birmingham,

555
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.020
Alabama.

556
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.771
Uh,

557
00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:02.240
as David was Chenowski says,

558
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:02.720
uh,

559
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.620
in his book,

560
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.170
a convict leasing was designed for black,

561
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:07.460
not white convicts.

562
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:11.930
It was possible to send a Negro to prison on almost any pretext,

563
00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:16.070
but is very difficult to get a white person there unless they had committed a

564
00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:17.090
very heinous crime.

565
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:22.810
The law allowed whites to exploit blacks without legal limit to withhold the

566
00:17:23.631 --> 00:17:28.631
most basic rights and safeguards while claiming to be indulgent.

567
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.410
A paternalistic,

568
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:30.880
uh,

569
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.713
in fair,

570
00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:32.150
uh,

571
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.983
worse,

572
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:37.820
it turned the criminal justice system into a corrupt and capricious entity,

573
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.000
utterly undeserving of respect.

574
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:41.541
I mean,

575
00:17:41.541 --> 00:17:43.370
this is the criminal justice system.

576
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:44.030
Uh,

577
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:44.810
during,

578
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:45.021
uh,

579
00:17:45.021 --> 00:17:46.010
the 20th century,

580
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:46.940
uh,

581
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.380
Dan Carter points out,

582
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.110
uh,

583
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.970
in his book about Scottsboro,

584
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.691
uh,

585
00:17:51.691 --> 00:17:53.910
that southerners discovered that lynching,

586
00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:54.780
uh,

587
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.470
finally discovered the lynchings were untidy and created a bad press.

588
00:17:58.910 --> 00:17:59.180
Uh,

589
00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.350
and they were increasingly replaced,

590
00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:02.120
uh,

591
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.040
by situations in which the southern legal system,

592
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:10.200
a prostituted itself to what the mob demanded basically would be.

593
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.790
Lynchers would just be told,

594
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:13.140
let the law take its course.

595
00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:17.970
In the understanding there of course was that the people would be arrested or

596
00:18:17.971 --> 00:18:19.410
they'd give them a quick trial.

597
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.260
We're just perfunctory representation before an all male,

598
00:18:22.261 --> 00:18:23.220
all white jury,

599
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.140
and they'd be sentenced to death.

600
00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.070
And promptly,

601
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:26.551
uh,

602
00:18:26.551 --> 00:18:28.110
executed as he says,

603
00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:29.100
such proceedings,

604
00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.173
uh,

605
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.020
had all the essence a of a mob violence,

606
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:34.800
uh,

607
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.470
shedding only it's most outward form,

608
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:41.430
the outright violence that that happened in the situation.

609
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:42.540
Uh,

610
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.220
this is the Scottsboro boys,

611
00:18:44.221 --> 00:18:49.221
the power versus Alabama landmark Supreme Court case about the right to counsel

612
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.180
for people facing the death penalty.

613
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:52.523
Uh,

614
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:58.010
these young men were tried in Scottsboro Alabama in 1931 and the people at

615
00:18:58.141 --> 00:19:02.370
Scottsboro actually thought that they had done something positive here.

616
00:19:02.371 --> 00:19:06.510
They didn't Lynch these young men who were charged with the rape of two white

617
00:19:06.511 --> 00:19:07.170
women.

618
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:07.621
Instead,

619
00:19:07.621 --> 00:19:08.730
they gave him a trial.

620
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:09.311
Now,

621
00:19:09.311 --> 00:19:10.170
much of a trial,

622
00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:10.920
uh,

623
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.780
trials that,

624
00:19:11.781 --> 00:19:12.030
uh,

625
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.620
started only a very short time,

626
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.430
uh,

627
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.540
after the crime.

628
00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:16.210
Uh,

629
00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.400
that went very fast.

630
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:20.760
There were dominated by mobs outside and inside the courthouse.

631
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:21.600
Uh,

632
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.250
but trials nonetheless.

633
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:23.911
Uh,

634
00:19:23.911 --> 00:19:24.780
and many people said,

635
00:19:24.781 --> 00:19:25.111
you know,

636
00:19:25.111 --> 00:19:27.090
if this had happened few years ago,

637
00:19:27.091 --> 00:19:28.590
we would have just lynched these young men.

638
00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.470
So why isn't everybody satisfied?

639
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:31.711
Well,

640
00:19:31.711 --> 00:19:31.981
of course,

641
00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:34.170
the answer being that the trials were a sham,

642
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.281
uh,

643
00:19:35.281 --> 00:19:35.821
and,

644
00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:36.420
uh,

645
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.410
the national guard was there throughout the entire time protecting these young

646
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:41.190
men.

647
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.461
Uh,

648
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:45.420
you can see the national guard behind the young men in this picture.

649
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.650
Um,

650
00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:47.483
and,

651
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:47.790
uh,

652
00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:52.020
but the supreme court record didn't have a great deal about the mobs outside of

653
00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:52.621
the courtroom.

654
00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:55.560
Didn't have a great deal of some about the national guard because it's mentioned

655
00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:56.394
in the opinion.

656
00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:01.490
But what the court seized on was the appointment of the lawyers in the case that

657
00:20:02.221 --> 00:20:03.600
basically on the morning of trial,

658
00:20:03.601 --> 00:20:04.530
there was no lawyer.

659
00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:08.370
A judge had earlier appointed all of the members of the bar,

660
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.030
uh,

661
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:09.751
to the case.

662
00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:11.520
And they all found some reason to get out of it,

663
00:20:11.521 --> 00:20:12.301
except for one,

664
00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:13.170
my low moody,

665
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.710
who was an elderly Sorta dottering,

666
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:16.530
uh,

667
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:21.060
lawyers somewhat senile according to Dan Carter's book on Scottsboro.

668
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:21.721
Uh,

669
00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:23.130
and then Steve Roddy,

670
00:20:23.131 --> 00:20:28.131
a lawyer who came from Chattanooga at the behest of the families of some of

671
00:20:28.231 --> 00:20:28.831
these people.

672
00:20:28.831 --> 00:20:29.640
But,

673
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:29.941
uh,

674
00:20:29.941 --> 00:20:31.080
as Carter also says,

675
00:20:31.081 --> 00:20:32.910
who fortified himself with alcohol,

676
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.450
uh,

677
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.880
before dealing with a very unhappy,

678
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:36.660
uh,

679
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.190
are very hostile to him,

680
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:38.671
uh,

681
00:20:38.671 --> 00:20:39.810
audience in the courtroom.

682
00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:40.841
Uh,

683
00:20:40.841 --> 00:20:44.520
and they basically decide on the morning of trial that they're going to try the

684
00:20:44.521 --> 00:20:49.521
case and they try the cases in a series of trials in which the death penalty is

685
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:50.171
imposed.

686
00:20:50.171 --> 00:20:51.610
The first jury goes out,

687
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.460
it comes back with a death sentence.

688
00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:58.420
The second jury is hearing a case and it hears the roar from the crowd.

689
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:58.960
Uh,

690
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.430
when the death penalty is imposed,

691
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:01.290
uh,

692
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:02.530
the court says that,

693
00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.693
uh,

694
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:09.180
lawyers are necessary from the outset for a thorough going investigation of the

695
00:21:09.191 --> 00:21:10.024
case.

696
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.590
And then in a capital case,

697
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.150
lawyers must be provided.

698
00:21:13.151 --> 00:21:15.130
We'll see that lawyers are not provided another,

699
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:15.880
uh,

700
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.660
serious criminal cases in the states until 1963.

701
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.003
Um,

702
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.020
finally I want to introduce,

703
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:23.883
uh,

704
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.540
Gilbert king who came,

705
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:26.230
uh,

706
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.050
as a guest to class and to talk about,

707
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:29.650
uh,

708
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:33.070
Jim Crow Justice and to talk about Thurgood Marshall's role.

709
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:33.641
Uh,

710
00:21:33.641 --> 00:21:35.200
in one particular case,

711
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:38.440
a number of African Americans who were facing the death penalty in Groveland,

712
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:39.723
Florida,

713
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.020
and the 1940s,

714
00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:42.140
late 1940s,

715
00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:43.180
uh,

716
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.370
he does a marvelous job telling the story,

717
00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:46.210
uh,

718
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:46.961
in this book.

719
00:21:46.961 --> 00:21:48.760
This was much like the Scottsburg case.

720
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:49.301
Uh,

721
00:21:49.301 --> 00:21:51.280
it was for young African American men,

722
00:21:51.281 --> 00:21:53.140
two of them ultimately killed by the sheriff,

723
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.070
uh,

724
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.940
or as Posse,

725
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:55.720
uh,

726
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.510
but who were charged with rape of a white woman.

727
00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.710
Uh,

728
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.190
he is also the author of a book on the execution of Willie Francis,

729
00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:05.230
a man who was at least Louisiana,

730
00:22:05.231 --> 00:22:08.260
tried to execute in one time and he was not killed,

731
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:08.951
uh,

732
00:22:08.951 --> 00:22:10.270
went to the Supreme Court,

733
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:11.260
which allowed,

734
00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:11.790
uh,

735
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.760
Louisiana try a second time and the second time Willie Francis was executed.

736
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:16.300
Uh,

737
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.330
but we're very fortunate to have Gilbert king join us for our class,

738
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:19.901
uh,

739
00:22:19.901 --> 00:22:23.890
and to tell us some about his research and what went into the book.

740
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:28.030
A devil in the grove about Thurgood Marshall and the Groveland boys.

741
00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:29.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>
