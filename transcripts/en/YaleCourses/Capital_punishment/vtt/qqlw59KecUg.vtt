1
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.360
We've talked about mitigating circumstances in the Supreme Court's decision in

2
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:20.361
lock vs Ohio and other cases it say that anything about the life and background

3
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:25.200
of the person accused can be considered in mitigation of punishment.

4
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.060
What I'd like to do in this segment is turned to actually proving mitigation.

5
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:33.240
What's involved in the nuts and bolts of putting on that evidence?

6
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.980
My guest is Susan Marcus,

7
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.790
who graduated from Northwestern university,

8
00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:41.520
was a mitigation specialist for a number of years,

9
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.160
then went to the University of Pennsylvania law school,

10
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.940
uh,

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.050
graduated with a law degree and since then has been a practicing lawyer for some

12
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:54.051
time and has been involved in a number of capital cases representing people and

13
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:55.350
presenting mitigation,

14
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.840
uh,

15
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.060
in the courtroom as a lawyer.

16
00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:58.530
So Susan's seen it from both sides.

17
00:00:58.531 --> 00:00:58.831
Susan,

18
00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:01.110
thank you so much for being with us today.

19
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.453
Thanks for having me.

20
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.541
I'd like to ask you,

21
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:04.021
first of all,

22
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:09.021
to just describe what the challenge of developing a mitigation case or what you

23
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:11.430
need to look into,

24
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.240
uh,

25
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.120
with regard to presenting mitigation on behalf of a client.

26
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.890
<v 2>The challenge is how extensive that the investigation has to be.</v>

27
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.940
Um,

28
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.940
and how do you start and the number and extent of witnesses that you talked to,

29
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.770
the records that you go through,

30
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.910
um,

31
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.310
when you're presenting a life history.

32
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.851
You know,

33
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:37.230
what we're really doing in the mitigation case is we are telling the truth.

34
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.770
We are talking about the truth of how our client ended up to do the things that

35
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:44.250
our client has done.

36
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.970
Um,

37
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.370
who are they as a whole being not just who they are as defined by the crimes,

38
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.420
but who are they as a father,

39
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:52.254
as a brother.

40
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.160
Um,

41
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.120
and how is it that they ended up to this place where they've done something that

42
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:58.500
we all wished that they didn't do.

43
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.880
And so we go back three generations in order,

44
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:05.640
at the very least in order to understand who are,

45
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.320
who our client is.

46
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.680
Because we know that people are affected by their parents,

47
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:11.161
of course,

48
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:13.920
what their parents went through and live through in their lives,

49
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.020
shaped what type of parents they were,

50
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:19.650
whether or not they were able to be there for their child.

51
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:23.640
And of course helps explain the things that they may have inflicted on their

52
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:24.330
child.

53
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.920
Understanding their grandparents,

54
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.170
understanding the culture in the background.

55
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.930
A lot of our clients have come from other countries,

56
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.681
um,

57
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:35.670
understanding what their lives were like in those other countries and why it is

58
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:40.040
they came to the u s and what they were hoping for coming to the u s um,

59
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.100
the many profound disappointments and struggles and difficulty that they were

60
00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:44.934
dealing with.

61
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.631
Um,

62
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:48.840
as they came to the u s and we,

63
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.230
in order to be able to understand all of that,

64
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.740
we talked to everybody who ever knew our client or their family.

65
00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.860
Um,

66
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.300
my experience in doing this,

67
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:02.680
I'm older than I look,

68
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:04.000
but it's been 18 years.

69
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.380
Um,

70
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.780
you never know where the information is going to come from.

71
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.770
You.

72
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.770
You cannot at the outset make your list of the five people to talk to and expect

73
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:17.650
that that's where you're going to find the information.

74
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.050
Um,

75
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.840
you don't know where it's going to come from.

76
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.741
You know,

77
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:21.551
in cases,

78
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:25.510
some of the most powerful testimony has come from neighbors who nobody told you

79
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:27.250
to talk to WHO's there,

80
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:28.210
not in any records,

81
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:31.720
but you simply do a record search and you find out who were the neighbors living

82
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.920
around your client.

83
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:37.660
And they happened to have witness all of the horrific abuse that your client was

84
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:38.201
going through.

85
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:42.460
They are the ones whose door your client knocked on when they couldn't find food

86
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:45.070
at eight years old for himself and his two younger siblings.

87
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.480
And it was only the neighbor,

88
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.410
um,

89
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.690
who knows this stuff and is willing to share it with you.

90
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.600
<v 1>A lot of times you probably are looking into people's lives and there are a lot</v>

91
00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:55.770
of family secrets,

92
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.010
uh,

93
00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.770
people that have had trauma,

94
00:03:58.771 --> 00:03:59.580
abuse,

95
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.420
childhood abuse,

96
00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:01.260
that sort of thing.

97
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.040
Uh,

98
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.060
how do you overcome that?

99
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.910
<v 2>There are always family secrets.</v>

100
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.750
Um,

101
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.750
I always say that people have a very hard time incorporating the worst things

102
00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:19.620
that they've done into their own image of who they think they are and trauma,

103
00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:20.251
what we know,

104
00:04:20.251 --> 00:04:23.430
what it does to people is it causes disintegration,

105
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.061
right?

106
00:04:24.061 --> 00:04:27.540
So people split off people who've been through a traumatic experience,

107
00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:28.374
they say,

108
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:29.130
um,

109
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.960
I was outside of my body.

110
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.700
They literally separate.

111
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.880
And that what happens when enough events happen over time,

112
00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:37.080
if it is untreated,

113
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.890
um,

114
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.060
what happens is that becomes a way of being in the world of being able to split

115
00:04:42.061 --> 00:04:42.894
and separate.

116
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.400
These things are too painful for us to experience or be present for.

117
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.520
And so we also do that with the worst things that we've done.

118
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.600
Um,

119
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.901
you know,

120
00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:52.734
we think of,

121
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.460
I think not being able to accept responsibility is,

122
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.330
uh,

123
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.730
something that we see in our politicians.

124
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.100
It's something we see in our own personal lives.

125
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.910
Um,

126
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.170
how we may try and make excuses for ourselves or not really want to share with

127
00:05:07.171 --> 00:05:07.660
everybody.

128
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.810
Kind of our worst moments or darkest moments.

129
00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:13.860
We think that people won't be able to see us as competent if they know of the

130
00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:16.650
Times that we royally messed up.

131
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.790
Um,

132
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.210
and so it's a very long intensive process.

133
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.793
There's,

134
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.723
um,

135
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.890
we meet people where they are.

136
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.580
I couldn't go in and just talk to a client's mother and say,

137
00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:33.780
tell me about the time you sexually abused you're Johnny.

138
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.380
There's no way that she would talk to me about that.

139
00:05:37.381 --> 00:05:39.150
It would make her never want to see me again.

140
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.590
Um,

141
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.890
over time I develop a relationship with her and we talk about the stresses and

142
00:05:46.741 --> 00:05:48.510
the strains that she's had in her life.

143
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.330
Maybe we understand first what happened to her.

144
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:52.201
You know,

145
00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:54.240
we know that violence is a cycle.

146
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.130
We know that,

147
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.990
um,

148
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.270
when somebody has committed violent violence,

149
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.910
they are most likely a victim of violence.

150
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:04.820
It is not the case that everybody who's a victim of violence commits it.

151
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.123
Um,

152
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.280
but in my experience,

153
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:11.750
it has been a one to one of everybody who's committed an act of violence has

154
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:13.130
been a victim of it themselves.

155
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:15.230
And so we start there,

156
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.861
um,

157
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:19.100
with having empathy and compassion towards what they have gone through.

158
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.670
And it is only after multiple interviews over a long period of time that we are

159
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:28.430
able to get somebody to the place where they feel,

160
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.823
um,

161
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.310
accepted enough and to be able to own up to what they've done.

162
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.050
But it's a very long process.

163
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:38.130
And throughout,

164
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.451
I mean,

165
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:41.090
there were people throwing up roadblocks and I don't want you to talk to this

166
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:42.380
person and you know,

167
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:47.381
family members very much close ranks and start to protect each other and will

168
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.190
prevent your access from,

169
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.390
from other people.

170
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.810
Um,

171
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.490
because they're worried about,

172
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.451
you know,

173
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:54.051
all of this.

174
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:55.310
And in a lot of cases,

175
00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:57.230
these are cases in the newspaper.

176
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.040
So this stuff being reported on day after day and who wants that?

177
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.701
I mean,

178
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:05.720
I think I would have a very hard time if everything that happened in my family.

179
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.010
Um,

180
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.050
we're to be blasted on the,

181
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.943
on the TV.

182
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.973
Right.

183
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.630
And I guess sometimes clients are very protective of their families.

184
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:14.931
Oh,

185
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:15.764
absolutely.

186
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.940
Absolutely.

187
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.320
I mean our clients who have gone through the most unspeakable horrors that you

188
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:22.154
could imagine,

189
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.060
um,

190
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.301
you know,

191
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:26.030
being locked in a closet until they were three years old,

192
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.770
not being given food,

193
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.350
being beaten until they pass out.

194
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.780
Being given alcohol at six years old,

195
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.170
being sexually abused by an older brother will,

196
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.340
when you first meet with them,

197
00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:37.641
they'll say,

198
00:07:37.641 --> 00:07:38.720
I had a normal family,

199
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.920
I had a great family and it's not at all inconsistent,

200
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:43.790
um,

201
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:48.320
that somebody would have had these horrible things and still have love for

202
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:49.430
people who've done these things.

203
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.630
I think that's the,

204
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.670
that's the beauty you see in our clients as human beings is their capacity and

205
00:07:55.671 --> 00:08:00.290
desire to still love and be loyal and be attached despite having been so

206
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:02.510
profoundly abused.

207
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:03.261
Um,

208
00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:03.861
so yes,

209
00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:04.850
they absolutely.

210
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:05.750
Um,

211
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.130
and I've had clients not want to present mitigation,

212
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:10.850
um,

213
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.820
because they don't want to bring their family through this process.

214
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.140
So very much of it depends upon the relationship of trust that lawyers and

215
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:19.400
mitigation specialists.

216
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.293
Absolutely.

217
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:22.311
Absolutely.

218
00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:23.390
And you have to be,

219
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.790
you have to understand and engage,

220
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:27.171
you know,

221
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:30.050
it's not just like we're mining people for information.

222
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:30.291
I mean,

223
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:32.270
you can't not,

224
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.150
you have to be human about what you're doing and why you're doing it.

225
00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:35.630
It has to,

226
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.841
I mean,

227
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:36.890
I'm not a therapist,

228
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:37.690
um,

229
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.320
and I can't pretend to be one,

230
00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:41.930
but I do talk regularly,

231
00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:42.740
um,

232
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.940
with experts,

233
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:48.860
with therapists to make sure that what I am doing is ethical and responsible and

234
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:53.630
is tending to the very severe trauma that our clients and their family members

235
00:08:53.631 --> 00:08:54.350
are going through.

236
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.590
And our approach has to be therapeutic or else,

237
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.483
um,

238
00:08:59.610 --> 00:08:59.911
you know,

239
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:02.790
I firmly believe that in my life it's,

240
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:03.240
you know,

241
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.080
do no harm.

242
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.651
You know,

243
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:06.420
I'm not doing this just to,

244
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:07.583
um,

245
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:08.580
you know,

246
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.031
like I said,

247
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:13.260
mine people for information or try and embarrass people or humiliate people.

248
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:18.261
I'm very mindful of how to do this in a way that respects everybody's dignity.

249
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.980
That's what we are doing this for.

250
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.480
It's about dignity.

251
00:09:21.481 --> 00:09:23.670
It's about dignity and respect for the individual.

252
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.110
Um,

253
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.510
and what I,

254
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.240
what I have learned is that taking these cases to trial,

255
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:30.740
which,

256
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.573
um,

257
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.710
is an incredibly intense thing is

258
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:37.920
it's a very hard,

259
00:09:37.921 --> 00:09:39.990
hard process for everybody to go through.

260
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:45.380
But it is a beautiful thing to do for people to integrate who they have been and

261
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:50.610
who they are to,

262
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.953
um,

263
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.351
you know,

264
00:09:52.351 --> 00:09:53.700
in one trial that I did it,

265
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.730
it was an incredible process to be a part of watching a family who has a culture

266
00:09:59.521 --> 00:10:01.080
of never talking about anything,

267
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:01.950
keeping it secret,

268
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.210
not even speaking to the,

269
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:04.044
to each other.

270
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.340
They were a multicultural family and not everybody even spoke the same language.

271
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.930
So talk about literally not speaking right.

272
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.910
They had never talked about all that they had been through to each other,

273
00:10:14.911 --> 00:10:17.550
so they weren't able to be systems of support for one another.

274
00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:22.230
They had kind of developed this mindset of I just have to survive myself.

275
00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:25.740
And so they have lost their ability like they had had in their home country to

276
00:10:25.741 --> 00:10:28.170
be connected and support one another.

277
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:33.620
And so this process was incredibly powerful for them to one by one as they took

278
00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:37.260
the stand to explain

279
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.010
who they were and what they had been through for everybody else to hear it.

280
00:10:43.011 --> 00:10:44.190
They were talking about,

281
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.503
um,

282
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:45.961
you know,

283
00:10:45.961 --> 00:10:48.240
they were talking about having been involved.

284
00:10:48.241 --> 00:10:50.850
They were victims of war of our war in Vietnam.

285
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:56.180
And so being able to share to a jury in America about what the effect was on the

286
00:10:56.551 --> 00:10:57.540
Vietnamese people,

287
00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:58.470
um,

288
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.430
to be able to talk about what their life was like when they came to the United

289
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.660
States and have people listen and hear and care about how much they'd suffered,

290
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:07.740
um,

291
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:11.940
to talk to our client who had heard these stories for the first time.

292
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.060
Never heard these stories before about what his grandfather,

293
00:11:15.061 --> 00:11:20.061
all he saw was this was somebody who terrorized and brutalized me my entire

294
00:11:20.161 --> 00:11:20.880
life.

295
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.880
And for him to see the humanity in his own grandfather and understand all that

296
00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:29.970
his grandfather had been carrying and for the first time really understood.

297
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:30.991
He beat me,

298
00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:33.780
not because I'm bad and not because there's something wrong with me,

299
00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:35.220
but because he couldn't handle,

300
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.140
um,

301
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.700
everything that was happening with him.

302
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.530
And then to have the family members acknowledged in public to our client,

303
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:45.023
uh,

304
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:50.150
we know what you've done and we forgive you and will you forgive me in the ways

305
00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:54.870
I failed you and to have them to Claire,

306
00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:55.711
to everybody.

307
00:11:55.711 --> 00:11:57.960
These are the ways I am going to be here for you.

308
00:11:57.961 --> 00:12:02.040
Now these are the ways in which going through this process has changed us

309
00:12:02.041 --> 00:12:05.400
fundamentally to understand how to be there for one another.

310
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.121
So in the end,

311
00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:06.954
it's,

312
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.350
I don't know that there's anything more beautiful I've been a part of and I

313
00:12:10.351 --> 00:12:15.351
don't know another way that we as a society are doing this.

314
00:12:16.021 --> 00:12:17.010
And so that's,

315
00:12:17.011 --> 00:12:21.690
I think that's why I'm keep being drawn back to doing this work is because it's,

316
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.213
um,

317
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.090
it's so compelling and so powerful and so beautiful.

318
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:27.780
Um,

319
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.460
at the end of the day if you can do it,

320
00:12:29.461 --> 00:12:29.671
I mean,

321
00:12:29.671 --> 00:12:30.504
if you,

322
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.081
you know,

323
00:12:31.081 --> 00:12:35.820
getting the time and the resources to be able to do this is always a fight.

324
00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:39.180
I don't care if you're in federal court or your in state court,

325
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.230
if you're in a jurisdiction that has more money or a jurisdiction that has none,

326
00:12:43.231 --> 00:12:47.760
nobody wants to spend the time and money that is required to do this for a

327
00:12:47.761 --> 00:12:48.330
family.

328
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.970
And I don't know how you do it otherwise.

329
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:56.840
<v 1>Interesting that all that comes together in a capital case that's provoked by</v>

330
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.180
the terrible crimes the person has committed.

331
00:12:59.390 --> 00:12:59.960
Yeah.

332
00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.650
Right.

333
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.700
But you're looking for things that shaped the way the person grew up,

334
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:05.923
trauma,

335
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:07.130
those sorts of things.

336
00:13:07.131 --> 00:13:08.420
Also risk factors.

337
00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:09.443
<v 2>Yes.</v>

338
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.373
Um,

339
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.430
so we understand in the DOJ has done a study of Department of Justice,

340
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.660
the Department of Justice,

341
00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:19.590
of risk factors and protective factors that affect people's lives.

342
00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:20.424
So,

343
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.450
um,

344
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:21.991
you know,

345
00:13:21.991 --> 00:13:24.840
a whole host of risk factors growing up in poverty,

346
00:13:24.841 --> 00:13:27.480
being subjected to physical abuse,

347
00:13:27.481 --> 00:13:28.560
sexual abuse,

348
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:29.483
um,

349
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.100
coming from immigrating from another country.

350
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:33.563
Um,

351
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.400
many different ways in which,

352
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:36.563
uh,

353
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:37.231
somebody,

354
00:13:37.231 --> 00:13:42.231
if they've been exposed to these certain risk factors may have a harder time

355
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.531
rising above.

356
00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:43.681
You know,

357
00:13:43.681 --> 00:13:47.910
our expectation is always of people that they can somehow rise above the

358
00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:49.020
circumstances that they've done.

359
00:13:49.021 --> 00:13:53.010
And we all know stories of people who've had really challenging lives and

360
00:13:53.011 --> 00:13:57.360
challenging circumstances who have been able to rise above.

361
00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:58.323
Um,

362
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:03.650
and what we understand about why that is is they have what's called protective

363
00:14:04.171 --> 00:14:05.790
factors or resiliency factors.

364
00:14:05.791 --> 00:14:10.080
So what are the things in somebody's life that protected them from fully feeling

365
00:14:10.081 --> 00:14:15.081
the effects of witnessing somebody shoot themselves in the head in front of you

366
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.420
if you've been able to get treatment for that right away.

367
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.780
If you've had a support system around you who you can,

368
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:22.890
um,

369
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.140
be able to talk to about something like that's happened.

370
00:14:25.141 --> 00:14:26.520
If you have a successful job,

371
00:14:26.521 --> 00:14:27.840
if you have an education,

372
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:28.500
um,

373
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.400
there are ways in which there are factors that can ameliorate the effects.

374
00:14:32.401 --> 00:14:35.850
It's not to say we would all be profoundly affected by something like that.

375
00:14:35.851 --> 00:14:36.161
I mean,

376
00:14:36.161 --> 00:14:41.161
I think there's a one among us who would not be profoundly impaired and affected

377
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:43.590
by witnessing something like that.

378
00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:44.610
But it is possible.

379
00:14:44.611 --> 00:14:45.400
And we know,

380
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.770
I think that that's why there,

381
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:51.170
it's not a one to one correlation with everybody who's been a victim of harm

382
00:14:51.171 --> 00:14:51.951
doesn't commit it.

383
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:52.640
And we,

384
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.910
what we know and what we understand in every single case,

385
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.520
it's come up in every single case I've ever been a part of.

386
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.510
Um,

387
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.720
understanding why did some siblings make it and why not others?

388
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:03.381
You know,

389
00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:07.700
we understand we're understanding a lot more about mental health and genetics,

390
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.271
right?

391
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:11.570
Genetic vulnerability to mental illness and epigenetics,

392
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:12.201
right?

393
00:15:12.201 --> 00:15:14.780
That you may have a genetic vulnerability to mental illness,

394
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:19.160
but it's your life experiences that may trigger the onset or the impact of that

395
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:19.994
mental illness.

396
00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.370
And there's so many things,

397
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.061
you know,

398
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:24.770
our lives are so complicated and,

399
00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:28.850
and what I come to find out in each case is,

400
00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.343
um,

401
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.240
and I'm always struck,

402
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.313
always

403
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:39.580
that my client held it together as long as they did that after the first

404
00:15:40.431 --> 00:15:42.740
stepping over the brains in the neighborhood.

405
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.950
I'm in New York City,

406
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.150
the first time they did that,

407
00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:48.410
that they didn't lose it.

408
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.830
That they didn't just give up and lose all contact with humanity,

409
00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:53.210
that they still manage to be,

410
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.970
have a child and be a loving father.

411
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.010
And after the second time,

412
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.100
they're best friend was shot and killed while they were standing right next to

413
00:16:01.101 --> 00:16:06.101
them that they didn't give up and they still managed to be a wonderful source of

414
00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:08.180
support to their friend's mother.

415
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:09.920
Um,

416
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.990
and that how,

417
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.070
you know,

418
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:13.611
people say,

419
00:16:13.611 --> 00:16:14.990
isn't this work depressing?

420
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.680
And it's actually being in the middle of it.

421
00:16:18.681 --> 00:16:23.681
That gives me great hope and makes me so grateful to be in the middle of it.

422
00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:27.380
It's incredibly uplifting to see the strength and resilience.

423
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.530
And that's what I see in our clients.

424
00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:34.460
They is the strength and resilience that persists even to this day when I show

425
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:38.510
up and who am I and I am nobody in no reason that they have to trust in the fact

426
00:16:38.511 --> 00:16:42.380
that they desire relationship and connection when they've been so profoundly

427
00:16:42.381 --> 00:16:43.214
disappointed,

428
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.970
um,

429
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.700
and rejected by every other person who's come their way,

430
00:16:46.701 --> 00:16:49.610
that they still seek connection and relationship.

431
00:16:49.611 --> 00:16:51.920
And how do I find my way through this?

432
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.170
<v 1>Now the things you find out,</v>

433
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:58.850
you finally have a number of mitigating factors to present to the jury.

434
00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.510
Yes.

435
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.090
You're not saying they excuse the crime or any way,

436
00:17:02.091 --> 00:17:03.050
explain it away.

437
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:03.500
No.

438
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.470
But now you're the lawyer and you're standing up and closing argument.

439
00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.860
What do you tell the jury to do with that information?

440
00:17:09.861 --> 00:17:12.410
The kind you've described to us just now.

441
00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:13.160
Yes.

442
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.120
<v 2>I say,</v>

443
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.410
and I say this to them,

444
00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:20.411
I say we have to hold more than one thing in the same place at the same time.

445
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:22.693
What do you mean by that?

446
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.310
What happens?

447
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:26.480
And again,

448
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:26.721
the,

449
00:17:26.721 --> 00:17:26.841
no,

450
00:17:26.841 --> 00:17:31.640
I think what happens to us and of abstractly as a jury or as society when we

451
00:17:31.641 --> 00:17:33.380
hear about things as we go through the same thing,

452
00:17:33.381 --> 00:17:34.310
a trauma victim might,

453
00:17:34.311 --> 00:17:35.540
when we hear about these things,

454
00:17:35.541 --> 00:17:35.781
right,

455
00:17:35.781 --> 00:17:36.650
we split off.

456
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:41.510
And what we know is that people who've been affected by trauma,

457
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.920
um,

458
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.630
things can become very black and white.

459
00:17:44.631 --> 00:17:47.180
They need to understand the world as good or bad.

460
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.350
The nuances get hard to hold.

461
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.840
And so I think that's what we do.

462
00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:56.130
That's our initial first reaction is we need somebody to be good or bad and part

463
00:17:56.131 --> 00:17:57.030
of trauma healing,

464
00:17:57.031 --> 00:18:01.050
part of being able to kind of function in the world in a healthy way is to be

465
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:03.150
able to hold more than one thing.

466
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:03.541
Yes,

467
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:06.000
our client has done these terrible things,

468
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:08.550
but he is more than the worst thing he has ever done.

469
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:09.571
You know,

470
00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:13.470
his self worth is not defined by the sum total of his bad actions.

471
00:18:13.471 --> 00:18:15.450
These are really moments.

472
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:20.760
They are horrific moments that profoundly altered and changed the course of life

473
00:18:20.761 --> 00:18:22.350
for so many people.

474
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:23.161
You know,

475
00:18:23.161 --> 00:18:27.870
and I have worked on cases where my clients have committed tremendous harm and

476
00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:29.310
that harm is not lost on me,

477
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:35.060
but there is more in this person's life and there is more for us all to do.

478
00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:36.420
Um,

479
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.480
then just focus on the worst moments of somebody's life.

480
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:44.100
And I do say that these are moments that in fact,

481
00:18:44.101 --> 00:18:47.250
most of the time this is a person who is overcoming,

482
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.880
who is struggling to get outside and away from the worst things that they've

483
00:18:54.481 --> 00:18:56.520
ever done to make better choices.

484
00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.170
And that there are times,

485
00:18:58.171 --> 00:18:59.004
and I've seen,

486
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:03.120
there hasn't been in case I've worked on where it isn't the truth,

487
00:19:03.121 --> 00:19:08.121
that the moment of the crime is when the 12 things that have been bearing down

488
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:12.600
on my client for all of his life happen at once.

489
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:13.531
You know,

490
00:19:13.531 --> 00:19:18.531
the uncle who kept him tethered and who gave him a place to stay dies at the

491
00:19:19.351 --> 00:19:24.351
same time that his coach is no longer able to keep him on the team at the same

492
00:19:25.261 --> 00:19:27.300
time that his best friend get shot and killed.

493
00:19:27.301 --> 00:19:27.481
I mean,

494
00:19:27.481 --> 00:19:32.481
it's just these moments where there aren't resources enough to be able to hold

495
00:19:33.391 --> 00:19:36.690
that person together and none of us can do it by ourselves.

496
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:37.040
Right?

497
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:37.873
I,

498
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.190
I know it's this myth that we can pull ourselves up by our bootstraps,

499
00:19:41.191 --> 00:19:41.461
right?

500
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:43.680
But none of us are,

501
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.720
have gone through life.

502
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.110
And maybe it's just a question of not having acknowledged the help that we've

503
00:19:49.111 --> 00:19:49.944
gotten.

504
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:50.310
You know,

505
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:54.480
I am where I am right now very much because of my family.

506
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:59.970
They have supported me over and over and over again.

507
00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.373
Um,

508
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:06.530
my clients end up having this sense of love and connection oftentimes in spite

509
00:20:08.341 --> 00:20:09.420
of where they've come from.

510
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:13.350
And it's an incredible testament to the beauty of humanity.

511
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:14.640
Um,

512
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.140
I tell them that one,

513
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.540
there are no competing tragedies,

514
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.340
only parallel tragedies.

515
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:22.110
Uh,

516
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.020
and I tell them that one person's tragedy doesn't have to dictate.

517
00:20:25.021 --> 00:20:25.854
And others,

518
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.310
my client comes from a family of people,

519
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:33.720
although profoundly damaged love and care about this person and whose lives

520
00:20:33.721 --> 00:20:36.600
would be profoundly altered,

521
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:37.920
um,

522
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.940
by his murder.

523
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:41.700
His execution.

524
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:42.803
Yes.

525
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.681
Susan,

526
00:20:43.681 --> 00:20:44.820
thank you so much.

527
00:20:44.821 --> 00:20:46.650
I know there's so much more we could talk about it,

528
00:20:46.651 --> 00:20:48.330
but thank you for everything.

529
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.830
<v 3>I really appreciate having you.</v>

530
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:50.790
Okay,

531
00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:51.623
thanks.

532
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:53.480
<v 4>Okay.</v>
