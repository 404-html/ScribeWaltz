1
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.451
In this session,

2
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:16.770
we're going to take up some of the mental illnesses that arise after a person

3
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:18.180
has been sentenced to death.

4
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:22.680
We've talked to in another session about competency for trial and issues of

5
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:23.514
insanity,

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.210
uh,

7
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.931
and so forth.

8
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:29.931
Now we're going to look about a Wa at whether a person is competent to appeal or

9
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:32.130
to basically drop their appeals,

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.660
uh,

11
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.290
and competent to be executed.

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.420
A supreme court has already decided that a person does not need to be competent

13
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.020
in order for their federal Habeas Corpus case to be litigated.

14
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.760
In the case of Ryan versus Gonzales decided in 2013,

15
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.330
uh,

16
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.220
the court said that a person who's in federal Habeas Corpus proceedings,

17
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.820
uh,

18
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.100
who may be incompetent and there were two cases,

19
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:58.500
one out of the Court of Appeals for the ninth circuit,

20
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:03.060
one out of the sixth circuit that had stayed the proceedings because the

21
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:05.550
petitioners in those cases were not competent.

22
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.330
But the court said that because a habeas corpus is a backward looking record

23
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:13.374
based,

24
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.310
uh,

25
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.260
the nature of it.

26
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.000
Uh,

27
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.440
therefore the person did not have to be competent.

28
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:20.970
The lawyers could do the research,

29
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:22.200
the writing and the briefing.

30
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.550
Uh,

31
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.410
district courts do have some discretion.

32
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.050
Uh,

33
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.430
they can ask with regard to particular issues in a case,

34
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:32.340
would there be a substantial benefit,

35
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.240
uh,

36
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.920
from the petitioners assistance?

37
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:35.431
In other words,

38
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:36.750
the lawyer goes to the judge and says,

39
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:37.350
your honor,

40
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.350
I need to be able to talk to my client to have a rational conversation with my

41
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:43.741
client,

42
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:46.680
with him having some understanding of what's going on here,

43
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.251
uh,

44
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:48.180
to go forward.

45
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.170
Uh,

46
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.070
the court says you a district court can grant a stay there,

47
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.820
uh,

48
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.730
but that if it looks like it's going to take a long time,

49
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.883
uh,

50
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.050
then the court should not grant a stay,

51
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.890
uh,

52
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.670
out of,

53
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.881
uh,

54
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:05.620
allowing the state to go forward and carry out its judgment.

55
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.140
So here the practicalities,

56
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.890
uh,

57
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.690
say,

58
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.940
uh,

59
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.410
to at least the Supreme Court,

60
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.070
uh,

61
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.120
we're not going to stay in execution for a long period of time just because the

62
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:17.070
person is not competent,

63
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.233
uh,

64
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.880
to,

65
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.170
uh,

66
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.640
like competent for trial,

67
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:21.930
able to assist their client,

68
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:23.820
able to assist their lawyer,

69
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.281
uh,

70
00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:24.650
enabled,

71
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.640
understand the proceedings that are going on.

72
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.420
Uh,

73
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.830
but there's another competency,

74
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.270
a question that comes up and that's whether or not a person can give up their

75
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:33.781
appeals.

76
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:34.620
That's a decision,

77
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.370
uh,

78
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.570
that a petitioner makes,

79
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.290
uh,

80
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.150
not unusual in some cases that petitioners decide at some point and usually

81
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.200
linked to mental illness,

82
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.010
uh,

83
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.500
that they want to give up their appeals.

84
00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:48.000
And 1960,

85
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.691
uh,

86
00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:51.890
the supreme court decided a wreath versus Peyton.

87
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.940
A Reese was a case in which the case went up to the court just on a question of

88
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.660
whether or not he could withdraw his petition for social ride of the Supreme

89
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.250
Court.

90
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.770
Uh,

91
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.420
the court sent it back and a very brief two or three paragraph opinion of

92
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:11.860
procuring them opinion that is by the court that said the district court was to

93
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:16.861
determine whether he had a capacity to appreciate his position and,

94
00:03:17.911 --> 00:03:18.220
uh,

95
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.220
and to make a rational choice with regard to continuing or abandoning

96
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.453
litigation.

97
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.421
In other words,

98
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:28.720
was he suffering from a mental disease disorder or defect,

99
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.090
which would substantially affect,

100
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.930
and the words that are chosen,

101
00:03:32.931 --> 00:03:34.330
her very important as we'll see,

102
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.360
substantially affect his capacity,

103
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.990
uh,

104
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.920
in the premises.

105
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.491
Uh,

106
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:40.360
so that's the question.

107
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:41.320
It's going to be raised.

108
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.861
Uh,

109
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:43.000
when a person says,

110
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.450
ah,

111
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.580
I want to give up my appeals.

112
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.630
Now,

113
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.410
one of these,

114
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.190
uh,

115
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.023
cases,

116
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.390
uh,

117
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.740
involved with whole name Ronald Gene,

118
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.220
uh,

119
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.060
Gene Simmons,

120
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.750
uh,

121
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.010
who committed a number of,

122
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.910
uh,

123
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.830
murders in the state of Arkansas.

124
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.173
Uh,

125
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.850
Ron Gene Simmons did not want to appeal his case.

126
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.751
And in fact,

127
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:06.751
he told his lawyers not to appeal and they abided by that another inmate a

128
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.330
Jonah's Whitmore came forward and said,

129
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:10.481
well,

130
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:15.481
I will represent a round gene Simmons and I have an interest in this because I'm

131
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:16.750
under a death sentence.

132
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:18.460
And the court compares,

133
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.120
uh,

134
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.650
cases and doing it.

135
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:22.180
The proportionality review,

136
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.230
uh,

137
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.090
I have an interest as a citizen,

138
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.740
uh,

139
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.970
in there being an automatic appeal.

140
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.630
Uh,

141
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.630
this is the only case I'm aware of where there was not a direct appeal to the

142
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:34.810
state Supreme Court after trial.

143
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.010
In most states,

144
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.270
in death penalty cases,

145
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:38.260
that's automatic.

146
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.131
But at this time,

147
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:44.131
it was not in Arkansas where the Arkansas Supreme Court turns a Whitmore down

148
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:49.660
and he goes to the United States Supreme Court and he loses on two grounds,

149
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:50.890
which help us understand,

150
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.430
uh,

151
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.620
what the court requires in these situations.

152
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.603
First,

153
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.911
uh,

154
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:56.890
the court said he is not injured,

155
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.551
uh,

156
00:04:57.551 --> 00:05:01.540
the fact that he's another death row inmate and that his case might be compared,

157
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.320
uh,

158
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.820
with,

159
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.010
uh,

160
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.610
Simmons case is just simply too big a stretch and,

161
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:07.330
uh,

162
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.571
uh,

163
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:10.180
he has to be directly injured.

164
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.590
And this is critical for the court to have jurisdiction because this was whether

165
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:16.510
there was a case or controversy,

166
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:17.110
uh,

167
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.650
before the court that the person have to have some injury.

168
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.431
In fact,

169
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:25.510
just as Marshall pointed out in his dissenting opinion that the court did not

170
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:29.800
have to enforce that and could consider this because the importance of the

171
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:34.801
public issue of his that was rejected by the majority of the Supreme Court.

172
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.430
Secondly,

173
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.181
uh,

174
00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:38.230
and this would defeat,

175
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.243
uh,

176
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.020
Whitmore right out of the,

177
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.250
out of the start.

178
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.881
Uh,

179
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:44.620
they said he couldn't be the next friend,

180
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.400
uh,

181
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.233
for Semans,

182
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.690
uh,

183
00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.840
that an ex friend has to be someone who's very close,

184
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.530
uh,

185
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.363
to the defendant,

186
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.960
someone like a parent,

187
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.823
a spouse,

188
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.073
child,

189
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.750
uh,

190
00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.750
someone who's got that person's best interest at heart and who's very close to

191
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:02.121
that person,

192
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:03.380
not just someone who,

193
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.071
uh,

194
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:06.950
I think the court in one case or referred to him as a,

195
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:08.260
a inner meddler,

196
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.750
uh,

197
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.810
who's coming along and trying to decide what to do.

198
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.980
One case that illustrates just how difficult and heart wrenching these decisions

199
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:23.651
can be is the case of Harvey and Rebecca Rumba who brought a wanting to stand in

200
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:27.320
as next friend for their son Charles.

201
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.891
Uh,

202
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:29.810
no question that they could be next friends.

203
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:30.710
They were his parents.

204
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:33.140
So the next friend question is not present.

205
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.320
The question present is could Charles make his own decision or as his parents

206
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:41.180
were pleading to the court,

207
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.510
they're saying our son is not able to decide things for himself and we should be

208
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:48.410
able to make the decision for him.

209
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.130
Uh,

210
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.110
Charles Rumba was 17.

211
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:52.520
At the time of the offense today,

212
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:55.010
he wouldn't be eligible for the death penalty,

213
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:56.900
but he was a bag at the time.

214
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:58.460
His case was before the court.

215
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.320
He was profoundly depressed.

216
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.831
Uh,

217
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:02.360
he suffered from schizophrenia,

218
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:03.560
paranoid schizophrenia.

219
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:04.101
Uh,

220
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:06.390
he had auditory hallucinations.

221
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.130
Uh,

222
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:12.130
he was a self mutilate or he had tried to cut his arm off and he had talked and

223
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.890
an occasion about experiencing the pain of self mutilation and being cleansed by

224
00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:19.270
it.

225
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.550
Uh,

226
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.720
he was suicidal.

227
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.030
He had attempted suicide several times.

228
00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:23.750
And in fact,

229
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.030
during the hearing in Federal District Court,

230
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.040
he advanced upon the United States,

231
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:28.874
Marshall,

232
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:29.360
uh,

233
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.510
and the Marshall shot him in the courtroom,

234
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.560
uh,

235
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.370
and he goes off to the hospital and the hearing continues,

236
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:37.911
uh,

237
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:38.744
without him.

238
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.670
Charles wants to give up his appeals,

239
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:41.301
uh,

240
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:42.380
and be executed,

241
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:42.891
uh,

242
00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:44.870
in large part because of his mental illness.

243
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.621
Uh,

244
00:07:45.621 --> 00:07:49.340
and his parents are asking the court not to let him do that,

245
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.190
but to say that he lacks the capacity,

246
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.150
uh,

247
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:58.150
to make his own decisions and they should be able to decide for him a while.

248
00:07:58.221 --> 00:08:02.780
The case centers very much on the testimony of Dr. Logan,

249
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:04.670
a doctor at the Springfield,

250
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.290
a federal hospital,

251
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:06.830
uh,

252
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.660
where run by had been sent for evaluation.

253
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:10.650
Uh,

254
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.530
and it shows how difficult,

255
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:13.190
uh,

256
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.560
it can be to determine if someone meets this danger,

257
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.540
the dusky standard of competence to make their own decisions.

258
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.470
In these cases,

259
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.160
uh,

260
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.330
the judge is asking,

261
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:23.870
uh,

262
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:24.770
the doctor here,

263
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.800
I what we're all trying to understand a is to what extent the depression was a

264
00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:36.101
coercive force in the decision that Charles made to give up his appeals.

265
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:37.970
Dr. Logan said,

266
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:38.151
well,

267
00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:39.500
if you weren't so depressed,

268
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.250
if he didn't have bouts of paranoia,

269
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.430
if he didn't have auditory hallucinations,

270
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.120
he probably would go forward with the litigation.

271
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.500
So obviously there's a very direct relationship between his depression,

272
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:55.320
his paranoia,

273
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:55.951
his solution,

274
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:56.784
nations,

275
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.150
and the fact that he wants to give up his appeals at this point.

276
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.990
Uh,

277
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.470
Dr. Logan says his mental problems,

278
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.850
it affect him.

279
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.650
This was the question asking Dusky does it affect his ability to make a

280
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:11.484
decision?

281
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.600
It affects them to the extent that if he were not so depressed,

282
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.200
if he did not have the periods of paranoia,

283
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.180
were his periods of auditory hallucination not present.

284
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.081
Uh,

285
00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:28.710
and if he wasn't so hopeless about his position,

286
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.360
both his mental health condition and his hope of ever winning his appeal,

287
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.440
uh,

288
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.770
he might be able to better cope with spending time on death row,

289
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.430
uh,

290
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.270
and waiting and seeing how he,

291
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.520
his appeals turned out.

292
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:42.390
Uh,

293
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.810
but his mental condition would not permit him to do that.

294
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:51.470
He goes on to say that his mental condition influenced him to a certain degree,

295
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.300
maybe even to a substantial degree.

296
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.140
Uh,

297
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.040
he recognizes that his mental condition is deteriorating.

298
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.480
Uh,

299
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.920
it's a realistic assessment.

300
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.060
It is deteriorating.

301
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:04.500
It influences him.

302
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.250
Uh,

303
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.780
he's been miserable for a long time and he's going to be miserable for a long

304
00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:11.280
time and he understands that,

305
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.331
uh,

306
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:14.010
and he's able,

307
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:14.881
nevertheless,

308
00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:16.380
he's able to think coherently.

309
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:17.880
So the judge,

310
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:21.690
he analogizes is to someone who has cancer that doesn't want any more treatment.

311
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:26.280
He's miserable because he has all these mental illnesses.

312
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.940
Uh,

313
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.210
he's going to get a,

314
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.680
it's going to continue to be miserable because there's very little prospect that

315
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:32.850
he's going to improve.

316
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:33.811
Uh,

317
00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:35.940
in terms of his mental condition,

318
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:36.961
uh,

319
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:37.351
of course,

320
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:42.351
most people who are in prison who had this feeling of hopelessness because of

321
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:47.370
their depression and their schizophrenia and their self mutilation and so forth,

322
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.720
of course would not have,

323
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.440
uh,

324
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.690
the opportunity to have the state put them to death.

325
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.201
Uh,

326
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:57.201
only because Rumbas on death row is he able to have the state carry out his

327
00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:58.890
execution,

328
00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.400
uh,

329
00:10:59.400 --> 00:10:59.720
in,

330
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.630
in his life,

331
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:01.710
uh,

332
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.680
the court as if he's able to understand what's going on.

333
00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:05.191
No question.

334
00:11:05.191 --> 00:11:07.380
He understands what's going on.

335
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.760
A court asks,

336
00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:13.761
is his decision rational based on what he presently faces?

337
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.410
Now this is a court asking,

338
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.880
is the decision that Charles Rumbas making rational?

339
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.313
Well,

340
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:26.640
that's probably anyone could say the weather decisions rational or irrational

341
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:29.910
and probably reasonable people would disagree about that.

342
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:30.511
Uh,

343
00:11:30.511 --> 00:11:32.790
but Dr. Logan says yes,

344
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.800
based on his past experience and based on what he presently faces,

345
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.660
I believe it's rational or logical at least.

346
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:48.530
So is the fact that it's logical for a person who has terminal cancer not

347
00:11:49.831 --> 00:11:50.664
wanting treatment,

348
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.690
but this is of course,

349
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:52.500
is not treatment.

350
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.250
This is being executed.

351
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:59.670
Is it rational or logical for a person who's facing execution to decided life is

352
00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:04.630
so miserable that they don't want to go on and therefore they want to give up

353
00:12:04.631 --> 00:12:05.464
their appeals?

354
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.380
Uh,

355
00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.410
the court employees three steps,

356
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:09.191
the majority,

357
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:13.180
this is a two to one decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the

358
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:14.014
fifth circuit.

359
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.460
One is the person suffering from a mental disease or defect.

360
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.421
If no,

361
00:12:19.421 --> 00:12:20.290
you stopped right there.

362
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:21.550
But in Rumbas case,

363
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:23.770
there's no question he's suffering from all kinds.

364
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:24.431
He's depressed,

365
00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:25.264
he's schizophrenia,

366
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:30.330
he's got a major mental illnesses that may substantially affect his decision.

367
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.770
So go to step two.

368
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:33.903
Step two,

369
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.970
does the mental disease or defect prevent him from understanding his position?

370
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.061
Again,

371
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:40.421
the answer,

372
00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:42.250
here's no Rumbar,

373
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:42.851
uh,

374
00:12:42.851 --> 00:12:44.560
understands his position,

375
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:45.490
uh,

376
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:50.490
has a good understanding both legally and factually a of where he stands in the

377
00:12:50.951 --> 00:12:51.784
legal system.

378
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:53.320
We go to step three,

379
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.230
even if he understands his position,

380
00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.480
does the mental illness.

381
00:12:58.481 --> 00:12:59.890
And the judge asked the question,

382
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:00.580
now,

383
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.510
prevent him,

384
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.150
not does it influence him?

385
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:05.490
Now,

386
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:06.580
does it affect him?

387
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:11.730
But does it prevent him from making a rational choice among the options you

388
00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:16.780
could state those last two questions as Reese did,

389
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.590
uh,

390
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:21.100
whether they substantially affect his understanding,

391
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:21.550
uh,

392
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.050
of his legal position,

393
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:23.950
uh,

394
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.110
and the choice that he has before it.

395
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.190
Uh,

396
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:28.023
at any rate,

397
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:28.600
uh,

398
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.280
Dr. Logan says there's no question.

399
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.690
The severe depression has some influence on his decision to give up his appeals.

400
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.540
He's capable of appreciating his position.

401
00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:39.610
He understands where he is,

402
00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:43.150
that he's in court with a Habeas Corpus petition and you can go forward.

403
00:13:43.151 --> 00:13:43.984
I did not,

404
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:44.980
uh,

405
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:45.813
and,

406
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:46.300
uh,

407
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:51.300
that he can make a sufficiently and substantially rational choice with regard to

408
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:55.870
abandoning a further litigation.

409
00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:56.830
In his case,

410
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:57.933
uh,

411
00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.500
the court allows,

412
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.393
uh,

413
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.650
Charles to take over the case,

414
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:03.401
dismiss it,

415
00:14:03.401 --> 00:14:04.340
and uh,

416
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:05.740
he's eventually executed.

417
00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:06.941
Judge Goldberg.

418
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:08.800
Desena Judge Urban Goldberg says,

419
00:14:08.801 --> 00:14:09.281
wait a minute.

420
00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:12.130
Competency is a mixed question of law.

421
00:14:12.131 --> 00:14:12.521
In fact,

422
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:13.540
that means the,

423
00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:16.540
a blend of the facts as we have them in the record,

424
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.490
but also the law of competency.

425
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.020
And the court thinks that,

426
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:20.890
uh,

427
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:21.551
the,

428
00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:24.460
excuse me just as Goldberg thinks that the court defers too much,

429
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.240
uh,

430
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:25.630
on,

431
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.350
on the,

432
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:27.550
on the question and doesn't,

433
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.270
uh,

434
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.740
analyze it enough itself.

435
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:30.310
Uh,

436
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.091
he says,

437
00:14:31.091 --> 00:14:32.200
if you look at this carefully,

438
00:14:32.201 --> 00:14:37.201
what rumble is doing is taking logical steps towards a goal that is the product

439
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.620
of his mental illness.

440
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:44.310
This is a question of a man giving up as appeals because he is mentally ill,

441
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:45.551
uh,

442
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:48.920
and he's unable to determine what's in his best interest.

443
00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:53.150
Has Mental illness keeps him from deciding what's in his best interest?

444
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.920
What does a very close case,

445
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.250
a very disturbing case for the parents,

446
00:14:58.251 --> 00:15:00.050
for everybody involved.

447
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:03.020
But it shows how difficult these decisions are.

448
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:03.621
Uh,

449
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:08.540
and deciding whether or not a person has the capacity that is the ability to

450
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:09.590
make their own decision,

451
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.200
uh,

452
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.750
or whether it's influenced,

453
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.530
uh,

454
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:13.300
by,

455
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:13.580
uh,

456
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.720
the mental illnesses.

457
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.440
Uh,

458
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.430
particularly if you have the profound and deep melanomas.

459
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.410
Is that somebody like Charles Rumble hat?

460
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.220
Uh,

461
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.350
but those are the questions of courts decide,

462
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:25.160
uh,

463
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.760
possibly different judges would have come out in a different way on this case.

464
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.660
Uh,

465
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.950
but as it turns out,

466
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:35.780
rumble loses his parents are not allowed to step in and represent him and he's

467
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:36.980
put it in the state of Texas,

468
00:15:36.981 --> 00:15:37.814
puts him to death.

469
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.553
Uh,

470
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.150
we look at these terms that are critical in this analysis,

471
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.700
prevent product or effect.

472
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.040
Did the mental illness prevent him?

473
00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:54.290
I would say the middle is he can't understand what's going on because of the

474
00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:57.530
melanomas or is his decision a product?

475
00:15:57.531 --> 00:16:00.560
Do we really know what the product of mental illness is?

476
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:05.590
Is the decision a product of the middle notice or does the mental illness

477
00:16:06.321 --> 00:16:10.280
substantially affect his capacity to understand?

478
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.350
If you ask these questions differently,

479
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:13.880
you might get different answers.

480
00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:14.960
Because with Rumba,

481
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.190
you might say,

482
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:16.880
uh,

483
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.930
that his bill illness does substantially affect his capacity.

484
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.620
Uh,

485
00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.300
maybe not so much to understand,

486
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:28.160
but to make a rational and informed and intelligent decision,

487
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:28.640
uh,

488
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.880
with regard to giving up litigation are going forward.

489
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.390
Uh,

490
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:37.390
but it is the sort of parsing that the courts do in this very mysterious area of

491
00:16:38.031 --> 00:16:41.780
mental health where very often there are different doctors giving different

492
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.760
diagnoses and different opinions about the abilities of people who suffer for

493
00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:47.613
melanomas.

494
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:48.231
Well,

495
00:16:48.231 --> 00:16:52.670
another place where men alone is often can come into play is with regard to the

496
00:16:52.671 --> 00:16:54.050
execution of a person.

497
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.190
Uh,

498
00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.240
many people,

499
00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:57.080
uh,

500
00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.220
on death row,

501
00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:58.820
uh,

502
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.630
may have already had mental issues in their case at trial.

503
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:03.560
Uh,

504
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.200
but some people will deteriorate,

505
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:06.890
uh,

506
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:10.250
significantly over the time period that they're on death row.

507
00:17:10.251 --> 00:17:12.290
It's not a healthy place to be.

508
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:13.070
Uh,

509
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:17.360
and they may be in virtual solitary confinement during much of that time.

510
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:20.240
And so the date of the execution approaches,

511
00:17:20.241 --> 00:17:21.770
the cases had been decided,

512
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:22.581
uh,

513
00:17:22.581 --> 00:17:24.470
and it becomes a parent,

514
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.021
uh,

515
00:17:25.021 --> 00:17:28.700
that this person doesn't understand what's going on,

516
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:32.180
that they're in a whole different world of reality,

517
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:32.931
uh,

518
00:17:32.931 --> 00:17:37.310
in which they either don't know they're going to be executed or they don't

519
00:17:37.311 --> 00:17:39.200
understand what execution is.

520
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.380
We looked earlier at a case out of Arkansas,

521
00:17:42.381 --> 00:17:43.460
Ricky ray rector,

522
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:44.510
uh,

523
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.820
who after he was executed,

524
00:17:46.821 --> 00:17:47.930
they go back to rectors.

525
00:17:47.931 --> 00:17:50.720
Sal and find that he's put his Pi aside.

526
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.421
Uh,

527
00:17:51.421 --> 00:17:54.990
he thinks he's going to come back after the execution and have dessert.

528
00:17:55.350 --> 00:18:00.120
So he obviously had very little understanding of what an execution was in the

529
00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:04.290
finality of the execution or what death was a,

530
00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:04.771
but of course,

531
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:09.000
that evidence didn't come out until after the course had already held that he

532
00:18:09.001 --> 00:18:11.610
was competent to be executed.

533
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.980
So we'll look at a couple of cases,

534
00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:14.580
uh,

535
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.390
where the supreme court has dealt with this one Ford versus Wainwright where the

536
00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:23.391
court first deals with both the procedures required and with the definition.

537
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.210
Uh,

538
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:24.991
and then after that,

539
00:18:24.991 --> 00:18:26.160
Scott Pineta his case,

540
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:26.671
uh,

541
00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:27.570
out of Texas,

542
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.793
um,

543
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.390
Alvin Ford versus Wainwright,

544
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.550
uh,

545
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.280
was the first case to present to the Supreme Court.

546
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.900
This question of,

547
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.800
uh,

548
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.350
whether or not a person was competent to be executed.

549
00:18:40.351 --> 00:18:42.150
It was an open question if that time,

550
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.840
whether the Constitution prohibited the execution,

551
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:46.710
uh,

552
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.300
of a person who was,

553
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:48.900
uh,

554
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.660
insane as it was put forward.

555
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.160
In that particular case,

556
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:53.800
uh,

557
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.810
the court canvas,

558
00:18:54.811 --> 00:18:59.811
what had been the practice in jurisdictions in the United States,

559
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.320
different states,

560
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.243
England,

561
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:07.280
and came to the conclusion that there was a constitutional prohibition to

562
00:19:07.591 --> 00:19:10.320
executing someone who was insane.

563
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.800
But we're going to see the devil is in the definition,

564
00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.460
uh,

565
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.350
in terms of how we describe that.

566
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.390
But the other issue that Ford had,

567
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.040
uh,

568
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.230
was he was claiming that the way in which it had been done,

569
00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:22.860
uh,

570
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.770
the way in which he was determined to be competent,

571
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.820
uh,

572
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.850
did not measure up to due process standards.

573
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.780
Uh,

574
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.490
Alvin Ford was a person who,

575
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:33.360
uh,

576
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.360
was clearly suffering from delusions,

577
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.470
uh,

578
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.560
both in his speech patterns and what he believed.

579
00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.220
His lawyers really couldn't talk to him,

580
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:41.940
uh,

581
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.650
because,

582
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:43.050
uh,

583
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.090
he didn't speak a of coherent,

584
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:45.570
uh,

585
00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:46.380
English,

586
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:46.711
uh,

587
00:19:46.711 --> 00:19:48.150
when he was talking to people.

588
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.223
Um,

589
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:49.920
and,

590
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.250
uh,

591
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.280
so the state since some doctors down,

592
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:53.971
uh,

593
00:19:53.971 --> 00:19:54.804
examine him,

594
00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:55.650
uh,

595
00:19:55.650 --> 00:20:00.650
they won't take any information from Ford's lawyers about what his mental

596
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.220
condition is.

597
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.170
And it goes to the governor,

598
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:04.921
uh,

599
00:20:04.921 --> 00:20:08.910
and a determination is made there within the executive branch,

600
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:09.481
uh,

601
00:20:09.481 --> 00:20:10.770
that he's competent.

602
00:20:10.771 --> 00:20:11.581
And Bob Graham,

603
00:20:11.581 --> 00:20:12.361
the governor of Florida,

604
00:20:12.361 --> 00:20:14.880
signs a warrant to put him to death.

605
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:16.590
A supreme court says,

606
00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:17.520
you gotta do better than that.

607
00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:18.271
Uh,

608
00:20:18.271 --> 00:20:19.200
first of all,

609
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.440
the person who's about to be executed,

610
00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.940
that person,

611
00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.120
their lawyer has to be involved in this process.

612
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:32.220
If they've had a mental examination and want to put that before the fact finder

613
00:20:32.221 --> 00:20:33.054
to determine,

614
00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:33.391
uh,

615
00:20:33.391 --> 00:20:34.230
whether he's competent,

616
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.250
they have a right to do that.

617
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.860
If they have lay witnesses to testify,

618
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:39.000
uh,

619
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.930
court didn't say that,

620
00:20:39.931 --> 00:20:40.500
but,

621
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:40.831
uh,

622
00:20:40.831 --> 00:20:41.190
the,

623
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.461
they,

624
00:20:41.461 --> 00:20:43.290
they have a right to do that as well.

625
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.530
People who've watched this person and who've talked to this person,

626
00:20:46.531 --> 00:20:49.540
and I have some sense of what this person's understanding is.

627
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:50.220
Uh,

628
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.530
if the prosecution is going to put forward evidence,

629
00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.310
uh,

630
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:59.170
perhaps it's subject to cross examination as in most kinds of cases where

631
00:20:59.171 --> 00:21:03.760
decisions are being made and finally the decision maker has to be more

632
00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:04.301
objective.

633
00:21:04.301 --> 00:21:06.310
It can't just be somebody in the governor's office.

634
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.001
Uh,

635
00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:09.850
so as a result,

636
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.870
we find that the way in which Ford was determined to be competent,

637
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.350
uh,

638
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.420
did not meet constitutional standards.

639
00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:16.781
I mean,

640
00:21:16.781 --> 00:21:19.720
this is as basic as the case of Goldberg versus Kelly,

641
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.430
which talks about what kind of procedures a person's entitled to before their

642
00:21:24.431 --> 00:21:26.140
welfare benefits are terminated.

643
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.801
Uh,

644
00:21:26.801 --> 00:21:29.590
here we're talking about a much more serious decision.

645
00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.650
Not that that isn't it a serious decision for many people,

646
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.680
but whether or not Alan Ford's life is going to be taken.

647
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.180
But then the question is,

648
00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:39.400
what does it mean to be insane?

649
00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.480
Uh,

650
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.620
Justice Marshall doesn't write much about that in his opinion,

651
00:21:44.621 --> 00:21:46.540
which was for four members of the court.

652
00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:49.900
Justice Powell cast the fifth and deciding vote.

653
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:50.891
Uh,

654
00:21:50.891 --> 00:21:52.060
and in his opinion,

655
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:56.500
he says the eighth amendment forbids the execution of those who are unaware of

656
00:21:56.501 --> 00:22:01.501
the punishment they're about to suffer and why they are to suffer it.

657
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:03.393
Uh,

658
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:08.430
the American bar association has suggested a slightly different standard one,

659
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:09.521
uh,

660
00:22:09.521 --> 00:22:11.830
that the person understands why they were tried,

661
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:15.130
what the proceedings were and the reason for their punishment.

662
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:18.610
That's not much different than what a Justice Powell said.

663
00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:19.420
Uh,

664
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.320
but secondly,

665
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.720
uh,

666
00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.950
that the person lacks capacity to understand,

667
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:24.670
uh,

668
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:28.810
what's going on and to be able to communicate with their lawyers about what

669
00:22:28.811 --> 00:22:31.870
might make unlawful or I'm just their execution.

670
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.050
It seemed pretty clear that after Ryan versus Gonzales,

671
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:35.560
uh,

672
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.130
that does not necessarily required since the court.

673
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.900
Although this may be a case where,

674
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:41.561
uh,

675
00:22:41.561 --> 00:22:42.460
the person's,

676
00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.150
uh,

677
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.620
cooperation is critical.

678
00:22:44.621 --> 00:22:45.430
But of course,

679
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.130
the whole issue is competency itself,

680
00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:48.641
uh,

681
00:22:48.641 --> 00:22:53.641
with regard to deciding that some states have adopted the American Bar

682
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:54.870
Association's,

683
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:55.090
uh,

684
00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:55.923
test.

685
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.290
Uh,

686
00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.220
but for our purposes,

687
00:22:57.221 --> 00:22:59.290
we'll look at what justice Powell said.

688
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.821
Uh,

689
00:22:59.821 --> 00:23:03.250
the person has to be aware of the purpose of the punishment,

690
00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:04.450
uh,

691
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.450
and then why they are receiving.

692
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:12.750
I am going to be put to death because I was convicted of murder in this court

693
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:15.790
many years ago.

694
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.840
Whatever rudimentary understanding the person has of it.

695
00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:24.070
And so many people can be profoundly mentally ill,

696
00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.410
it's proven to be,

697
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:29.110
can be profoundly out of touch with reality,

698
00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:29.800
uh,

699
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.630
and still be found competent,

700
00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.110
uh,

701
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.070
for execution.

702
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.540
One case that illustrates this is the case of Scott Panetta,

703
00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.970
who was sentenced to death in Texas.

704
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:40.750
Uh,

705
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:44.500
pinetrees mental health problems were obvious from the outset.

706
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:45.260
Uh,

707
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.720
he tried his case and a cowboy suit,

708
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:48.290
uh,

709
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:49.640
like a little boy would wear.

710
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.480
Uh,

711
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:52.610
he was found competent for trial,

712
00:23:52.611 --> 00:23:57.020
allowed to try his own case instead of having a lawyer try the case.

713
00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:57.470
Uh,

714
00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:01.280
people that watch the trial said that those who were there were afraid of him,

715
00:24:01.281 --> 00:24:03.470
were worried about what he was going to do.

716
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:04.220
Uh,

717
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:09.220
he clearly was not a functioning as a normal person during his trial.

718
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:11.001
Uh,

719
00:24:11.001 --> 00:24:13.100
and his mental health didn't get any better.

720
00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:13.490
Uh,

721
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:15.350
during the time he was on death row.

722
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:16.783
Uh,

723
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:20.330
by the time Texas was about to execute it,

724
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:21.800
a Scott Bennett,

725
00:24:21.801 --> 00:24:26.570
he was suffering from a genuine delusion and according to the court,

726
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.590
uh,

727
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:32.590
that his execution was part of spiritual warfare between the demons and the

728
00:24:33.531 --> 00:24:38.531
forces of darkness on one side and God and angels and the Forces of light on the

729
00:24:38.841 --> 00:24:39.674
other side,

730
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.050
and that he was going to be executed,

731
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.530
uh,

732
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:43.850
to keep him from preaching.

733
00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:45.050
Uh,

734
00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.990
and that was basically his understanding.

735
00:24:47.991 --> 00:24:48.710
In other words,

736
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:53.000
he did not understand that he was going to be executed for punishment for the

737
00:24:53.001 --> 00:24:54.080
crime he committed.

738
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.210
He understood what execution was,

739
00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:01.250
but the purpose he saw it being as to keep him from preaching,

740
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:01.731
uh,

741
00:25:01.731 --> 00:25:06.440
not as punishment for the crime that he committed a supreme court in the

742
00:25:06.441 --> 00:25:07.274
decision,

743
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.253
uh,

744
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.130
by,

745
00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:09.890
uh,

746
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:10.880
Justice Kennedy,

747
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:11.630
uh,

748
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:12.590
says that,

749
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.340
uh,

750
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.730
the lower court should not have left out,

751
00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:20.120
not considered a this delusional belief.

752
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:25.070
He also found that the procedures leading to the finding of competency in

753
00:25:25.071 --> 00:25:28.820
Penedes case where we're totally inadequate by the Texas courts,

754
00:25:28.821 --> 00:25:30.680
but we'll talk about what he said,

755
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:31.250
uh,

756
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:33.410
with regard to pinetrees competency.

757
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:34.221
Uh,

758
00:25:34.221 --> 00:25:39.221
the argument that panettone suffered from a severe documented mental illness,

759
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:40.941
uh,

760
00:25:40.941 --> 00:25:45.941
and had gross delusions preventing him from comprehending what was going on and

761
00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:50.900
the purpose of the execution had to be considered in the lower court had not

762
00:25:50.901 --> 00:25:51.734
done that.

763
00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:52.680
So the case,

764
00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.010
the court reversed the case,

765
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:55.670
uh,

766
00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:56.421
send it back.

767
00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:59.060
The fifth circuit in turn sent the case back.

768
00:25:59.061 --> 00:26:02.120
The court of Appeals for the fifth circuit sent the case back to the District

769
00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.500
Court judge them Starks.

770
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:03.950
Uh,

771
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:04.760
had a hearing,

772
00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:09.760
once again found in Scott Perinetti was competent to be executed,

773
00:26:10.761 --> 00:26:12.710
that he had a sufficient understanding,

774
00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:13.371
uh,

775
00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:14.150
of,

776
00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:14.983
uh,

777
00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:19.040
what execution was and what the purpose of it was as well.

778
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:20.810
Uh,

779
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.100
this standard,

780
00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:22.910
uh,

781
00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:27.200
does not keep profoundly mentally ill people from being executed.

782
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.190
Uh,

783
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.210
John Ferguson,

784
00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.050
uh,

785
00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:32.420
was executed in 2013,

786
00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:33.050
uh,

787
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.130
by the state of Florida.

788
00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.970
A Ferguson had an unusual belief system.

789
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:41.720
He believed that he was the prince of God and that after execution,

790
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:42.381
uh,

791
00:26:42.381 --> 00:26:47.381
he would be resurrected and he would return to earth in that capacity.

792
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:48.610
Uh,

793
00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:49.001
here,

794
00:26:49.001 --> 00:26:51.400
there were many aspects of his mental illness,

795
00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.350
but with regard to that delusion,

796
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.250
uh,

797
00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:59.020
here's what judge Ed Karnes said for the 11th circuit that,

798
00:26:59.021 --> 00:27:03.880
that thought about what happens after death might seem extreme to some people,

799
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:09.330
but he pointed out that every world religion from Christianity to z,

800
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.253
uh,

801
00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.160
uh,

802
00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:17.160
the believed in some kind of continuation of life after death.

803
00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:17.950
Uh,

804
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:18.670
and,

805
00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:18.910
uh,

806
00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.040
some kind of resurrection.

807
00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:21.940
Uh,

808
00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:22.770
so,

809
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:23.050
uh,

810
00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.870
Ferguson's belief that he's going to be resurrected,

811
00:27:25.871 --> 00:27:28.150
the court said is not in that,

812
00:27:28.151 --> 00:27:33.151
it's not all that different from the views of millions of Americans with regard

813
00:27:33.161 --> 00:27:34.390
to their religious beliefs,

814
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:34.990
uh,

815
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:36.690
decisions almost self parity,

816
00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:37.331
uh,

817
00:27:37.331 --> 00:27:42.331
in terms of treating a profound mill illness is nothing but an unusual religious

818
00:27:44.201 --> 00:27:45.034
belief.

819
00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:45.760
Uh,

820
00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.760
John Ferguson was executed by Florida on August 5th,

821
00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.680
2013 and his case tells us a lot,

822
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:54.511
uh,

823
00:27:54.511 --> 00:27:59.511
about the mental condition that a person can be in a and still be executed in

824
00:28:00.281 --> 00:28:00.860
the United States.

825
00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:01.060
<v 0>It's.</v>
