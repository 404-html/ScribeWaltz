1
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.310
Racial disparities have been a future of the death penalty throughout the

2
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:19.170
history of the United States.

3
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.101
Of course,

4
00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:21.960
the death penalty was,

5
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.100
uh,

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.370
used so much in the south during the time of slavery.

7
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.301
Uh,

8
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:29.460
and also after the civil war,

9
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:31.350
during the time of Jim Crow,

10
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:34.020
justice lynchings and racial oppression,

11
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.160
uh,

12
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.970
and today still a,

13
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.070
there are racial disparities in the infliction of the death penalty.

14
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.180
Uh,

15
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.290
Warren McClusky,

16
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.270
who was sentenced to death in Georgia,

17
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.480
challenged racial disparities in the infliction of the death pony in Georgia in

18
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:53.280
a case McCleskey vs Kemp.

19
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.070
That's what we're going to start off talking about today.

20
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.150
Uh,

21
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.130
just to sort of set the stage.

22
00:00:59.131 --> 00:00:59.821
And Georgia,

23
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:02.760
27% of the population is African American.

24
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.601
Look at this.

25
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:08.250
65% of the victims of murder are African American.

26
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.250
Yet 80% of the people on death row,

27
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.270
uh,

28
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.920
are there for the murders of white people.

29
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.700
Uh,

30
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.700
clearly Georgia punishes the murder of a white person much more severely than it

31
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:23.130
does the murder of a black person.

32
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.671
Uh,

33
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:25.230
regardless of who commits a crime,

34
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:26.670
whether the person is black or white,

35
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.953
uh,

36
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.150
murders of African Americans.

37
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.700
Uh,

38
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.070
are not treated,

39
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.670
uh,

40
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.310
with the same degree of seriousness by the courts.

41
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.503
Uh,

42
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.510
Georgia prosecutors seek the death pony and 70% of the cases where the person,

43
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.210
the defendant is black and the victim is white.

44
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.230
Uh,

45
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.830
32% of white defendants on white victims,

46
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.700
uh,

47
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.700
19% white defendants and black victims and then 15% where it's black on black.

48
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.660
Uh,

49
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.460
so you can see,

50
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.200
uh,

51
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.430
the top two here,

52
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.210
uh,

53
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.210
the wide victim has a very prominent role in keeping this number above 20%,

54
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.120
uh,

55
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.460
as well as the race of the defendant.

56
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.660
Uh,

57
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.760
in terms of the imposition of the death pony,

58
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.980
22% black defendant,

59
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:18.090
white victim cases,

60
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.253
uh,

61
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.360
are,

62
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.760
uh,

63
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.800
the death penalty is imposed on those cases,

64
00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:23.880
only 8%,

65
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.020
where it's a white defendant and a white victim and then three and 1% for the

66
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:29.640
other racial combinations.

67
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.210
The ball to study was actually two studies,

68
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.051
uh,

69
00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:35.370
often referred to as the ball,

70
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:36.750
the studies if it was just one,

71
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:37.420
but there were two,

72
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.570
the procedural reforms study,

73
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.321
uh,

74
00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:42.660
and then the charging and sentencing study.

75
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.260
And the second the charging and sentencing one is the one that's really

76
00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:47.094
important.

77
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.150
Uh,

78
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.450
one of the criticisms that have been made of,

79
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.990
uh,

80
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.010
studies of the death penalty and of racial disparities with,

81
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.800
they were all these variables that weren't taken into account that if you just

82
00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:59.643
said,

83
00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.890
uh,

84
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.310
of all the people that were sentenced to death in the commission of a robbery,

85
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.240
uh,

86
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.350
the number of blacks was much greater than the number of whites.

87
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:09.280
People would say yes,

88
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:12.190
but there are a lot of other factors that have to be considered.

89
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.300
And what this study tried to do was take those factors into account.

90
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:18.880
A total of 230 variables,

91
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.540
uh,

92
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.740
were taken into account.

93
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.390
This is probably the most sophisticated,

94
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.350
uh,

95
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.970
study of sentencing,

96
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.691
uh,

97
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:29.470
that has ever been done about 2,500 Georgia cases.

98
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:30.490
This was from when the death,

99
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:33.700
plenty was re-instituted in Georgia until the time,

100
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:34.270
uh,

101
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.590
that the study was done.

102
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.670
And,

103
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.911
uh,

104
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:40.780
they found about 1600 people were eligible for the death penalty.

105
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.530
Uh,

106
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.040
but only 128 actually were sentenced to death.

107
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.290
So you see the tremendous difference,

108
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.950
uh,

109
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.470
in the number of people who could have received the death penalty,

110
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.140
but only 8% of the people did.

111
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.290
So the question was what were the factors that influenced how this narrowing

112
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:04.270
took place from going to 1600 a to 128 and to what extent,

113
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:04.870
if any,

114
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.910
did race play a role in that?

115
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.253
Um,

116
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.680
warm McCluskey was prosecuted in Fulton County.

117
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:12.514
That's Atlanta,

118
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.960
Georgia and of the 17 was charged for killing a police officer,

119
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.180
warm a Tuskegee was African American.

120
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.871
Uh,

121
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:21.190
the police officer was white.

122
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.170
Uh,

123
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.680
of the 17 people arrested for murder of a police officer,

124
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.550
uh,

125
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.280
during between 1973 and 79,

126
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:31.960
which is when this study was conducted,

127
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.590
a only McCluskey was sentenced to death.

128
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.843
Um,

129
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.560
the US and his colleagues who did this study,

130
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.340
uh,

131
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.340
performed a rigorous multiple regression analysis to try to take all these 230

132
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:51.730
variables that they had found and see how they factored into the process of who

133
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:53.380
got the death pony and who didn't.

134
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.130
To what extent things that were legally relevant may have factored in like

135
00:04:57.131 --> 00:05:01.270
multiple victims or crime against a stranger or torture.

136
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.600
But also to what extent did nonlegal factors like race come into play?

137
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.041
Uh,

138
00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:09.790
and,

139
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:10.150
uh,

140
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.811
after,

141
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:11.170
uh,

142
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.950
running,

143
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.540
uh,

144
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.040
the multiple regression analysis and looking at different,

145
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.880
uh,

146
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.870
aspects of this,

147
00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:17.704
the,

148
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:18.370
uh,

149
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.650
researchers concluded that a white person,

150
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:21.551
excuse me,

151
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:26.170
an African American leg McCluskey who's charged with a murder of a white person,

152
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.130
a is 4.3 times more likely to be sentenced to death.

153
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.240
Uh,

154
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.020
then,

155
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.830
uh,

156
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.570
other racial combinations,

157
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:35.813
um,

158
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.570
McCluskey race two claims,

159
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.900
a one that there was intentional racial discrimination against him because of

160
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:44.914
his race.

161
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.310
Uh,

162
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.420
and because the race of the victim and McCluskey his lawyer,

163
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.550
John Charles Boger,

164
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.900
the Naacp Legal Defense Fund,

165
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.650
when he stood up before the court to make the argument for McCluskey,

166
00:05:56.651 --> 00:05:57.080
he said,

167
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.460
if we had a law that said the death plenty could only be imposed in cases where

168
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.600
the victim was white,

169
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.150
it certainly would be unconstitutional.

170
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.081
In fact,

171
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:07.520
at one time in our history,

172
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.480
the punishment for crimes did very,

173
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.030
uh,

174
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.750
based on the race of the victim as well as the race of the defendant.

175
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.500
Uh,

176
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.760
but of course today that would not be in at the time I'm a classic use case,

177
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.270
uh,

178
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.260
that would not be a permissible basis for distinguishing which case has got the

179
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:25.640
death penalty in which did not.

180
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.331
Uh,

181
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:30.590
so his argument was race discrimination,

182
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:33.350
intentional race discrimination came into play.

183
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.310
And then he made a second argument based on the cruel and unusual punishment

184
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:38.960
clause of the eighth amendment,

185
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.801
uh,

186
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:43.250
in which he said there was an impermissible risk,

187
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.910
uh,

188
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.770
not necessarily intentional,

189
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.940
but that there were so many discretionary decisions being made.

190
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:53.090
So many people had so much discretion that by the time,

191
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.840
uh,

192
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.330
the death pony was or was not imposed,

193
00:06:56.331 --> 00:06:59.240
there was too great a risk of the death Poli,

194
00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.781
uh,

195
00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:02.390
of race in influencing who received the death pony.

196
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.250
This was what Justice Douglas had found in Furman versus Georgia.

197
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.040
And that was the reason for his vote to strike down the death.

198
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:15.041
Polian Furman versus Georgia was that there was so much room for discretion to

199
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:17.000
come into the process,

200
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.660
uh,

201
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.280
that it did not eliminate the risk or it didn't minimize the risk of race and

202
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:23.114
poverty,

203
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.360
uh,

204
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.380
coming into play.

205
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:25.700
Uh,

206
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.680
with regard to the first claim,

207
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:28.940
the equal protection claim,

208
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.811
uh,

209
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:34.811
the court set a very high standard of proof that warm McCluskey had to prove

210
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:40.811
that the decision makers in his case a acted with discriminatory purpose,

211
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:42.261
uh,

212
00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:47.261
that unlike a jury challenges the jury pools where you look at the number of

213
00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:51.710
people in the population and say it's 50% African American and you look at the

214
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:53.480
jury pool and it's 30%.

215
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.310
And you infer from that,

216
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.180
uh,

217
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.000
that there's discrimination or employment cases,

218
00:07:59.360 --> 00:07:59.870
uh,

219
00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.110
the decision to impose the death plenty.

220
00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:06.800
It's made one jury at a time and each jury is an ad hoc body that comes together

221
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:09.020
and makes that decision one time.

222
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:09.860
Uh,

223
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.540
really the decision making,

224
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:12.350
uh,

225
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.520
that results in these disparities is decision making,

226
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:15.950
uh,

227
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:16.910
by prosecutors.

228
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.050
The two most important decisions in every death penalty case is one,

229
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.320
does the prosecutors seek the death penalty to begin with?

230
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.060
Most of the time they don't.

231
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.370
Many prosecutors never seek the death.

232
00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:28.940
Polly,

233
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.340
some other prosecutors seek at every opportunity.

234
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:36.550
So there's wide variation in each prosecutors elected and most states from a

235
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:38.750
different judicial district.

236
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.100
So the practices in one district can be completely different than the practices.

237
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:44.243
And another,

238
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:49.010
the second critical decision is whether a plea bargain the case and resolve it

239
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:52.880
with a sentence other than death in exchange for the defendant pleading guilty

240
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:54.380
and waving a trial.

241
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.980
And that's where the overwhelming majority of capital cases are resolved.

242
00:08:58.981 --> 00:08:59.671
And they're resolved,

243
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:00.780
obviously without the death,

244
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:02.300
plenty being imposed because he,

245
00:09:02.301 --> 00:09:06.840
the prosecutor didn't seek it or because the prosecutor offers a plea bargain

246
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:09.510
and the cases resolved with a plea bargain.

247
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.760
But what about the times from the prosecutor won't offer a plea bargain and the

248
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:16.410
cases are taken to trial.

249
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.300
A Supreme Court,

250
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:18.841
uh,

251
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:22.080
as it had done in other cases of selective prosecution,

252
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:22.740
uh,

253
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.990
sets a very high standard,

254
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:25.590
uh,

255
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.240
for trying to challenge,

256
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:27.751
uh,

257
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:30.780
the decisions being made by prosecutors,

258
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.590
uh,

259
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:36.590
that exceptionally clear proof because of the value of discretion which can work

260
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:41.910
in the defendant's favor if the prosecution prosecutor is merciful or can work

261
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.720
adversely if the prosecutor decides just to seek the death pony,

262
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.243
uh,

263
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.730
exceptionally clear proof and we don't know how clear it has to be because

264
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:52.770
nobody has made this standard yet,

265
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.401
uh,

266
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:58.401
has proven this yet exceptionally clear proof is required to infer that there's

267
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.420
been race discrimination.

268
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:01.651
In other words,

269
00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:06.651
the person challenging the decision has to be able to show that the decision was

270
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:10.920
because of race and not merely in spite of it.

271
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.450
And the court,

272
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.170
uh,

273
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.490
has done this in other cases before McCluskey his case and uh,

274
00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:16.970
uh,

275
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.690
weight versus United States,

276
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.080
a number of people who had burned their draft card,

277
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.560
we're charged with evading the draft.

278
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:26.640
Uh,

279
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.750
when they prosecuted,

280
00:10:27.751 --> 00:10:28.051
they said,

281
00:10:28.051 --> 00:10:28.141
well,

282
00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:28.531
wait a minute.

283
00:10:28.531 --> 00:10:30.450
There were 600,000 people,

284
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:31.080
uh,

285
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.040
who didn't register for the draft and we're the only ones who got prosecuted.

286
00:10:35.041 --> 00:10:37.590
And it was probably because we burned our draft cards.

287
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:41.340
And so we're being discriminated against because we exercised our first

288
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:42.840
amendment right to protest,

289
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.000
supreme court rejected and said,

290
00:10:45.001 --> 00:10:49.110
you have to show that because of your exercise,

291
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:50.250
not million spite of,

292
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:50.821
uh,

293
00:10:50.821 --> 00:10:52.800
that the prosecutors singled you out.

294
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.700
It's pretty obvious that the prosecutors had a,

295
00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:00.150
but basically what that decision has done in subsequent decisions is pretty much

296
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:05.180
insulate from any judicial review decisions made by prosecutors in terms of

297
00:11:05.971 --> 00:11:10.590
whether to seek the death penalty and whether to resolve cases with plea

298
00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:11.310
bargains.

299
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:16.310
We'll also see that it's difficult for defendants to make that challenge because

300
00:11:16.681 --> 00:11:21.240
often the information that is needed is just simply not available.

301
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.111
Uh,

302
00:11:22.111 --> 00:11:24.510
with regard the Eighth Amendment Challenge,

303
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:25.650
uh,

304
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.940
the question was,

305
00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:31.110
is there some risk of race playing a role?

306
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.373
Uh,

307
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:36.450
there are risks that other kinds of prejudice will influence criminal trials.

308
00:11:36.451 --> 00:11:38.670
But the question about race is,

309
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:43.910
at what point does the risks become constitutionally inacceptable?

310
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:44.690
Uh,

311
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:45.570
unacceptable.

312
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.800
So those were the questions that were before the court to look at both of these.

313
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.070
Let's first look at what the court said about this statistics.

314
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.090
Uh,

315
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.020
Justice Powell road for the majority,

316
00:11:56.021 --> 00:11:57.070
the five justices,

317
00:11:57.071 --> 00:12:00.520
this was a five to four decision justice Powell writing,

318
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.090
uh,

319
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:02.050
for the majority,

320
00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:02.670
uh,

321
00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.030
says at most,

322
00:12:04.031 --> 00:12:09.031
the ball to study indicates a discrepancy that appears to correlate with race

323
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.960
and then goes on to say disparities in sentencing are inevitable,

324
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.520
which is one of the most striking lines in the McClusky opinion.

325
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.110
I guess the court in Brown versus board of education could have said differences

326
00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:30.550
in the kind of education children receive at school are inevitable.

327
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:31.350
Uh,

328
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.360
so we'll allow separate but equal to go on.

329
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.021
Uh,

330
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:37.240
the court didn't do that in the Brown case,

331
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.170
but it did do it.

332
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.370
And the mccloskey case,

333
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:40.120
uh,

334
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.960
basically,

335
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:41.470
uh,

336
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:46.330
saying that we are not going to assume that one is unexplained,

337
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.730
that these disparities that we see,

338
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:49.840
uh,

339
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.340
because discretion is so important to our criminal justice system that

340
00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:57.040
prosecutors have discretion that juries have discretion,

341
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.850
uh,

342
00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.560
that because that's so important.

343
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:04.660
We're not going to assume that what is unexplained is invidious.

344
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:05.350
Uh,

345
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:10.350
basically all the evidence is pointing to one reason for this and the baldest

346
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.790
study certainly isolated,

347
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:13.480
uh,

348
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.280
reasons for this.

349
00:13:15.281 --> 00:13:16.330
But the court said,

350
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.480
we're not going to assume that race was the factor that caused Warren McCluskey

351
00:13:22.781 --> 00:13:25.300
to be sentenced to death or that influenced the decision.

352
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.560
Doesn't have to be the only reason,

353
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:27.160
but,

354
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:27.401
uh,

355
00:13:27.401 --> 00:13:29.320
that Warren McCluskey got the death penalty.

356
00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:30.693
Um,

357
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:36.120
the court also said in light of the safeguards that the court had adopted a to

358
00:13:36.851 --> 00:13:38.710
minimize racial bias,

359
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:39.460
uh,

360
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.790
the value of the jury trial and the benefits of discretion.

361
00:13:42.791 --> 00:13:43.091
Again,

362
00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:44.800
back to the benefits of discretion.

363
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:45.640
Uh,

364
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:50.640
the court holds that the ball of study does not demonstrate a constitutionally

365
00:13:50.831 --> 00:13:55.000
significant risk of racial bias is the risk of racial bias.

366
00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.730
It's pretty well established by the study.

367
00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:58.380
Uh,

368
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:03.380
but the court concludes that it's not constitutionally significant in terms of

369
00:14:04.151 --> 00:14:06.070
affecting the capital sentencing process.

370
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:06.700
Uh,

371
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.533
in Georgia.

372
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.770
Uh,

373
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:13.120
the court also says it's nondiscriminatory or disproportionate,

374
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:18.810
disproportionate when applied to Warren McCluskey because McCluskey committed a

375
00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:23.110
crime for which the death pony could be imposed.

376
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:23.921
Of course,

377
00:14:23.921 --> 00:14:24.120
if,

378
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.720
if there's no problem,

379
00:14:25.721 --> 00:14:29.860
anytime a person that sends to death for a crime for which the death penalty can

380
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:30.730
be imposed,

381
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.680
then you stop right there.

382
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.330
And that's the end of the inquiry.

383
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.070
But as we saw earlier,

384
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:36.790
uh,

385
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:41.260
out of 1600 people who are Algebra for the death and the only 128 received it,

386
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:46.620
so a lot of decisions and discretion is being exercised to get down to the

387
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:51.890
people like Warren McClusky who ended up in that 128 who were sentenced to death

388
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.430
and not in the hundreds of other people who were not,

389
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:55.970
uh,

390
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:56.930
sentenced to death.

391
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.273
Uh,

392
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.680
Justice Powell also says that,

393
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:01.400
uh,

394
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.900
the sentence in this case was consistent with the procedures that Georgia has

395
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:07.130
for imposing the death penalty.

396
00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:11.540
These were upheld by the court and Greg versus Georgia in 1976.

397
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:12.374
One of the,

398
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:12.710
uh,

399
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.270
arguments McCluskey and made is that everybody in short,

400
00:15:15.271 --> 00:15:16.160
you're discriminated.

401
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:16.971
The legislature,

402
00:15:16.971 --> 00:15:17.640
the governor,

403
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.350
the juries,

404
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.220
the prosecutors,

405
00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:23.750
everyone in court said you can't say the legislature a discriminated because we

406
00:15:23.751 --> 00:15:27.170
upheld the Georgia statute in 1976.

407
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:31.160
Of course that was upholding the statute as written,

408
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.720
but not as applied.

409
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:33.590
Uh,

410
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:34.231
and mccloskey,

411
00:15:34.231 --> 00:15:35.180
his challenge was,

412
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:39.440
now that we've seen this statute and operation for some period of time,

413
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:43.640
what we're seeing are these rather dramatic racial disparities,

414
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:48.790
4.3 times more likely to get the death penalty if you're a black man like Warren

415
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.440
McCluskey and the victim is as a white person.

416
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.460
Uh,

417
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.210
but,

418
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:53.930
uh,

419
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:58.640
the court says because he could have received the death pony because this is

420
00:15:58.641 --> 00:16:02.600
under the statute which allows the death penalty if there's a homicide and

421
00:16:02.601 --> 00:16:03.980
aggravating circumstances.

422
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:04.670
Uh,

423
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:09.350
we're not going to assume that the death penalty was wantonly and freakishly

424
00:16:09.351 --> 00:16:10.184
imposed.

425
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:10.660
Uh,

426
00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:11.660
in this case,

427
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.650
uh,

428
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:13.820
two other considerations.

429
00:16:13.821 --> 00:16:18.821
The court mentions one that if McCluskey is a case was taken to its logical

430
00:16:19.701 --> 00:16:20.391
conclusion,

431
00:16:20.391 --> 00:16:23.060
it would throw into question,

432
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:23.840
uh,

433
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.090
the entire criminal justice system,

434
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:27.021
uh,

435
00:16:27.021 --> 00:16:29.300
that if we looked at race bias,

436
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:29.971
uh,

437
00:16:29.971 --> 00:16:31.730
in the imposition of the death pony,

438
00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:32.270
uh,

439
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:37.270
we could be soon confronted with claims that there's race discrimination in

440
00:16:37.401 --> 00:16:38.750
other kinds of sentencing.

441
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.340
And there certainly is,

442
00:16:40.341 --> 00:16:44.090
we know that there's race discrimination and penalties for drug use,

443
00:16:44.091 --> 00:16:44.924
for example.

444
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:45.820
Uh,

445
00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:50.360
and basically the court is saying if we start looking at race and depth pony

446
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:51.194
cases,

447
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:51.531
uh,

448
00:16:51.531 --> 00:16:56.360
then we might have to start looking at race in all kinds of other criminal cases

449
00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:01.520
where it appears that the sentencings are more severe as applied to African

450
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.320
Americans or Hispanics or whoever,

451
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.960
uh,

452
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.330
that applied to whites.

453
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.900
Uh,

454
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.250
Justice Brennan call this,

455
00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:07.730
uh,

456
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.440
the fear of too much justice.

457
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:10.490
Uh,

458
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.760
and others could argue that if there are those racial disparities,

459
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.540
uh,

460
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:15.410
which there are,

461
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:15.920
uh,

462
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.470
throughout the criminal justice system,

463
00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:21.590
what the courts ought to be about is dealing with them,

464
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.190
uh,

465
00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:27.080
not sweeping them under the rug by having a standard of proof that no one can

466
00:17:27.081 --> 00:17:27.650
meet.

467
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:28.940
But that's what the court did.

468
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:29.540
Uh,

469
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:30.440
in this case,

470
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:31.663
uh,

471
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.660
justice probably even goes on to say hard to understand this,

472
00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:40.661
that it could even be applied to other characteristics such as gender.

473
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:41.703
Of course.

474
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.480
Normally we don't allow discrimination on the basis of gender,

475
00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:49.481
but he goes even further than that to say that that if McCluskey his claim is we

476
00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:54.570
might even apply to facial characteristics or physical attractiveness.

477
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:55.591
Now,

478
00:17:55.591 --> 00:18:00.480
justice Lewis Powell lived in Richmond for genuine,

479
00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:03.090
which was the capital of confederacy at one time.

480
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.360
He surely knew that African Americans had been subject to discrimination

481
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.420
throughout the history of this country and we're still subject to

482
00:18:12.421 --> 00:18:13.320
discrimination.

483
00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:17.910
It was in no way comparable to people based on their facial characteristics are

484
00:18:17.911 --> 00:18:19.890
based upon their physical attractiveness.

485
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.930
So it's an,

486
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:21.280
it's a,

487
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.650
it's a striking line,

488
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:23.251
uh,

489
00:18:23.251 --> 00:18:24.120
in the opinion,

490
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:24.901
uh,

491
00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:25.620
that,

492
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:25.861
that,

493
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:30.861
that he would say that a claim based on race is as trivial as a claim based on

494
00:18:31.261 --> 00:18:32.800
physical attractiveness or,

495
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.380
or facial features.

496
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:35.813
Uh,

497
00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.010
he says there's one other factor and that's,

498
00:18:38.011 --> 00:18:40.590
that this is best presented to the legislature's,

499
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:41.491
uh,

500
00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:44.430
that they can weigh the studies and the information.

501
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.310
And they can decide what's appropriate.

502
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.121
Of course,

503
00:18:48.121 --> 00:18:49.530
the problem is that,

504
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.220
uh,

505
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.550
legislatures are very driven by the majority.

506
00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:54.270
Uh,

507
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.850
and if someone's constitutional rights are being violated,

508
00:18:56.851 --> 00:18:58.950
the buck really stops with the courts.

509
00:18:59.370 --> 00:18:59.701
Uh,

510
00:18:59.701 --> 00:19:00.720
it's the courts,

511
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:01.381
uh,

512
00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:04.770
that would have to step in and do something about,

513
00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:05.620
uh,

514
00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.170
or race discrimination.

515
00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:12.550
It's unlikely that particularly when you have states like Texas and Georgia and

516
00:19:13.231 --> 00:19:16.650
Alabama and others where the death pony is immensely popular,

517
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:17.461
uh,

518
00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:22.230
that those states are going to look at the death pony and decide that they're

519
00:19:22.231 --> 00:19:23.160
not going to impose it.

520
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:23.881
Although,

521
00:19:23.881 --> 00:19:24.870
as we will see,

522
00:19:24.871 --> 00:19:29.820
one state North Carolina did pass a law to look at race disparities and the

523
00:19:29.821 --> 00:19:30.810
influence of race,

524
00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:31.440
uh,

525
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.730
in capital sentencing.

526
00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:33.410
Uh,

527
00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.090
and what they saw was,

528
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.953
uh,

529
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:42.110
not a very favorable with regard to the fair implement a fair infliction of the

530
00:19:42.691 --> 00:19:42.901
death.

531
00:19:42.901 --> 00:19:47.901
Plenty of North Carolina Justice Brennan in his descent in this case says at

532
00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:52.650
some point where McCluskey undoubtedly ask his lawyer what the chances were that

533
00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:54.150
he was going to get the death penalty.

534
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.201
He says,

535
00:19:55.201 --> 00:19:57.540
an answer to that question would have to be disturbing,

536
00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:58.580
uh,

537
00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:02.520
because the lawyer would have to tell McCluskey that nothing about the fact of

538
00:20:02.521 --> 00:20:03.480
his crimes.

539
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.500
Uh,

540
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.140
nothing about his own personal background.

541
00:20:07.141 --> 00:20:12.141
His prior record would be as influential in terms of whether he received the

542
00:20:12.331 --> 00:20:13.164
Death Poli,

543
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:13.980
uh,

544
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.000
as his race,

545
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:15.871
uh,

546
00:20:15.871 --> 00:20:17.430
and the race of his victim.

547
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:23.300
It's a remarkable thing that William Brennan in his lofty perch and the supreme

548
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:29.541
court or the United States could so clearly understand conversations that

549
00:20:30.001 --> 00:20:35.001
lawyers and people facing the death penalty have in jails all over the United

550
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:36.850
States.

551
00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:37.230
Uh,

552
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:42.230
he said those conversations which continued until this day would be the most

553
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.440
eloquent desense to the McClusky opinion of all.

554
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.730
The question then is,

555
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.810
is there a remedy after McCluskey for race discrimination,

556
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:58.540
one of the first cases to present this was another Georgia case of a felony and

557
00:20:58.541 --> 00:21:02.380
wildly Dobbs who was sentenced to death and Walker county.

558
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.250
Uh,

559
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:08.250
Georgia here was a case where powerful evidence that everybody involved in the

560
00:21:09.431 --> 00:21:09.731
case,

561
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:10.511
the jurors,

562
00:21:10.511 --> 00:21:11.350
the prosecutor,

563
00:21:11.351 --> 00:21:12.131
the defense lawyer,

564
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:12.964
the judge,

565
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.540
uh,

566
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.000
that there were these racial attitudes of the community.

567
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.070
Had this history of race,

568
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:18.821
uh,

569
00:21:18.821 --> 00:21:19.654
and yet,

570
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:20.650
uh,

571
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:21.700
Dobbs lost,

572
00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:22.131
uh,

573
00:21:22.131 --> 00:21:23.500
the court ruled against him.

574
00:21:23.501 --> 00:21:27.490
He said on the first prong that he hadn't proven intentional racial

575
00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:28.390
discrimination.

576
00:21:28.391 --> 00:21:32.470
And we've talked about why and McCluskey why that is almost impossible.

577
00:21:32.471 --> 00:21:35.380
It is impossible to prove after the McClusky case.

578
00:21:35.381 --> 00:21:40.381
And then the court said with regard to the risk of race playing apart and Dobbs

579
00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:41.613
case,

580
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.250
uh,

581
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:43.010
that,

582
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.270
uh,

583
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.670
as long as these procedures existed,

584
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.080
such as,

585
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:47.590
uh,

586
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.790
procedures prohibiting discrimination in the composition of the jury pools,

587
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:53.950
a Batson versus Kentucky,

588
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:58.360
which says that a prosecutor's theoretically can't strike on the basis of race,

589
00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.231
uh,

590
00:21:59.231 --> 00:21:59.950
that,

591
00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:00.670
uh,

592
00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.070
other things that the Supreme Court,

593
00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:03.820
uh,

594
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.960
had had held and the Georgia death penalty statute and the aggravating and

595
00:22:07.961 --> 00:22:09.280
mitigating circumstances.

596
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.113
And the way,

597
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.570
uh,

598
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:11.520
it decided,

599
00:22:11.521 --> 00:22:11.740
uh,

600
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.320
or guided how the death point it was to be imposed.

601
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:14.861
It said,

602
00:22:14.861 --> 00:22:16.150
because these procedures,

603
00:22:16.151 --> 00:22:18.400
Georgia had minimize the risk.

604
00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:19.960
Now this is an important point.

605
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.340
Notice it didn't say the procedures had to work.

606
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:29.910
It only looks at whether there are procedures that minimize the risk.

607
00:22:30.611 --> 00:22:32.350
And if there are such procedures,

608
00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:33.490
stop right there.

609
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.890
And that's what the court did in Dobbs.

610
00:22:35.891 --> 00:22:36.724
This case,

611
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:41.650
what it really says is that as long as these procedures exist and they don't

612
00:22:41.651 --> 00:22:43.030
have to be implemented in the case,

613
00:22:43.031 --> 00:22:44.200
it doesn't have to be invoked.

614
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.800
Uh,

615
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.633
in the case,

616
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.210
uh,

617
00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.840
the court is going to reject a claim of race discrimination today,

618
00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:55.020
virtually impossible for a defendant to get even a hearing on a claim of race

619
00:22:57.071 --> 00:22:57.970
discrimination.

620
00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:02.650
Even though everybody knows that race is playing a role,

621
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.660
very often a dominant role.

622
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.110
On the question of do we seek the death pony or do we not?

623
00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:12.580
We know that the prominence and the race of the victim is a critical factor.

624
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:13.270
Uh,

625
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.010
we know that the race of the defendant,

626
00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:15.551
uh,

627
00:23:15.551 --> 00:23:16.420
is a factor,

628
00:23:16.421 --> 00:23:18.220
particularly interracial crimes,

629
00:23:18.221 --> 00:23:22.480
particularly if there's sexual assault or behavior like that involved.

630
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:23.201
Uh,

631
00:23:23.201 --> 00:23:25.600
and there's some politics involved as well too.

632
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.080
Those are all extra legal factors that shouldn't be considered.

633
00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:29.800
Uh,

634
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.530
but they're very much central to the decision to seek death,

635
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:33.400
uh,

636
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.690
in many cases.

637
00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.460
Let's talk for a moment about,

638
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:37.120
uh,

639
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.800
Dominic green's case in,

640
00:23:38.801 --> 00:23:43.390
in Texas where he did at least get an issue of race discrimination before the

641
00:23:43.391 --> 00:23:44.890
Texas Court of criminal appeals.

642
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:45.771
Uh,

643
00:23:45.771 --> 00:23:49.430
this case involved a crime committed by four people,

644
00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:51.290
three blacks and one white.

645
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Two of the blacks who participated in a crime may plea bargains and got out with

646
00:23:57.561 --> 00:23:58.610
prison sentences.

647
00:23:58.790 --> 00:23:59.990
The White Fella,

648
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:01.610
he didn't get charged at all,

649
00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:05.180
so he walked away free from this crime.

650
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:06.080
Uh,

651
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.850
green was sentenced to death,

652
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.811
uh,

653
00:24:08.811 --> 00:24:10.550
and the prison people,

654
00:24:10.551 --> 00:24:14.600
the jail people intercepted some letters that he wrote to one of the other

655
00:24:14.601 --> 00:24:16.460
fellows who was accused in the case,

656
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:17.240
uh,

657
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:22.180
repeatedly using the word sort of the wrap word Nigga in Igg,

658
00:24:22.181 --> 00:24:27.181
Aa a and he signed off the letter as a trigger happy Nigga.

659
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:28.723
And,

660
00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.090
uh,

661
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:31.430
that was presented to the jury case.

662
00:24:31.431 --> 00:24:34.220
Went up on the argument that this was not necessary,

663
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:34.820
uh,

664
00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.640
to put this letter in a,

665
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:41.210
but the Texas court held that the probative value outweighs any prejudicial

666
00:24:41.211 --> 00:24:43.770
effect and that it was properly admitted,

667
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:44.310
uh,

668
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.620
at Greens trial and,

669
00:24:45.621 --> 00:24:48.020
and green was put to death.

670
00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:49.310
Um,

671
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:50.450
let's look at John Bass,

672
00:24:50.451 --> 00:24:50.961
this case.

673
00:24:50.961 --> 00:24:52.010
This was the case.

674
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:52.760
Uh,

675
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.000
that points out the problem of getting information.

676
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:57.320
Uh,

677
00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:02.360
United States government has been prosecuting capital cases since 1988 and we

678
00:25:03.591 --> 00:25:08.591
know that the federal government prosecuted Steph pony cases more than twice as

679
00:25:09.231 --> 00:25:12.500
often against African Americans than against whites.

680
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.820
Really quite remarkable.

681
00:25:13.821 --> 00:25:18.020
And the federal death row is quite remarkable and it's overwhelmingly people of

682
00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:18.854
color.

683
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:19.311
Uh,

684
00:25:19.311 --> 00:25:24.110
also the Justice Department plea bargains more often with whites and other words

685
00:25:24.111 --> 00:25:26.690
in that second decision that prosecutors make,

686
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:31.930
we know that federal prosecutors are more likely to offer a life sentence and

687
00:25:33.021 --> 00:25:37.610
allow a person to escape the death pony if they're white than if they're black.

688
00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.930
All this information is presented to the United States district court,

689
00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.130
which says,

690
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:43.551
well,

691
00:25:43.551 --> 00:25:44.720
we need to look into this.

692
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:45.470
Uh,

693
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:50.470
we need to require the prosecution to provide some information about its

694
00:25:50.511 --> 00:25:55.511
charging practices so that we can see if there's some explanation for why it is

695
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.090
that more blacks are charged,

696
00:25:59.390 --> 00:25:59.601
uh,

697
00:25:59.601 --> 00:26:01.370
that blacks are denied plea bargains.

698
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.910
Uh,

699
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:05.810
that's upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the sixth circuit.

700
00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:06.830
Uh,

701
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:11.690
but the United States Supreme Court Grants Hersha Rari and summarily reverses

702
00:26:11.691 --> 00:26:12.524
the case,

703
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:13.191
uh,

704
00:26:13.191 --> 00:26:18.191
and basically says that bass has not made a credible showing up discrimination,

705
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.491
uh,

706
00:26:19.491 --> 00:26:21.350
that the raw statistics,

707
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:25.610
which the only statistics he can have because he doesn't have the information

708
00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.100
that the court had ordered me this closed.

709
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:28.940
Uh,

710
00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.140
but it says all this is,

711
00:26:30.141 --> 00:26:31.190
is raw statistics.

712
00:26:31.191 --> 00:26:34.220
It shows they're seeing the death putting more often against blacks.

713
00:26:34.221 --> 00:26:37.340
It shows that they're giving plea offers more often a whites,

714
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.900
but that alone doesn't really tell you anything because in theory,

715
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.310
there could be some other explanations for that.

716
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:44.940
Uh,

717
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:45.960
besides race.

718
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.831
Uh,

719
00:26:46.831 --> 00:26:48.960
another case involving information,

720
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:49.681
uh,

721
00:26:49.681 --> 00:26:50.460
was,

722
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:50.671
uh,

723
00:26:50.671 --> 00:26:52.170
in Ray United States,

724
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:52.831
uh,

725
00:26:52.831 --> 00:26:56.970
this was a fellow named Williams who was one of 14 people who was indicted for a

726
00:26:56.971 --> 00:26:58.320
terrible crime.

727
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.981
Uh,

728
00:26:58.981 --> 00:27:03.210
they were smuggling people into the United States and the back of a truck.

729
00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.051
Uh,

730
00:27:04.051 --> 00:27:09.051
and as a result of the heat and the failure to adequately take care of these

731
00:27:09.241 --> 00:27:09.480
folk,

732
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.740
19 people,

733
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.220
uh,

734
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:11.940
suffocated,

735
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:12.773
died,

736
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:13.200
uh,

737
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.040
in this truck.

738
00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.200
Uh,

739
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.080
and there were 14 people indicted for this,

740
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:19.980
uh,

741
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.681
by the only stuff that,

742
00:27:20.681 --> 00:27:21.514
that point against one.

743
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.130
And that was Williams.

744
00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:27.360
And so Williams of course raised this with the court.

745
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:27.691
Why,

746
00:27:27.691 --> 00:27:28.380
why me?

747
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:33.380
Why am I the one for which the government seeing the death pony when the 13

748
00:27:34.171 --> 00:27:38.100
other people who were involved in the smuggling operation just as I was,

749
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:41.130
and not saying he shouldn't be punished for what he did,

750
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.083
but why is the,

751
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:44.880
why is the death penalty being sought?

752
00:27:44.881 --> 00:27:45.714
In his case,

753
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.310
a judge Gilmore,

754
00:27:47.311 --> 00:27:49.170
the United States district judge,

755
00:27:49.171 --> 00:27:52.740
this was a federal prosecution in federal court in Texas.

756
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:58.230
The district judge said that she wanted the Department of Justice to give

757
00:27:58.231 --> 00:28:01.710
information about its sentencing practices,

758
00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:02.580
uh,

759
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:06.660
to the defense so they can make an assessment of why it was that Williams was

760
00:28:06.661 --> 00:28:08.370
charged and not other people.

761
00:28:08.371 --> 00:28:12.780
And Williams also pointed to these larger racial disparities in the use of the

762
00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:13.680
federal death public.

763
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.193
Um,

764
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.270
and then when the government wouldn't turn the information over,

765
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.190
a judge Komora said,

766
00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:20.311
well,

767
00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:25.170
I'm going to instruct the jury that I asked for this information and the

768
00:28:25.171 --> 00:28:26.970
government refused to give it.

769
00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.240
This is sort of like a missing witness instruction.

770
00:28:30.241 --> 00:28:34.770
Sometimes if one side has the ability to call a certain witness and doesn't call

771
00:28:34.771 --> 00:28:35.604
that witness,

772
00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:35.940
uh,

773
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.730
the court will give an instruction to the jury,

774
00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:42.210
can draw some inference from the figure to present the witness.

775
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:46.200
A mandamus relief is very unusual,

776
00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:46.790
uh,

777
00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.750
and only for a,

778
00:28:48.751 --> 00:28:53.751
an abuse of discretion and almost never granted against district judges.

779
00:28:53.911 --> 00:28:54.750
But here,

780
00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:59.100
the United States Court of Appeals for the fifth circuit issued a regimen,

781
00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.400
Damon saying that a judge can more,

782
00:29:02.401 --> 00:29:05.010
could not give that instruction,

783
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:05.880
uh,

784
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.100
and said that she had abused her discretion,

785
00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:08.700
uh,

786
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:12.600
and therefore prohibited as it turned out that case,

787
00:29:12.601 --> 00:29:15.390
all of them when we did go to trial Williamson's not sentenced to death.

788
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.350
Uh,

789
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:17.430
but here again,

790
00:29:17.431 --> 00:29:22.431
we see the courts just simply unwilling to give up any information that might

791
00:29:23.731 --> 00:29:25.530
explain the racial disparities.

792
00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:26.010
Uh,

793
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.920
the case that sort of is the genesis of all of those.

794
00:29:28.921 --> 00:29:32.340
The case called in re Armstrong versus United States,

795
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:33.180
uh,

796
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.870
which had to do with the disparities and drug sentencing with crack cocaine and

797
00:29:36.871 --> 00:29:37.704
powdered cocaine.

798
00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.370
Uh,

799
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:38.911
once again,

800
00:29:38.911 --> 00:29:40.650
a district court did order disclosure,

801
00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.340
it had up to a court of appeals,

802
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:44.350
but the Supreme Court of the United States said,

803
00:29:44.351 --> 00:29:44.890
no,

804
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.210
you couldn't get the information.

805
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:46.781
Of course,

806
00:29:46.781 --> 00:29:48.100
if you can't get the information,

807
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:49.360
you can't prove your case.

808
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:55.080
So the court has done two things with regard to race claims and race cases.

809
00:29:55.181 --> 00:29:58.270
One is set a very high standard,

810
00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.320
uh,

811
00:29:59.320 --> 00:29:59.890
that,

812
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:00.520
uh,

813
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:05.410
exceptionally clear proof that the defendant has to show because of,

814
00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.880
and not merely in spite of,

815
00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:07.770
uh,

816
00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:07.990
and,

817
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:09.010
and secondly,

818
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:09.520
uh,

819
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.200
deny the evidence in,

820
00:30:11.201 --> 00:30:12.130
in these cases,

821
00:30:12.131 --> 00:30:12.761
the court has said,

822
00:30:12.761 --> 00:30:15.760
we're not going to look into the reasons for the prosecutors,

823
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:16.470
uh,

824
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:17.130
decisions.

825
00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:21.310
We're not going to require the prosecutor to give up information that might help

826
00:30:21.311 --> 00:30:24.310
us understand why certain decisions were made.

827
00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:24.881
Uh,

828
00:30:24.881 --> 00:30:26.050
the result is,

829
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.710
uh,

830
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:28.900
basically that,

831
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:29.860
uh,

832
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.440
even though race plays such an important role,

833
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:33.370
uh,

834
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.710
in who sends to death,

835
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:40.570
which cases advanced a death penalty or are seen as stuff point of cases,

836
00:30:40.571 --> 00:30:42.540
advanced a penalty phase and does imposed,

837
00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:43.180
uh,

838
00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.660
the courts almost never now based on McCluskey,

839
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:47.290
uh,

840
00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:51.880
look into why it was a and what prosecutorial decisions were made,

841
00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:52.600
uh,

842
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.840
and whether race influenced those decisions at all.

843
00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.900
The last case,

844
00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.660
state versus a Dorsey,

845
00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.231
uh,

846
00:31:02.231 --> 00:31:04.960
this is the monument,

847
00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:05.340
uh,

848
00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:07.180
out in front of the courthouse in Shreveport,

849
00:31:07.181 --> 00:31:07.791
Louisiana,

850
00:31:07.791 --> 00:31:08.980
and it's Keto parish,

851
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.761
uh,

852
00:31:09.761 --> 00:31:11.020
where we have Robert E.

853
00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.780
Lee and Stonewall Jackson and Jefferson Davis.

854
00:31:13.781 --> 00:31:15.220
And then we have sort of the all,

855
00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:15.990
uh,

856
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:18.940
every man sort of soldier for the confederacy,

857
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:19.571
uh,

858
00:31:19.571 --> 00:31:21.370
as well as the confederate flag.

859
00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:22.090
Uh,

860
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:23.050
one of the jurors,

861
00:31:23.051 --> 00:31:26.540
one of the African American jurors who pass by that going in the courthouse

862
00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:26.801
said,

863
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:27.550
you know,

864
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:29.140
I don't feel very comfortable,

865
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:29.770
uh,

866
00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:32.320
coming into a courthouse that has this huge,

867
00:31:32.321 --> 00:31:33.380
and you can see this is this,

868
00:31:33.381 --> 00:31:35.680
and not just a little little plaque or something.

869
00:31:35.681 --> 00:31:37.210
This is a huge monument,

870
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.650
concrete monument maintained there in front of the courthouse,

871
00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.381
right where you come.

872
00:31:42.381 --> 00:31:42.701
And he says,

873
00:31:42.701 --> 00:31:43.240
I,

874
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.550
I don't think that's right.

875
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.240
Uh,

876
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.320
these people were in rebellion against the United States of America and they

877
00:31:50.321 --> 00:31:51.700
were in rebellion because of race.

878
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:53.050
Uh,

879
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:55.420
and so he was excused from jury duty.

880
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:56.410
Uh,

881
00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:00.730
Dorsey's lawyers raised the question that race came into play in his case

882
00:32:00.731 --> 00:32:01.331
because of course,

883
00:32:01.331 --> 00:32:01.841
all the jurors,

884
00:32:01.841 --> 00:32:06.700
black or white had to go pass this a symbol of the confederacy.

885
00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:07.510
Uh,

886
00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:09.370
but the Louisiana Supreme Court,

887
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.270
uh,

888
00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.103
held,

889
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.441
uh,

890
00:32:11.441 --> 00:32:12.274
that,

891
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.670
uh,

892
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:16.840
that did not in any way interfere with this trial and affirm just a sentence.

893
00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.160
There has been legislation passed and just a few states,

894
00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:21.821
uh,

895
00:32:21.821 --> 00:32:25.150
to deal with race discrimination since the courts are not dealing with it.

896
00:32:25.151 --> 00:32:25.984
Kentucky,

897
00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:26.470
uh,

898
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:28.060
Pastor Racial Justice Act,

899
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:28.650
uh,

900
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:32.590
North Carolina passed a racial Justice Act and actually,

901
00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:33.693
uh,

902
00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.250
had hearings on it.

903
00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.093
Uh,

904
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.911
two hearings,

905
00:32:36.911 --> 00:32:38.230
one involving a,

906
00:32:38.231 --> 00:32:40.040
one person sends to death.

907
00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:42.830
And the second hearing involving three other people sentenced to death,

908
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:43.420
uh,

909
00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.270
and Cumberland County,

910
00:32:44.271 --> 00:32:45.110
North Carolina.

911
00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.530
And the findings made a,

912
00:32:48.531 --> 00:32:51.650
as will be discussed with Henderson Hill and another segment,

913
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.431
uh,

914
00:32:52.431 --> 00:32:53.390
were really,

915
00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.140
uh,

916
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.010
quite striking.

917
00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:55.851
Uh,

918
00:32:55.851 --> 00:33:00.230
it's one thing to look at the jury strikes within a particular case and see that

919
00:33:00.231 --> 00:33:01.970
there's the dis disparate number,

920
00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:02.421
uh,

921
00:33:02.421 --> 00:33:03.650
used against black,

922
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:04.110
uh,

923
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:06.290
as opposed to white perspective jurors.

924
00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:07.610
But what happened,

925
00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.211
uh,

926
00:33:08.211 --> 00:33:13.100
in the racial justice act cases in North Carolina was they put together all of

927
00:33:13.101 --> 00:33:16.820
the jury strikes in death penalty cases in North Carolina.

928
00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:22.040
And when you aggregate all those numbers and you see that over the course of the

929
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:22.491
time,

930
00:33:22.491 --> 00:33:24.890
since North Carolina has had the death penalty,

931
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.830
a white person is,

932
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:28.491
or excuse me,

933
00:33:28.491 --> 00:33:31.970
a black person is twice as likely to be struck,

934
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:33.350
uh,

935
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:34.190
from jury duty.

936
00:33:34.191 --> 00:33:37.100
When the prosecutor has a chance to strike a black person,

937
00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.180
it's twice as often that they're going to strike a black person as a white

938
00:33:41.181 --> 00:33:42.014
person.

939
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:42.381
Uh,

940
00:33:42.381 --> 00:33:46.100
the court also found that the race neutral reasons,

941
00:33:46.101 --> 00:33:47.930
prosecutors we're giving,

942
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:48.830
uh,

943
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:49.790
we're often,

944
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:50.570
uh,

945
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.200
not only pre textual,

946
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:52.820
uh,

947
00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.280
but it came out in the hearing,

948
00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:55.940
uh,

949
00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.710
that the prosecutors had a cheat sheet,

950
00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:01.790
a and they had the race neutral reasons already written out,

951
00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:02.510
uh,

952
00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:04.250
before they ever,

953
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:05.120
uh,

954
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.110
saw the jurors.

955
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:10.820
So when a prosecutor struck a black juror and under Batson versus Kentucky,

956
00:34:10.821 --> 00:34:11.391
the judge,

957
00:34:11.391 --> 00:34:12.380
if it was challenged,

958
00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:13.101
the judge would say,

959
00:34:13.101 --> 00:34:14.060
what was your reason?

960
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.590
You just look down and say,

961
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:16.161
ah,

962
00:34:16.161 --> 00:34:20.810
that person looked distant or solen or some other,

963
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.410
uh,

964
00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:26.000
race neutral reason that had been supplied before you ever saw the juror.

965
00:34:26.001 --> 00:34:27.260
And the way the jury behaved,

966
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:28.130
uh,

967
00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:29.000
judge weeks,

968
00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:29.630
uh,

969
00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:30.560
found that,

970
00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:31.310
uh,

971
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:34.250
prosecutors in North Carolina instead of,

972
00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:35.240
uh,

973
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:40.240
trying to study how to present their cases to diverse juries and how to have a

974
00:34:42.321 --> 00:34:47.321
fair system had instead tried to figure out how do we resist the Batson versus

975
00:34:48.621 --> 00:34:49.550
Kentucky decision.

976
00:34:49.551 --> 00:34:52.430
How do we continue to exclude black people from serving?

977
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:53.630
In both cases,

978
00:34:53.631 --> 00:34:55.790
he found that race had been a factor,

979
00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:59.360
which was the statutory language race had been a factor,

980
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:00.110
uh,

981
00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.700
in the imposition of the death poem.

982
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:03.350
And under the statute,

983
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.100
uh,

984
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.330
the four cases,

985
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:06.110
uh,

986
00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:10.880
the sentences in the four cases were reduced from death to life in prison.

987
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:12.223
Uh,

988
00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.970
what did the North Carolina legislature do upon finding that race had played

989
00:35:16.971 --> 00:35:19.820
such a dramatic role in death penalty cases?

990
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.631
Uh,

991
00:35:20.631 --> 00:35:23.900
it repealed the racial justice act.

992
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.891
Uh,

993
00:35:24.891 --> 00:35:26.600
and so now,

994
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:27.643
uh,

995
00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:32.090
people in North Carolina who had the opportunity to make claims that McCluskey

996
00:35:32.091 --> 00:35:33.860
basically bart everywhere else,

997
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:36.940
but in North Carolina and allowed by statute,

998
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:37.580
uh,

999
00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.140
can no longer make those claims.

1000
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.371
Finally,

1001
00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:42.510
in federal cases,

1002
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.440
uh,

1003
00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:48.440
federal jurors are required to sign a statement and are instructed that they are

1004
00:35:48.961 --> 00:35:53.670
not to let the race of the victim or the race of the defendant come into play

1005
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.530
when they make the decision.

1006
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:56.550
Uh,

1007
00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:00.420
whether or not this is very effective in presenting race from coming into play,

1008
00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:01.050
uh,

1009
00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:02.340
is subject to debate.

1010
00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:03.240
Uh,

1011
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.800
but overall,

1012
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:08.010
as we look back on what we've talked about in this segment,

1013
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.410
we see that the reluctance of courts to deal with race,

1014
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.120
certainly in North Carolina,

1015
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:20.270
we see the reluctance to deal when race is proven to repeal the law.

1016
00:36:20.671 --> 00:36:22.690
So that can't be proven anymore.

1017
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:23.490
Uh,

1018
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:26.130
and North Carolina was the only in Kentucky,

1019
00:36:26.131 --> 00:36:29.130
the only states that have passed racial justice acts.

1020
00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:31.920

1021
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.701

1022
00:36:32.701 --> 00:36:34.230

00:36:40.951 --> 00:36:43.980
death penalty always has been and still is today.
