1
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,560
Victim impact evidence.

2
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,630
One of the more controversial areas of
capital punishment at the penalty phase

3
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:19,950
of a capital trial.

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,380
The prosecution can in most states,

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,100
put on evidence from the victim's family
or members of the community to talk

6
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:28,680
about what the impact on
the community has been.

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,120
And on the survivors,

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,260
the supreme court first said in booth
versus Maryland that this evidence was not

9
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:34,861
admissible,

10
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:39,420
but just a short time later after a change
in some members of the court held in

11
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:40,980
Payne versus Tennessee,

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,380
that such evidence was admissible.

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,260
And now in almost all the states
that have the death penalty,

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,390
victim impact evidence is admissible.

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,140
I've asked five students from Yale law
school to come here and discuss the

16
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:54,840
various aspects of victim impact evidence,

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:55,381
uh,

18
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:56,430
with us today.

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,200
I want to introduce Megan walked
suppressed who is from Chicago,

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,140
who's with us as well as
Emma Kaufman from Carlisle,

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,230
Pennsylvania to my immediate
right is Jamil Giovanni from,

22
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:09,870
uh,

23
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,703
Toronto,

24
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:11,610
uh,

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,790
to my left if familiar,

26
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,430
Morgan from Los Angeles.

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,001
Uh,

28
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:16,140
and finally Virginia,

29
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:16,700
uh,

30
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,780
mccline bit who was from Iowa.

31
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:19,943
So,

32
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,351
uh,

33
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:21,960
I want to thank all of them,

34
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,441
uh,

35
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:25,860
for joining us here today
to talk about this subject.

36
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,800
And Jamil,

37
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,720
let me just start with you.

38
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,590
What is,

39
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:28,960
what,

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,410
what is the victim impact evidence?

41
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,860
What does the jury do with it?

42
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,731
Well,

43
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:36,250
the jury's going to use that information
to sort of get the full picture of the,

44
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,580
the harm caused by the
crime in particular,

45
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:41,280
the impact on the family,

46
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,870
whether it's financial,

47
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:43,471
emotional,

48
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:44,520
psychological,

49
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,180
um,

50
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,930
trying to get a larger picture of
what happened as a result of the crime

51
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:50,010
committed by the defendant.

52
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,000
And

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,560
what does the dream do with that?

54
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,011
I mean,

55
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:54,210
how does it weigh it?

56
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:56,640
It's deciding it's got
aggravating circumstances,

57
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:57,990
mitigating circumstances.

58
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:58,291
What is,

59
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,124
so what does it do with it?

60
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,430
I mean,

61
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,940
I think theoretically it goes to the
jury's understanding of the victim who was

62
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:05,460
lost and the extent of the harm committed.

63
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:09,150
So it gives the jury a better sense
of who it was that was affected by the

64
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:09,720
crime,

65
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,010
which goes to the gravity of the crime.

66
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,121
Megan,

67
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:12,954
do you have any different,

68
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,191
well,

69
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:17,820
I think it also serves a purpose
within the courtroom for the victims

70
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:18,421
themselves.

71
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:22,410
I mean it's introduced after the Mig or
alongside the mitigating evidence stage

72
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:26,160
in which you get a much fuller picture
of the defendant's life and why they're

73
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:27,690
deserving of the jury sympathy.

74
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,430
And so it feels like a
way of counteracting that
vision of the defendant in

75
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:37,431
defense of the perceived harm by the
victim and the victim's family shooting

76
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,450
part of why this evidence is admissible,

77
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,290
the balance out,

78
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:44,520
the mitigating evidence
about the defendant with
the seven and it's about the

79
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:45,870
person whose life was taken.

80
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,450
Um,

81
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,600
I mean I think that's theoretically
one of the rationales for it,

82
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:50,841
again,

83
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:51,560
to get a full,

84
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,910
a full picture of the crime.

85
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:53,660
Um,

86
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,170
I think a lot of people would say
that that is prejudicial that in,

87
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,830
um,

88
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,710
in the penalty phase looking at

89
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:05,010
the defendant and it's about that person
and their life and so extra information

90
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:05,740
about the,

91
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,460
uh,

92
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,010
the victim just serves to confuse
what's happening in the courtroom.

93
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,820
Collaborate on that just a little bit.

94
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,640
Are you saying maybe the seven
it should be admitted or,

95
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:14,474
or it should be.

96
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,500
One of the questions we have of course
is not only if it's going to be admitted,

97
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:20,360
which the Supreme Court
has pretty much decided,

98
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:22,820
but the scope of the
evidence once it comes in,

99
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:23,361
how much,

100
00:03:23,361 --> 00:03:24,870
how much evidence is going to be allowed.

101
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,650
Right?

102
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:25,921
Yeah.

103
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:26,400
I think,

104
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,700
I think you have to be very careful
about how the evidence is presented.

105
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:30,480
And so,

106
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:30,870
um,

107
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,740
because it can have extraordinarily
prejudicial effects for the defendant.

108
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:35,610
And I think that,

109
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,570
um,

110
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,110
often,

111
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,381
I mean,

112
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:38,760
when you're looking at a capital case,

113
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,530
you're always going to be
dealing with someone who's,

114
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,191
who's died.

115
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:42,720
Like there's always going
to be someone who's Dad.

116
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:43,460
And so,

117
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:43,800
um,

118
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,230
that's obviously hugely
harmful for the community.

119
00:03:46,231 --> 00:03:46,890
But when you,

120
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,990
when you bring in all of
these people who aren't,

121
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,460
who are talking about their loss,

122
00:03:50,461 --> 00:03:53,550
there's a risk that the defendant
isn't going to get a fair trial.

123
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,000
Do you remember what are,

124
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,440
what are your thoughts about this in
terms of it is a fair trial risk by this

125
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:01,780
cause this evidence be too emotional or,

126
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,500
uh,

127
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:02,791
what,

128
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,850
what's your take on it?

129
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,341
Yeah,

130
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:04,851
absolutely.

131
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:05,690
I think there's a,

132
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:09,530
there's a risk at hand here when you
have people kind of pulling at the

133
00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:10,880
heartstrings of a jury.

134
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,330
Uh,

135
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,780
they might make decisions that are more
motivated by emotional appeal as opposed

136
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:18,950
to fairness or as opposed to what is the
kind of reasonable application of the

137
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:19,580
law.

138
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:19,821
Uh,

139
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:20,720
but ultimately,

140
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:20,881
uh,

141
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:21,890
I think there's the,

142
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,460
the,

143
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,700
the important thing is the restorative
aspect that I think it can give to

144
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:27,800
victims and making sure they
get to play a part in the,

145
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:28,610
in the,

146
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,680
in the trial and making sure that their,

147
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,460
their,

148
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:31,790
uh,

149
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,720
their experience through the crime is
being weighed by people and that they are

150
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:39,290
some fairness to their process
and some closure for them as well

151
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,000
before we're done to scope.

152
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:41,271
I mean,

153
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:43,880
is there anybody that thinks this evidence
just shouldn't be admitted that the

154
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:45,220
court got it wrong and,

155
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:45,530
and,

156
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,390
and Payne versus Tennessee?

157
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:47,790
Emma?

158
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,001
Yeah.

159
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:48,834
I think it's,

160
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,980
I think justice Stevens wrote in his
dissent to the opinion that allowed it in

161
00:04:52,981 --> 00:04:55,760
that we're just entering
unchartered sees of irrelevance.

162
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,790
I think that was how he put it.

163
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,120
My impression is that what you're
supposed to be thinking about during the

164
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:05,121
penalty phase of a capital trial is the
defendant's crime and whether or not the

165
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:08,250
defendant's life has mitigating
aspects to the sentence,

166
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:08,461
right.

167
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:13,230
So I just think we're going beyond the
scope entirely of what is at issue in the

168
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:14,064
penalty phase,

169
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,513
Megan.

170
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:16,381
Well,

171
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:17,610
I think that there's a,

172
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:22,611
there's a real risk that it sets the jury
up to believe that the only way to do

173
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,160
proper or to properly honor
the life of the victim and,

174
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:30,330
and to show respect for the victim is to
give the death penalty when that those

175
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,164
two,

176
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:36,630
whether or not to choose death for the
defendant and whether or not one honors

177
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,670
and appreciates the loss of the victim
seem to be two different determinations

178
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:46,500
that get conflated or confused by the
admission of victim impact statements and

179
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:46,980
evidence.

180
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,150
Let's spend just a moment.

181
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:49,470
I'm talking about the scope,

182
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,210
uh,

183
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,120
of this evidence.

184
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:54,720
Some courts have allowed just very
brief statements being made by,

185
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,790
uh,

186
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,470
witnesses about the person,

187
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,160
uh,

188
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,230
who's no longer in large
to the victim of the crime.

189
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:00,891
Uh,

190
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:04,700
others have allowed a very elaborate
even characterizations of the crime,

191
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:09,701
the family talking about what punishment
they want imposed a in the materials we

192
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,390
cite to justice Stevens,

193
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,980
a descending opinion.

194
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:15,110
And in one case in which
you put a videotape,

195
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,090
uh,

196
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:16,970
on the website,

197
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:17,601
uh,

198
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:19,620
with regard to a 20 minute videotape,

199
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,720
a about a person,

200
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:22,630
is there any limit to,

201
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,560
is there any limit to this evidence?

202
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,051
Well,

203
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,660
I think that's part of the problem that
was wrong with sort of the pain decision

204
00:06:27,661 --> 00:06:28,111
in general.

205
00:06:28,111 --> 00:06:32,490
The court didn't really set any
standards or guidance for courts to um,

206
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:32,941
applying,

207
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:34,890
deciding what should be
the scope of this evidence.

208
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:37,650
And so now you have cases
where there's video tapes,

209
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:38,950
maybe 40 minutes long,

210
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,110
extremely long composition by Enya or
something along those lines where it's,

211
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,780
the evidence is extremely
emotionally evocative.

212
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:49,830
And so there's really an issue I would
say with scope and the courts haven't

213
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:54,000
really across the board I'm found a
sufficient way of sort of challenging this

214
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:57,720
type of evidence and ensuring that
there's not disparities between courtrooms

215
00:06:57,721 --> 00:07:01,710
and defendants given the quality of the
victim impact evidence that's presented.

216
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,960
And certainly January she stayed too

217
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,260
taking different approaches.

218
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:09,340
I mean some states like Oklahoma is
allowed all sorts of evidence to come in,

219
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:14,230
whereas Georgia requires a hearing before
where the witnesses testify and only

220
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:16,040
very limited presentations.

221
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:16,871
Right.

222
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:17,321
And I think,

223
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:19,450
I think that again gets
to the problem with,

224
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,170
um,

225
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,380
the death penalty being arbitrary and
capricious as administered in different

226
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:23,801
states.

227
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:25,990
That if you are going to
allow this kind of evidence,

228
00:07:25,991 --> 00:07:26,980
and I think it has to be,

229
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,550
um,

230
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,160
pretty severely constrained in
terms of what you can offer.

231
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:30,750
Um,

232
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,630
and I think it's,

233
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:33,910
it's just really difficult
because as Megan said,

234
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:34,510
it's,

235
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,020
um,

236
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,321
you know,

237
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:35,591
it's,

238
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:39,670
it's something for the victim and their
family to be able to express the grief

239
00:07:39,671 --> 00:07:40,271
at the loss.

240
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:40,900
And,

241
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,111
um,

242
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:42,040
but that's really not,

243
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:42,490
and that's,

244
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,870
that's something that needs to happen.

245
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,600
It's just not clear to me that where
that needs to happen is that the penalty

246
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:50,530
phase of a capital trial when the issue
was really the individual defendant and

247
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:54,130
their individual sentence and they're
being prosecuted by the state for what

248
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:55,930
they did that was contrary
to the laws of the state.

249
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:59,140
And so it's hard because I think you
have to draw a pretty fine distinction

250
00:07:59,141 --> 00:08:02,470
between what the purpose of the penalty
phases and even though part of it is

251
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:04,360
honoring the loss of the
victim and their family,

252
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:04,620
that's,

253
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,610
that's really not the main purpose,

254
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,371
Chris,

255
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:11,030
to the quality of this evidence is
going to vary some depending upon how

256
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:13,940
articulate the members of the victim's
family or you may have people from a

257
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:16,430
prominent family may have
someone who has no family at all.

258
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:17,870
So there's no one to testify.

259
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,800
Uh,

260
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,040
Justice Betterman the Georgia
Supreme Court Express some concern,

261
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:22,821
uh,

262
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:23,590
about,

263
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:23,930
uh,

264
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,650
two classes of victims are,

265
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:27,080
are we concerned about that journal?

266
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:27,890
Uh,

267
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,360
well I think we're concerned about that.

268
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:34,280
And so far as there are inequalities and
disparities in American society and so

269
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,240
you're going to have
different levels of education,

270
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:36,520
diff,

271
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,580
how different degrees in which people
can be eloquent and articulate their

272
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:44,210
experience through a crime and the impact
is left on them and their families.

273
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,770
I don't think that a trial is where
we necessarily need to be concerned,

274
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:49,340
uh,

275
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,380
about trying to equalize this.

276
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:52,214
People are going to,

277
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,420
we are being,

278
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,370
we're essentially asking us are we going
to make a qualitative decision about

279
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,410
how well we think someone communicates,

280
00:08:58,411 --> 00:08:59,244
articulates.

281
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,050
And I don't think that's
really the goal here.

282
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:04,500
The goal is to create an opportunity for
people who have been affected to speak

283
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:05,610
about how they've been affected.

284
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,000
I think there's a great point I believe
made by Justice Scalia where he talks

285
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:12,060
about how there's going to be
differences between one defense attorney,

286
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,540
another.

287
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,470
There's going to be different
than the one prosecutor and other,

288
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,700
there's always going to be
these qualitative differences
in how well someone can

289
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:19,800
be articulate and how all
they can be an advocate.

290
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,873
And I think that,

291
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,480
um,

292
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,810
you know,

293
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,360
we should,

294
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,660
that's a natural part of the,

295
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:26,710
the legal system and uh,

296
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,160
we,

297
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,770
I don't think being too preoccupied
with that is really the,

298
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,970
the point here that every victim is
going to come from a different angle with

299
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:35,970
different things to say and we need
to respect and honor that can come in

300
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:36,804
different forms.

301
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,930
So say this is just the vagaries
of the system in any crime,

302
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,520
it may be that the witnesses or
articulate or not witnesses to testify the

303
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:46,440
lawyers may be a of different

304
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,490
quality and so forth,

305
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,920
comfortable with those
kinds of inequalities that I
think that's a conversation

306
00:09:50,921 --> 00:09:53,160
we need to be having our
school large and our,

307
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:53,410
yeah,

308
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,060
and our larger social issues and not,

309
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,350
not when it comes to a trial,

310
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,653
Emma,

311
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,020
I mean I agree with Jamil that we need
to be having a broader conversation about

312
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,310
embedded inequalities.

313
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,000
But it seems to me that if the goal
in sentencing is to determine what's

314
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:08,890
appropriate for the crime that was done,

315
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:14,190
that there's something wrong with a
hierarchy of victim hood in which those

316
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:16,630
people who know more people
who are more eloquent,

317
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:18,340
who are more well connected,

318
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,150
are going to have more of an emotional
impact on a jury than those people who

319
00:10:22,151 --> 00:10:22,451
aren't.

320
00:10:22,451 --> 00:10:23,020
Right.

321
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,561
Ultimately,

322
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:28,060
the impression you're giving is that
murdering someone who is more prominent in

323
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:32,680
society is more problematic
or more offensive than
murdering someone who doesn't

324
00:10:32,681 --> 00:10:34,810
have family members to come
testify on their behalf.

325
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,630
Anyone else want to comment on that,

326
00:10:37,631 --> 00:10:38,290
Megan?

327
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:38,411
Oh,

328
00:10:38,411 --> 00:10:41,120
well I think that there's some worry,

329
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:42,370
some intersections with,

330
00:10:42,371 --> 00:10:42,971
for example,

331
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:46,540
the results in McCleskey v
Camp of the empirical study of,

332
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,040
of when the death penalty is granted.

333
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:48,750
And so you,

334
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:48,911
right,

335
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:50,070
and in that case you're talking about,

336
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:51,690
just so everybody knows
what we're talking about,

337
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:55,520
the case racial discrimination and
the racial disparities and the Dustin,

338
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:55,990
right.

339
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,111
So,

340
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:56,680
yeah,

341
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,750
so through very extensive empirical work,

342
00:10:58,751 --> 00:11:02,230
they found that the way to increase
the likelihood of receiving the death

343
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:06,640
penalty is basically to be an African
American individual whom earners a white

344
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,610
individual and,

345
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:12,280
and the way in which that the kinds of
effects of what lives are considered

346
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:17,020
valuable and what lives are considered
the death of which people is considered a

347
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:18,490
particularly heinous crime.

348
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,520
I think given the broader structural
problems our society has intersect with

349
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:27,220
real in really uncomfortable
ways with a face frame,

350
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:27,550
uh,

351
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,510
phase of the trial devoted to
measuring the severity of that impact.

352
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:32,561
Well,

353
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,870
back to my earlier question
about the scope of this.

354
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:35,260
What,

355
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,020
what should the scope be?

356
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,071
I mean,

357
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:39,821
should we allow,

358
00:11:39,821 --> 00:11:40,654
I mean,

359
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,230
uh,

360
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,160
extensive testimony with these
video tapes and so forth or,

361
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:44,500
or,

362
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,730
or is there a principle way to
decide how much evidence to allow?

363
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,680
I think that's a very difficult question.

364
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:53,210
I don't think that there have been many
courts that have really addressed that

365
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:53,990
head on.

366
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,410
But I do think that I agree somewhat
with the purse a bar as relates to the

367
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:58,880
victim impact videos.

368
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,690
I think it's very hard to sort of
standardize the quality of victim,

369
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,111
um,

370
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:05,330
videos as technology advances,

371
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:07,280
as there's differences in resources.

372
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,870
Um,

373
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,840
and I also think that the,

374
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:08,991
uh,

375
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:11,030
approach adopted by the
Georgia Supreme Court,

376
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:11,864
I believe,

377
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:12,500
um,

378
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,730
to go through written testimonies and
allow victims to present their testimony

379
00:12:16,731 --> 00:12:17,870
through a written statement,

380
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,590
but then go through an excise those
parts that are maybe very prejudicial

381
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:23,420
towards a defendant
referring to the defendant,

382
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,950
let's say in a disparaging way.

383
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,340
Keeping the focus on impact
might be one way of channeling,

384
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,820
um,

385
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,600
the evidence that's presented to the
court and trying to keep away a testimony

386
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,370
that might unduly inflame the jury.

387
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,650
So I do believe that
statement should play a role.

388
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,130
Um,

389
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,570
but victim impact videos,

390
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:39,630
I don't think that there's a,

391
00:12:39,631 --> 00:12:43,610
a principled way of channeling those
types of videos and perhaps outside of

392
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:44,690
maybe a hard time limit,

393
00:12:44,691 --> 00:12:46,820
but then you still couldn't
really control the quality.

394
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:47,923
Um,

395
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:50,090
so I would say that's
probably one approach

396
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,070
for any of those videos are,

397
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:52,390
are,

398
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,630
are quite often admitted and
are pretty much standard,

399
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:54,880
uh,

400
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,460
practice,

401
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,020
uh,

402
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,853
in that state.

403
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,360
The Supreme Court really has been
looked at this since the time of pain,

404
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:02,260
which in which the,

405
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:03,630
at least just so Connor said,

406
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:07,060
this was a brief glimpse
at the victim's life,

407
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,160
but at least we see in some states now,

408
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,820
it's a much more elaborate
a glimpse than just a,

409
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:13,990
a brief claps.

410
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,813
Jenny.

411
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,391
Yeah,

412
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:18,040
I really agree with what Julia said,

413
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:18,520
that it's,

414
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:18,790
um,

415
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,500
I think to the extent that
you're going to allow it,

416
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,810
it has to be fairly
circumscribed and controlled.

417
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,200
Um,

418
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,370
and I think the court should know in
advance what's going to be stuck said.

419
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,680
And essentially the only way to do
that is through a written statement.

420
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,450
I think that again,

421
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,480
these victims and their families have
had hugely traumatic experiences and I

422
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:37,240
just,

423
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,140
it's um,

424
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:38,560
if you,

425
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,130
if you got into a situation where
someone said something that was the court

426
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:44,830
eventually said was more prejudicial
than probative or whatever,

427
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,550
it's just,

428
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,750
it's very hard for,

429
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,680
um,

430
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,100
it's very easy for just one
comment to tape taint the whole,

431
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,900
the whole trial or the
whole penalty phase.

432
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:53,734
And so,

433
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,160
um,

434
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,680
definitely I think the videos
are really problematic,

435
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:57,514
especially with,

436
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,060
you know,

437
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,100
the soft music in the
background and it's just,

438
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:00,934
it's really,

439
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,361
I mean,

440
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:03,280
these are very moving
things and they should be,

441
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:03,761
it's just,

442
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:05,470
I don't think that they
belong in the courtroom

443
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:06,500
in,

444
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,550
in one of the cases it's in the
materials George Battles case,

445
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,630
uh,

446
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,680
the prison guards,

447
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:15,250
this was a fellow who was accused and
convicted of killing a prison guard at the

448
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:19,930
penitentiary in Atlanta and guards
testified at the penalty phase that,

449
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:20,650
uh,

450
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,650
it would be bad for morale if battle was
not given the duck pond good for morale

451
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:27,970
if he was given the death penalty.

452
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,320
Uh,

453
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,190
should that type

454
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,680
of evidence be admitted,

455
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:33,514
Megan?

456
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,331
Well,

457
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:38,980
that gets a little bit trickier because
there are all ready provisions within

458
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:43,981
our criminal laws that make the severity
of punishment associated with killing a

459
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:46,210
public officer such as a policeman,

460
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,000
a higher of a,

461
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,280
the penalty is higher than
to kill an ordinary citizen.

462
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,460
Um,

463
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,360
in part because of the criminal justice
system is meant to be the action of the

464
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:59,420
state against the individual and the
collective against the individual rather

465
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:02,240
than just the victim
against the defendant.

466
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,550
And so in the,

467
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,481
for me,

468
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:10,481
the trickiness in that case is because
they're making an appeal to the broader

469
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:15,551
social or institutional effects of the
crime and they're basically saying this

470
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:20,510
impedes our ability to carry out a public
service in the same way that the death

471
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:24,350
of a police officer impedes the ability
of police officers to carry out a public

472
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:25,184
service.

473
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,000
And so while I would find such,

474
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,360
I mean I'm uncomfortable with
the admission of that testimony.

475
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:37,361
I think it does push up against this
larger contrast between who exactly is

476
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:39,890
pursuing the defendant
and the trial and who,

477
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,910
whose justice are we seeking
the victims or the states in a,

478
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:44,780
in a way that perhaps the,

479
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,280
the more personalized victim
impact statements don't,

480
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,301
they don't,

481
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:52,910
they don't push up against the
public function of the trial.

482
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:53,744
In the same way,

483
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,750
the fact that the victim was
a police officer or was a,

484
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,110
a guard at a prison is often
an aggravating circumstance.

485
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:03,270
So that's already in the mix there.

486
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,190
But then the question becomes,

487
00:16:05,191 --> 00:16:08,160
can members of the police
department members of the,

488
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,880
uh,

489
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,830
the guards a group at the prison,

490
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:14,830
can they say this will
affect our morale if,

491
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:15,001
if,

492
00:16:15,001 --> 00:16:15,330
if,

493
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:15,900
uh,

494
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,151
or,

495
00:16:16,151 --> 00:16:18,900
or you will show your
support for the police?

496
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:19,621
Uh,

497
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:22,860
if you give the death polling
in this particular case,

498
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,143
Emma,

499
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,200
I would think not right.

500
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:29,380
I would think that was
extremely prejudicial.

501
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,250
Um,

502
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,080
and the question that raises for me,

503
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,220
if we're going to admit it,

504
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:38,170
is why then it wouldn't mean that we're
also admitting testimony from the family

505
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:41,770
members of the person who's going to be
executed about the potential effects of

506
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:43,150
the execution on the family.

507
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:46,870
Cause that's another class of prospective
victims here that we don't talk about

508
00:16:46,871 --> 00:16:47,620
very much.

509
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,810
And that kind of testimony
doesn't come in very much,

510
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,000
but there are cases in which people say,

511
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:52,271
you know,

512
00:16:52,271 --> 00:16:55,750
you're going to execute my father that
will have long term effects on me.

513
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,050
So should we be letting that and if
we're going to be letting in police

514
00:16:59,051 --> 00:16:59,890
officer's saying,

515
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,560
this will perspectively affect
my morale in a certain way.

516
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,660
What was his defense lawyer to do?

517
00:17:04,661 --> 00:17:04,891
What,

518
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,340
what let's say hypothetically,

519
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:08,110
what if they're negative,

520
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:08,890
uh,

521
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,880
characteristics?

522
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:10,091
Uh,

523
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:10,990
of the,

524
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,550
let's say the person who

525
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,040
was the victim and the crime was actually
somebody who may have been involved in

526
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:22,630
illegal activities or may have done
other things that would not reflect

527
00:17:22,631 --> 00:17:23,530
favorably on them.

528
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,410
Is that going to be introduced
as part of this evidence?

529
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,330
Jenny?

530
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:27,730
So,

531
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,530
so I think that's one of the reasons
that I find victim impact evidence so

532
00:17:31,531 --> 00:17:35,130
problematic is because the 14th amendment
guarantees the right to due process

533
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:39,840
and a big portion of what our country
believes that due processes is adversarial

534
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:40,674
testing.

535
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,770
And there's just no way that you can
really attack the credibility of a victim

536
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:47,490
in this case because the person,

537
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:47,761
I mean,

538
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:48,750
the person has died,

539
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:49,660
they've been the victim of a,

540
00:17:49,661 --> 00:17:50,410
of a horrible

541
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,243
crime.

542
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,260
And so I don't think that if,

543
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,400
if I were a defense lawyer,

544
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:55,234
I would feel,

545
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:55,810
um,

546
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,930
that it was extraordinarily risky to
try and attack that kind of evidence.

547
00:17:58,931 --> 00:18:00,700
I think very quickly you're going to look,

548
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,360
um,

549
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,480
petty or like you're playing games or
like you're not respecting the fact that

550
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:06,070
this is a horrible loss and so,

551
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:08,770
and it is a horrible loss
and that should be respected.

552
00:18:08,771 --> 00:18:09,550
And so,

553
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,000
um,

554
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,090
I don't think there's any way to
effectively cross examine the testimony.

555
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:13,780
I don't think,

556
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:13,990
I don't,

557
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,231
yeah,

558
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:14,501
I just,

559
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:17,980
I don't think it can be subjected to
the kind of adversarial testing that we

560
00:18:17,981 --> 00:18:19,450
think is essential to due process.

561
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,090
So if you're the defense lawyer,

562
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,940
you're probably,

563
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:25,590
even if you know that not going
to put that evidence on right.

564
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,350
Am I right?

565
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:26,690
Yeah,

566
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,400
that seems like an impossible choice.

567
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:28,790
I would,

568
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,110
I would think you would always choose no.

569
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,253
Right.

570
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,360
So that was one of the concerns.

571
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:36,330
Justice Powell had a course
in the booth case was that,

572
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,170
uh,

573
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:42,170
the really may not be much back and forth
with regard to this kind of evidence.

574
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:43,651
Well.

575
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:46,050
Any final thoughts that anyone wants to,

576
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:46,320
uh,

577
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,840
sure,

578
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,650
sure.

579
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,190
Yeah.

580
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:48,480
Uh,

581
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,110
you going back to the previous question,

582
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:54,610
we're talking about crimes happening in
a social context and I often think about

583
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,090
the case being brought against George
Zimmerman about the death of Trayvon

584
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:58,330
Martin.

585
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:02,680
And think about the importance of a
victim impact evidence being brought into

586
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:04,150
that trial as it goes on.

587
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:08,470
And the need to make sure that the voices
of people who have been affected by

588
00:19:08,471 --> 00:19:10,930
the death of this young
man are going to be heard.

589
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,260
And I think that that's an example
that I think challenges some of our

590
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,470
assumptions about who is the
defendant and who is a victim.

591
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,760
And in this situation,

592
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:22,300
I think that there is a lot of justice
that can be given to communities,

593
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,560
young people,

594
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,040
uh,

595
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,450
black communities that have been denied
justice for long periods of time by

596
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,520
letting their voice and their,

597
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,160
their experience be part of this trial.

598
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,800
And I think that's an example
where I think we're going to see,

599
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:36,280
uh,

600
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,760
Vic,

601
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,520
if we see victim impact
evidence abroad into that trial,

602
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,330
I think we're going to see a,

603
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,051
a lot of,

604
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:41,620
um,

605
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,120
a lot of people who've been denied
justice in the past feel like the America,

606
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,350
the,

607
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,050
the criminal justice system in America
is starting to do them a favor a or work

608
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:51,190
in their favor I should say.

609
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,110
Um,

610
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,380
and I,

611
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,610
I look forward to seeing the
conversations around that.

612
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,381
Of course,

613
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:57,810
that's a very high profile case.

614
00:19:57,811 --> 00:19:59,520
What about the day to day case?

615
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,621
I mean,

616
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:03,460
in cases that we don't hear
about on the national news and,

617
00:20:03,461 --> 00:20:03,671
and,

618
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:04,021
and,

619
00:20:04,021 --> 00:20:07,850
and there were just what's going on
in communities all across the country.

620
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,440
I think that victim impact evidence
introduces or perhaps exacerbate some

621
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:15,530
structural disparities that we already
have existing within our criminal justice

622
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:18,500
system around access to
counsel and competent counsel.

623
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:22,280
Perhaps counsel notes that the victim
impact evidence will be prejudicial,

624
00:20:22,281 --> 00:20:24,350
but it doesn't raise that
objection in the trial.

625
00:20:24,351 --> 00:20:27,710
And so now we have individuals sentenced
to death because of the quality of

626
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:28,940
victim impact evidence.

627
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,361
Um,

628
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:33,200
and that I think is an impermissible
risk and that's something that we worry

629
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:36,560
about when we are imposing the death
penalty to the extent that the society

630
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:37,730
continues to do so.

631
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,391
And so,

632
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:42,050
although I agree with Jamil
on incorporating the views
and perspectives of the

633
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:43,730
community and ensuring their voice,

634
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,980
the voice of the victims in this process,

635
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,000
I think we have to be very
concerned about how we

636
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,190
are embedding within to the process.

637
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:53,550
I'm more structural disparities that
we as a society have not decided to

638
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:54,384
rectify.

639
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:54,831
Jenny,

640
00:20:54,831 --> 00:20:55,830
would you add anything to that?

641
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:56,970
Um,

642
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,120
I would just add I agree with Jimmy Earl.

643
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:00,390
I think his point is well taken,

644
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:04,860
but I think that we need to be really
careful and remember that in individual

645
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:07,320
trials we still have an
individual system of adjudication.

646
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,190
Ultimately it's about the individual
who committed the crime allegedly.

647
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,180
And um,

648
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,260
and you know,

649
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,490
what happened around that.

650
00:21:14,491 --> 00:21:17,790
So I think that cultural
context is important,

651
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:21,240
but I think that we can't allow that to
get it get in the way of the individual

652
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:22,860
defendant having a fair trial.

653
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:23,420
Um,

654
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,160
and there might be other contexts where
it's more appropriate to have those

655
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:26,911
conversations,

656
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:27,750
which are essential,

657
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:30,300
but maybe not at the penalty
phase of a capital trial.

658
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,070
Chris,

659
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,650
most people on death row are there
for crimes against white people,

660
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,240
overwhelmingly even in states that have
large African American populations,

661
00:21:38,241 --> 00:21:39,200
Georgia for example,

662
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:41,900
80% of the people on death
row there for murder.

663
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:42,920
So of white people.

664
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,090
Uh,

665
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:44,923
does that,

666
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,790
is that a factor or Emma?

667
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,121
Yeah,

668
00:21:47,121 --> 00:21:47,954
I mean I think,

669
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:52,070
I think the things we're getting at here
today in Jameel's comments and in these

670
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:55,190
facts about race are that these
are much broader structural issues,

671
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:55,730
right?

672
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,780
And there's a desire,

673
00:21:56,781 --> 00:22:01,760
I think in what you're talking about
for a more restorative model of dealing

674
00:22:01,761 --> 00:22:04,850
with a crime and for a more restorative
model of dealing with the history of

675
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:06,170
racism in the United States.

676
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:06,351
Right?

677
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:11,150
We want to have a bigger conversation
about where this country is and it gets

678
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:13,610
condensed into the penalty
phase of a capital murder trial,

679
00:22:13,611 --> 00:22:17,960
which feels like an odd place to do
justice to pat to the past or to racial

680
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:18,710
injustice.

681
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,490
Um,

682
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:19,821
but yeah,

683
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:22,310
I think if you start
to look at the numbers,

684
00:22:22,311 --> 00:22:26,150
you start to look at jury composition
and people of color being excluded from

685
00:22:26,151 --> 00:22:26,571
juries.

686
00:22:26,571 --> 00:22:29,960
You start to look at the McClaskey study
and the number of people who are being

687
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:33,890
convicted solely because the aggravating
factor is that they are African

688
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,040
American.

689
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,100
You start to just have
fundamental questions about
whether we're really talking

690
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:38,090
about a justice system

691
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,450
and if this larger conversation isn't
going on or doesn't come to some

692
00:22:42,451 --> 00:22:43,284
resolution,

693
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,080
which seems like it's been
going on for centuries.

694
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:46,951
Uh,

695
00:22:46,951 --> 00:22:48,600
what do we do with the individual case,

696
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:49,410
Megan?

697
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,243
Oh Wow.

698
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,333
Huh.

699
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,633
MMM.

700
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,400
I think that we,

701
00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:01,430
we very much lead a space or some
kind of social recognition of the harm

702
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,670
associated with murder.

703
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,720
Um,

704
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,170
that,

705
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:07,530
uh,

706
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:12,530
a lot of what Virginia has been saying
about the deep need for victim's families

707
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,370
to,

708
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:18,630
to gain public appreciation for their,

709
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:19,570
for their suffering.

710
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:21,270
Okay.

711
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,580
But it doesn't fit into
the adversarial trial.

712
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,300
It doesn't,

713
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:29,300
it's not fair to any individual defendant
to compress all of those wide variety

714
00:23:30,481 --> 00:23:33,330
of issues into the penalty phase.

715
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,450
And so in,

716
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:35,751
I mean,

717
00:23:35,751 --> 00:23:40,250
in the meantime I suppose my preferred
solution is to exclude most of this

718
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:45,251
evidence absent maybe some written
statements but also to work on developing

719
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,500
forms of restorative justice
or alternative procedures
that don't determine

720
00:23:53,311 --> 00:23:54,750
whether a person lives or dies,

721
00:23:54,751 --> 00:23:58,410
but nevertheless provide this opportunity
for social recognition of the arm.

722
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,090
The very profound harm that has
happened in any death penalty case.

723
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,510
Well is this discussion is brought out,

724
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:10,511
this is a credibly a contentious issue
and there is questions about who should

725
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:12,080
it come in at all,

726
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,003
what's the limit?

727
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,050
We've just touched on
some of those things.

728
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:16,550
We could talk about him a lot longer.

729
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,300
Uh,

730
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,080
but uh,

731
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,840
this is how long we'll
talk about them today.

732
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:25,841
I want to thank everyone for coming and
being a part of this discussion and I

733
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:28,760
hope that it's helpful as we
think through this question,

734
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,510
uh,

735
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:33,140
because eventually the supreme court
probably will look at this question again

736
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:37,100
and decide some of these things we've
talked about particularly about the scope,

737
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:37,731
uh,

738
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:40,490
or that by that I mean what
evidence is going to be admitted.

739
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,120
Uh,

740
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,901
how extensive,

741
00:24:41,901 --> 00:24:45,980
it can be characterizations the sort of
opinions like in the battle case that we

742
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:46,760
discussed.

743
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,990
So thank you all very much,

744
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,740
uh,

745
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,890
most grateful to you for your
contributions to our discussion.
