1
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,130
We're joined for this segment,

2
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,140
but with Derwyn button,

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,650
who is the chief public
defender for Orleans parish.

4
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:20,401
That's New Orleans,

5
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:21,234
Louisiana.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,610
Derwin thank you so much for
being here with us today.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,503
Thank you for having me.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,021
Well,

9
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:28,080
I wanted you to talk just a little bit
about your office in New Orleans and the

10
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:32,400
challenges of representing poor people
accused of crimes in New Orleans.

11
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,241
Well,

12
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:38,241
I think our challenges aren't unique
to a lot of offices we have in our,

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,750
in our state and in our city,

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,580
a large volume of cases,

15
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:46,581
a large volume of serious cases and very
few resources to handle all of those

16
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:47,671
cases.

17
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:52,671
And we've been fighting over the last few
years trying to even the playing field

18
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:57,930
and trying to provide excellent public
defender services for poor folks in the

19
00:00:57,931 --> 00:00:58,764
parish.

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,730
And it's been,

21
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,660
it's been up and down,

22
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:04,290
but we've been largely
successful in a lot of ways.

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,700
We've had our setbacks,

24
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:09,210
but the challenges remain
like everybody else's,

25
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,510
you know,

26
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,740
sort of resources,

27
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:11,520
uh,

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,560
trying to get resources
to folks who need them.

29
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,670
And talk a little bit about how the lack
of resources and when you've actually

30
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:20,130
lost some funding in the last few years,

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,000
how does that affect your lawyers and
how does that affect the way your office

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,110
handles cases?

33
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,071
Well,

34
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,200
from a very technical standpoint,

35
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:33,201
it increases caseload caseload begins
to rise as you begin to lose lawyers.

36
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,270
And as you begin to lose staff,

37
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,930
uh,

38
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,441
collateral,

39
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:37,831
staff,

40
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,000
investigators,

41
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:39,570
uh,

42
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,470
court support,

43
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:41,700
those kinds of folks,

44
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,380
it makes the workload and much harder
because you're asking everybody in the

45
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:47,970
office to do more.

46
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,320
And so you,

47
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,920
what you have is a lot
of very overburdened,

48
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,210
overworked staff and that can
take its toll on your staff.

49
00:01:57,211 --> 00:02:00,390
So your turnover rate
may begin to be affected.

50
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,640
Also your preparation for cases.

51
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,600
If you,

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,600
you begin to triage more and more as a
front line defender so that you try to

53
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:09,984
figure out,

54
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,490
uh,

55
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,490
unfortunately,

56
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:11,910
uh,

57
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,870
in many cases how to cut
corners to handle what,

58
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,080
what are the most serious
first and then move on down.

59
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,460
So what it really means is each client
doesn't get the individual lives

60
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:26,340
representation that we would hope.

61
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:26,931
No.

62
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:27,930
And that's exactly,

63
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,040
that's exactly right.

64
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,760
And in the case of our office
law at the beginning of 2012,

65
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:34,110
we had to cuddle.

66
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,450
A lot of staff had to,

67
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,580
we had huge layoffs about
a third of our staff,

68
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,950
but rather than just embrace
all these extra cases,

69
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:47,250
what we had to do is simply
stopped taking them because we,

70
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,203
we,

71
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,010
we had the money to represent the folks
that we could represent and use the

72
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:57,360
staff that we could responsibly
represent everyone else.

73
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,800
We began what was,

74
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,990
what was a waitlist for representation
and who handled those other cases when

75
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:05,920
your office can't handle a case?

76
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,100
Who represents the
defendants in those cases?

77
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:09,881
Well,

78
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:12,880
what we did is we reached
out to the private bar,

79
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:13,840
the local bar,

80
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,400
and we created a pro bono consortium and
we reached out to some of the corporate

81
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:23,401
law firms in New Orleans who were very
active already with our office and they

82
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:26,410
were able to take some cases,

83
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,010
uh,

84
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:27,640
from the,

85
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,660
from the wait list.

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,280
The,

87
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,150
the judges started appointing,

88
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:31,570
uh,

89
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,800
lawyers as well.

90
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,930
And they were doing cases pro bono,

91
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:35,501
uh,

92
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:36,940
as well on those cases.

93
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,210
But there was still a few
because of the volume of cases,

94
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,460
there were a few folks who just sat
unrepresented for probably about three

95
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:48,100
months without any lawyer at all,

96
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,450
without any lawyer at all.

97
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,870
Let me ask you to describe a
little bit in Louisiana generally,

98
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:53,920
uh,

99
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,660
capital representation.

100
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:58,270
Somebody is facing the
death penalty in Louisiana,

101
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,880
sends to a number of people to death
and it's carried out a number of

102
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:01,750
executions.

103
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,243
How,

104
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,840
what's the system if there is one in
Louisiana for providing representation to

105
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:09,460
people facing the death penalty?

106
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,241
Well,

107
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:12,490
the system in Louisiana is,

108
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,300
uh,

109
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,410
is a bit of a,

110
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:15,280
of a quilt.

111
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,430
So you have 42 judicial districts,

112
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,420
each with their own chief
and chief public defender,

113
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,290
public defenders.

114
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,980
At the first level it's the district.

115
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,740
And so some districts contract with folks,

116
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,560
some districts handle it in house.

117
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,520
And also within those different districts,

118
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:41,521
you have nonprofits who handle capital
cases at the trial level as well.

119
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,450
And so what happens is if your charged
with a capital crime in Louisiana,

120
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,310
you can have the district,

121
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,380
you could have a district contractor or
you could have a nonprofit representing

122
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:53,620
you.

123
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,350
Just depending on sort
of where you line up in,

124
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,240
in the order of cases as they come in.

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,620
And just speaking generally,

126
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:04,240
does a quality of representation
differ between those different ways of

127
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,770
providing representation?

128
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:06,311
No,

129
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:07,690
that's an incredibly uneven.

130
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,703
We,

131
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,000
we have our state,

132
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,160
our Louisiana public defender board,

133
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,740
which was sort of reformed and revamped,

134
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,170
uh,

135
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:20,170
in 2007 now controls the
sort of certification of
capital lawyers and is trying

136
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:25,300
to have a more robust program
in how they certify lawyers.

137
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,750
And so some of the lawyers who
used to handle capital cases,

138
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:29,471
for example,

139
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,310
very few,

140
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,190
but some were decertified for example,

141
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,160
because they just weren't
living up to standard.

142
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,750
And you still had others that in the
districts who didn't have resources.

143
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:44,410
So capital cases have to be
staffed up with two attorneys,

144
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,600
mitigation specialist and investigator.

145
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,070
Some of the districts can't afford that
or are gambling that the case won't stay

146
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:51,880
capitol.

147
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,691
So what you'll get,

148
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:56,570
maybe it's just one lawyer on the capital
case hoping that it gets indicted to

149
00:05:56,571 --> 00:06:00,620
as something lesser or that they can
work with the da to make it something

150
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:01,454
lesser.

151
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,360
But of course,

152
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,490
invariably those cases come back capital
and all of a sudden you're behind in

153
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,540
your representation.

154
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,310
And so,

155
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:09,680
uh,

156
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,480
not only do you have a
quality differential because
some lawyers simply aren't

157
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:15,160
ready,

158
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,500
right.

159
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,230
But you also have a resource differential
cause you just don't have the

160
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,680
resources to staff them up.

161
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,480
In some parishes,

162
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:28,340
actually a case can just sit for
even years waiting to be funded.

163
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:29,000
Is that true?

164
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,260
That is absolutely true.

165
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,070
Um,

166
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,330
one of our most,

167
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:32,720
uh,

168
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,720
most unique cases in Louisiana was
citizens citizen versus Louisiana or

169
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,030
Louisiana versus citizen.

170
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,820
And what his son was an individual that
was his name was the citizens as race is

171
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,760
a man named citizen,

172
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,830
a man named citizen.

173
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,010
Um,

174
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,040
and what happened in that case
is that they just didn't have,

175
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,150
they ran out of money for the
representation and filed for,

176
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:56,930
uh,

177
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,590
for systems with resources got
denied everywhere they went.

178
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:06,190
And the court stopped the case and
went up to our Louisiana Supreme Court.

179
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,820
And the Louisiana Supreme Court said,

180
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:11,240
you either find money or you
have to hope prosecution.

181
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,750
You can't prosecute a without a defense.

182
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,040
And by the way,

183
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:20,420
your speedy trial clock is ticking
like this doesn't stop any of that.

184
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,990
And what they found was the parish,

185
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,350
this was in Calca shoot,

186
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:28,160
Paris is southwest Louisiana,

187
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,930
Lake Charles Lake Charles,

188
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,720
all around the municipality.

189
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,010
There were fun balances.

190
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:35,210
There were reserves,

191
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:35,660
right?

192
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,790
No one wanted to give to public defense.

193
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,000
You had a multimillion dollar reserve,

194
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,510
uh,

195
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,580
with what's called the police jury,

196
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,220
which is law enforcement
funding mechanisms.

197
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:48,470
There you had a fun balance,

198
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:50,780
a reserve with the
district attorney's office,

199
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,370
a reserve with the sheriff or reserve
with the courts and none of them.

200
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,950
And these are multimillion
dollar reserves.

201
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:02,951
None of them wanted to
provide any additional funds
so that the sixth amendment

202
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:05,210
could be realized in this capital case.

203
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,380
It was really remarkable.

204
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,820
So that fun was funding.

205
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,970
The law enforcement is funding the courts
and is funding the district attorney's

206
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:11,540
office,

207
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,430
but absolutely no money for the
public defender now and still doesn't.

208
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,940
It still does and still doesn't.

209
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,110
And that's why what you have right
now in Lake Charles for example,

210
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,890
their public defender's office is right
in the middle of a service restriction.

211
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,890
They had to withdraw from about 400 cases.

212
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,430
Wow.

213
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,310
Because they simply couldn't
afford to handle it.

214
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,393
Wow.

215
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,611
Well,

216
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:32,450
I know at one time,

217
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:33,710
Jason Manual Reeves,

218
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:35,750
a case that came out of Calcasieu parish,

219
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,520
they had had the,

220
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,420
one of those nonprofit organizations
represented him at his first trial.

221
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,950
But then at the second trial,

222
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:46,940
the judge took them off and put the
local public defender and I think he was

223
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:48,650
carrying like 500 cases.

224
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,521
Oh yeah.

225
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:50,331
At that time,

226
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:51,500
that public defender's office,

227
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:52,670
they've gone through some changes,

228
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:53,600
but at that time,

229
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,810
and still now the case wildly
exceed a national standards by,

230
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,690
by almost any measure.

231
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,930
You've got lawyers who carry
about 800 misdemeanors,

232
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:04,764
for example,

233
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,700
which is about twice the national
standard and about 400 felonies,

234
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,151
again,

235
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:10,650
about twice the national standard.

236
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,010
So you're taking those lawyers that
are already handling twice a national

237
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:14,610
standard,

238
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,030
and then you give them a
capital case on top of that.

239
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,350
That's exactly,

240
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,910
that's exactly what happens.

241
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,260
And one of the cases that was recently
argued in the u s supreme court was a

242
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:26,400
case called Boyer,

243
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,300
uh,

244
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,800
Louisiana versus Boyer.

245
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,240
And what happened in Boyers case is
there was simply no money to fund his

246
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:34,320
representation.

247
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,450
And so it took him,

248
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:36,961
I think,

249
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:40,140
five years to get to trial on this case,

250
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,560
right.

251
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,860
Not because it was a particularly
complex and long case,

252
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:47,430
but they simply were slow going
because they didn't have the money.

253
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,000
Right.

254
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,070
And there is,

255
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,800
there's a question now of
on the speedy trial issue,

256
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:53,670
whose fault is it?

257
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,180
Right?

258
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,013
Should this,

259
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:55,980
should this be,

260
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,020
this conviction be
reversed and kicked out?

261
00:09:58,021 --> 00:10:00,180
And so we're awaiting word
from the Supreme Court,

262
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:00,930
uh,

263
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,590
on that case in the state took the
position in that case that they were not

264
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:05,990
responsible for the delight.

265
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,863
That's correct.

266
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,870
Even though obviously the
state of Louisiana has the
money to pay for a defense

267
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,081
if they want it.

268
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:14,180
When you seek the death pony,

269
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,761
Louisiana,

270
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:16,110
it's sort of the name of the state,

271
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,801
Louisiana,

272
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:17,380
isn't it?

273
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:17,850
Yeah,

274
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,080
that's absolutely correct.

275
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,340
And their position was,

276
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:21,174
so what,

277
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,613
my goodness,

278
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,371
what,

279
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:23,820
what,

280
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,360
uh,

281
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,070
what are you doing in New Orleans?

282
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,430
Uh,

283
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,400
with regard to representing
people in capital cases?

284
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:29,971
Well,

285
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:32,040
we just started a capital division.

286
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:32,311
Uh,

287
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:36,000
what we've been able to do over the
past four years is really grow a lot of

288
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,950
strong talent in our office and
wanted to figure out how to provide

289
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,770
representation basically
all the way through,

290
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:44,521
uh,

291
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:44,820
in,

292
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,500
in every sort of case that could enter
the parish while at the same time

293
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,610
continuing,

294
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,240
uh,

295
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,050
a sort of tradition of excellence because
we were having the same problem as the

296
00:10:55,051 --> 00:11:00,051
rest of the state was with Tom Tractors
who were sort of problematic and how

297
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:00,720
they were,

298
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,830
they were staffing up.

299
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,450
And these are people who would contract
to handle cases for like a flat fee?

300
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,051
Well,

301
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:07,884
we,

302
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,251
we,

303
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,350
it's a fee for service for capital,

304
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,483
but there's,

305
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,470
there's very few capitol certified
lawyers around the state.

306
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,850
And we wanted to sort of create a
pipeline to certify lawyers inside,

307
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:21,560
uh,

308
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,440
our staff.

309
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:22,861
And,

310
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:26,160
and it was a way for folks to sort of
move through the leadership ranks in the

311
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:28,790
office along with building
different capacities.

312
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,300
So we started a capital,

313
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,650
a defender,

314
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,230
a division in our office this year.

315
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,970
How many lawyers do you have in hand?

316
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,021
Right now,

317
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:37,860
we just have,

318
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,390
we just have two lawyers.

319
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,780
And so we still contract with a sort
of trusted folks for any cases that go

320
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:47,730
beyond standard right now.

321
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,331
Uh,

322
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:49,290
but we,

323
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:49,470
you,

324
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:49,861
my,

325
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:50,340
uh,

326
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,390
deputy chief,

327
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,960
uh,

328
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,960
leads the division and as an
excellent lawyer and has one,

329
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,220
one praise from many different corners of,

330
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:00,851
uh,

331
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:01,720
of lawyering.

332
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,800
So we're very,

333
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,280
very proud of how the
program is progressing.

334
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:07,270
They also have a nice,

335
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:07,530
uh,

336
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:12,530
a great young lawyer who had experience
with in Bryan Stevenson's shop at Eji in

337
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:17,930
Alabama and is always sort of
wanted to be a capital defender.

338
00:12:17,931 --> 00:12:19,060
So we're,

339
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:20,650
we're excited about what's to come.

340
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,580
That's going to be a big challenge
with your resources though,

341
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:23,881
right?

342
00:12:23,881 --> 00:12:27,600
Cause that one capital cases is going
to take a whole lot more resources than

343
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,471
many,

344
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:28,741
many,

345
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:32,280
many misdemeanor cases
or less serious felony.

346
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,750
Okay.

347
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,000
No,

348
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,480
and that's,

349
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,950
that's exactly what we're seeing.

350
00:12:34,951 --> 00:12:39,720
And so we're going to be really talking
with local stakeholders and the state to

351
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:44,721
s to talk about how since we do have this
division now that we're going to need

352
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:46,200
the resources to staff it.

353
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:48,540
And we in Orleans parish,

354
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,220
our district attorney doesn't have the
sort of appetite for capital cases that

355
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:54,120
others do.

356
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,830
So we're hoping that will be,

357
00:12:55,831 --> 00:12:56,664
that's a change.

358
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:57,900
It's a real change.

359
00:12:57,901 --> 00:13:00,690
He started sort of guns blazing,

360
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,300
but found out that it,

361
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,800
it is incredibly sort of wasteful,

362
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,640
uh,

363
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,690
and uh,

364
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,010
and costly,

365
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:08,790
uh,

366
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,770
for these cases in Orleans parish,

367
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:11,221
the case,

368
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:11,910
he,

369
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,910
he actually began his
career with a capital case,

370
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,180
uh,

371
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,820
as Da,

372
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,410
whereas with a capital case
actually won a capitol conviction,

373
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,520
but because of an
enormous Brady violation,

374
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:24,311
well,

375
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:26,430
it is figured to disclose
exculpatory evidence.

376
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,000
Right?

377
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,490
Right.

378
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,710
Because of a huge,

379
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,180
a Brady violation,

380
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:33,020
that case was reversed and um,

381
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,840
then then ultimately resolved
with a manslaughter conviction.

382
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,190
So it was one of those.

383
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,440
So I think after that experience,

384
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:40,771
he's like,

385
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:41,101
all right,

386
00:13:41,101 --> 00:13:42,870
that was a whole lot of money for nothing.

387
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,050
And we don't see a lot of
capital indictments anymore.

388
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,660
And of course when Harry
Connick was a district attorney,

389
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,380
you had lots of capital cases and lots
of violations of failure to turn over

390
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,950
exculpatory evidence,

391
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,240
lots of violations,

392
00:13:57,241 --> 00:14:02,241
very almost no capital convictions and
no death sentences for out of Orleans for

393
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:06,810
more than a decade.

394
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:08,280
But he still kept them coming.

395
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:14,030
And what we're also finding
out now through subsequent
litigation is that wasn't

396
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:16,140
playing by the rules,

397
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,243
right?

398
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,650
So how much of a drain it is on your
system is going to depend very much on

399
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:23,360
those two decisions the prosecutor makes,

400
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:27,410
whether to seek the death Polly and then
whether to resolve the case with some

401
00:14:27,411 --> 00:14:28,240
sort of plea offer.

402
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,290
That's exactly right.

403
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,490
That's exactly right.

404
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:31,600
And that's what we see,

405
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,720
um,

406
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,180
in our,

407
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,810
in our parish right now.

408
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:35,740
Uh,

409
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,640
the big,

410
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,480
the big bottleneck is when are
you going to make a real decision,

411
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:41,314
Mr Da.

412
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,600
So from arrest,

413
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,880
the police will arrest F at for first
degree and then he has 120 days to decide

414
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:50,200
if he wants to,

415
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,520
whether going to go capital or not,

416
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,610
but we have to staff
it in that time period.

417
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:55,820
Right?

418
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,031
Like,

419
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:58,040
it's a capital k capital and that's,

420
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,200
that's how we move forward in our office.

421
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:02,900
So the faster that decision comes,

422
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:03,561
uh,

423
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:08,120
the less strain on our resources we have
because it's an enormous responsibility

424
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:12,020
to investigate the life and
background of the client mitigation,

425
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:15,080
all those things that you would not
do if the case was not capitalism.

426
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,561
No.

427
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:16,520
And that's exactly right.

428
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:19,280
And I think that's what
a lot of folks miss.

429
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,550
Uh,

430
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,950
particularly a lot of Das and Louisiana,

431
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:22,590
uh,

432
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,423
district attorneys,

433
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,530
district attorneys,

434
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,690
because we recently had,

435
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:29,810
we were recently had staff in Boston,

436
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:30,351
uh,

437
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:31,540
researching the life of,

438
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:36,110
of a client who's charged capital and
they don't understand why you running back

439
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:36,944
to Boston.

440
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:37,450
Right?

441
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:37,881
And it's like,

442
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:38,630
because his,

443
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,620
his life led him through there
and we have to figure out,

444
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,280
um,

445
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,110
we have to investigate everything,

446
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,920
right?

447
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,600
Because we're trying to save a mans life.

448
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,670
And so they,

449
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,860
the system in Louisiana,

450
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:52,910
it doesn't really get it.

451
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,310
The prosecutorial side
doesn't really get it,

452
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,370
but those were enormous
strains on resources.

453
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,020
What Derwyn Bunton we're so glad to
have you and we wish you the best and

454
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:04,610
getting the resources you need.

455
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,250
I know you've been getting a recruiting,

456
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:09,140
some great lawyers for your office.

457
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:09,860
Uh,

458
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,910
but I know the case loads the workloads
and everything depends upon having the

459
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,841
resources.

460
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:15,520
And,

461
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,100
uh,

462
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,890
you've been the public defender
chief defender there for four years,

463
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:19,791
and,

464
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,020
uh,

465
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,261
we,

466
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:23,900
we thank you for making the time to be
with us today and wish you the best.

467
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,200
No,

468
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,351
well,

469
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,220
thank you for having me.

470
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:25,700
Sure.
