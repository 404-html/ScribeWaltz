1
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,350
As we saw the supreme court in 1972 says
the death penalty is unconstitutional

2
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,770
and Furman versus Georgia.

3
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,290
But the court's decision is a mess.

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,750
We have five justices in the majority,

5
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:27,570
all finding it unconstitutional
for different reasons.

6
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:32,400
Some of them saying it's unconstitutional
because the way it has been used up

7
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:36,960
until the time and four in the dissent
saying it's up to the legislature's

8
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:37,823
basically.

9
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,940
And so what happens after
Fermin is decided in 1973,

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,950
Georgia passes a new death penalty
statute signed into law by then governor

11
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:51,951
Jimmy Carter in March of
1973 and by May of 1973,

12
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:54,390
Georgia's carrying out
death penalty trials.

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,343
Once again,

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:55,860
uh,

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,040
the same thing right
promptly after Fermin,

16
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:01,050
Texas passes a new a
death penalty statute.

17
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:04,950
And so do 35 states and just
a very short period of time,

18
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:05,784
four years,

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,100
a number of states have responded to the
firm and decision by passing new death

20
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:12,211
penalty statutes,

21
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:16,290
which they think are designed to deal
with the main problem that the court

22
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,380
identified in Ferman arbitrariness.

23
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,780
So two ways to do this.

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,853
One,

25
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,140
tell the jury how to make its decision
that is guide the discretion of the jury.

26
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,910
Or secondly,

27
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:33,600
what Justice Burger warrant about
in his dissenting opinion in Fermin,

28
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
which is make the duck putting mandatory,

29
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,420
take any discretion out of the process,

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,051
uh,

31
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:41,820
and say you commit a certain crime,

32
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:42,530
you commit a please,

33
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,130
you kill a police officer and the
punishment is going to be the death.

34
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:47,840
Polly.

35
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,240
Uh,

36
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,560
so North Carolina,

37
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:53,040
Louisiana passed the
mandatory statutes there.

38
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,610
Case come their cases come
before the court in 1976.

39
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,361
Uh,

40
00:01:57,361 --> 00:01:58,110
and,

41
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,441
uh,

42
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:01,080
the court grants review of the Georgia,

43
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:01,531
Florida,

44
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:02,850
and Texas statutes.

45
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,860
And so let's look at what each state did
in response to Fermin and then how the

46
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,260
court in deciding these five cases,

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,720
Greg versus Georgia out of Georgia profit,

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,710
uh,

49
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,660
versus Florida out of Florida and,

50
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:16,201
and so forth,

51
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:17,310
jerk versus Texas,

52
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,330
uh,

53
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,260
Woodson versus in North Carolina
a and Roberts versus Louisiana.

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,680
Uh,

55
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,730
how the court makes the determination
of what's constitutional and what's not.

56
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,920
Let's first look at what Georgia did.

57
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,720
What every state did was
provide for a bifurcated trial.

58
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,051
This,

59
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:35,280
we had seen in mcgautha,

60
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,940
uh,

61
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,800
with California having one trial on
guilt or innocence and another trial on

62
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:41,634
penalty.

63
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,030
The idea being you're
not compromised in the,

64
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,350
in a unitary trial,

65
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:46,711
uh,

66
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:47,610
by having to decide,

67
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:51,540
am I going to defend the case on guilt
or innocence or am I going to put

68
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:55,560
evidence before the jury that's of
sports a sentence less than death.

69
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,390
Now there are two different inquiries.

70
00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:59,560
First determine if the person guilty,

71
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,260
then go to a second sentencing phase,

72
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:04,180
which will be focused just on sentencing.

73
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:04,850
Uh,

74
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,880
and then aggravating circumstances.

75
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,480
Uh,

76
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,130
Georgia adopts 10,

77
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,630
and it's Duff Poly Statute,

78
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,351
uh,

79
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:12,100
one,

80
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,431
uh,

81
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:16,390
whether the murder is committed
in the course of another felony.

82
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,910
This is basically felony murder,

83
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,511
uh,

84
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:23,140
that the court is saying a is
eligible for the death polling.

85
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:23,951
Uh,

86
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:26,740
and as you see rape,

87
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,371
armed robbery,

88
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:28,030
kidnapping,

89
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,900
aggravated battery,

90
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:29,500
burglary,

91
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,333
arson.

92
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,263
The question is,

93
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,590
are we finding a way to narrow
the application of the death?

94
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:36,424
Polly,

95
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,140
and one of the controversial questions
on this is with regard to these felony

96
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:42,100
murder statutes,

97
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:47,101
because almost all murders occur
in the course of another crime.

98
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,190
Uh,

99
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,020
the classic being of course,

100
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,210
the holdup of a convenient store,

101
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:52,780
uh,

102
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,480
in which someone is shot and killed a,

103
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:58,270
those are the cases are all
eligible for the death polling.

104
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,630
Most of them will not be
prosecuted as death pony cases,

105
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:02,740
but they can be.

106
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,970
So the question becomes,

107
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:08,971
does this eliminate the arbitrary is
that we saw in Ferman or is this enough

108
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:11,650
guidance for the jury,

109
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,170
uh,

110
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,820
that we don't have that arbitrators?

111
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,590
Uh,

112
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,520
another factor,

113
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,630
the prior record,

114
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,321
uh,

115
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:18,154
of the,

116
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,850
uh,

117
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,451
defendant,

118
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:22,090
does this person have a prior
conviction for capital felony?

119
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:22,421
If so,

120
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:24,760
that is a reason to give the person a,

121
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,623
the death pony,

122
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,170
uh,

123
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:31,170
whether the a person's
actions and committing the
crime created a great risk of

124
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:33,940
death to more than one person,

125
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,283
uh,

126
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:35,861
another,

127
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:39,460
whether it was for money or any other
thing of monetary value we've covered

128
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:39,790
here,

129
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,870
but an awful lot of the kinds
of crimes that take place,

130
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:44,290
uh,

131
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,970
when life is lost.

132
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:46,930
Uh,

133
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,760
but all of these are at least,

134
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,450
uh,

135
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,800
you have objective factors to consider.

136
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,820
Is there a robbery?

137
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:55,391
Uh,

138
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:58,570
is there a prior capital felony?

139
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,260
Uh,

140
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,730
was there a great risk of death,

141
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,990
but then the court,

142
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,440
then the state legislature
adopts the catchall aggravating,

143
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,790
which really is more descriptive
than it is anything else.

144
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,210
Was the murderer outrageously
and wantonly vile,

145
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:14,650
horrible and inhuman.

146
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,250
I suppose every murder
is outrageously wantonly,

147
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:18,851
vile,

148
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:19,320
horrible,

149
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:19,960
inhuman.

150
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,590
But the legislature tacks onto that
and that didn't involve torture.

151
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,970
We know what torture is.

152
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:25,781
That's a crime.

153
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:27,130
And juries can figure that out.

154
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:27,761
Uh,

155
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:32,070
depravity of mind on the part
of the defendant in creating a,

156
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:33,640
in committing the crime,

157
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,510
uh,

158
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,340
which is,

159
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:35,660
uh,

160
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,580
hard to fathom or notice any one of these,

161
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,010
an aggravated battery to the victim.

162
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:45,040
We'll see some other
states adopt a catchall,

163
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,660
a aggravating factors,

164
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:49,140
which are much more vague
than the Georgia one.

165
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:49,691
Uh,

166
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:50,201
but here,

167
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:54,820
if a prosecutor finds that the death pony
doesn't fit under any of these others,

168
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,320
then it can be,

169
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:56,900
uh,

170
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,840
perhaps fit under the
outrageously Wanli vile,

171
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:00,291
horrible,

172
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,540
and inhuman aggravating circumstance.

173
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,501
Uh,

174
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:04,250
and then,

175
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:04,610
uh,

176
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,360
the state,

177
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,750
uh,

178
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,291
provides.

179
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,560
There must be at least one
aggravating factor established,

180
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,240
no aggravating factor established.

181
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,340
That's the end of the process.

182
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:13,941
Uh,

183
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:17,920
the jury returns a verdict of,

184
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:19,130
of life imprisonment.

185
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,800
The jury can consider anything
as a mitigating circumstance.

186
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,750
We'll see a Florida statute,

187
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:30,050
which gives the jury a list of
mitigating circumstances but not Georgia.

188
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:30,884
Georgia says,

189
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,500
once an aggravating factors
has been established,

190
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,710
the jury can consider
anything else in aggravation.

191
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,970
So that's wide open.

192
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,090
And then the jury can consider
any mitigating factor.

193
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:43,430
And we'll talk more
about mitigating factors,

194
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:48,431
but basically mercy evoking reasons for
imposing a sentence less than death.

195
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,251
Uh,

196
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:53,690
anything about the life and background
of the person may be mitigating

197
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:55,370
circumstances of the crime.

198
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:55,810
Uh,

199
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,090
why it was committed or some
aspect of the way it was committed.

200
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,540
Uh,

201
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,980
perhaps the defendant had a lesser
role of being one of several people who

202
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:04,850
committed a crime.

203
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,560
Or maybe it's something about,

204
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,370
uh,

205
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,110
the defendant himself,

206
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:09,771
uh,

207
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:12,320
that that is the mitigating
factor or factors.

208
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,220
Um,

209
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,240
but once an aggravating
factor is found in Georgia,

210
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:19,220
the jury has complete discretion,

211
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,530
finds one aggravating factor,

212
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,630
and then it can give death or life.

213
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,700
It can give life in prison even
if it finds no mitigating factors.

214
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,480
Uh,

215
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,800
but once it has that information
before it a complete discretion,

216
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,420
jury must be unanimous.

217
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,980
This is not going to be
the law in every state,

218
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:37,814
but in Georgia,

219
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,040
the jury must be unanimous.

220
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:40,551
Uh,

221
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:43,880
if it can't reach a verdict
than it's a life sentence,

222
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,511
uh,

223
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:45,344
imposed.

224
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:45,920
Uh,

225
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,260
but the jury's recommendation is binding,

226
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:48,840
uh,

227
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,730
on the judge.

228
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,130
Uh,

229
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:50,691
in other words,

230
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:52,130
the jury sentences,

231
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,031
this is not,

232
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:55,070
we're going to look at some
judge sentencing statutes,

233
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,700
uh,

234
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,120
but this statute provides
for jury sentencing.

235
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,360
So in order for the prosecution
to get the death penalty,

236
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:02,840
uh,

237
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,950
it has to convince all 12 members of
the jury that there's at least one

238
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:08,900
statutory aggravating circumstance,

239
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,440
uh,

240
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,850
and that the death penalty is appropriate
for the crime considering both the

241
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:18,290
facts of the crime and the background and
circumstances of the person facing the

242
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:18,530
death.

243
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,363
Pollock,

244
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,940
Georgia also provides a
for an automatic appeal,

245
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:23,351
uh,

246
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:24,800
to the Georgia Supreme Court,

247
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,330
uh,

248
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,600
where that court is to decide whether
the death penalty is imposed under the

249
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:31,010
influence of passion,

250
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,581
prejudice,

251
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:33,530
or any other arbitrary factor,

252
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,040
uh,

253
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,340
whether the evidence supports
the aggravating circumstance,

254
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:37,821
uh,

255
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:40,760
and whether the sentence is
excessive or disproportionate.

256
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,000
The idea being that the Georgia Supreme
Court will look at all the death

257
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:49,001
sentences imposed in the state of Georgia
and make a determination of whether a,

258
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,160
there's some that really compared
to other cases should not be a death

259
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:55,440
sentences.

260
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,561
Now,

261
00:08:55,561 --> 00:09:00,561
the court only looks at this in 1976
as to whether the statute satisfies the

262
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:03,060
constitution.

263
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:03,840
Uh,

264
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,740
in practice,

265
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,780
none of these things really happen.

266
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,380
Uh,

267
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,240
the Georgia Supreme Court just pastes a
boilerplate paragraph in his decisions

268
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,540
saying that it finds the duff plenty
was not imposed under the influence of

269
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:15,961
passion,

270
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:16,441
prejudice,

271
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:20,820
or an arbitrary factor that evidence
supports the aggravating circumstance and

272
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:25,470
then a tax on some other decisions in
an appendix a where it says the death

273
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:27,060
penalty was imposed in these cases.

274
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,800
So it's not disproportionate,

275
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:29,310
uh,

276
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:29,941
in this case.

277
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:30,670
So,

278
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:30,991
uh,

279
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:33,300
this has been a rather hollow promise,

280
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:37,770
but the Supreme Court is going to say
proportionality review is not required.

281
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,220
Uh,

282
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,053
anyway.

283
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,013
Um,

284
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,093
so,

285
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,023
uh,

286
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,270
Florida provides for a bifurcated
trial just like Georgia.

287
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:48,841
Uh,

288
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:49,231
again,

289
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:50,850
a list of aggravating circumstances.

290
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:54,960
It's not a whole lot different
than what we saw prior conviction.

291
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,640
This we saw in Georgia have a felony,

292
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,161
uh,

293
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:58,470
or in prison and parole,

294
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,090
same one we saw in Georgia.

295
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:01,410
Great risk of death.

296
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,070
Uh,

297
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,060
too many people,

298
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,000
uh,

299
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,060
in the Commission of another felony.

300
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:06,961
Here again,

301
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:08,250
felony murder cases,

302
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:08,750
uh,

303
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,980
are all going to be eligible
for the death penalty.

304
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:14,070
So if it's a murder in the commission
of a robbery and kidnapping,

305
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,000
a sexual battery,

306
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:15,660
uh,

307
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,493
arson,

308
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:16,740
uh,

309
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,120
those cases are going to be
eligible for the death penalty.

310
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,320
Uh,

311
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,550
and then here's the Catchall,

312
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,300
uh,

313
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,210
was the murder especially heinous,

314
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,560
atrocious or cruel?

315
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,990
Virtually every murder is heinous,

316
00:10:30,991 --> 00:10:32,040
atrocious and cruel.

317
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,990
So the question's going to come up.

318
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,140
Does this really give the
jury any principle basis
for deciding whether or not

319
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:40,920
to impose the death penalty?

320
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:41,971
Uh,

321
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:42,804
the court,

322
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,970
the statute also provided a,

323
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:47,460
that if the murder is committed in a cold,

324
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:49,560
calculated and premeditated manner,

325
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,371
again,

326
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:55,371
these are more descriptive as opposed to
a definitions of what might make a case

327
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,470
aggravated enough,

328
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:58,860
uh,

329
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,630
for the death penalty to be imposed.

330
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,030
But those questions are
going to come later.

331
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:04,320
The Supreme Court for now,

332
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:07,560
and of course I have not given you
with regard either Georgia or Florida,

333
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,930
all of the aggravating circumstances,

334
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:13,560
but if given me the ones that
tend to be used the most often,

335
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:14,401
uh,

336
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:14,671
and,

337
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:14,941
and,

338
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,260
and apply to the most cases,

339
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:17,910
and of course more than anything else,

340
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,500
is going to be the felony murder,

341
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,490
a murder in the commission of
a robbery or some other crime.

342
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,181
Now far,

343
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:27,510
it also provides for
mitigating circumstances,

344
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,740
but unlike Georgia,

345
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,880
which just says the jury can consider
anything else once it finds an aggravating

346
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:34,710
factor to consider anything else,

347
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,280
uh,

348
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,870
in mitigation of Florida actually
provides a list for the jury,

349
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,441
uh,

350
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:41,760
of the mitigating factors.

351
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:44,910
No significant history of
prior criminal activity,

352
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,540
uh,

353
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,300
extreme emotional distress,

354
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:48,970
uh,

355
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,760
that the person committed the crime.

356
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,540
Uh,

357
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,300
you can imagine a
domestic disturbance and,

358
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,170
uh,

359
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,170
the wife has been beaten by her husband
and she goes out and shoots him and

360
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,900
could argue that there's extreme mental
or emotional disturbance cause where

361
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:07,900
that cases Algebra for the death penalty,

362
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:10,000
or not a threshold question,

363
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:12,070
but a prosecutor could say it was heinous,

364
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:13,420
atrocious and cruel.

365
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,171
Uh,

366
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:19,171
the victim was a participant almost
never is the victim of participant or a

367
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:21,910
consented to a murder.

368
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,420
Uh,

369
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,420
so this one doesn't really apply a very
much a relatively minor participation.

370
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:28,661
Uh,

371
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:30,280
as I talked about a moment ago,

372
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,210
one of the mitigating factors
that may arise in a case,

373
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:37,480
particularly when several
people commit a crime together,

374
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,141
uh,

375
00:12:38,141 --> 00:12:39,850
is whether the,

376
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,043
uh,

377
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,063
uh,

378
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,490
any one of those people was sort of the,

379
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:45,971
you know,

380
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:49,960
the lookout person or was
less involved in the crime,

381
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:50,500
uh,

382
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,460
than some of the others.

383
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:51,730
Uh,

384
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,730
extreme duress duress is
not a defense to murder,

385
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,680
but extreme duress.

386
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:57,161
Somebody who,

387
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:57,631
for example,

388
00:12:57,631 --> 00:13:02,050
is in a gang and put under a lot of
pressure to commit a crime as part of an

389
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:06,850
initiation or a for whatever reason
that could be a mitigating factor.

390
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:07,001
Now,

391
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:10,150
none of these mitigating factors
cancel out the death pony.

392
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:15,280
They're just factors that the jury must
consider in deciding whether or not to

393
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:16,250
impose the death pony.

394
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,390
Uh,

395
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,460
and finally,

396
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,001
uh,

397
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:21,580
the capacity of the
defendant to appreciate,

398
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,450
uh,

399
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,290
or conform,

400
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:23,950
uh,

401
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,760
his behavior to the
requirements of the law.

402
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,983
Uh,

403
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,060
if a defendant has no ability to conform
his behavior to the requirements of the

404
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:34,241
law,

405
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:35,590
that's an insanity defense.

406
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:36,191
Uh,

407
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:40,660
what the legislature in
Florida is provided for here
is to say a person may not

408
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:45,661
be so lacking in capacity to
meet the insanity defense,

409
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,270
but their capacity was impaired,

410
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:50,890
their mental thinking,

411
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,401
uh,

412
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:52,680
their mental abilities were,

413
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,650
were impaired.

414
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,770
And so that's something that
we will take into account,

415
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,340
uh,

416
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,173
sort of like,

417
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:58,720
uh,

418
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,010
emotional disturbance,

419
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:00,510
uh,

420
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,960
that that may be a reason,

421
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,510
uh,

422
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,030
that the jury can consider.

423
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:04,780
Again,

424
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,190
these just go into the mix,

425
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,730
the aggravating and mitigating
circumstances as to whether or not,

426
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,330
uh,

427
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,950
death is going to be imposed.

428
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:12,761
Uh,

429
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:13,600
in Florida,

430
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:13,780
uh,

431
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,860
jury ways,

432
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:15,371
uh,

433
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:17,650
the aggravating and mitigating factors,

434
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:18,700
the question it asks is,

435
00:14:18,701 --> 00:14:21,820
are there sufficient
mitigating circumstances,

436
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:22,391
uh,

437
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:23,860
which outweigh the aggravating.

438
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,300
So unlike Georgia,

439
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,300
which has complete wide open discretion,

440
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,320
once the jury finds an aggravating
circumstance in Florida,

441
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,850
the jury ways,

442
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,230
if it's possible,

443
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:37,690
is the question that's
worthy of discussion.

444
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,940
But we won't take time for that right now.

445
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,391
Uh,

446
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:41,224
but,

447
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,651
uh,

448
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:46,651
the jury theoretically ways the mitigation
against the aggravation and comes out

449
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,100
with a sentence.

450
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:48,821
Uh,

451
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,680
and then here's another difference.

452
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:55,830
The recommends punishment by a majority
vote no requirement of unanimity as in

453
00:14:57,861 --> 00:14:58,311
Georgia,

454
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:00,050
which says you have to have all 12 jurors,

455
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:01,460
a great in Florida.

456
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,840
It can be seven to five.

457
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:03,610
Uh,

458
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:03,940
of course,

459
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,660
what one consequence of that,

460
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:06,740
uh,

461
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,440
is the kind of deliberations you have.

462
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,570
If you have a requirement of unanimity,

463
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,120
it means everybody has equal power.

464
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,800
You sit down in that jury room,

465
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,870
everybody's got to listen to everybody
else as in the play and movie.

466
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,250
12 angry men,

467
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:22,830
uh,

468
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,210
until if thrashed it out
and decided what to do.

469
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:26,960
And so that Ha,

470
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,370
there has to be that interaction.

471
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,230
Florida basically the jury,

472
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:31,490
although they're totally deliberate,

473
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,330
can go in and take a vote and if it's
seven to five for life or seven to five

474
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:37,270
for death or whatever it may be a,

475
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,020
they can make their recommendation.

476
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,250
But notice this,

477
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,110
the judge can override
the decision of the jury.

478
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,640
So the jury may come back with life in
prison and the judge may give the death

479
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:51,980
pony or vice versa.

480
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:53,510
The jury may come back with death.

481
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,010
Uh,

482
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,420
and the judge may impose,

483
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,573
uh,

484
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,100
uh,

485
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,933
life imprisonment.

486
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,680
In fact,

487
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,680
almost all the overrides in Florida and
in other states have been life sentences

488
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:09,080
by juries which are
overwritten to DeCinces.

489
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,780
Florida ultimately adopted a standard,

490
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,321
uh,

491
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:13,760
which made it very difficult,

492
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,421
uh,

493
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:16,070
for judges to overwrite jury.

494
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:16,904
So in Florida,

495
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:22,070
although there were a lot of overrides
and that time after 1976 when this case

496
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:22,910
was decided,

497
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:23,540
uh,

498
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,470
since that time,

499
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:27,280
there have been fewer
and fewer overrides and,

500
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:28,670
and virtually none today,

501
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,120
uh,

502
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,953
in Florida.

503
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,591
On the other hand,

504
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:35,591
Alabama also has a judge override a
really the main state using judge override

505
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,550
today and in Alabama,

506
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:42,551
20% of the people on death row are
people who receive life sentences from

507
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:43,730
Alabama juries,

508
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,290
but they were sentenced to
death by judges who overrode,

509
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:48,990
uh,

510
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,330
the,

511
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:49,760
the jury.

512
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,620
And of course far it also provides for
automatic review by the State Supreme

513
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:54,621
Court.

514
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:56,600
We're going to see this in every state,

515
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,270
whether the defendant asked for it or not,

516
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,970
whether they follow a
notice of appeal or not,

517
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,250
the case is going to
go just as in Georgia.

518
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:08,240
The case is going to go to the state
Supreme Court and that court is going to

519
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:09,074
decide,

520
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,353
uh,

521
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,140
review the case and make a decision about
both the legal errors in the case and

522
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:18,230
maybe some questions about the
appropriateness of the death polling.

523
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:19,011
Well,

524
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:20,600
let's go to the great state of Texas,

525
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,580
which has a completely different,

526
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:23,391
uh,

527
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:27,500
way of defining which cases are
going to be death poly cases.

528
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,550
First of all,

529
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,890
Texas defines the crime,

530
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,491
uh,

531
00:17:31,491 --> 00:17:35,930
of capital murder as one that's going
to be decided at the guilt phase.

532
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,920
In other words,

533
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,770
there's a crime that if you're
convicted of capital murder,

534
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,900
then your case goes to the penalty phase.

535
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,410
Uh,

536
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,570
we see the same sorts of things,

537
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,530
um,

538
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:46,100
as,

539
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,580
uh,

540
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,650
making one eligible for capital murder,

541
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,490
a murder of a police,

542
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:50,940
uh,

543
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,350
or,

544
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,700
or fire person here again,

545
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:54,421
felony murder,

546
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:56,070
murder during a kidnapping,

547
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:56,581
burglary,

548
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:57,091
robbery,

549
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:57,480
rape,

550
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,313
arson,

551
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,850
any murder in the commission of another
crime is going to be eligible for the

552
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:03,684
death penalty.

553
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,540
Murder for a renumeration,

554
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:07,680
uh,

555
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,770
is as well murder in
the course of an escape.

556
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:11,460
Uh,

557
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,151
and finally,

558
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:14,310
a prisoner who kills the prison employee.

559
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,200
Notice what's missing in Texas.

560
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,190
No catchall,

561
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,810
no catchall heinous,

562
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:21,320
atrocious and cruel or anything like that.

563
00:18:21,321 --> 00:18:22,770
It's pretty well defined,

564
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,401
uh,

565
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:28,110
in terms of what a person has to do in
order to be eligible for the death pony

566
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,083
in Texas,

567
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,990
the unique part of the Texas statute,

568
00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:31,824
that's part of it,

569
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,420
but a number of states now have capital
murder statutes where at the guilt

570
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:37,254
phase,

571
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,401
at the same time,

572
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:40,020
the jury's deciding guilt or innocence.

573
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,120
It's deciding whether the person
is guilty of something plus murder.

574
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,750
In other words,

575
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,040
an aggravating factor that's basically
Texas moves that determination of

576
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:53,640
aggravating factors into the guilt
phase as opposed to having it,

577
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,240
uh,

578
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,510
as Georgia and Florida
do in the penalty phase.

579
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,170
Uh,

580
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,910
so we get to the,

581
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:00,960
uh,

582
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,190
penalty phase and the jury
is asked three questions,

583
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:05,690
uh,

584
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,630
and these are yes,

585
00:19:06,631 --> 00:19:07,470
no questions.

586
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:08,010
First,

587
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,180
was it deliberate?

588
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:09,900
Uh,

589
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,733
did the,

590
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,753
uh,

591
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,110
was the conduct deliberate
with a reasonable expectation
that death would occur?

592
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,990
The answer to that question is
almost always going to be yes.

593
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:19,700
Uh,

594
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,700
because the person has been found guilty
of intentional capital murder at the

595
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:25,554
guilt phase,

596
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,090
and most likely,

597
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:27,960
uh,

598
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,810
it's going to be the found
that it was deliberate.

599
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,160
The only question is the
expectation that death would occur,

600
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:35,910
uh,

601
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,980
that may be an issue in some cases.

602
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:38,610
Uh,

603
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,301
secondly,

604
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:40,350
and most importantly,

605
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,070
is the person a future danger to society.

606
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,880
This is a introduced by Texas here and
upheld in 1976 the jury is asked whether

607
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:52,920
beyond a reasonable doubt,

608
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:58,250
there is a substantial probability that
the defendant will commit future acts of

609
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:02,400
violence and be a continuing
threat to society.

610
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,890
This is a highly controversial,

611
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,570
aggravating circumstance.

612
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,080
Uh,

613
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,890
first of all,

614
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,100
what do we mean by
substantial probability?

615
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,120
Uh,

616
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,811
if we say,

617
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:17,811
if the weatherman tells us there's
a 30% probability of rain tomorrow,

618
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,880
is that a substantial probability a,

619
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:23,340
or do we have to have a 60% probability,

620
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,121
uh,

621
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:24,421
or,

622
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:24,811
or higher?

623
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:25,920
That's never been decided.

624
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:26,851
Uh,

625
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:30,120
and then the question of
can this even be determined?

626
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,410
Can doctors,

627
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:32,310
psychiatrists,

628
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,430
or psychologists predict
future dangerousness?

629
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,001
Uh,

630
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,670
and can juries make
determinations about it?

631
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,270
Uh,

632
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,961
well in Texas,

633
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:41,100
they do a,

634
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:41,934
at the time,

635
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,290
uh,

636
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,340
1970s,

637
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:44,691
when,

638
00:20:44,691 --> 00:20:46,320
when the death point is
being posted in Texas,

639
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:47,710
basically a,

640
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:48,820
in one part of Texas,

641
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,600
uh,

642
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,910
people would be examined
by Dr. James Grigson,

643
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:52,720
uh,

644
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,130
who would opine that they were a future
danger at the penalty phase of their

645
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:57,964
trials.

646
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,080
Another part of Texas,

647
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:01,480
you'd be a doctor Holbrook,

648
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,020
uh,

649
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:06,970
would be the doctor who had examine a
defendants and provide a opinion that they

650
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:08,020
were a future danger.

651
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:08,651
Uh,

652
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:12,640
and pretty much at the penalty
phase of capital cases,

653
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,100
uh,

654
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,933
in Texas.

655
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,390
That would be the,

656
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:20,020
the evidence offered by the prosecution
for the death pony because I say it's

657
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:21,760
not going to be much
question about deliberate.

658
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,421
Uh,

659
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:24,460
and there's not going to be
much question about this third,

660
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:24,970
uh,

661
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,320
issue provocation,

662
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,820
whether the defendant's conduct was
unreasonable in response to provocation.

663
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:31,361
In other words,

664
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:36,160
did the victim do something which caused
the defendant to commit the crime?

665
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:36,971
So the,

666
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:39,910
the first and last generally
are not going to be issues.

667
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,120
So the case is going to come
down to future dangerousness.

668
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,230
And notice this once the jury
answers those three questions.

669
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:48,064
Yes,

670
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:48,760
yes,

671
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,593
yes.

672
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,550
The death penalty is imposed.

673
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,440
The judge has no discretion,

674
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,160
uh,

675
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,060
to reject the death.

676
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:55,721
Money is justice.

677
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:58,030
Rehnquist says in his dissenting opinion,

678
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:58,721
uh,

679
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:02,380
in Jorg versus in the
mandatory death pony cases,

680
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,490
Woodson versus North Carolina
and Roberts versus Louisiana.

681
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:06,971
He says,

682
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:07,361
wait a minute,

683
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:09,370
we've upheld a mandatory death sentence.

684
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:09,790
The,

685
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,970
the Texas statute is a mandatory statute.

686
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:16,690
If the jury finds the answers to
three questions in the affirmative,

687
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,370
the death penalty is imposed.

688
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:18,970
Uh,

689
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,770
this scheme here,

690
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,320
uh,

691
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,780
this statutory approach the Texas took
is the reason that so many people had

692
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:27,640
been executed in Texas.

693
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,360
Uh,

694
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,193
because,

695
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:29,740
uh,

696
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,390
if these questions are all answered,

697
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,080
yes,

698
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,320
uh,

699
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,640
there's not the discretion that juries
have in Florida and Georgia to reject the

700
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:39,220
death penalty and still
impose a life imprisonment.

701
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:40,060
The jury really,

702
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:40,560
uh,

703
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,640
is never given that
question under this statute.

704
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,301
Now,

705
00:22:43,301 --> 00:22:48,301
we will learn later in the course that
ultimately the supreme court found some

706
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:53,620
problems with the statute and the fact
that it didn't allow a certain mitigating

707
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:55,390
circumstances to be considered.

708
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,980
But in 1976,

709
00:22:56,981 --> 00:22:57,581
the court said,

710
00:22:57,581 --> 00:22:58,090
well,

711
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,370
in answering some of
these other questions,

712
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,910
the jury can take into account
mitigating circumstances.

713
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:04,983
And so,

714
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,291
uh,

715
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:06,610
the statutes are going to be,

716
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,031
uh,

717
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:07,864
upheld,

718
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:08,110
uh,

719
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,100
based upon that,

720
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,530
or the Texas statute was
upheld based upon that.

721
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,011
Uh,

722
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:12,844
but we'll see,

723
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,510
uh,

724
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:13,721
the,

725
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:15,550
there were some problems with the statute.

726
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,190
A supreme court didn't
recognize him for a long time,

727
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,600
and by the time it did,

728
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,050
an awful lot of people had been sentenced
to death and even executed in Texas,

729
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:23,860
uh,

730
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,240
under this statute,

731
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:27,130
which was upheld in 1976,

732
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,210
um,

733
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:28,880
North Carolina,

734
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,590
Louisiana,

735
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,700
as I mentioned before,

736
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,180
adopt mandatory death penalty statutes.

737
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:35,470
You commit a certain crime.

738
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,600
The death pony is mandatory.

739
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,321
Uh,

740
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:40,530
this is to prevent arbitrators.

741
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,080
Uh,

742
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,680
so the court has to decide of these five
death pony statutes that it has before

743
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:46,220
them.

744
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,940
What's one,

745
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,500
which ones are constitutional,

746
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:48,970
uh,

747
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:49,910
in which ones are not.

748
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,253
Uh,

749
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,161
and,

750
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:54,020
and in these five cases,

751
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:54,530
uh,

752
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:59,090
we have some justices who find all the
statutes constitutional chief justice,

753
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:00,410
Burger justice,

754
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:00,741
White,

755
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:05,741
black Rehnquist vote to
uphold both the Florida,

756
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,500
Texas and Georgia statutes.

757
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,160
Uh,

758
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,850
and to hold up all the mandatory statutes.

759
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,250
I just said Brennan and Marshall
would say that the death penalty is

760
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:17,750
unconstitutional in all cases,

761
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:20,270
so they would not uphold
any of the statutes.

762
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:25,070
And so this leaves the decision making
a true a plurality of three justices.

763
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:25,970
Justice Stewart,

764
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:26,690
uh,

765
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,980
justice Powell and justice Stevens who's
not come on the court taking justice

766
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:35,780
Douglas place appointed by President
Gerald Ford and the three of them,

767
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,221
right.

768
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:39,860
The opinion that joins with,

769
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:40,610
uh,

770
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:45,020
Brennan and Marshall to declare the
mandatory death Polly unconstitutional by

771
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:46,640
very close five to four vote,

772
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:47,441
uh,

773
00:24:47,441 --> 00:24:52,441
and then join with chief justice Berger
and the others to uphold a the so called

774
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,920
guided discretion statutes.

775
00:24:55,130 --> 00:25:00,020
The statutes that supposedly tell the
jury how it's to make this decision.

776
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:00,651
The Georgia,

777
00:25:00,651 --> 00:25:01,340
Florida,

778
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,450
and Texas statutes.

779
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,290
So the guided discretion
statutes are upheld seven to two.

780
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:11,620
The mandatory statutes are a declared
unconstitutional by very close vote of

781
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:13,430
five to four.

782
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,803
Um,

783
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,040
one could ask,

784
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:16,670
uh,

785
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,890
why would the mandatory statute,

786
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:19,640
uh,

787
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,140
be unconstitutional if the goal is to
limit tray eliminate arbitrariness.

788
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:24,561
And of course,

789
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:28,760
some members of the court felt that
mandatory death pony was perfectly

790
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:29,594
appropriate.

791
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,140
Uh,

792
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,020
but the court was concerned about,

793
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:33,591
first of all,

794
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:35,210
the risk of arbitrariness,

795
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:35,811
uh,

796
00:25:35,811 --> 00:25:37,350
justice Stevens and writes his opinion,

797
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,213
talks about,

798
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:38,660
uh,

799
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,460
jurors often would nullify,

800
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:44,030
would not return a verdict of guilty
if they felt the death plenty was not

801
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:44,864
appropriate.

802
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:45,261
Uh,

803
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:50,060
but I think what really is a critical
take home lesson of Woodson versus North

804
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,330
Carolina,

805
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:52,370
which struck down in the
North Carolina Statute,

806
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,120
uh,

807
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,810
is,

808
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:54,200
uh,

809
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,000
the failure to consider the individual
circumstances of the offender.

810
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,470
This is going to become one of the most
important principles in modern death

811
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:06,890
pony law that the jury cannot treat.

812
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,870
The person accused,

813
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,471
uh,

814
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:11,990
as a faceless mass of criminals.

815
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:12,831
The,

816
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:17,420
that this can't be defined just by
the crime you must take into account,

817
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,110
uh,

818
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,420
the diverse frailties of humankind.

819
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,410
Uh,

820
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:26,410
anything about the life and background
of the person that meditates in favor of

821
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:27,650
a sentence less than death.

822
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,970
And this is the basis upon which the
mandatory death pony statutes are struck

823
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:35,630
down cause four justices would
have uphold them and said,

824
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,350
you know,

825
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,930
these are states can decide,

826
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:39,411
uh,

827
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:43,650
what the jury can consider it if the
state wants to make it mandatory on the

828
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:44,484
crime.

829
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,220
There's no requirement of
individualized sentencing,

830
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,750
but the majority of the court,

831
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:49,410
uh,

832
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,300
the plurality that I described,

833
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,110
uh,

834
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,640
and Brennan and Marshall,

835
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,030
uh,

836
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,960
come together to hold a,

837
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,610
that there must be consideration
of individual circumstances,

838
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:00,361
uh,

839
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:02,640
in order to impose the death pony.

840
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:03,960
Um,

841
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,580
well what do we get out of these opinions?

842
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:07,260
Let's look at the critical opinions,

843
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:10,540
which is justice Stewart
Powell and Stevens A.

844
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:15,690
And look at how the court dealt with
some of these issues that we had in 1972

845
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,370
and Furman versus Georgia.

846
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:18,180
First of all,

847
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,220
the evolving standards of decency,

848
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:20,940
uh,

849
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,770
35 state legislatures,

850
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,610
uh,

851
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:28,610
have now adopted the death pony and many
juries have imposed it and this group

852
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:29,874
says,

853
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:30,860
and,

854
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,430
and the others who joined them,

855
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:34,110
Chief Justice Burger and that group,

856
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:34,531
uh,

857
00:27:34,531 --> 00:27:38,880
it's clear that the death plenty does
not violate the evolving standards of

858
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:39,421
decency.

859
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:43,170
Because 35 legislature's wouldn't
have adopted it if it did.

860
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:46,080
So it tells us that society
accepts the death pony,

861
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,363
dignity,

862
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,300
uh,

863
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,133
dignity.

864
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:49,800
Uh,

865
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,450
these justices say relates to the
consideration of individual circumstances.

866
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:58,170
Brennan and Marshall would say
dignity means the death penalty is

867
00:27:58,171 --> 00:27:59,250
unconstitutional,

868
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,720
but the majority,

869
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,940
or at least the plurality here,

870
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,140
holds that dignity,

871
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:09,141
says you've got to look into
the individual circumstances
of the person who's

872
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,130
facing the death colleague.

873
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:11,850
Uh,

874
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,140
they also talk about,

875
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:13,860
uh,

876
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:18,690
that it cannot be so without justification
that it results in the gratuitous

877
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,133
infliction,

878
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:20,701
uh,

879
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:21,091
of,

880
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:21,540
of,

881
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,310
uh,

882
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,143
uh,

883
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,053
of suffering.

884
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:24,871
Uh,

885
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:27,600
and then they uphold it
based on the purposes.

886
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,830
Retribution.

887
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,150
Rimera Justice Marshall had said
previously that retribution was not even a

888
00:28:33,151 --> 00:28:34,350
valid consideration.

889
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:39,120
We see in the 1976 cases that most
of the members of the court except

890
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:39,954
retribution,

891
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,150
a sentencing somebody to
punish them for what they did,

892
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,810
uh,

893
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:49,410
is a fair reason to have the death.

894
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:52,710
Polian if a state legislature
decides it wants it for that purpose,

895
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:53,544
it can have it.

896
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:59,060
The Terrance is a tricky question because
the studies on deterrence are all are

897
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,061
mixed.

898
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:00,894
I mean some,

899
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:01,740
uh,

900
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,401
find that,

901
00:29:02,401 --> 00:29:02,511
uh,

902
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:06,900
the death penalty deters and
others most find that it does not.

903
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:07,620
Uh,

904
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,490
before,

905
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,151
uh,

906
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:10,650
in 1972,

907
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,100
uh,

908
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,470
justice Brennan and some of the
other members of court had said,

909
00:29:13,471 --> 00:29:13,591
well,

910
00:29:13,591 --> 00:29:17,240
unless the states can
show that it deters a,

911
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,480
they can't have the death pony.

912
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:18,871
In other words,

913
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:20,730
they put the burden of
proof on the states.

914
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,241
Well,

915
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:22,620
now the court changes that,

916
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:23,251
uh,

917
00:29:23,251 --> 00:29:25,890
at least this plurality
of justice does and says,

918
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:26,370
ah,

919
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,290
it's up to the legislature to decide,

920
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,070
uh,

921
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,390
whether it deters.

922
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:34,290
And if a state legislature decides
that it wants to adopt the death point

923
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:35,730
because it believes that deters,

924
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,280
uh,

925
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,200
that's up to the legislature
and the challengers,

926
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,530
the challenging the death Tony would
have to show that it does not deter,

927
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,120
uh,

928
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,851
which again,

929
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:47,530
if the studies are all in conflict,

930
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:50,920
that's going to be and has been
pretty impossible to prove.

931
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,143
Um,

932
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,440
Brennan and Marshall,

933
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,300
different notion of dignity,

934
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,460
the intrinsic worth of people,

935
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:57,880
uh,

936
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,960
as human beings,

937
00:29:59,320 --> 00:29:59,741
uh,

938
00:29:59,741 --> 00:30:00,490
that,

939
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:00,790
uh,

940
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,430
Brennan says the punishment
must not be degrading,

941
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,960
as we talked about before,

942
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:09,040
Marshall must not be the total
denial of the wrongdoers,

943
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,240
dignity and worth,

944
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:10,691
uh,

945
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:13,150
this turns out to be a minority view,

946
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:13,750
uh,

947
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,950
because the majority says we look at
dignity only to look at the individual

948
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:19,360
circumstances of the people.

949
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,940
We don't think that
extinguishing human life,

950
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:22,601
uh,

951
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:23,434
is a,

952
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,220
a front and dignity in a way that
violates the eighth amendment to the

953
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:29,290
constitution in the way that justice,

954
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:29,440
uh,

955
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,280
Chief Justice Warren had
described in Troup versus Dallas.

956
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,513
Um,

957
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:38,470
retribution a here justice Stewart
repeats some of what he had said.

958
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:39,304
And Greg,

959
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:39,971
uh,

960
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:44,971
when people believe that the organized
society is not going to impose a

961
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,540
punishment on criminals,

962
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,050
uh,

963
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,490
that they deserve a,

964
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,301
then he says,

965
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:53,380
then you sow the seeds of a
vigilante justice lynch mob,

966
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,513
uh,

967
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,130
uh,

968
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,650
self help and so forth.

969
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,281
Uh,

970
00:30:57,281 --> 00:30:59,080
and so he basically is saying,

971
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,420
we have to channel this,

972
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,710
uh,

973
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,491
passion,

974
00:31:03,491 --> 00:31:04,420
this reaction,

975
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:06,190
this thirst for vengeance.

976
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:06,711
Uh,

977
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:08,680
that comes out of a terrible crime,

978
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,160
uh,

979
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:14,160
by allowing it to be done in the courts
as opposed to having people resort to

980
00:31:14,681 --> 00:31:16,570
vigilante justice or Lynch law.

981
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:21,070
It shows how close we are in
time to the time of Lynch law,

982
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:21,791
uh,

983
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:26,380
and vigilante justice of the race riots
and the lynchings that had gone on,

984
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,130
uh,

985
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:27,870
earlier,

986
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,220
uh,

987
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,080
in the century,

988
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:29,801
uh,

989
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:31,660
and are not lingering met far behind.

990
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:31,901
Of course,

991
00:31:31,901 --> 00:31:32,770
one can argue,

992
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,310
uh,

993
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:38,310
that basically the government ought to
be able to deal with a vigilante justice

994
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:43,090
and Lynch law doesn't necessarily have
to have the death pointing to do that.

995
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:43,481
And of course,

996
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:44,314
the number of states,

997
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:44,830
uh,

998
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,620
still 15 did not have the
death Pawnee at this time.

999
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,320
The other thing the court says
with the gardener retribution,

1000
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,680
certain crimes themselves are so grievous,

1001
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,800
uh,

1002
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,633
that they,

1003
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:56,290
uh,

1004
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,790
such an affront to humanity.

1005
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,050
The only adequate punishment is
going to be the sentence of death.

1006
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:02,591
Uh,

1007
00:32:02,591 --> 00:32:03,424
and so,

1008
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:03,880
uh,

1009
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,360
the court finds that
for a murder at least,

1010
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:09,730
which all these cases involved murders,

1011
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,271
uh,

1012
00:32:10,271 --> 00:32:11,230
the five cases,

1013
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:15,250
we're going to see later the court
looking at some non murder cases to decide

1014
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:17,560
whether it's appropriate to
impose the death penalty.

1015
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,210
But with these cases,

1016
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:22,690
the court says some crimes
so grievous in the front,

1017
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:23,410
uh,

1018
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,550
to society,

1019
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,910
uh,

1020
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,360
that they can be punished
by the death penalty.

1021
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,853
Um,

1022
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,190
deterrence is to come back
to what I said earlier,

1023
00:32:33,191 --> 00:32:35,480
the studies have been inconclusive.

1024
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,430
Uh,

1025
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,900
the plurality says,

1026
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,650
uh,

1027
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,290
probably there's some people for whom a
deterrence works and there are probably

1028
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:44,840
other people who are not deterred a,

1029
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:46,580
but we're not going to get into that.

1030
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,140
It's a complex issue.

1031
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:48,830
Uh,

1032
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,300
it's not for the court to sort out,

1033
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,291
as I said earlier,

1034
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:52,640
it's for the legislature.

1035
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,280
And so we're going to
let the legislature's,

1036
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:57,320
the state legislatures and Congress,

1037
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:57,890
uh,

1038
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,450
have hearings here,

1039
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:03,530
the pros and cons of deterrence and
whether the death penalty deters and make

1040
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:04,281
their own decision,

1041
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:05,540
whether to adopt the death Polly.

1042
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,690
So it pretty much takes
deterrence off the table.

1043
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:09,621
Uh,

1044
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:10,454
in the,

1045
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,320
uh,

1046
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,910
in decision the court was talking
a lot and members of the court,

1047
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:18,560
we were talking a lot about is this
serving the purpose of deterrence and some

1048
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:18,951
justice,

1049
00:33:18,951 --> 00:33:21,700
we're saying it's so
infrequently used and,

1050
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:22,170
and uh,

1051
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,410
it's so arbitrary that it doesn't deter,

1052
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,820
but now the court is basically saying
we're going to leave to turns to the

1053
00:33:27,821 --> 00:33:28,654
legislatures.

1054
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:28,930
Uh,

1055
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,200
it's not for us to decide.

1056
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:30,981
Uh,

1057
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:31,814
and so,

1058
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:32,803
uh,

1059
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:36,470
retribution is an acceptable
reason to have the death pony.

1060
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,760
Deterrence is something we're
leaving up to the legislators.

1061
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,480
So what's the answer?

1062
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:42,314
What's the,

1063
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:42,530
uh,

1064
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:46,580
what do we come out of the 1976
cases with bifurcated trials?

1065
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,370
Every state that has the death penalty,

1066
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,000
uh,

1067
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,350
has bifurcated trials.

1068
00:33:51,351 --> 00:33:56,060
One trial on guilt or innocence and
another on penalty narrow the class of

1069
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:56,923
eligibles,

1070
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,630
a narrow who can be sentenced to death.

1071
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:03,320
That is provide what justice
white was looking for in 1972.

1072
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:06,380
That principled reason why
some people get the death,

1073
00:34:06,381 --> 00:34:08,090
Tony and others do not.

1074
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,840
And we saw the Georgia
did that by providing,

1075
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,940
once the jury finds an
aggravating circumstance,

1076
00:34:13,941 --> 00:34:15,650
it has complete discretion,

1077
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,250
uh,

1078
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,083
Florida,

1079
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:17,571
uh,

1080
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:21,590
ways whether there's sufficient
mitigating circumstances that outweigh the

1081
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:23,030
aggravating circumstances.

1082
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:23,871
And finally,

1083
00:34:23,871 --> 00:34:28,580
Texas gives the jury three questions
and it answers those questions.

1084
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,110
And as I said earlier,

1085
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:31,580
if the question is answered yes,

1086
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,470
then it means the death plenty is imposed.

1087
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:37,760
If it's answered no to any
of the questions than the
death pony is not imposed.

1088
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,083
Um,

1089
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:44,110
three discretion of the jury must be
suitably directed and limited to minimize

1090
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:50,330
the risk of arbitrary and
capricious sentencing.

1091
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:51,441
In other words,

1092
00:34:51,441 --> 00:34:56,441
we've got to tell the jury how it's to
go about its job in a way that takes into

1093
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:01,100
account the circumstances of the crime,

1094
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,010
but also the circumstances
of the individual,

1095
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,700
the offender and the jury
must be given guidance with,

1096
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,190
these are jury instructions
we're talking about here,

1097
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:14,870
clear and objective standards about
the fact of the crime and about the

1098
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:15,704
defendant.

1099
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:16,723
And so,

1100
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,390
uh,

1101
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,223
those are,

1102
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:18,740
uh,

1103
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,191
critical.

1104
00:35:19,191 --> 00:35:19,491
Now,

1105
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:20,510
in addition to that,

1106
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,380
uh,

1107
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,250
we saw that,

1108
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:22,940
uh,

1109
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,450
automatic appeal was
provided for by Georgia,

1110
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,810
had been provided in Florida.

1111
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,953
Uh,

1112
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,800
it's unclear whether it's
constitutionally required.

1113
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,550
The court sort of talks about
it with approval in these cases.

1114
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,240
Uh,

1115
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,040
but it's never held that
automatic appeal is required.

1116
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:39,871
And by automatic,

1117
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:40,680
I mean,

1118
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,380
even if the defendant doesn't
file a notice of appeal,

1119
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:46,050
which is required in
other cases to appeal,

1120
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:46,631
uh,

1121
00:35:46,631 --> 00:35:46,950
the,

1122
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:51,090
the case if a DeCinces imposed that
case is going to be reviewed by a higher

1123
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:51,920
court,

1124
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,300
uh,

1125
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,070
in every state that has the death penalty
and the federal government provide for

1126
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:56,904
that.

1127
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:57,301
Uh,

1128
00:35:57,301 --> 00:36:01,170
at the time these cases
were decided in 1976,

1129
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:01,710
uh,

1130
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,960
the thought was that
proportionality review,

1131
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,940
like Georgia has a,

1132
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:10,970
that is comparing the case in which the
defendant was sentenced to death with

1133
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:13,650
other cases involving similar facts,

1134
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,130
uh,

1135
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,980
to decide whether the death
penalty was disproportionate.

1136
00:36:16,981 --> 00:36:17,311
That is,

1137
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:20,730
is it excessive where there are
other people who got convicted,

1138
00:36:20,731 --> 00:36:24,870
a very similar crimes or
maybe more heinous crimes
who did not receive the death

1139
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:25,704
tonic,

1140
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,190
uh,

1141
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,020
that was,

1142
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,300
uh,

1143
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,600
seen by some at that time as
constitutionally required.

1144
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,531
But as we will see,

1145
00:36:31,531 --> 00:36:35,490
the court later holds that it's
not a constitutionally required.

1146
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:39,300
And so most states abandoned
their proportionality review.

1147
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,670
Once the Supreme Court decides that,

1148
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,103
um,

1149
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,210
Justice Powell says,

1150
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:46,560
to sort of sum this up,

1151
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:47,070
uh,

1152
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:52,070
guidance is sufficient if the factors
channel the discretion of the jury by

1153
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,600
requiring them to examine the factors
that argue in favor and against the death

1154
00:36:57,601 --> 00:36:58,434
public.

1155
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,281
In other words,

1156
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:00,420
the aggravating factors,

1157
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:04,740
reasons to give the death Polly the
mitigating factors reasons not to give the

1158
00:37:04,741 --> 00:37:07,620
death Paul and the judges
to instruct the jury.

1159
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,370
You've got to find one or more of these
aggravating factors that is in the

1160
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,590
states that Florida and Georgia,

1161
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:14,371
uh,

1162
00:37:14,371 --> 00:37:17,070
and then describes how
to consider mitigation.

1163
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:17,670
Uh,

1164
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,350
and theoretically that will,

1165
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:19,980
uh,

1166
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,360
put before the jury.

1167
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,160
This is what the court
said couldn't be done.

1168
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:26,310
And mcgautha mcgautha
said just a year earlier.

1169
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,870
It's beyond human ability
to define before the fact.

1170
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:35,310
What are the characteristics of the
crime and the offender that justify the

1171
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:36,144
death point.

1172
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,910
One year later under the eighth amendment,

1173
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,770
the Supreme Court does exactly that.

1174
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:41,460
Uh,

1175
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,160
excuse me.

1176
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,360
Uh,

1177
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,193
four years later,

1178
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,300
the supreme court does exactly that.

1179
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:45,961
Uh,

1180
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:48,450
two other points which will leave with,

1181
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,081
uh,

1182
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:51,270
with regard to Greg versus Georgia and,

1183
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,050
uh,

1184
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:52,801
all the cases.

1185
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:54,150
But this was mentioned in Greg.

1186
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:55,741
First of all,

1187
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:57,330
we're a life is at stake.

1188
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:57,931
Uh,

1189
00:37:57,931 --> 00:38:02,931
the courts must be particularly
sensitive to see that every safeguard is

1190
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:03,834
observed.

1191
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:04,981
The idea,

1192
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:06,600
at least in 1976,

1193
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:09,090
was that if the death penalty is imposed,

1194
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,010
then,

1195
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:10,230
uh,

1196
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,440
because death is different because of
the stakes involved because of the era

1197
00:38:14,441 --> 00:38:15,890
voke ability of the death point,

1198
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:19,800
we going to make sure that
every safeguard is observed,

1199
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:20,320
uh,

1200
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,270
that uh,

1201
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:22,320
will be abandoned,

1202
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,310
uh,

1203
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,450
as the years go by.

1204
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:24,960
Uh,

1205
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,330
but that was at least the notion in 1976.

1206
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:28,650
And then secondly,

1207
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:29,370
uh,

1208
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:33,120
that accurate sentencing
information is indispensable.

1209
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:33,751
In other words,

1210
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:36,290
the jury has to have not
just the facts of the crime,

1211
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:39,770
they're going to have that because the
law enforcement is going to investigate a

1212
00:38:39,771 --> 00:38:40,580
crime.

1213
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:45,560
They're going to present all the details
that are available with regard to how

1214
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:46,700
the crime was committed,

1215
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:50,180
but also have to have the
information about the offender,

1216
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,730
the circumstances of the offender.

1217
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:57,940
And this is going to put a great deal of
responsibility on defense counsel as we

1218
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:01,130
will talk about later in the course.

1219
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:01,670
Uh,

1220
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:06,670
the responsibility of defense counsel to
conduct the investigation into the life

1221
00:39:06,681 --> 00:39:07,514
and background,

1222
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,230
uh,

1223
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:08,950
of,

1224
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,260
uh,

1225
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,093
the defendant,

1226
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:10,881
uh,

1227
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:11,870
and uh,

1228
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,250
put that evidence before the jury so that
it can give consideration not only to

1229
00:39:16,251 --> 00:39:17,540
the circumstances of the crime,

1230
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:22,340
but the life and background
of the defendant and any
factors that are mitigating

1231
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:26,390
factors that militate in favor
of a sentence less than death.

1232
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,790
So once the dust clears a,

1233
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:30,500
with these five decisions coming out,

1234
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:34,160
we know that guided discretion
statutes are constitutional.

1235
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,150
Uh,

1236
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,661
Georgia,

1237
00:39:35,661 --> 00:39:38,120
Florida and Texas are going
to be allowed to go ahead.

1238
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:41,210
Other states are going
to adopt a statutes.

1239
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:44,480
Like there's probably
the model is Florida,

1240
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:45,680
the weighing statute.

1241
00:39:45,681 --> 00:39:49,550
That's what the federal government has
in a number of other states have adopted

1242
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,780
weighing statutes.

1243
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:55,781
But there are also states that adopted
future dangerousness determinations,

1244
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:56,961
uh,

1245
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:57,311
and,

1246
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,440
and other elements of these three cases.

1247
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:00,981
Uh,

1248
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,180
but basically this,

1249
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:05,420
let the states know
this is what you can do,

1250
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,040
a,

1251
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,600
that's constitutional and you cannot
have a mandatory death penalty.

1252
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,790
The court considered a number of cases
later on and involving mandatory death

1253
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,940
plenty in certain circumstances
where the argument was made.

1254
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:21,140
Well if you kill a person in prison after
you've been since the life in prison,

1255
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,060
you could have a mandatory death when no,

1256
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,510
not.

1257
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,480
So basically the court has rejected every,

1258
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:26,910
uh,

1259
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,410
ever to justify a mandatory death points.

1260
00:40:29,411 --> 00:40:34,100
So juries have to have some discretion
in whether or not to impose the death

1261
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:34,610
penalty.

1262
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:38,270
They have to be instructed as to what
factors militate in favor of the death

1263
00:40:38,271 --> 00:40:38,511
penalty.

1264
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:43,511
What factors militate against the death
Pollock and what will take up next a is

1265
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,240
the death pony for certain crimes.

1266
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:47,871
Uh,

1267
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:50,180
whether the death penalty
can be imposed for,

1268
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,140
uh,

1269
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,520
the role of the offender and the crime
for particular crimes where there's not a

1270
00:40:55,521 --> 00:40:56,540
murderer involved.

1271
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,081
Uh,

1272
00:40:57,081 --> 00:40:58,370
and then for particular people,

1273
00:40:58,850 --> 00:40:59,450
uh,

1274
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,440
for children,

1275
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,680
for intellectually disabled
people and other people.

1276
00:41:03,681 --> 00:41:07,190
Are there some people that under
the cruel and unusual clause,

1277
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,880
the death police should really be off
limits and that's what we'll take them in

1278
00:41:10,881 --> 00:41:11,510
our next session.
