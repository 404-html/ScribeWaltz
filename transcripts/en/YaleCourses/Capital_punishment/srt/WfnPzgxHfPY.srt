1
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,280
The central player in the criminal
justice system is a prosecutor.

2
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,270
Uh,

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,430
prosecutors decide what cases are brought,

4
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:19,830
what charges are filed
against the accused,

5
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:21,780
what plea bargains are offered,

6
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:23,790
what sentences are imposed very often,

7
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:24,624
or at least have a,

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,050
a tremendous amount of
power in deciding that.

9
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:33,051
So today I want to talk
about the discretion that
prosecutors have and how it's

10
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,080
exercised,

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,050
uh,

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:35,391
and,

13
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:36,600
and how it has an impact,

14
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:38,010
particularly in capital cases.

15
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:39,210
Because as we'll see,

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,860
the two most important decisions in any
capital case is often made by just one

17
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:44,640
person.

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:44,911
Uh,

19
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,170
and that's the prosecutor,

20
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:46,830
uh,

21
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,663
called,

22
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:47,950
uh,

23
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,780
United States attorneys in the federal
system called State's attorneys or

24
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:52,800
district attorneys,

25
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:53,341
uh,

26
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:54,060
usually,

27
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,560
uh,

28
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,470
in the,

29
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:55,860
uh,

30
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,790
in the state system.

31
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,103
Uh,

32
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,760
prosecutors have all sorts of
discretion in terms of where cases go,

33
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:04,560
what cases are brought and so forth.

34
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,453
The first,

35
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,290
uh,

36
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:06,630
uh,

37
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,590
what to investigate,

38
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,280
uh,

39
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,180
how our,

40
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,810
uh,

41
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,621
resources,

42
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:14,100
law enforcement resources that
prosecutor's offices resources,

43
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:15,540
how are they going to be allocated?

44
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,261
Of course,

45
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:19,380
the prosecutor is always
going to be prosecuting.

46
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:22,680
All prosecutors offices are going
to be prosecuting violent crime,

47
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,360
murders and robberies.

48
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:25,180
And other,

49
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,680
uh,

50
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,950
crimes against people and crimes
where there's damage and so forth.

51
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,680
But there's a lot of discretion in terms
of how much emphasis might be put on a

52
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,950
economic crimes as opposed to our public
corruption or other areas like that.

53
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,440
Uh,

54
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,273
does the,

55
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:41,700
uh,

56
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,440
prosecutor look at financial,

57
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,190
uh,

58
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,023
business,

59
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:45,480
uh,

60
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,201
miss dealings?

61
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:49,590
It might be a basis for a prosecution.

62
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,250
Uh,

63
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,250
does the police send people
out to a restrooms to try
to find people looking for

64
00:01:56,281 --> 00:02:01,281
sexual partners or do they try to find
people looking for prostitutes or do they

65
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,440
try to find people looking
to buy and sell drugs?

66
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,131
Uh,

67
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:08,010
and if they're looking for
people to buy and sell drugs too,

68
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:13,011
they dispatch those officers to college
campuses to look for a drug use there or

69
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:15,510
do they send them to
certain parts of town?

70
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,100
All of these things are going to influence
which cases come into the system.

71
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:20,761
Uh,

72
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:21,594
eventually.

73
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,261
Uh,

74
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:23,094
and so,

75
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:23,730
uh,

76
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,380
the investigation,

77
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,070
uh,

78
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,110
is critical in terms of,

79
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:28,680
uh,

80
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,600
what kinds Chris in death penalty cases,

81
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,270
those cases are going to be
investigated and prosecuted,

82
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:36,540
but the overall power
prosecutors in that regard,

83
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,890
it is worth noting.

84
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,640
The next thing is whether
to charge a case or not.

85
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:42,571
Uh,

86
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:43,220
when,

87
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:43,590
uh,

88
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,210
some cases come into court,

89
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,030
let's say the quality of
life cases that you have in,

90
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,810
uh,

91
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,330
some cities now people are
arrested for loitering,

92
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,030
uh,

93
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,880
for small amounts of marijuana,

94
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,600
uh,

95
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,433
for,

96
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:55,890
uh,

97
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,723
jaywalking.

98
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,270
Uh,

99
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,040
are we going to bring charges?

100
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,041
Those people,

101
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:04,150
are we going to bring him before a
judge tried to get a sense or might the

102
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,720
prosecutor decline prosecution
in those situations?

103
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,150
And those can be a more
serious cases as well.

104
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,040
A person is arrested for assault.

105
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:12,730
Uh,

106
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,750
the question may be,

107
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,140
uh,

108
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,610
do they act in self defense?

109
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,540
Uh,

110
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,830
the prosecutor will study the case and
make a determination and perhaps decide

111
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,150
not to prosecute.

112
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,110
Uh,

113
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,670
the Strauss Kahn case,

114
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,301
uh,

115
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,134
where,

116
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,800
uh,

117
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Strauss Kahn was charged with a rape,

118
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:30,760
sexual assault.

119
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:31,331
Uh,

120
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:32,200
but eventually,

121
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:32,771
uh,

122
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:34,660
the prosecutor's office in Manhattan,

123
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,920
a Dick decided to decline that
prosecution and not to go forward.

124
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:40,720
So this is a tremendous power,

125
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,320
uh,

126
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,540
that the prosecution has a,

127
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,530
in terms of,

128
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,130
uh,

129
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,020
whether to charge at all,

130
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,370
even though there may be a basis
for thinking there's a charge there.

131
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,121
Uh,

132
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:57,121
and then what to charge the same behavior
can often be prosecuted under a lot

133
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:57,750
of,

134
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,970
uh,

135
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,530
different,

136
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:58,750
uh,

137
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,100
statutes or laws.

138
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,293
Um,

139
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,193
assault,

140
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:02,830
uh,

141
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,491
maybe,

142
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:04,270
uh,

143
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,961
prosecuted,

144
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:05,561
for example,

145
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:07,060
is aggravated assault,

146
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,830
which might be a felony.

147
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,410
That is a crime punishable by over a year,

148
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,090
and it might carry 10 years saying,

149
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,950
just in some jurisdiction,

150
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:15,731
uh,

151
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:18,430
the prosecutor could charge that
same crime as simple assault,

152
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,680
a punishable by only one year.

153
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,710
So right there in making
that charging decision,

154
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:24,731
uh,

155
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,760
in charging the more serious
crime or the less serious crime,

156
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,140
the is deciding right there what the
range of punishments are going to be.

157
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,011
In one case,

158
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:34,090
it's going to be 10 years.

159
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,600
Uh,

160
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,370
in one case it's going to be,

161
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,160
uh,

162
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,993
uh,

163
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,400
just one year,

164
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,573
um,

165
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,500
uh,

166
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,470
in the readings we have that in Manhattan,

167
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,280
uh,

168
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,150
auto stripping,

169
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:46,710
uh,

170
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,860
it was charged as a felony.

171
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:48,490
Uh,

172
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,860
so it's more seriously
punishing Brooklyn's charge,

173
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,671
uh,

174
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:52,510
as a misdemeanor.

175
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:53,230
Uh,

176
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,300
so we have different prosecutors offices,

177
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:55,840
uh,

178
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,680
with different,

179
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,281
uh,

180
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:59,860
approaches to the same behavior,

181
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:00,490
uh,

182
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,750
but charging different things.

183
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:02,081
So again,

184
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:04,810
this is an area of
prosecutorial discretion,

185
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,213
um,

186
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,570
when to charge,

187
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,793
um,

188
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:09,940
the,

189
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,773
uh,

190
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,260
case that will take up later in
the file name Harrison chronic.

191
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:14,861
Uh,

192
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:19,120
the government's been four and a half
years putting together this elaborate case

193
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:19,954
against him,

194
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,390
which involved a check hiding scheme.

195
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,681
Uh,

196
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:25,720
they've finally charged him with it,

197
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,390
a assigned a real estate
lawyer to represent it,

198
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:29,650
him to represent him,

199
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,990
and then told them to be
ready for Trump 25 days,

200
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:33,700
and they tried the case in 25 days.

201
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,660
Uh,

202
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,720
so obviously the prosecution,

203
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:40,690
if it does something like that
can get an enormous advantage,

204
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,350
uh,

205
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,320
in taking time to build a case.

206
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:44,870
Uh,

207
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,060
there's really no limit.

208
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,150
A lot of times when prosecutors
investigating cases,

209
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:50,920
one method they use as a grand jury,

210
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,030
that people can be subpoenaed
to go before the grand jury,

211
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,250
which is only the prosecution,

212
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,951
the witnesses,

213
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:59,810
there's no defense lawyer present there.

214
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:01,190
There's no judge present.

215
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,031
Uh,

216
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:05,060
and grand jury investigations
may go on for years,

217
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,690
uh,

218
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,650
before charges,

219
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,251
uh,

220
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:07,551
are,

221
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:08,120
are,

222
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,953
are broad,

223
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:09,920
uh,

224
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,970
where to charge.

225
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,601
Uh,

226
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:13,040
this can be very important,

227
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:13,700
uh,

228
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,533
has been,

229
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:14,901
uh,

230
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:15,860
in drug cases,

231
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:19,610
whether those cases are charged in federal
court or whether they're charged in

232
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,451
state court,

233
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:23,270
most of those cases can
be charged in either one.

234
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,961
Uh,

235
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:25,760
particularly with regard to cocaine,

236
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:26,541
crack cocaine,

237
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,210
you can charge it state or federal court.

238
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:30,710
Same thing for powdered cocaine.

239
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,281
Uh,

240
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:36,281
and there was a lot of controversy
about where those charges were brought,

241
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:36,890
uh,

242
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,480
because they were often brought in the
jurisdiction that carried the heavier

243
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:42,314
sentence.

244
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:42,711
Uh,

245
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:44,300
we see that in death penalty cases.

246
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,410
Uh,

247
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,400
for example,

248
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,820
if a potential capital
case is in Orleans parish,

249
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:52,790
say New Orleans,

250
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,773
Louisiana,

251
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,560
uh,

252
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Orleans Parrish is about
70% African American.

253
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,090
So the jury is gonna reflect that there's
going to be a very large number of

254
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:04,370
African Americans probably
in the jury pool and,

255
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,290
and it will make it onto the jury.

256
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,920
Uh,

257
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,410
but if the case is
prosecuted in federal court,

258
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,100
it will be prosecuted in the
eastern district of Louisiana,

259
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:15,020
which includes not only Orleans parish,

260
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:16,910
but all the parishes around it.

261
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:17,241
In fact,

262
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:22,220
a very large part of the state
of Louisiana and the jury,

263
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:22,701
uh,

264
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:27,350
the percentage of African Americans
in that pool a is only 20%.

265
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,320
So by deciding where the case is brought,

266
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,000
the state's attorney and the United
States attorney can decide whether it's

267
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:39,680
going to be brought in a place where the
citizens are 70 per black citizens or

268
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:41,030
70% of the population,

269
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,980
or where the 20% of the population.

270
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:43,671
Uh,

271
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,560
the same thing happens in
Prince George's county,

272
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:46,340
Maryland.

273
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,320
These cases are often
brought in federal court,

274
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:48,841
uh,

275
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:49,674
in Maryland,

276
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,150
uh,

277
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,770
same thing,

278
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,230
uh,

279
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,250
around Saint Louis,

280
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,590
uh,

281
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,680
or in Saint Louis.

282
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,221
Uh,

283
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:58,130
those were not be the places where you
would think that would be the greatest

284
00:07:58,131 --> 00:07:58,890
number,

285
00:07:58,890 --> 00:07:59,220
a,

286
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,370
a federal death pony prosecutions.

287
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:01,780
Uh,

288
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,720
but it turns out,

289
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,260
uh,

290
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,591
that,

291
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:03,890
that,

292
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,723
that it is.

293
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,953
Um,

294
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,370
and then,

295
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:07,671
uh,

296
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:09,650
as I said in state or federal court,

297
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,011
uh,

298
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:14,750
one other point to make is whether
they're brought in juvenile court or adult

299
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:15,360
court.

300
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,920
Uh,

301
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,170
used to be that any child,

302
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:22,670
anybody under 18 could only be prosecuted
in adult court if there was some

303
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:27,671
showing made by a judge I made before a
judge and a judge certified the case to

304
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:28,844
adult court.

305
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,530
Many jurisdictions today,

306
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:31,880
the prosecutor decides,

307
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:32,541
uh,

308
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,170
the,

309
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:33,530
uh,

310
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:38,270
children presumptively can be charged
as adults and the prosecutor can waive

311
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:41,390
prosecution and they're
prosecuted in juvenile court.

312
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,720
This is a classic example of how much
power has moved from the judges to the

313
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:48,290
prosecutors,

314
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:48,831
uh,

315
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:52,790
in terms of where cases are prosecuted
in terms of what sentencing a is

316
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,080
available for people.

317
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,711
Uh,

318
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:55,141
it's a,

319
00:08:55,141 --> 00:09:00,141
it's a power that I think many people
may not realize is being exercised by

320
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:02,004
prosecutors,

321
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:02,550
uh,

322
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,600
in these cases.

323
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,680
Just to speak for a moment about the
investigation that prosecutors do,

324
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,820
which I've alluded to.

325
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,570
Uh,

326
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,403
obviously,

327
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,150
uh,

328
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,970
and let's talk about state prosecutors
because I said most of these cases are

329
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,590
going to be in the state courts.

330
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,620
95% of criminal cases are
state prosecutions and most
death penalty sentences

331
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,840
have been imposed in the,

332
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,140
in the state courts.

333
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,980
Uh,

334
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,570
but,

335
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:26,820
uh,

336
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,900
a state prosecutor,

337
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,800
a district attorney,

338
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,030
state's attorney will have,

339
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,460
uh,

340
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,460
all the law enforcement agencies,

341
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:34,590
the State Bureau of Investigation,

342
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:38,520
the local police departments
or sheriff's departments,

343
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,700
all of the law enforcement
agencies are available.

344
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:41,911
Of course,

345
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:42,840
that's what their job is,

346
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:44,610
is to go out and investigate crimes,

347
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:45,090
uh,

348
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,530
take statements from witnesses,

349
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,371
uh,

350
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:48,480
and so forth.

351
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,623
Um,

352
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,300
uh,

353
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,740
the states also have crime laboratories.

354
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:53,400
Now,

355
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,061
unfortunately,

356
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:58,320
a lot of the crime laboratories are
part of the law enforcement agencies,

357
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,250
uh,

358
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,950
National Academy of Science
and suggested that perhaps,

359
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,461
uh,

360
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:06,330
the integrity of some of the
science has been compromised to bed,

361
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:06,860
uh,

362
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,430
because it's not seen as science is as
much as it's seen as law enforcement

363
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:11,881
sometime.

364
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:12,714
But at any rate,

365
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,230
uh,

366
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,140
when the prosecutor
needs to have evidence,

367
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:17,700
analyzed fingerprints,

368
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,863
um,

369
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,003
uh,

370
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,630
you know,

371
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,650
DNA testing,

372
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:25,170
which of course is so critical today,

373
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:26,550
but all sorts of things,

374
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,290
uh,

375
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,550
the blood spatter analysis and so forth,

376
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,120
uh,

377
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,700
it has people on staff already,

378
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,090
uh,

379
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,140
to do those things.

380
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:34,681
And then of course,

381
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:37,350
prosecutors usually have a staff,

382
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:37,951
uh,

383
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,784
as well.

384
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,361
Uh,

385
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:44,361
worth mentioning is the
fact that a prosecutor has
a power that no other person

386
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,020
in the legal system has,

387
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,380
and that's the power to reward people
who cooperate and say what give them

388
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:56,550
favorable testimony for their
case and punish people who do not.

389
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,013
Uh,

390
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,200
we see this in cases where several
people are charged with a crime,

391
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,830
uh,

392
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,490
very often one will agree to
testify against the others,

393
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,091
uh,

394
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:09,960
in exchange for having the charges
dismissed or having to charges,

395
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,440
uh,

396
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,610
greatly reduced.

397
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,510
Uh,

398
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,340
but for example,

399
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:14,940
uh,

400
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,260
Sammy the Bull Gravano,

401
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:16,831
uh,

402
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:19,290
even though he committed 19 murders,

403
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:19,831
uh,

404
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:24,450
was allowed to plead guilty and get
only five years in exchange for his

405
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,760
testimony against Mafia boss John Gotti,

406
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,280
uh,

407
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,560
in the 1990s.

408
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,161
Uh,

409
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:33,780
that's the kind of reward that the
prosecution can give a witness,

410
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,190
a who cooperates.

411
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,031
Uh,

412
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:38,250
if the prosecution
doesn't get what it wants,

413
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:43,251
it can often make a life pretty difficult
for a person can investigate their

414
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:43,891
taxes.

415
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:44,350
And,

416
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:44,530
uh,

417
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,200
just about everything about them.

418
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,620
Uh,

419
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,790
when Webster Hubbell,

420
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:48,270
uh,

421
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:53,270
did not give testimony that the Ken
Starr Warning Against Bill Clinton,

422
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:53,890
uh,

423
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,710
star actually indicted
Webster Hubbel's wife,

424
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:57,850
uh,

425
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,560
as a way of bringing more pressure,

426
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,071
uh,

427
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:00,430
on,

428
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,340
on Webster Hubbel's.

429
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,350
So there's a tremendous amount of pressure
that often has brought upon people,

430
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,040
uh,

431
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,850
to,

432
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,510
uh,

433
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,180
to get them to cooperate if
some person is in custody,

434
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:10,740
uh,

435
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,920
where are they housed?

436
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,611
A,

437
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:16,330
are they housed in a part of the jail
where they're scared to death and

438
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:17,410
something could happen to them?

439
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:19,480
Or are they given some,

440
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,020
uh,

441
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,710
better,

442
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:20,920
uh,

443
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,000
arrangement in that,

444
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,650
or are they released pending trial?

445
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,340
Uh,

446
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,510
depending upon what their bargain
with the prosecutor may be.

447
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,710
Um,

448
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,460
and then,

449
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,293
um,

450
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,440
what penalty to see,

451
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,371
uh,

452
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:34,420
the prosecutor,

453
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:34,960
uh,

454
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,040
can influence,

455
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,820
uh,

456
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,653
the,

457
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,493
uh,

458
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,810
as we said earlier by
the charging decision,

459
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:41,910
uh,

460
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,880
if something is brought,

461
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,770
may carry a sends a 10 years,

462
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:45,650
then it's going to be a,

463
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,480
obviously a larger sense than if it's
charged as something that only carries one

464
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:49,990
year.

465
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,070
But in addition to that,

466
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,670
uh,

467
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,140
prosecutors can enhance senses
by a repeat offender papers.

468
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,340
It's just means the prosecutor files
of paper that says this person has two

469
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,630
prior convictions,

470
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:02,464
for example,

471
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,830
and if they're convicted of this,

472
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,840
it'll be the third time.

473
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:05,920
Three strikes you're out.

474
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,910
So they get a license instead of the
sentence that they would normally get for

475
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:10,511
that crime.

476
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:11,530
This can be huge.

477
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,040
Uh,

478
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,560
if the person is a charged for the crime,

479
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:17,560
that might only carry a
fairly small sentence.

480
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,423
Otherwise,

481
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:18,850
uh,

482
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,410
mandatory minimum sentences.

483
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:23,620
Most legislatures now have
passed mandatory minimum.

484
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:24,910
So for example,

485
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,610
if a prosecutor charges
someone with arm robbery,

486
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,270
uh,

487
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,103
in a state,

488
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,501
uh,

489
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:31,990
the person may have to
do at least 10 years,

490
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,620
uh,

491
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,453
before,

492
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,800
uh,

493
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,350
they're eligible for parole.

494
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,670
Uh,

495
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,410
the prosecutor can take that
away by just charging a robbery,

496
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:41,870
uh,

497
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,540
and taken away the arm robbery part of it.

498
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,530
And then the 10 years,

499
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,021
uh,

500
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:46,000
is no longer there.

501
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:47,680
This will be a subject
for plea bargaining,

502
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:48,940
which we'll talk about in a moment.

503
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,800
The one we're most concerned about,

504
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,251
uh,

505
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:52,870
the notice to seek the death penalty.

506
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,243
Um,

507
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,370
a prosecutor never is required to
seek the death polling in any state,

508
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,120
any jurisdiction in this country.

509
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:05,350
It's always a discretionary with the
prosecutor and some prosecutors don't ever

510
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:07,450
seek the death pony even
in states that have it.

511
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,310
And some prosecutors,

512
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:09,820
uh,

513
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,280
seek the death pony very frequently.

514
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,060
Uh,

515
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,810
but this is one of the two most important
decisions that are made in capital

516
00:14:16,811 --> 00:14:21,811
cases because very often the prosecutor
won't decide or won't notice up the

517
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:23,110
death pony at all.

518
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:23,681
Uh,

519
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:26,170
and the case will never be
treated as a capital case.

520
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:26,651
Uh,

521
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:28,210
even though it may be a murder case,

522
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:31,900
and even though it may involve
a fairly aggravated murder,

523
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:32,590
uh,

524
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:37,590
that first decision when Robert Morgenthau
was the district attorney in New York

525
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:40,450
during the time that New York had
the death pony about 10 years,

526
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:40,990
uh,

527
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,480
he never sought the
death pony in any case.

528
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,010
Neither did Robert Johnson,

529
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,581
uh,

530
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:47,050
the prosecutor in the Bronx,

531
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:47,950
both of them had,

532
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,880
uh,

533
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,950
they just didn't feel like
the death penalty was,

534
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,793
was useful.

535
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,970
And so they did bring it.

536
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:53,810
On the other hand,

537
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,340
if you go to a place like Houston,

538
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:56,174
Texas,

539
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,510
uh,

540
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,343
prosecutors,

541
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:57,950
uh,

542
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,940
bring the death pony,

543
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,600
uh,

544
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,080
quite,

545
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,980
quite frequently.

546
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,293
Um,

547
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,290
and then finally,

548
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,700
the prosecution can also,

549
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:05,990
particularly in the federal system,

550
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:06,380
uh,

551
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,870
reduced the sentence again
for someone cooperating.

552
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,320
Uh,

553
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,010
they can note that the person provided
substantial assistance to the government,

554
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:13,671
uh,

555
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:14,810
and that can reduce,

556
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,220
uh,

557
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,700
the sentence that the person served.

558
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:21,701
So that's another incentive for
people to agree to cooperate with the

559
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:24,344
government.

560
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:24,670
Uh,

561
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,470
and then the most critical
prosecutorial decision,

562
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,480
what plea bargain offer or whether
to offer a plea bargain at all.

563
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,561
For example,

564
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:34,394
the defendant,

565
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:34,700
uh,

566
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,390
gives up his or her right to a trial.

567
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,351
Uh,

568
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:40,640
and in exchange for that,

569
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:43,610
the prosecution withdraws its
notice to seek the death penalty.

570
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,570
Uh,

571
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,230
that's the second most important
decision in every capital case.

572
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,800
And most capital cases will be
resolved with one of those decisions.

573
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:54,860
Either the prosecutor won't
seek the death pony at all,

574
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,100
or the prosecutor will
seek the death penalty,

575
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,360
but ultimately the case will be resolved
with a plea bargain and the defendant

576
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,600
will get sentenced usually to life
imprisonment without the possibility of

577
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:06,380
parole.

578
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,290
But sometime life imprisonment
with the possibility of parole.

579
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,650
And even in some cases a a term of years,

580
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,580
uh,

581
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,320
in the country today,

582
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:20,350
94% of all state convictions and 97%
of all federal convictions are guilty

583
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:23,720
pleas.

584
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,490
So as the Supreme Court has said,

585
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:25,941
uh,

586
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:29,570
this is a system of please
not a system of trials.

587
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:34,930
Most criminal cases from the most garden
variety misdemeanor shoplifting case to

588
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:37,970
the death penalty cases,

589
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,460
uh,

590
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,390
are going to be resolved
with plea bargaining.

591
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,591
Uh,

592
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:44,150
and so as I said,

593
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:46,220
these are the two most important,

594
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,030
uh,

595
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,863
decisions,

596
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,351
uh,

597
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:50,210
that are going to be made.

598
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,000
Uh,

599
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,530
and these are made in the complete
discretion of the prosecutor.

600
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:55,700
Uh,

601
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,533
often,

602
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:56,751
uh,

603
00:16:56,751 --> 00:17:00,290
they're going to turn on the policies
and the politics and the attitude,

604
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:00,990
uh,

605
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,030
of the prosecutor,

606
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,000
uh,

607
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,040
the prosecutor,

608
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,000
uh,

609
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,240
mean some will decide to resolve a case
with a plea bargain and some will say

610
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:08,990
there's no plea bargain.

611
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,170
We're going to trial and we're
going to get the death pounding,

612
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,311
uh,

613
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:14,420
and uh,

614
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,130
or they may make an offer.

615
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:16,730
Uh,

616
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,350
the prosecutor may say,

617
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,070
uh,

618
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:23,330
we're willing to give you
life imprisonment or life
imprisonment without parole.

619
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:23,781
Uh,

620
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:25,320
but the defendant rejects the plate.

621
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,250
Uh,

622
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,540
even though the prosecutor has decided
the case does not have to be a death

623
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,374
penalty case,

624
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:30,741
uh,

625
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:32,300
for the plea bargaining system to work,

626
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:36,980
the prosecutor has to go forward with
the threat and try and get the death.

627
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:37,450
Polly,

628
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:37,760
uh,

629
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,660
in the case,

630
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,410
uh,

631
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,580
just recently was looking at a case out
of Alabama in which the prosecutor had

632
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:48,320
offered the defendant eight to 10
years and the defendant didn't take it.

633
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,610
And so the prosecutor got the death poem,

634
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:51,510
uh,

635
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,920
as a result of the person's,

636
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,880
uh,

637
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,820
unwillingness to take a plea
bargain of eight to 10 years.

638
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,970
Obviously the death punny is a way in
which to pressure people to enter pleas of

639
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:02,611
guilty,

640
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:03,660
and it usually works.

641
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,320
Uh,

642
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,640
but as in that example,

643
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:06,720
when it doesn't work,

644
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,480
it results in a very harsh sentence,

645
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,141
uh,

646
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:13,050
for somebody who might
not have it otherwise.

647
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,700
No other country,

648
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,451
Aleks,

649
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:16,284
prosecutors,

650
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:16,840
uh,

651
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,510
that's unique to the United States.

652
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:22,110
This was an ad that Bob may see
ran when he was a long time,

653
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,480
a district attorney in Oklahoma City.

654
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:24,991
Uh,

655
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:26,640
he's running here on his record,

656
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,280
a 44 people sent to death row,

657
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,740
30,000 felons sent to prison,

658
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,310
uh,

659
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,670
15,000 juvenile gang crimes prosecuted,

660
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,571
uh,

661
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:37,680
and so forth.

662
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:38,490
Uh,

663
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,490
he'd returned $10 million of bogus
checks and fees to a innocent victims.

664
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:44,431
Uh,

665
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:46,020
so there are a lot of political,

666
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:46,710
uh,

667
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,990
as well as legal considerations.

668
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,560
Uh,

669
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,470
state prosecutors are elected
in judicial districts.

670
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,420
They're independent of each other.

671
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,171
Uh,

672
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:57,480
unlike in a European
system where there's a,

673
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,580
maybe an attorney general who then,

674
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,683
uh,

675
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,440
sets a policy for all
the local prosecutors.

676
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,251
Uh,

677
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:07,530
you can have prosecutors
right next door to each other,

678
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,161
uh,

679
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:13,050
in the United States who have completely
different policies with regard to all

680
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,680
sorts of things like auto stripping
and Manhattan and Brooklyn,

681
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:18,750
but also with regard to the death poly.

682
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,830
Uh,

683
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,640
so,

684
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:20,881
uh,

685
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:25,881
whether or not a person is in one county
or another may determine whether that's

686
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:30,510
going to be a death penalty case or not.

687
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,673
Uh,

688
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,551
for example,

689
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:33,690
there was a case and,

690
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:34,380
uh,

691
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:34,760
uh,

692
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,080
as unclear whether it
happened in Lexington,

693
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,040
uh,

694
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,590
county in South Carolina
or it was Columbia,

695
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,850
uh,

696
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,070
Lexington sends a lot
of people to death row.

697
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,150
Uh,

698
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,800
almost all white juries,

699
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,310
uh,

700
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,143
conservative,

701
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,840
uh,

702
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,673
Columbia,

703
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:49,980
uh,

704
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,611
very few,

705
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:54,750
almost no one sent to death row and
actually had to call in a surveyors to

706
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:58,500
determine which side of the
county line the crime happened on.

707
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,371
Uh,

708
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:00,810
and if it happened on one side,

709
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,610
it was almost definitely
going to be a death case.

710
00:20:02,611 --> 00:20:03,850
And if it wasn't it,

711
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,430
it was on the other side of the line,

712
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,080
it would not be prosecuted.

713
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,540
Uh,

714
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,760
as a death penalty case,

715
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,421
uh,

716
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:11,490
we see this with individual prosecutors,

717
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,391
many him,

718
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:12,781
Garvis,

719
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:15,660
Davies and Illinois had
been sentenced to death.

720
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:16,710
It got reversed.

721
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,360
The prosecutor said when it came back
that he was not going to seek the death

722
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:22,194
Polly,

723
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,310
but then he went out of office in a new
prosecutor came in and he decided to

724
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:29,580
seek the death penalty and he
did seek it and obtained it.

725
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,270
So just the question of who's
in office as a prosecutor?

726
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,290
And when we see
prosecutor's offices change,

727
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:36,750
uh,

728
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,750
we often see great changes in their
policy with regard to the death penalty.

729
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,830
And so for example,

730
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:44,664
in Houston,

731
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,040
when Johnny Holmes and Chuck,

732
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,390
where the district attorneys,

733
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:49,870
uh,

734
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,000
so many people were
being sentenced to death,

735
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,390
that Houston is actually
executed more people,

736
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:56,410
over a hundred people,

737
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,050
uh,

738
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:57,641
at one time,

739
00:20:57,641 --> 00:20:58,600
more than any state,

740
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,130
excel,

741
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,330
any state except Texas itself.

742
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,261
Uh,

743
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:02,860
and then,

744
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,341
uh,

745
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:04,420
in 2008,

746
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,320
uh,

747
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,030
judge Pat Lycos became the district
attorney and all of a sudden the number of

748
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:12,520
death sentences dropped
tremendously in Houston.

749
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:12,911
In fact,

750
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:15,580
now more death sentences
are imposed in Dallas,

751
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,361
uh,

752
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:17,560
then are imposed,

753
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,320
uh,

754
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:18,880
in,

755
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,750
in Houston.

756
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,470
But,

757
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:24,610
but what we see a lot of places is that
if a case is prosecuted in Houston,

758
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,770
at least during the Johnny Holmes and
Chuck Rosenthal era is probably going to

759
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,620
be a death case.

760
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,110
If that same case was
prosecuted in Dallas,

761
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,430
probably wouldn't be death case,

762
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,010
but at the same token of is
prosecuted in Philadelphia,

763
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,031
Lynn Abraham,

764
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:39,340
and she was the district attorney
there when for the death point,

765
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,660
virtually every case where,

766
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:41,560
where as possible.

767
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,690
But if the case was
prosecuted in Pittsburgh,

768
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,230
uh,

769
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,310
very little likelihood,

770
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,011
uh,

771
00:21:46,011 --> 00:21:50,020
that the death penalty would be imposed
because of the prosecutor in that case.

772
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,300
So it just raises a
question which I leave,

773
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:52,811
uh,

774
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,650
for you to think about.

775
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,970
How important is consistency is the fact
that different prosecutors in different

776
00:21:57,971 --> 00:22:02,440
parts of the state may have different
attitudes about the death pony,

777
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:05,320
different criteria for
seeking the death penalty.

778
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,513
Um,

779
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,030
is that something that's important or
do we leave that to the prosecutors in,

780
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:13,450
in each per a particular place?

781
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,390
And,

782
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,310
and do we,

783
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,910
by giving one person so much power,

784
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,020
uh,

785
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,270
is that subject to abuse,

786
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,473
uh,

787
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,720
isn't subject to race coming into play,

788
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:29,800
particularly when this decision is such
a subjective decision and is often made

789
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,850
by one person?

790
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,331
Well,

791
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:33,260
that's the issue that becomes a,

792
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,870
that we'll see raise later on.

793
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,501
Uh,

794
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:37,210
when we get to the question of,

795
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,260
uh,

796
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,440
racial discrimination and we
started seeing disparities,

797
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,200
uh,

798
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,210
and we say where,

799
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:44,770
who made these decisions?

800
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,660
These two most important decisions,

801
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:52,230
prosecutors are probably less accountable
than any other public officials in a

802
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:56,020
system where we have a lot
of checks and balances that,

803
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:56,260
uh,

804
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,093
uh,

805
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,740
limit a discretion of other,

806
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,230
uh,

807
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,063
actors,

808
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:01,690
uh,

809
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,523
in government,

810
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,550
uh,

811
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,380
that does not apply to prosecutors.

812
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,530
The judge cannot tell a prosecutor
you can't seek the death penalty.

813
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:09,370
In this case,

814
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:09,911
uh,

815
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:14,600
the judge cannot tell the prosecutor
to not to bring certain charges or,

816
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:18,340
or to make a certain plea offer if the
prosecutor decides in a death penalty

817
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:23,341
case that he or she wants the death
penalty and insists upon filing the notice

818
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:24,250
for it,

819
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:24,700
uh,

820
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,710
and pursuing it before a jury.

821
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:30,430
And if the jury returns
a capitol conviction,

822
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,070
uh,

823
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,860
and then makes the case to the jury,

824
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,350
if the jury imposes the death penalty,

825
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,720
then that's the penalty
that's going to be imposed.

826
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:40,930
The judge has no way really to
prevent that from happening.

827
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,651
Uh,

828
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:46,651
and we're so much power is exercised
a is in the plea bargaining process.

829
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,380
Uh,

830
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,090
there's virtually no way,

831
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:50,990
uh,

832
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,670
that an accused person can prevail
on a claim of selective prosecution.

833
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,470
There are often cases where it appears
that somebody is being prosecuted because

834
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:04,370
of their race or maybe because they
exercise their rights to free speech.

835
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,361
Uh,

836
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,194
and yet,

837
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:06,681
uh,

838
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:09,050
the supreme court has
said in a number of cases,

839
00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:14,051
you can only prevail if you can show
that the prosecution was because of that

840
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:15,794
fact,

841
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,120
not merely in spite of it,

842
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:18,080
but you were charged.

843
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,980
Because of your race are you,

844
00:24:19,981 --> 00:24:20,210
were,

845
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:25,210
you are sought the death penalty because
of your race or prosecuted because of

846
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:29,540
your exercise of your first
amendment rights to free speech.

847
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,231
Uh,

848
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:32,590
so what that really is meant is,

849
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,230
and the other thing is to
prove a prosecution claim,

850
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,150
a selective prosecution claim,

851
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:43,151
one almost has to have information that's
in the possession of the prosecutors.

852
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,740
And the courts have pretty
much said prosecutors,

853
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,250
uh,

854
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,070
do not have to give that information up.

855
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:49,880
Uh,

856
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,650
prosecutors have absolute immunity from
prosecution no matter what they do in a

857
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:58,130
case as long as it's in the
capacity of prosecuting the case.

858
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:58,680
Uh,

859
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,690
there are immune from being sued
for any misconduct that took place.

860
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:03,530
Uh,

861
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,150
John Thompson's case and,

862
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,140
uh,

863
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,370
out of Orleans parish,

864
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,350
Louisiana is a good example.

865
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,280
Uh,

866
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,790
Thompson came within weeks of being
executed even though there was a,

867
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:14,930
uh,

868
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,230
uh,

869
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,950
a lab report that showed that he could
not possibly have been the person who

870
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:19,790
committed the crime.

871
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:20,740
Uh,

872
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,630
it showed that the blood type was a
different type than Johnson's type,

873
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:25,040
the blood type of the perpetrator.

874
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,290
He brought a lawsuit.

875
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,730
He couldn't sue the prosecutors directly,

876
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,390
but he brought a lawsuit saying that
they hadn't been properly trained.

877
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,940
And then because the lack of training,

878
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,620
the parish of New Orleans and
the city were liable to him.

879
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:43,220
He won a $14 million verdict at trial,

880
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,840
which was upheld on appeal,

881
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,200
but then was reversed by the supreme
court in a case called chronic versus

882
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:49,034
Thompson,

883
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:49,400
uh,

884
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,380
which left him absolutely penniless in
terms of his recovery in that particular

885
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:55,190
case.

886
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,300
So prosecutors,

887
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,890
tremendous amount of power,

888
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,020
a tremendous amount of discretion,

889
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:00,700
uh,

890
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,500
and tremendous responsibilities
in these cases.

891
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:03,950
Uh,

892
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,880
very often the only investigation that's
going to be done in a criminal case is

893
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:10,970
going to be done by the law
enforcement and the prosecutor's.

894
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,860
It's just simply the defense is not going
to have the resources and the ability

895
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:16,970
to do it,

896
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:17,450
uh,

897
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,410
an investigation.

898
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,830
So prosecutors have a immense power,

899
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,581
uh,

900
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,500
and how they use it.

901
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:24,890
Uh,

902
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,110
we'll be seeing as we look at these cases,

903
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:27,710
uh,

904
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,250
that fall.
