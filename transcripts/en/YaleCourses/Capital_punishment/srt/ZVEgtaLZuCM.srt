1
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,540
Probably nothing is more critical to a
fair trial and reliable verdict on either

2
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,770
guilt or what penalty is imposed and
the fairness and the impartiality of the

3
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,000
judge presiding over a case.

4
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,030
We presume that a judge
is going to be fair,

5
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:31,140
that the judge is not going to be pro
prosecution and is not going to be a pro

6
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:31,974
defendant,

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,210
but it's going to call the,

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:33,900
uh,

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,940
legal issues that come up in the case.

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,500
What evidence to admit,

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,370
uh,

12
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,240
what evidence might be suppressed
because it was illegally seized or,

13
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:47,610
or Taegan how to instruct the jury that
all those decisions are going to be made

14
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,110
fairly and impartially.

15
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:49,740
Uh,

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,700
by the same token,

17
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:54,450
appellate judges are going to
review what happens at trial,

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:54,930
uh,

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,720
to decide if there's been
any error at the trial.

20
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,230
Uh,

21
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,230
that may require a reversal of
the conviction or the sentence.

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,380
Sometimes judges cannot
be fair and impartial.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,200
And I,

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,840
a lot of times that's going to be obvious.

25
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,711
Uh,

26
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:14,310
the judge is related to one of the
lawyers and one of the parties,

27
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,000
uh,

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,070
or for some other reason the judge,

29
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:17,700
uh,

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,980
disqualifies himself or herself.

31
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:23,640
And so no issue is ever
presented in the case,

32
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:28,470
but there are going to be cases where
the impartiality of the judge is going to

33
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:30,870
be a closely contested.

34
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,880
And we're look at a few of those cases,

35
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:33,420
uh,

36
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,400
today and how courts
tried to sort them out.

37
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,210
Uh,

38
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,210
Supreme Court has said that the right
to a fair and impartial judge means that

39
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:43,890
the judge should have no temptation,

40
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:44,620
uh,

41
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,640
to forget the burden of proof
and not hold the balance.

42
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,151
Nice,

43
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:48,661
clear,

44
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:49,494
true,

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:49,920
uh,

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,500
between the prosecution and the defense.

47
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,150
Uh,

48
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:58,150
another way of putting that is a judge
may be disqualified if the judge's

49
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:03,360
impartiality might reasonably
be questioned if an
objective person knowing all

50
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:04,530
the facts involved,

51
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,190
uh,

52
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,190
had a doubt about the
judge's impartiality.

53
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,000
Then that judge had step aside and
another judge who presided over the case

54
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,350
where there's absolutely no question
that the judge can be fair and impartial.

55
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,090
One of the first cases where this came
up was burger versus United States in

56
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:21,691
this case,

57
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:23,220
in the burger versus United States.

58
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:28,221
Case involved just land justice Landis
later to be the commissioner of baseball.

59
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,783
Uh,

60
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,900
the affidavit claim,

61
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,130
the judge Landis had said,

62
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:35,880
if anybody has anything worse
to say about the Germans,

63
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,740
or we'll say anything worse than I have,

64
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,530
I liked to know what it
is so I can use it myself.

65
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,190
Uh,

66
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,810
he said that German Americans,

67
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:43,250
uh,

68
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,250
hearts are reeking with disloyalty
and that he knew a safe blower,

69
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,111
uh,

70
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,300
that he had given nine years,

71
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:51,800
uh,

72
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,610
and is now a soldier in France.

73
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,181
Uh,

74
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:56,460
and as between him and the defendant,

75
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:57,420
in another case,

76
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:57,840
uh,

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,530
he would prefer the same floor.

78
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,071
Uh,

79
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:01,540
this comment was made,

80
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,141
uh,

81
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,120
at a time when there was a great deal of,

82
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:04,900
uh,

83
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,733
uh,

84
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,010
hostile feeling towards
Germany during World War One.

85
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,370
A lot of hostile feeling towards German
and people of German descent and Victor

86
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,560
Burger,

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,820
the defendant in this particular case
was of German descent and also was a

88
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:19,654
socialist,

89
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,081
uh,

90
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:21,400
actually elected to Congress,

91
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:21,971
uh,

92
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:22,900
as a socialist.

93
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:23,531
Uh,

94
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:24,221
and he,

95
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:24,930
and,

96
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,180
uh,

97
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,590
the codefendants in this case,

98
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:29,080
we're saying that with
these kinds of attitudes,

99
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,070
judge land is,

100
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:32,830
could be fair and impartial in their case.

101
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:33,911
Uh,

102
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:36,460
and so that affidavit has filed.

103
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:37,690
Judge Landis denies it,

104
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,550
refuses to take himself off the case.

105
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:40,960
That goes to the Supreme Court,

106
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,093
which says,

107
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:42,821
first of all,

108
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:44,920
with regard to deciding the question,

109
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,440
the affidavit must be presented
under penalty of perjury.

110
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,071
In other words,

111
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:55,750
if the person who says that judge land
has said these things is lying about it,

112
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,740
he or she can be prosecuted for
perjury or if it's a lawyer,

113
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,060
they can be disbarred.

114
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,330
And the court said that's going to be
some protection against frivolous efforts

115
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:07,900
to get judges off the case.

116
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:09,130
And it must state facts,

117
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,580
not,

118
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,960
not rumors or gossip,

119
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:14,350
but facts that show bias
on the part of the judge.

120
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,020
Uh,

121
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,150
the judge when getting an affidavit
like this and a motion to disqualify the

122
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:21,910
judge simply looks at the affidavit.

123
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,060
And based upon what it says and
assuming the facts to be true,

124
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,230
the judge can't say,

125
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,360
I deny every single fact.

126
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:30,580
You said here the judge looks at it.

127
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:35,380
And if it appears that the
judge's impartiality might
reasonably be questioned,

128
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:36,910
it's their responsibility to judge,

129
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,860
step off the case,

130
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,120
recused themselves,

131
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,590
and let another judge,

132
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,430
uh,

133
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,840
take over the case.

134
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,310
Go no further.

135
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,980
Let the case be assigned to another judge.

136
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:49,690
That's what the Supreme Court held here.

137
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,950
Uh,

138
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,950
the prosecution or the defense may
know of bias on the part of a judge.

139
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,530
The judges also have a duty to disclose
any bias under the code of judicial

140
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:03,071
conduct,

141
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:05,470
which this is the Aba model code.

142
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,041
Now,

143
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,560
each state has its own version of this,

144
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:09,880
but there's not much difference.

145
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:15,150
A rule two point 11 says the judge would
disqualify himself or herself in any

146
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:21,100
proceedings in which the
judge's impartiality might
reasonably be questioned

147
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,120
what I've talked about.

148
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:26,470
So the judge has the first
responsibility to disqualify.

149
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,630
If the judge doesn't disqualify,

150
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,990
then the affidavit is file,

151
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:32,170
like the one in burger
versus United States.

152
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,700
The judge passes upon it.

153
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,460
The procedure may be very different,

154
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,060
uh,

155
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,200
in the state courts,

156
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:38,861
uh,

157
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:41,290
where there may be a
hearing by another judge,

158
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,490
there may be evidence taken,

159
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:46,570
there may be more development of the
record and some determination of the truth

160
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:48,220
or false,

161
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,220
a falsity of the allegations.

162
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:51,820
Uh,

163
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,190
but that's going to vary
from place to place,

164
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,091
uh,

165
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:55,924
among,

166
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,140
uh,

167
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:01,140
so what kind of disqualifying by biases
might adjudge have a personal opinion?

168
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,660
The judge has already
made up his or her mind.

169
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,410
Somebody supported the judge and
the campaign gave a lot of money.

170
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,490
Maybe it was the judge's campaign manager
and is now the lawyer for one side.

171
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,151
Uh,

172
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:19,151
one case involved a claim
of race discrimination and
the judge made the comment

173
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:20,000
outside of court,

174
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:20,390
well,

175
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,090
I know that person and that
person would never discriminate.

176
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:23,721
Well,

177
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:24,680
if the judge thinks that,

178
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:26,870
then the judge shouldn't
be sitting on that case.

179
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:30,770
And so another judge a w would decide
that case because that personal

180
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:31,610
relationship,

181
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,330
uh,

182
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,360
sometimes the judges have
knowledge of the facts,

183
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,230
uh,

184
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,970
such as being a witness or otherwise
knowing facts about the case which might

185
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,830
disqualify them.

186
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,490
Uh,

187
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,040
usually this has to be
extra judicial knowledge,

188
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,150
not knowledge the judge gained
in presiding over the case,

189
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,270
but knowledge the judge has from outside,

190
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:53,690
uh,

191
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,300
which is not properly considered.

192
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:56,720
Uh,

193
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,620
in the case,

194
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,100
uh,

195
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,900
misconduct during the trial,

196
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:00,490
uh,

197
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,490
very seldom is a case going to be
reversed because of a judge's misconduct

198
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,411
during the trial.

199
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:10,040
That is the judge berates one
lawyer humiliates the lawyer,

200
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:10,461
uh,

201
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:12,110
rules against the lawyer all the time.

202
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:12,560
The,

203
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,910
the remedy for that,

204
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,740
the courts say most of the
time is to appeal a conviction.

205
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,320
Uh,

206
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,910
but that may be a very unsatisfactory
remedy because of court of appeals may

207
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:23,900
very well say,

208
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:24,591
well,

209
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:27,380
what the judge did was improper and wrong,

210
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,670
but it wasn't harmful enough that
we're going to reverse the conviction.

211
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,631
So they're,

212
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:37,631
the defendant is with no relief
for what happened during the trial.

213
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,283
Um,

214
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,210
pecuniary interest a,

215
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,160
this is the probably the easiest one.

216
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:45,020
If a judge gets some
money out of the deal,

217
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:49,520
then obviously a judge can't
really be fair and impartial.

218
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,360
Some cases where the judges
would give part of the fine.

219
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,140
So a defendant comes before
the judge on a traffic matter,

220
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:57,860
say,

221
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,400
and if the judge imposes a,

222
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:00,140
a fine,

223
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,360
a percentage of the
fine goes to the judge.

224
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,550
A supreme court says you can't do that.

225
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,060
Uh,

226
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,290
because obviously the judge
has an incentive to find
people guilty and find them

227
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,910
since the judge is getting a cut of
whatever fines are being brought in.

228
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:14,661
Uh,

229
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,220
in the Ed and the life insurance,

230
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,270
a case,

231
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,500
it was a little bit different.

232
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:19,900
It was a case about,

233
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,420
uh,

234
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,500
insurance companies,

235
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:21,920
uh,

236
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,450
and one of the judges on the Alabama
Supreme Court got a pretty good settlement

237
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:29,270
in a case as a result
of that very decision.

238
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,890
And the Supreme Court said,

239
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:31,101
no,

240
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:36,101
that violates due process because the
judge had to direct the culinary benefit,

241
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,070
uh,

242
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,851
from the case.

243
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,780
That's not going to be the case
in criminal cases generally.

244
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,003
Um,

245
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,670
want to talk a little
bit about racial bias,

246
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:47,690
which is one other,

247
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,620
uh,

248
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,590
kind of bias that is
not raised a whole lot,

249
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:54,950
but it is often present in cases in the
morning to look at a couple of three

250
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,850
cases here where it was raised.

251
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:57,481
Uh,

252
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:59,220
it may be behavior off the bench,

253
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:04,221
such as the Louisiana judge who wore
blackface to a Halloween party a and said

254
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:07,080
he didn't mean to offend anyone.

255
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:07,890
Uh,

256
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,330
but he was sent to a,

257
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:09,780
uh,

258
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,350
uh,

259
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,250
some sort of sensitivity class
and was allowed to become a judge.

260
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:14,900
Uh,

261
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,850
the judge in North Carolina
who made a lot of racist jokes,

262
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,421
uh,

263
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:19,830
had to step down as chief judge,

264
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:24,831
but continued to stay on the bench as a
judge despite questions raised about the

265
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,040
judge's ability to be fair and
impartial in cases involving,

266
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:29,641
uh,

267
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:32,910
African American defendants
peak versus Florida,

268
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:33,691
uh,

269
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:38,691
was a case in which the Florida Supreme
Court after reversing the case for a era

270
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:42,990
that took place during
the sentencing phase,

271
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:47,991
the trial noted that the
judge in referring to the
defendant's family had used a

272
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,400
racial slur,

273
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,120
uh,

274
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,230
in describing them.

275
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,311
Uh,

276
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:54,240
and the court said,

277
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:55,710
just for future guidance,

278
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:56,611
uh,

279
00:09:56,611 --> 00:10:00,480
we're telling judges that you should
avoid the appearance of impropriety.

280
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,560
Uh,

281
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,430
this judge,

282
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,120
had he been a sportscaster or had he
been some prominent public figure,

283
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,270
would almost certainly have lost his job.

284
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,070
But as a judge,

285
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:14,880
uh,

286
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,590
he is just simply told,

287
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:20,010
keep your racist thoughts to yourself,

288
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,611
uh,

289
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:23,430
and tomorrow and the next
day and every day from now.

290
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:28,410
And he can preside over cases despite
having shown this racial bias.

291
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:32,640
In this one particular case where
there are two cases out of Missouri,

292
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,410
both decided the same year,

293
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,340
uh,

294
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,470
state versus smalls and
state versus Kender,

295
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:37,980
uh,

296
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,690
both involve issues of race,

297
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,510
racial bias on the part of the judges.

298
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,501
In one case,

299
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:45,000
the Missouri Supreme Court fines,

300
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:45,870
racial bias.

301
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,300
And in the other case it doesn't.

302
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,940
Let's take a look at those cases and
whether there's a difference in what

303
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,774
happened.

304
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,081
Uh,

305
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:53,040
the first case,

306
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:53,581
uh,

307
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:58,581
was smalls here you had judge Karagan
who is presiding over the jury selection

308
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:05,610
process and the defense lawyer is making
an assertion that the prosecution is

309
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:08,310
striking jurors on the basis of race.

310
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,320
And so the defense lawyer wants
to make a record of every person.

311
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:16,770
The prosecutor struck whether
that person was black or white.

312
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,100
And when the defense lawyer as the
judge to note that one juror is African

313
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:23,260
American,

314
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,030
the judge says,

315
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,830
I don't know what it is to be black.

316
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:26,400
Uh,

317
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,200
I don't know what constitute black.

318
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:28,771
Uh,

319
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,780
there's some dark complected
people and the jury,

320
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,700
but I don't know if that
makes them black or not.

321
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:33,534
I don't know.

322
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,021
Uh,

323
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:37,440
what constitutes is by years ago
they used to say one drop of blood,

324
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:37,980
uh,

325
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,980
constitutes black smallest raises
this on appeal saying the judges just

326
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:49,071
qualified because these remarks that
were made in responding to this,

327
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,910
she'll racial bias,

328
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,391
uh,

329
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:53,530
on the part a of the judge,

330
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,850
a judge white rights for the majority
of the only African American on the

331
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,290
Missouri Supreme Court.

332
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,921
Uh,

333
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:01,420
and frames the question this way,

334
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:06,421
whether there's an objective basis upon
which a reasonable person could have a

335
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:12,151
doubt about the racial impartiality of
the trial judge in this particular case,

336
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:13,600
uh,

337
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,590
points out that,

338
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,190
uh,

339
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:20,190
the context of this statement that was
made was in the midst of a race centered

340
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:22,000
issue.

341
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,500
In fact,

342
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,830
the issue here was,

343
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,310
was there discrimination
against black people?

344
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,533
Uh,

345
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,800
and also,

346
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:30,461
uh,

347
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:34,600
the descending opinion accuses
the majority being hypersensitive.

348
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,060
But justice white judge white says,

349
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:37,451
ah,

350
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:42,180
this is just simply acknowledging
that prejudice is very often subtle.

351
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:42,301
It,

352
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:44,920
it's not as blatant as it used to be.

353
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,371
A,

354
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:49,930
but when we see this kind of coded
language used and see the judge obviously

355
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:53,260
resistant to a supreme court decision,

356
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:56,860
which had said that there couldn't
be discrimination against blacks,

357
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,060
and he's basically saying,

358
00:12:58,061 --> 00:12:59,380
I don't even know what black is.

359
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:03,190
I don't know how we can tell who's
black and who's white in this situation.

360
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:04,240
Given the context,

361
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,410
given what the judge said,

362
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:06,640
the one drop of blood,

363
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,683
all of that,

364
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,990
the judge is disqualified
from any further proceedings.

365
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,130
In this case,

366
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,450
a judge limbo,

367
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:14,284
descents,

368
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:14,950
uh,

369
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,410
he says the trial judge's insensitive,

370
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,510
but he's not racially biased.

371
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,720
This is what often is the response
to claims of racial bias that it's

372
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:26,140
insensitivity.

373
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,340
Uh,

374
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,630
and uh,

375
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,660
limbo says the judge was just having
difficulty figuring out who was black and

376
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:35,080
who was white,

377
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,770
uh,

378
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,060
in the jury pool.

379
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,493
Um,

380
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:39,881
the next case,

381
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:40,870
the Kender case,

382
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,531
uh,

383
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:43,510
Brian Kender that justice limbo.

384
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:48,511
We'll be writing a and we will see that
much of what the court said in smalls is

385
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:52,750
going to be a set aside or,

386
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,110
or,

387
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,450
or the law in this area
is going to be rewritten.

388
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,070
A just a short time later,

389
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,730
uh,

390
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,780
with judge,

391
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,500
uh,

392
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,640
limbo in the majority.

393
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,240
Here's what happened in kinder kinder's
about to go to trial and a death penalty

394
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:05,074
case.

395
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,740
Uh,

396
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,000
six days,

397
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,780
Brian kinders and African American,

398
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,260
six days before trial,

399
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,030
the trial judge,

400
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,010
Judge Blackbaud beside announces that
he is changing political parties.

401
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,280
He's running for reelection that year
and he says that he is switching from the

402
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:29,041
democratic to the Republican parties
because the Democratic Party places too

403
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:33,340
much emphasis on minorities
such as homosexuals,

404
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,230
people who don't want to work and people
whose skin is any color but white.

405
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:43,770
And he says it's time for us to place
much more emphasis on the hardworking

406
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,930
taxpayers in this country.

407
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,293
Uh,

408
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,031
Kender says,

409
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:49,551
wait a minute,

410
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:52,970
and I'm facing trial six days from now.

411
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,890
The judge is basically said that the
Democratic Party represents homosexuals.

412
00:14:57,891 --> 00:15:01,280
People don't want to work and people
whose skin is any colored black,

413
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,151
uh,

414
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,780
and suggesting that he has
for the hardworking taxpayers.

415
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:06,740
Uh,

416
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,010
this suggests an appeal to race,

417
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,960
which shows the racial bias and
therefore he should be disqualified.

418
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:15,531
Again,

419
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:18,590
context is important
here because head this,

420
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,030
a press release been issued
it no significant time,

421
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:23,631
uh,

422
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,880
it might've been seen
as a bit distasteful,

423
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:26,240
but,

424
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,511
but,

425
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:28,670
but not as relevant to a legal issue.

426
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:31,850
But here it's issue just six
days before a capital trial.

427
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,201
Well,

428
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:33,034
as I said,

429
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:33,410
ah,

430
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,900
now judge Limbaugh's writing,

431
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,390
uh,

432
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,420
for the majority and he says
recusal was not required.

433
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:43,690
One because we presume the judges act
with honesty and integrity and making

434
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:45,554
their decision.

435
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,500
Judge Black Wall had said at one point,

436
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,071
uh,

437
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:53,450
that everybody is absolutely entitled
to their constitutional rights,

438
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:54,890
whether they're yellow,

439
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:55,371
red,

440
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,080
white or Polka dot,

441
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,560
which may be suggested a
certain amount of sarcasm there.

442
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,480
Uh,

443
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,410
according to judge Limba,

444
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:03,920
uh,

445
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,410
the judge did in fact give a fair trial.

446
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:07,670
So he was true to his word.

447
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:08,870
He gave a fair trial.

448
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:09,571
Uh,

449
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:14,571
and in this distinction that the press
release that was issued was a political

450
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:16,190
act,

451
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,450
that it was not a judicial act but a
political act and therefore it didn't come

452
00:16:20,451 --> 00:16:21,284
into play.

453
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,383
Uh,

454
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:27,450
and the limbo now wants to distinguish
the smallest case by saying the reason

455
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:33,290
the judge and smalls was disqualified
was because he wouldn't follow the law.

456
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,571
Because in,

457
00:16:34,571 --> 00:16:36,380
in this race discrimination case,

458
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,020
he wouldn't recognize the race of a juror,

459
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,233
uh,

460
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,050
and wouldn't follow the law.

461
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,220
A judge,

462
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,830
judge white who wrote smalls
takes issue with that.

463
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,310
Uh,

464
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,300
in his dissent,

465
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,370
he calls the press release a
pernicious racial stereotype,

466
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,170
race baiting nonsense,

467
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:54,651
uh,

468
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:57,560
suggesting that minorities
are not hardworking people.

469
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,281
Uh,

470
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:00,920
and that you can't disregard this,

471
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:01,520
uh,

472
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,120
just simply because the judge
says that he can be fair.

473
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,640
Judges will often say they can be fair.

474
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:12,350
The question is whether a
reasonable person looking
at the facts would think the

475
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:14,810
judge did or did not harbor any bias.

476
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,830
Chris would kinders worried about is
that the judge running for reelection,

477
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:24,010
having now a changed political parties
may be tempted and remember that that

478
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:25,700
standard,

479
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,640
whether the temptation
is not to hold a balance,

480
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:28,971
nice,

481
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:31,280
true and clear between the
defendant in the state,

482
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:36,470
whether there's now a temptation to use
this capital trial and the rulings in

483
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:39,260
this capital trial in a way
that will help the judges,

484
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:39,710
uh,

485
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,850
political fortunes.

486
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,093
Um,

487
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:47,330
he also says the majority mischaracterizes
his opinion and smalls that it wasn't

488
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:49,660
about a willingness to follow the law.

489
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,900
It was that a judge be free from the
appearance of racial prejudice against a

490
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:58,660
defendant or any racial group.

491
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:04,110
You also suggest that what Judge Blackwell
did in issuing this pressure release

492
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,160
was perhaps more egregious than
what happened in smalls and smalls.

493
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,730
The judge has an outburst in
the middle of jury selection.

494
00:18:12,731 --> 00:18:13,870
When the lawyer says,

495
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,710
uh,

496
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:19,690
I want you to recognize that this juror
is black and the judge goes off and

497
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:19,901
says,

498
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:22,390
I don't know what black
is and goes into that,

499
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,230
uh,

500
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,000
those words we looked at a moment ago.

501
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,380
Whereas here,

502
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,190
uh,

503
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,570
this is a press release,

504
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,471
a,

505
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:30,970
this is an appeal to the voters.

506
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:32,560
This is something that's put together,

507
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:33,520
that's proof read,

508
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:35,020
that's a refined,

509
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:35,591
uh,

510
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:37,480
and then announced at a press conference,

511
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:38,380
uh,

512
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,290
and is actually a stronger indication.

513
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,390
Justice White's suggests then,

514
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,543
um,

515
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,070
the,

516
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,240
the what happened and,

517
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:47,074
and smalls,

518
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:47,740
uh,

519
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,880
but he's all by himself,

520
00:18:48,881 --> 00:18:53,140
just as white as all by himself
and dissent in this case.

521
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,830
So these cases are decided
by the Missouri Court,

522
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,910
uh,

523
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,750
and um,

524
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,740
do not see this kind of
issue come up very often,

525
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,460
uh,

526
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,290
but probably should be raised,

527
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:05,950
uh,

528
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,783
more often.

529
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,750
Uh,

530
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,220
this brings us to our next issue,

531
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:11,890
which is political pressures on judges.

532
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:12,641
Uh,

533
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:16,480
our political acts and
political considerations,

534
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,633
uh,

535
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,823
uh,

536
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,450
separate from judicial acts
and the federal courts.

537
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:24,190
The judges are appointed by the president,

538
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:27,190
United States and subject to
confirmation by the Senate.

539
00:19:27,191 --> 00:19:29,020
Once they're confirmed there,

540
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,820
they have their jobs for life.

541
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,630
They may be ambitious and they may want
to move to a higher court or they may

542
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,800
want some other,

543
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,180
uh,

544
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,470
political advancement,

545
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,370
but at least they are secure
in the jobs they have not.

546
00:19:42,371 --> 00:19:46,210
So in the state courts in the state
courts or judges run for election every

547
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:46,570
four,

548
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,403
six years.

549
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,590
Some states the judges are
up for retention election.

550
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,880
That is just a vote,

551
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:52,990
yes or no,

552
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,870
whether to keep that
judge in office or not,

553
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,750
or judges run head on.

554
00:19:58,751 --> 00:20:00,910
And states like Alabama and Texas,

555
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,600
uh,

556
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,370
judges run under party labels,

557
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:03,971
Democrat,

558
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:04,804
Republican,

559
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,531
uh,

560
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:06,550
against each other.

561
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,390
Uh,

562
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:12,390
and as we will see where the full array
of campaign advertisements which are

563
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,500
growing and growing and growing,

564
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,270
as the amount of money funneled
into judicial campaigns increases,

565
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:19,990
uh,

566
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,270
with every election cycle.

567
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,140
Uh,

568
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,973
so,

569
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:24,520
uh,

570
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,750
before one election,

571
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,530
uh,

572
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,410
voters in Alabama saw this advertisement,

573
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:34,411
which involved a young lawyer
who's getting a call from
the chief justice of the

574
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:35,913
State Supreme Court.

575
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,390
Tom Is Chief Justice Warren.

576
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,770
Judge Warren's been well,

577
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:45,481
good morning to you,

578
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:46,314
sir.

579
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:52,130
You won't bond $500 for you campaign
from each member of the phone.

580
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,830
Well,

581
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,411
now you know,

582
00:20:55,411 --> 00:20:55,741
judge,

583
00:20:55,741 --> 00:20:58,050
we do have a case panning and your court,

584
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,753
it doesn't matter.

585
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,553
Yes sir.

586
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,390
I'll get the money up to you right away,

587
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:04,683
sir.

588
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:06,470
Well,

589
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:11,030
I'd imagine that it would be a little
disturbing to people to think of judges,

590
00:21:11,031 --> 00:21:15,380
whether it be the chief judge or any other
judge dialing a lawyer who has a case

591
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,260
before that judge for
money for their campaign.

592
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:18,920
Uh,

593
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,150
but today it's quite frequent.

594
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:20,871
In fact,

595
00:21:20,871 --> 00:21:25,100
today it's not unusual for
a camp candidate for a state
Supreme Court to have a

596
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:25,934
fundraiser,

597
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,300
uh,

598
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,190
sponsored by prominent lawyers who have
cases before that judge for the judge to

599
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:32,000
come.

600
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,820
Sometimes the fundraisers
are held at law firms,

601
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:35,391
uh,

602
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:36,230
or maybe held,

603
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,130
uh,

604
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:37,881
somewhere else,

605
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:41,690
but the judge may calm and shake
hands and thank people for making the

606
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:42,501
contribution.

607
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:45,760
So there's no secret about
who is supporting that.

608
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:48,200
These committees of people,

609
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:52,790
usually prominent lawyers from all
different walks of life who are supporting

610
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:53,624
the judge.

611
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,140
Uh,

612
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,180
so the question comes when you,

613
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,320
when you have that kind
of financial support,

614
00:22:00,321 --> 00:22:02,300
that kind of public support for the judge,

615
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,690
can a judge still be fair and impartial?

616
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,180
Uh,

617
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,670
and judges are generally going to face
far greater attacks than what chief

618
00:22:10,671 --> 00:22:12,140
justice Hornsby faced.

619
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,741
Uh,

620
00:22:12,741 --> 00:22:16,880
it's not just going to be a matter of
whether they solicited cane being called

621
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:18,770
out for soliciting campaign funds.

622
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,490
Uh,

623
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,450
the generally,

624
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,171
uh,

625
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:25,160
it's going to be about decisions
the judges made in criminal cases.

626
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,250
Very often these cases are really,

627
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:33,110
are these elections are really a fight
between the business community that it's

628
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:37,850
interested on caps on punitive
damages and civil cases,

629
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,020
uh,

630
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,500
or,

631
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,900
or other civil matters.

632
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,610
And between the plaintiff's Bar,

633
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,361
uh,

634
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:47,750
which does none of that is the lawyers
representing people who are suing

635
00:22:47,751 --> 00:22:50,870
insurance companies or
businesses or whoever,

636
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,330
and they're trying to win
as much money as they can.

637
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,740
But the campaigns aren't about that.

638
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,570
The campaigns are most often
about issues of criminal justice.

639
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,681
And A,

640
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:02,030
we're looking at one,

641
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:02,870
uh,

642
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,703
penny white,

643
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:04,280
uh,

644
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,260
voted off the Tennessee Supreme Court.

645
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:06,980
Uh,

646
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,760
this was a retention election in
which shortly before the election,

647
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,270
uh,

648
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,103
suddenly,

649
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,650
uh,

650
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:17,540
people started to get mail that said
that penny white had voted to free,

651
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,261
uh,

652
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:19,640
this man,

653
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,360
uh,

654
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,760
Odom who had committed this awful crime.

655
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:23,301
In fact,

656
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,980
the court had not freed him.

657
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:29,090
It had just simply reversed his death
since and sent the case back for a re

658
00:23:29,091 --> 00:23:31,730
sentencing where he was
against sentence to death.

659
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,850
But judges had been voted off
the courts a number of times,

660
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,460
particularly for their votes
in death penalty cases.

661
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,000
Uh,

662
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,530
three in California in 1986 and since
then on the Texas Court of Criminal

663
00:23:42,531 --> 00:23:43,364
Appeals,

664
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:43,620
uh,

665
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,440
the Mississippi Supreme
Court Justice White,

666
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,400
uh,

667
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,370
and of course locally
that has happened as well.

668
00:23:50,371 --> 00:23:52,560
A trial judge in a local community,

669
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:54,420
maybe three or four counties,

670
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,350
uh,

671
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:00,350
has to know that if he or she makes a
controversial ruling or an unpopular

672
00:24:00,361 --> 00:24:01,190
rolling,

673
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,441
uh,

674
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:02,460
in a death penalty case,

675
00:24:02,461 --> 00:24:04,830
it could very well cost him the election,

676
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,401
uh,

677
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:05,701
when,

678
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:08,430
when they run for reelection,

679
00:24:08,431 --> 00:24:13,431
that if they rule in favor of
a defendant in a capital case,

680
00:24:13,441 --> 00:24:15,990
no matter how clear the law is,

681
00:24:15,991 --> 00:24:17,490
that that ruling is required.

682
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:18,350
Uh,

683
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,350
they may be signing their own political
death warrant if they do that.

684
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:23,803
Uh,

685
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,430
2010 chief justice of Illinois was
on the ballot for retention election.

686
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:31,080
A yes or no election.

687
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:31,621
Uh,

688
00:24:31,621 --> 00:24:36,621
business interests a raised about
$670,000 for the campaign against him.

689
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,520
Uh,

690
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,240
but the campaign wasn't about business
interest as as we'll see in a moment.

691
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:42,800
Uh,

692
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,431
Kale Brides,

693
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:46,050
a committee raised 2.8 million.

694
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:51,110
1.4 of that came from the Democratic
Party at about a 460,000 from the,

695
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,380
uh,

696
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,030
Illinois Federation of teachers.

697
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,193
Uh,

698
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,200
quite a bit of money spent on a retention
election and most of it went into 32nd

699
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:02,860
ads.

700
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,390
Uh,

701
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,330
there were many ads and
many ads about crime,

702
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,780
but here are some actors portraying,

703
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,980
uh,

704
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,270
inmates in prison.

705
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,580
And one of the ads that was run against,

706
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,180
uh,

707
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,770
chief justice Kilbride.

708
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:22,280
I was convicted of stabbing victims
with a kitchen knife or shooting my ex

709
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:25,850
girlfriend and murdering her sister in
front of our child of sexual assault on a

710
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:27,200
mom and her 10 year old daughter.

711
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,430
And I slashed her throat.

712
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,420
It's on appeal.

713
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:33,890
Justice Thomas Kilbride side with
us over law enforcement or victims.

714
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,800
Other judges overruled Kilbride
in our appeals were denied.

715
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,030
Kilbride chose criminals
rights over and over again.

716
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,130
We more than any other justice.

717
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,000
No.

718
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,370
On retention of Thomas Kilbride vote down,

719
00:25:45,371 --> 00:25:45,910
bounce.

720
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,960
It's a top priority.

721
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,700
Kilbride had many ads run against him
saying that he put a criminals over.

722
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,340
Victims are criminals over other people.

723
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:57,851
Uh,

724
00:25:57,851 --> 00:25:59,830
the next dad was running
against Louis Butler,

725
00:25:59,831 --> 00:26:03,580
the old way African American
on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

726
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,181
Uh,

727
00:26:04,181 --> 00:26:07,690
and look for the racial
implications of this ad.

728
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,793
Again,

729
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,010
uh,

730
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:14,010
the sort of a theme that ran through the
campaign against Butler was that he was

731
00:26:14,051 --> 00:26:15,190
loophole Louis,

732
00:26:15,191 --> 00:26:19,320
that he always found a loophole
to get criminals off on

733
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,710
unbelievable shadowy special interest
supporting Louis Butler are attacking

734
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:25,760
judge Michael Gable woman.

735
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,773
It's not true.

736
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,920
Judge District Attorney Michael Gable
make has committed his life to loving up

737
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:31,341
criminals,

738
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:32,420
to keep families safe,

739
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,400
putting child molesters behind bars.

740
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:35,510
For over a hundred years,

741
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,680
Louis Butler worked to put criminals on
the street like Reuben Lee Mitchell who

742
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,290
raped an 11 year old girl
with learning disabilities.

743
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,590
Butler found a loophole.

744
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,260
Mitchell went on to molest another child.

745
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,920
Can Wisconsin families feel safe with
Louis Butler on the Supreme Court?

746
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,070
This was a very misleading ad.

747
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,000
Uh,

748
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Butler did not rule on Mitchell's case
as a member of the Wisconsin Supreme

749
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:02,060
Court.

750
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,650
He had represented Mitchell when
he was a public defender long ago,

751
00:27:06,651 --> 00:27:11,360
early in his career before he
became a member of the court.

752
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,433
Second,

753
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,110
Mitchell did not get off on a loophole.

754
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,200
He served his entire sentence,

755
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:18,860
uh,

756
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,693
in prison.

757
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,740
And also notice at the end of that add
the merger of the faces of Reuben Lee

758
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,010
Mitchell,

759
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,680
the criminal with Louis Butler,

760
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,680
both black men both wearing glasses.

761
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,590
And this sort of almost like butler,

762
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,191
uh,

763
00:27:34,191 --> 00:27:37,970
is a personification or the
representation of Mitchell,

764
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:38,750
uh,

765
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,000
to the voters of Wisconsin.

766
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,340
A gay woman,

767
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,100
uh,

768
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,720
beat Butler in this election,

769
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:45,501
uh,

770
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:47,930
and now sits on the
Wisconsin Supreme Court.

771
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,273
Uh,

772
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:54,630
will these kinds of ads raise lots
of questions about how judges behave,

773
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,120
both what influence it has on their,

774
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,283
uh,

775
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,330
seeking office,

776
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,730
what they're willing to
promise to get office.

777
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,130
And there are two things that
we're concerned about here.

778
00:28:07,131 --> 00:28:07,580
One,

779
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,990
how do we get the best judges?

780
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:09,711
Uh,

781
00:28:09,711 --> 00:28:13,470
are we better off for the
nominating commission that
tries to just select people

782
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:14,930
on the UN on the basis of merit?

783
00:28:14,931 --> 00:28:17,660
They're always going to be politics
involved and there will be there too.

784
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,410
Uh,

785
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,690
but that's a system that some states have.

786
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,740
Uh,

787
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,570
or are we better off with a,

788
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,141
uh,

789
00:28:24,141 --> 00:28:27,800
an election system in which anybody can
run for judge and we have a knockdown

790
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,820
drag out campaign.

791
00:28:28,821 --> 00:28:33,010
It's pretty much decided on the basis of
32nd ads at least statewide campaigns.

792
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,230
Sorry.

793
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:36,440
Now that wouldn't be as true
for a local judicial election.

794
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:41,000
But the second question is how
once a person is on the bench,

795
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:42,140
however they got there,

796
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:47,590
how do we make it possible for the judge
to decide the case on the law to decide

797
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:49,970
the case based on the law,

798
00:28:49,971 --> 00:28:54,971
without any fear that if the judge calls
it as the law requires that the judge

799
00:28:56,841 --> 00:28:58,910
is going to remain an office and has the,

800
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,900
uh,

801
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:00,221
the,

802
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:01,070
the protection,

803
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:01,790
uh,

804
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,350
that an unpopular ruling,

805
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:03,700
uh,

806
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,900
will not be a basis for,

807
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,590
uh,

808
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,330
being voted out of office.

809
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,220
Judges are not like legislators,

810
00:29:10,221 --> 00:29:10,911
presidents,

811
00:29:10,911 --> 00:29:15,530
other people who are supposed to represent
the public will a responsibility of,

812
00:29:15,531 --> 00:29:18,500
of judges to uphold the law
even when it's unpopular,

813
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,180
a free speech.

814
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:23,630
And even when somebody hasn't
very unpopular thing to say,

815
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:27,830
the judge's responsibility is to
say under the First Amendment,

816
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:29,210
the United States constitution,

817
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:34,220
you have a right to say these things
are to parade in this area or to publish

818
00:29:34,221 --> 00:29:34,971
this newspaper,

819
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:35,870
whatever it may be.

820
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,250
And by the same token,

821
00:29:37,251 --> 00:29:38,390
in criminal cases,

822
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,720
when there's a tremendous amount of the
and the prejudices of the moment coming

823
00:29:44,101 --> 00:29:45,600
into the judicial process,

824
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:50,810
it's the judge's responsibility to hold
back those forces to grant the change of

825
00:29:51,181 --> 00:29:52,014
venue,

826
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,320
uh,

827
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,730
maybe to another jurisdiction,

828
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:54,630
although that may,

829
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,800
that may make the judges constituents
unhappy because they wanted to decide that

830
00:29:58,801 --> 00:30:03,801
case or to continue the case until a
later time after some of the passion has

831
00:30:04,351 --> 00:30:05,190
died down,

832
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,190
a number of decisions that
judges are going to be made,

833
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:08,670
uh,

834
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,420
making,

835
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:09,661
uh,

836
00:30:09,661 --> 00:30:12,060
that may or may not be
influenced by politics.

837
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:12,990
Well,

838
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,130
I'll end this series of ads
with one of the most upbeat ads,

839
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:16,600
uh,

840
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,910
that's running the last few years.

841
00:30:17,911 --> 00:30:19,020
This was sue bell cob,

842
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:23,040
a running for chief justice
of the Alabama Supreme Court

843
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:24,800
Zoo.

844
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,540
Bill Cobb was raised in Evergreen,

845
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:30,350
Alabama and sue bill
cubs values her faith,

846
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,260
her family shine brighter every day.

847
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,670
She graduated at the top of her class and
with honors from law school and became

848
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:41,980
judge sue Belcamp,

849
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:45,170
a pioneer for women judges
and Alabama history.

850
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,140
She put thousands of criminals in jail.

851
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,970
Per House was fire bombed,

852
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,730
but judge sue bell carb
only grew stronger,

853
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,900
more determined.

854
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,140
She served 40 counties and today
judge Sue Bell Club decides life.

855
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,320
While all those years
outside the courtroom,

856
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,680
judge sue bell Cobb became
a state and national leader,

857
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,650
a reformer helping
children stay out of jail.

858
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,230
The southern woman kind and caring,

859
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,170
strong and determined.

860
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:20,810
Judge Sue Bell copic is
our chief justice should be

861
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,830
pretty good advertisement
for use in the Bible belt.

862
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,790
Uh,

863
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,900
also as I said,

864
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:32,990
one of the few positive
advertisements and that year,

865
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,040
uh,

866
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,930
on the entire Ballard in Alabama,

867
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:40,070
the only Democrat who got elected
to anything with Subo Cobb,

868
00:31:40,071 --> 00:31:42,440
who got elected chief justice of Alabama,

869
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,320
she later a retired as chief justice,

870
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:47,510
but she did a win that election.

871
00:31:47,511 --> 00:31:49,160
So at times,

872
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:49,560
uh,

873
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,810
a positive approach,

874
00:31:50,811 --> 00:31:52,820
although there were plenty
of negative ads as well,

875
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,300
uh,

876
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,790
that ran in that election cycle.

877
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,510
Uh,

878
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:56,931
but,

879
00:31:56,931 --> 00:31:57,760
uh,

880
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,100
uh,

881
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:03,100
that ad was seen as having played a big
role in her success as being elected to

882
00:32:04,371 --> 00:32:05,030
the cork.

883
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:09,270
Whether or not that's what should be
deciding who sits on our courts or not is

884
00:32:09,271 --> 00:32:13,430
the question I will leave for you to
think about the independence of the

885
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,264
judiciary.

886
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:19,250
The judges are independent
that they decide cases based
on the law and the facts

887
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:20,810
without any other political,

888
00:32:20,811 --> 00:32:21,590
financial,

889
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,423
any other,

890
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:23,421
uh,

891
00:32:23,421 --> 00:32:25,010
influence whatsoever.

892
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:25,551
Uh,

893
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:30,200
is one of the most important
issues in our society today,

894
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:30,740
uh,

895
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,030
is justice for sale.

896
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:32,780
Uh,

897
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,950
are good people discouraged from being
judges because they don't want to go

898
00:32:36,951 --> 00:32:39,320
through these elections
with these negative ads.

899
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:43,100
They don't want to have the one
case that they decided in which,

900
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:45,920
and of course the court is always
going to reverse some case.

901
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,260
So if you go back through
a judge's whole record,

902
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:52,340
you're going to be able to find some case
where the judge set aside a conviction

903
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:54,050
who take that one case,

904
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:55,550
blow it all out of proportion,

905
00:32:55,551 --> 00:32:57,380
and suggest that that case,

906
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:02,060
like what penny white to the Odom case
was everything that justice white stood

907
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:02,690
for,

908
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:02,871
uh,

909
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:04,760
over her long career,

910
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,330
uh,

911
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,650
as a both a trial,

912
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,580
a judge,

913
00:33:07,581 --> 00:33:08,540
as an appellate judge,

914
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,210
uh,

915
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:09,720
in,

916
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,580
in Tennessee,

917
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,420
uh,

918
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:16,130
money in politics are at odds with
a fair and impartial judiciary.

919
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,353
But today,

920
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,360
money and politics play a
greater and greater role,

921
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,230
uh,

922
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,470
in who's elected to the bench
and who presides over cases.

923
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:29,650
And it has a big effect on the fairness
of trials and on the behavior of

924
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:35,231
appellate judges in deciding whether to
affirm or to set aside a death penalty

925
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:39,110
case or any other criminal case
because of a constitutional violation.
