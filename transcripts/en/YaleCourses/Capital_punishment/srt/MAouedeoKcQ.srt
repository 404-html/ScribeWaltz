1
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:11,550
Oh,

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,090
good case that illustrates a lot of the
issues that we're going to be talking

3
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:17,490
about over the course of the course.

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,241
Uh,

5
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:21,600
is the case of Arkansas
versus Ricky rector.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,291
Uh,

7
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,050
this was a case out of a,

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,680
and it's in the readings,

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,370
uh,

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:26,821
out of,

11
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:27,150
uh,

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:27,751
Conway,

13
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:28,920
which is in Faulkner County,

14
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,783
Arkansas.

15
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,090
Tragic death here of a police officer,

16
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:33,924
Bob Martin,

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,000
who had come to a rest Ricky rector,

18
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:40,890
who had shot and killed someone else
just a short time before and had been,

19
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:41,760
uh,

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,630
on the run.

21
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,140
Uh,

22
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,000
but he agreed to come back
to his mother's house.

23
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:48,720
And Bob Martin was the friend of the
family and he came to arrest him and to

24
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:50,970
everyone's complete shock and amazement.

25
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:53,000
Rector walks up behind Martin,

26
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:53,520
uh,

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,353
and shoots him.

28
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,190
But then what he does next,

29
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,060
[inaudible] walk out in the backyard
and put the gun to his own head,

30
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:00,841
uh,

31
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:03,540
and give himself basically
a frontal lobotomy.

32
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,790
A lot of people thought
that retro wouldn't live,

33
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:06,624
but he did.

34
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,670
And so then the question becomes,

35
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,850
what do we do in this case?

36
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:12,540
Uh,

37
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,250
this is a community that had never
before even had a police officer shot,

38
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,800
let along the police officer killed.

39
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,400
And so there's a tremendous
reaction in the community,

40
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,091
uh,

41
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:26,190
because Bob Martin had been
a great public servant.

42
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:27,720
He was loved by people there.

43
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,531
Uh,

44
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:33,300
and there was a feeling that the death
penalty should be imposed because of this

45
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,370
loss of a law enforcement official.

46
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,580
This case is full of politics from the
start to the very end when Bill Clinton

47
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:45,771
running for president in 1992 comes back
to preside over the execution of Ricky

48
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:47,250
rector.

49
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:47,401
Uh,

50
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:49,140
right before the New Hampshire primary,

51
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:49,501
in fact,

52
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:52,230
Clinton had scheduled the execution
by signing a death warrant,

53
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:52,790
uh,

54
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,170
so that rector would be executed.

55
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,730
But rector who had been a pretty troubled
person and somewhat troubled mentally

56
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:00,564
to begin with,

57
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,381
uh,

58
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:06,381
was even more severely impaired
after he shot himself through the,

59
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,150
uh,

60
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,170
front of his head.

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,011
Uh,

62
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:14,790
and we'll talk a little bit about
how that was looked at in the case.

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,301
Uh,

64
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,490
but first I just raised the question,

65
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:20,730
what do you do if you're the district
attorney there in Faulkner County?

66
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:21,780
Uh,

67
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,180
the police of course
want the death penalty.

68
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,790
We don't know what the
Martin family wanted,

69
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,700
but we assume the family may
have wanted the death penalty.

70
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,150
Uh,

71
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,751
no question.

72
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,090
The community wants the death penalty,

73
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,100
but we have a man now who is profoundly
damaged as a result of this self

74
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:39,150
inflicted wound.

75
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:39,930
Uh,

76
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,930
do we still seek the
death penalty if we do?

77
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:44,040
What's our purpose?

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,990
Is the purpose to show people regardless
of whatever the facts are about Ricky

79
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:49,824
rector,

80
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,250
is the purpose to show people
that if you come to Conway,

81
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:55,620
Arkansas and kill one
of our police officers,

82
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,120
you're going to get the death penalty.

83
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,110
Uh,

84
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,110
or is there other considerations that
should take into account the individual

85
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:05,290
circumstances of rector?

86
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,011
Uh,

87
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:10,060
would it be possible has happened
in the Jared Lochner case,

88
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,120
the person who shot Gabrielle Giffords,

89
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:16,480
the congressman and killed a federal
judge as well as a little girl and other

90
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:21,481
people in that case was ultimately
resolved with a plea disposition where the

91
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:24,010
families and the community
and everybody agreed.

92
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,420
The best thing in this case is to make
sure that Jerry Lochner is never in the

93
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:29,440
community again.

94
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,280
Uh,

95
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,000
but not to go through a death penalty
trial and the appeals and so forth that

96
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:34,834
would go with it.

97
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,231
Well,

98
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:37,450
that obviously wasn't the
decision that was made,

99
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:37,960
uh,

100
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,040
in Faulkner County.

101
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,611
Uh,

102
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:43,390
but it's important to point out to
decisions that the prosecutor had to make

103
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,120
first whether to seek
the death penalty at all.

104
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,620
It's never required to
seek the death poly,

105
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:48,920
no,

106
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,751
no cases,

107
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,580
a mandatory death penalty case.

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,691
And then second,

109
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:56,110
even after the prosecutor had announced
were seeking the death penalty in this

110
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:56,944
case,

111
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,090
he would always offer a plea bargain
life imprisonment without any possibility

112
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:01,924
of parole,

113
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,621
uh,

114
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:04,930
resolve the case without a trial.

115
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,800
Uh,

116
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,310
and,

117
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:06,911
and of course,

118
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:07,810
the different sentence,

119
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,440
uh,

120
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,041
in this case,

121
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:13,240
both those questions were answered that
the prosecutor was going to go forward

122
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:14,140
with a prosecution.

123
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:16,480
It was felt that they
wanted the death pony,

124
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,090
even if Ricky rector
wasn't the same person.

125
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,700
We want the death pony for Ricky rector,

126
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,210
uh,

127
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,380
because of what happened in the community
and maybe for this deterrence purpose

128
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:27,280
that I talked about.

129
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,000
Uh,

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,330
but,

131
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,780
but you can see that that issue
is not just a legal question.

132
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,910
Is he eligible for the death politic?

133
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:34,520
Uh,

134
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,970
it was certainly his because
he shot a police officer,

135
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:37,720
uh,

136
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,310
but in killed a police officer,

137
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,400
but also a lot of political questions.

138
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:45,550
And of course the prosecutors got to
run for reelection and Faulkner County.

139
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,330
So how much does that
factor into the process?

140
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,680
And then of course,

141
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,820
what happened in the case was there's
no question rector committed the crime.

142
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,080
Every one knew that.

143
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,790
So the question becomes,

144
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,110
is he competent?

145
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,440
Is He as a result of
his damage to his brain?

146
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,630
Is he mentally competent,

147
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,530
uh,

148
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,220
to,

149
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:06,670
uh,

150
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,930
stand trial.

151
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:10,420
Now we have the defense
doctors who saw him,

152
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:10,931
Dr. Brown,

153
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:11,890
Dr. Stephens,

154
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:12,940
a psychologist,

155
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,280
a Mr. Hello.

156
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,283
Dr Heller.

157
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:15,590
Uh,

158
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,690
as well as his,

159
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,783
um,

160
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,640
uh,

161
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,330
or excuse me,

162
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,490
Heller is his attorney
and the Criswell case,

163
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:21,911
uh,

164
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:23,560
the one that had tried before,

165
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,101
uh,

166
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:28,150
and his sister all describe how
Ricky rector is functioning.

167
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,920
And we come out from that with a
diagnosis that he has retrograde Amnesia,

168
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,680
he's damaged his brain damage.

169
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:38,080
He's got no emotion whatsoever.

170
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,650
You go see him one day and he doesn't
remember having talked to you the last

171
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:43,660
time you went to see him.

172
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,230
Uh,

173
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,210
his intellectual functioning is
tested 66 later tested at 70.

174
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:50,860
But basically this is a person,

175
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:51,850
uh,

176
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,380
who not only is his thinking,

177
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:54,520
it's sort of a childlike level,

178
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,540
but is acting,

179
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,440
uh,

180
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,800
at a child like level,

181
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:58,634
very,

182
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,690
uh,

183
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,411
childish in,

184
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,730
in the way he behaves.

185
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,863
Uh,

186
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,240
the state doctors on the other hand,

187
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:05,830
uh,

188
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,180
Dr Ahmed is the main state doctor.

189
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:08,750
He says,

190
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,880
rectors lying about his loss of memory.

191
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,550
Uh,

192
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,880
there doesn't have
anything to do with this.

193
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:13,714
A bullet wound,

194
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,210
uh,

195
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,043
through his,

196
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,183
through his brain.

197
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,001
Uh,

198
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:17,780
and uh,

199
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,561
he even says it.

200
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:20,990
By the second trial he had improved.

201
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:21,940
The state also had a,

202
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:22,870
another uh,

203
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,830
psychiatrist and two psychologists.

204
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:26,870
So you can see a lot of
experts in this case,

205
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,070
unusual for a case involving a
poor person to have this many,

206
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,610
uh,

207
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,610
experts too on the defense side and not
unusual for the state to have for a on

208
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:37,634
its side.

209
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,000
Uh,

210
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,650
but where does that get us?

211
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:40,484
They decided,

212
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:40,921
uh,

213
00:06:40,921 --> 00:06:43,490
the state doctors that he was faking it,

214
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,451
uh,

215
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:46,010
and then he was not cooperating,

216
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:46,760
uh,

217
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,290
in,

218
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:47,510
uh,

219
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,540
answering their questions and that
his lack of emotion and his childlike

220
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,393
behavior,

221
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:52,940
uh,

222
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,000
they said work life
choices that he had made.

223
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,230
Uh,

224
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,063
so,

225
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,700
uh,

226
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,560
what do we do with these?

227
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:01,670
These are the same
diagnosis we had before.

228
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,670
The defense experts
come to the conclusion,

229
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,760
manifestly incapable of assisting
his lawyers in any way that he's too

230
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,111
childlike,

231
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:12,944
too injured,

232
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,370
uh,

233
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,203
to,

234
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:14,930
uh,

235
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,700
damaged,

236
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:15,891
uh,

237
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:16,431
to work with.

238
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:17,450
As lawyers state,

239
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,051
uh,

240
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:20,960
these doctors decide he could choose.

241
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:21,291
Again,

242
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:24,560
they're saying that he's faking it and
all that they're saying if he wants to

243
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:25,580
cooperate with his lawyers,

244
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:30,581
he can and therefore there's no
problem going forward with this.

245
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,610
This is what the Arkansas
Supreme Court will later say,

246
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:37,250
that the evidence was
hopelessly in conflict.

247
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,010
This doctors reach one conclusion,

248
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,060
one diagnosis,

249
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:41,990
the state doctors,

250
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,190
another diagnosis,

251
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,390
another conclusion.

252
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,800
How does this get resolved?

253
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,843
One person,

254
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,710
one person resolves it.

255
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:49,431
Uh,

256
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:50,570
and that's the trial judge.

257
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:51,201
Of course,

258
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:54,560
he too is elected by the voters
there and Faulkner County.

259
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:55,341
Uh,

260
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:56,870
whether or not that comes into play,

261
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,411
uh,

262
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:58,101
we don't know,

263
00:07:58,101 --> 00:08:01,580
but we can't help but know that there's
got to be some political pressure,

264
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,130
uh,

265
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,470
there with regard to it.

266
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,310
Let's look at the legal issue that
was presented by rectors case.

267
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,001
Uh,

268
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:08,241
and,

269
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:10,090
and what other issues
are presented by his,

270
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:10,963
his mental health.

271
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,700
Was he competent to stand trial?

272
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,760
Most fundamental question in this case,

273
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:20,840
and this is what the case is all about
because I said there's no question that

274
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,130
he's guilty of the crime.

275
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:22,910
Uh,

276
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,170
not much question that a jury and Faulkner
County is going to sentence him to

277
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:27,681
death.

278
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:32,180
And he ends up with an all white jury in
a community that has about 10% African

279
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:32,560
American.

280
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,393
Um,

281
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,220
the standard,

282
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,570
the statute is set out here,

283
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:36,620
the Arkansas Code,

284
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,150
which provides that a person who
lacks the capacity to understand the

285
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:42,200
proceedings that is,

286
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:43,490
understand what's going on,

287
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:44,390
who the judge is,

288
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,201
the prosecutor,

289
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:46,034
the jurors,

290
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,580
uh,

291
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,580
and how the proceedings are taking place
or assist his lawyer that is be able to

292
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:54,080
have conversations with his lawyer,

293
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:55,280
relate information,

294
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,831
uh,

295
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:56,940
and that sort of thing.

296
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,790
As a result of a mental disease or defect,

297
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,013
uh,

298
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,501
uh,

299
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:04,980
is not to be tried if
they lack this capacity.

300
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,960
So those are the two
questions we're asking.

301
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:10,710
Can Rector understand the
proceedings and can he,

302
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,580
uh,

303
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,900
cooperate with his lawyers?

304
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:16,770
Can he interact with his lawyers in a
way that makes it possible for them to

305
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:17,604
represent them?

306
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,181
And as I said,

307
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:20,580
the whole case is going to
be decided on this one issue.

308
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,623
And as I said,

309
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,590
the judge is the person
who's going to decide it.

310
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,620
So the judge decided that he's competent
and then the importance of that finding

311
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,330
by that one trial judge means that when
the case goes to the Arkansas Supreme

312
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:34,164
Court,

313
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,240
it affirms and it says the
evidence is hopelessly in conflict.

314
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:41,790
So we defer to the trial judge.

315
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,820
The trial judge was the
person who heard the evidence,

316
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,200
saw the witnesses,

317
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,070
uh,

318
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,950
and unless it's clearly erroneous,

319
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:53,880
unless it's absolutely clear
to us that he made a mistake,

320
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,420
uh,

321
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,580
with regard to finding of competence,

322
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,000
uh,

323
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,590
we're going to defer to his findings.

324
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,400
Every court when the case is later
reviewed in the federal courts,

325
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,241
uh,

326
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:03,990
those,

327
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,290
uh,

328
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,280
findings are going to be
a binding on those courts.

329
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,690
So you see how the power of this one
man or really we see the power of two

330
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:13,171
people here,

331
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:15,720
the prosecutor seeking the death penalty,

332
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,730
not plea bargaining in the case,

333
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,750
and then the power of the judge to decide
the legal issue that's going to decide

334
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:22,584
the whole case.

335
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,410
If rector had been found
not to be competent,

336
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,620
he would have been sent to a mental
institution and he would have stayed there

337
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:33,030
until either became competent or it was
determined that he just was not going to

338
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:33,930
ever be competent.

339
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:34,860
Uh,

340
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,170
but of course here he was found competent,

341
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,140
which meant that the
case moved on to trial.

342
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,520
Let me just mention a couple of other
issues raised by these mental issues.

343
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,480
Often in cases,

344
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:46,980
one is sanity.

345
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,320
We've all heard of the insanity defense.

346
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,070
Uh,

347
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,280
seldom really used successfully in cases,

348
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:58,170
particularly by poor people who usually
can't afford the expert witnesses and

349
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,830
often can't get them from the court
in order to even try to prove.

350
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,820
But the difference here,

351
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:04,200
when we talk about sanity,

352
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,250
we're talking about the person's mental
condition at the time of the crime,

353
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,250
whether or not the
person had the capacity.

354
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:11,551
Again,

355
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:15,780
the ability we're talking about to
conform his or her behavior to the

356
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:19,230
requirements of the law and
appreciate the criminality,

357
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:19,661
uh,

358
00:11:19,661 --> 00:11:21,300
of what he or she did.

359
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:21,811
In other words,

360
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:25,740
the person who shoots someone because
they think they're an enemy soldier who's

361
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,090
the invading the country,

362
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,980
and they have a delusional belief.

363
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,720
They believe this completely.

364
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,081
I mean,

365
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:33,500
that's sort of your classic example of a,

366
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:34,740
of an insanity defense.

367
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,050
Don't have that in this
case because of course,

368
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:40,680
rectors damage to his
brain and his functioning,

369
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,131
uh,

370
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:44,760
was a result of an injury he inflicted
after he committed the crime.

371
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:49,560
So no question about his sanity at the
time he shot and killed Bob Martin.

372
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,783
Uh,

373
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,620
mitigation is,

374
00:11:52,621 --> 00:11:53,770
we'll talk about later.

375
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,560
Uh,

376
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,560
is rectors condition a reason
for a sentence less than death?

377
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:00,550
Uh,

378
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,080
do we take this into account?

379
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,280
We look at the crime,

380
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:03,701
uh,

381
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:06,730
the heinousness of the crime
of the loss to the community.

382
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,120
Uh,

383
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,370
but do we also look at rectors condition?

384
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,170
And there's some argument about this,

385
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:11,740
about,

386
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,190
well,

387
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,500
that wasn't his condition
at the time of the crime,

388
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,000
so we shouldn't consider it.

389
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,590
And the other side,

390
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:17,921
well,

391
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,000
that is his condition.

392
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:21,610
Now this is the situation.

393
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:25,900
This man is in profoundly damaged
as a result of this gunshot wound.

394
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:26,561
Uh,

395
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:31,180
and so perhaps this is not a person
who should be sentenced to death.

396
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,630
The Arkansas Supreme Court when
presented with this question and said,

397
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:34,721
well,

398
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,910
this is a matter for executive clemency.

399
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,631
Of course,

400
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,920
at the time they said that,

401
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:39,401
uh,

402
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:41,830
or for the governor to consider
for executive clemency,

403
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:42,640
Chris,

404
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,031
at the time,

405
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:45,670
they considered that
they didn't know that,

406
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,570
uh,

407
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,180
clemency would come up at a time when
the governor was running for president of

408
00:12:50,181 --> 00:12:54,940
the United States and his law and
order Bona Fides would be the most,

409
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,490
one of the most important
issues in the case,

410
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:58,420
as someone said,

411
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,530
for Ricky rector.

412
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,710
That timing was very bad indeed.

413
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,551
Uh,

414
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,710
and then finally at the end of the case,

415
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:09,370
the question came up whether rector
was competent to be executed.

416
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,590
As I mentioned just a little earlier,

417
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,340
uh,

418
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,850
whether or not he understood
why he was being executed.

419
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:16,571
Uh,

420
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:17,404
so those are,

421
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:17,921
uh,

422
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:22,921
this case gives you a sense again of
the way in which these issues come up in

423
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:23,981
cases.

424
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:28,420
Retros case was not a celebrated
case when it first came up in Conway,

425
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:29,254
Arkansas,

426
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,940
but of course it became a fairly well
known case at the very end because the

427
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:37,600
role it played in Bill Clinton's
campaign for President United States.

428
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,040
Uh,

429
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,730
and it certainly was seen by a lot of
people as protecting Clinton from any

430
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:45,040
attack that he was soft on crime,

431
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:45,670
uh,

432
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,240
that he would not be like the previous
Democratic nominee Michael to caucus,

433
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:49,840
uh,

434
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,610
who had been opposed to the death penalty.

435
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,211
Uh,

436
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:57,211
and that cost him a fairly dearly with
the ads that were run against him when he

437
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:58,600
ran for president.

438
00:13:59,230 --> 00:13:59,810
Well,

439
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,040
uh,

440
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,570
let's go from that just to quickly talk
about how these cases make their way

441
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:05,404
through the system.

442
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,071
Uh,

443
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:10,390
obviously any criminal case is going
to start with a crime being committed,

444
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:10,870
uh,

445
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:15,820
and then an investigation which can
last for as long as a few seconds.

446
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:20,821
If the offender is a apprehended right
there on the scene or can last for

447
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:21,311
months,

448
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:22,144
years,

449
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,070
however long it takes for law enforcement
and the prosecutors to decide who it

450
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,300
is that committed the crime.

451
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,410
Um,

452
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,270
once we know who committed the crime,

453
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,650
then there's going to be an arrest.

454
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,000
Uh,

455
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,311
again,

456
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:34,420
that may be very soon.

457
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:37,780
Or you may have somebody who has fled
the country or fled the jurisdiction.

458
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:39,880
So that may take some period of time.

459
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,960
Here's where we want to get into
the legal proceedings to take place.

460
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:46,420
Those things you probably
a pretty familiar with.

461
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:47,260
When you're arrested,

462
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,330
you're entitled to a
first appearance hearing.

463
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,321
In other words,

464
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:51,920
within a day or two of being arrested,

465
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:55,160
a person should be brought
before a judicial officer,

466
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,851
a judge,

467
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:56,750
or a magistrate.

468
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:57,771
Uh,

469
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,060
and the question here,

470
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:00,320
that's critically important.

471
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,120
Do you get a lawyer at that point?

472
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,060
Because if you're accused of any crime,

473
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:10,340
you want a lawyer at this point
because if you're on a minor crime,

474
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,780
you're hoping to get out on bail a so
you can go back to work so you can keep

475
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:15,614
your home,

476
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,753
uh,

477
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,360
uh,

478
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,530
carry on your life,

479
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:18,840
uh,

480
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,380
in hope that maybe you won't
ever go to prison on this case.

481
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,790
If you're in a serious case and death
point in case you want your while you're

482
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,250
out investigating the
case right from the start.

483
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,270
Diego Martin who was facing
the death plenty in del Rio,

484
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:32,781
Texas,

485
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:33,680
gets arrested,

486
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,380
asked for a lawyer eight months.

487
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,860
He goes for eight months facing
the death penalty with no lawyer.

488
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,000
And you can imagine the damage that
does to his case in terms of there's no

489
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:44,900
investigation.

490
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,600
He's not able to talk to
a lawyer about his case.

491
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:48,590
What's going on.

492
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,490
Uh,

493
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,770
he basically just sits
in jail for eight months.

494
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,900
The prosecution is building its case,

495
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,531
uh,

496
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:55,700
and he is not,

497
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,181
uh,

498
00:15:56,181 --> 00:16:00,410
at any rate at this first hearing of
judge will usually tell the defendant what

499
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,090
his or her rights are.

500
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,403
Uh,

501
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,460
set bail.

502
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,840
Most capital cases,

503
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,850
no bail is set in capital cases,

504
00:16:07,851 --> 00:16:08,810
but in other cases,

505
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:11,130
the court will set bail or uh,

506
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,870
in some cases release people on
their personal promise to come back.

507
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,910
That is their personal Rick cognizance.

508
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,990
A short time after that
in most jurisdictions.

509
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,741
And this is what Chris,

510
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:24,650
we're generalizing here across all states.

511
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,870
And so some of these
things are not as true,

512
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,860
maybe one place to another,

513
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,040
but most places within
a short time after that,

514
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,430
uh,

515
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,170
the defendant has a preliminary hearing,

516
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,250
uh,

517
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,600
is represented by client,

518
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,380
by,

519
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,250
by a lawyer.

520
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:37,991
Uh,

521
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:38,301
of course,

522
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:39,410
if you don't have a lawyer,

523
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,790
like in the case I mentioned,

524
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:41,480
uh,

525
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,313
for eight months,

526
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,870
you're probably not going
to have preliminary hearing
because no lawyer is going

527
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:46,040
to request a preliminary hearing,

528
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:46,610
uh,

529
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,443
for you.

530
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:47,930
Uh,

531
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:48,800
but at that hearing,

532
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,400
uh,

533
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,600
the court determines,

534
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:52,020
the judge determines a,

535
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,080
whether there's probable cause that is,

536
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:57,260
whether it's probable that the
person committed the crime,

537
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,951
uh,

538
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:58,611
and if so,

539
00:16:58,611 --> 00:17:03,230
the person can continue to be
held either on bail or in prison.

540
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,310
Uh,

541
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,620
most states still have grand juries,

542
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:08,210
not all in some states,

543
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:09,980
the prosecution's can just simply,

544
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:10,881
prosecutors,

545
00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:11,391
excuse me,

546
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:12,224
can just

547
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,000
file an accusation which
sets out the charges.

548
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:17,870
Uh,

549
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,340
but in a lot of states,

550
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:21,380
the cases presented to a grand jury,

551
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:21,981
uh,

552
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:24,620
it considers the evidence and
then returned an indictment.

553
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,410
And the indictment is the formal charge.

554
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,650
The fact that somebody has been indicted
does not mean they committed a crime.

555
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,040
It just means they're
formally charged with a crime.

556
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:34,680
Uh,

557
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,910
original purpose of the grand jury or
one of its purposes had been that if you

558
00:17:38,911 --> 00:17:43,610
were accused of something you didn't
do a and the grand jury did not indict,

559
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,020
you wouldn't go through the,

560
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:45,320
uh,

561
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,180
public embarrassment of being accused.

562
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:48,080
Because today,

563
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:48,960
uh,

564
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,490
that's really not the case.

565
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:54,960
Grand Juries are used to gather evidence
and investigate cases and generally

566
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,890
everybody knows who's
being investigated by,

567
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,800
by the grand jury,

568
00:17:58,801 --> 00:17:59,221
at least in,

569
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:00,660
in cases of any prominence.

570
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,900
Once a person's indicted by the grand
jury or they're brought before the court

571
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,890
for Arraignment,

572
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:10,070
this is the proceeding where the person
enters a plea of not guilty a or in some

573
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:12,481
cases,

574
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:15,450
this will be where the cases
resolved with a guilty plea.

575
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,880
Certainly in a lot of non capital cases,

576
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,380
a lot of people,

577
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,310
a lot of poor people accused of crimes
will meet their lawyer for the first time

578
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,144
at arraignment,

579
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,430
will plead guilty and be sentenced all
within about a 15 minute time period.

580
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,361
Uh,

581
00:18:30,361 --> 00:18:31,440
capital cases,

582
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,580
generally a not guilty plea is going
to be entered because nobody's going to

583
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,560
plead guilty or unless
less they want the death.

584
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:39,570
Probably most people are going
to plead not guilty here.

585
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,111
Uh,

586
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:41,970
and then we go to pretrial hearings,

587
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:43,560
which can be on all the issues,

588
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,400
uh,

589
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,120
that,

590
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,510
uh,

591
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,950
maybe litigated pretrial,

592
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:48,780
whether to change the venue in the case.

593
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,110
Should we move it to another
place where there's not a,

594
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,870
the kind of knowledge of the case
that there was in the rector case.

595
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,711
Uh,

596
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:56,880
is there,

597
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,300
uh,

598
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,620
suppression of evidence?

599
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,200
Uh,

600
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,300
the competency issue,

601
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,051
uh,

602
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:02,790
in the retro case is a good example.

603
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,410
This issue was not an issue.

604
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:05,370
Tried to a jury.

605
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:09,690
This was an issue that was decided in
a pretrial hearing before the judge.

606
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,120
Uh,

607
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,550
there may be other issues like,

608
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,090
uh,

609
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:17,090
motions to suppress identification
because it was suggestive or some other,

610
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,060
uh,

611
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,910
motion to suppress the
confession because the person,

612
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,390
uh,

613
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,530
it was not a voluntary confession or
there was a violation of Miranda versus

614
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,573
Arizona.

615
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,260
Basically any issue that's a legal
issue that needs to be resolved,

616
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,040
uh,

617
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,730
can be litigated before that is uh,

618
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,460
you know,

619
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,300
motion can be filed and the
parties can argue about it,

620
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:42,510
present evidence on and the
judge decides it before trial,

621
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,360
before we get to the issue
of guilt or innocence.

622
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,720
Sometimes there'll be issues about what
evidence is going to be admitted or not.

623
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,380
And the judge will rule
upon that prior to trial.

624
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,820
Once that happens,

625
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:54,661
uh,

626
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:55,860
we moved to,

627
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,440
uh,

628
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,360
this process,

629
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:58,200
the trial,

630
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:58,830
uh,

631
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,200
this is a where the trial
is going to take place.

632
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:05,520
This is where the accused is entitled
to a lawyer under the Supreme Court's

633
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:06,121
decision.

634
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,920
And Gideon versus Wainwright.

635
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:08,940
Uh,

636
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,070
and in depth pony cases,

637
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,750
this will be a bifurcated trial.

638
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:13,650
That is two trials,

639
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:14,760
one trial and guilt,

640
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,650
one trial on penalty,

641
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,581
uh,

642
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:20,010
after assuming the person is convicted,

643
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,320
found guilty in some states,

644
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,940
like Alabama is a good example.

645
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:27,480
There's an intermediate court of
appeals that is as the Alabama Court of

646
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:28,314
criminal appeals.

647
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,153
And then above it,

648
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,630
the Alabama Supreme Court,

649
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,490
all these cases go first to the Alabama
Court of criminal appeals and decides

650
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:36,300
the case.

651
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,690
And then a person can
petition the Supreme Court,

652
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,410
uh,

653
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,610
to review the case,

654
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:42,810
but it's not required to.

655
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,320
Most states the cases bypass
the intermediate court.

656
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,560
They go straight from the trial
court to the state Supreme Court.

657
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,221
Texas,

658
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:51,821
for example,

659
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:54,250
has a whole level of
intermediate appellate courts,

660
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:55,900
but the death pawn in
cases don't go there.

661
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:59,800
They go straight from the trial court to
the Texas Court of criminal appeals or

662
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,860
in Georgia from the trial court
to the Georgia Supreme Court.

663
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,880
And then that state court
makes a decision of whether,

664
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,420
uh,

665
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,710
reviews the trial,

666
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,873
uh,

667
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
the briefs that are filed to see was
there any legal error made at the trial,

668
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:20,161
either in those pretrial motions that we
just talked about or admitting evidence

669
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:23,170
during the trial jury
instructions that were given,

670
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,780
anything that may have been
discussed or a decided not discussed,

671
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:28,614
but decided,

672
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:28,991
uh,

673
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:30,310
at the trial court level,

674
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:30,850
uh,

675
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,950
the State Supreme Court May Review,

676
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,030
a party can ask the United States
Supreme Court to review it by filing a

677
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:40,030
petition in the Supreme
Court seeking review.

678
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,650
Almost always,

679
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,710
except in the rare case
that's going to be denied a.

680
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:49,180
So this is what we call direct
appeal directly from the trial court,

681
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:49,691
uh,

682
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:51,670
up through the state Supreme Court.

683
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:52,983
Now,

684
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,850
once that process is ended,

685
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,820
person theoretically is eligible to be
executed because they've had their trial

686
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:01,840
and they've had their appeal.

687
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:02,531
Uh,

688
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:06,130
but all states provide
some kind of collateral,

689
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:07,420
what we call collateral,

690
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,890
a attack on the conviction
or post conviction review.

691
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:12,701
Uh,

692
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:17,200
and here the person can go back to
the trial court and file a petition or

693
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:22,201
emotion saying my death
sins or my conviction was
obtained in violation of the

694
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:24,311
constitution,

695
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:26,710
the laws of the United States
and this particular state.

696
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,203
But one thing,

697
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:33,070
the person cannot raise any issue here
that could have been raised at trial or

698
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:34,180
in the state supreme court.

699
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:35,920
So what does that leave?

700
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,720
If you've already raised these issues
before trial or during trial and you've

701
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:42,190
raised them in the state Supreme Court,

702
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,233
what's left?

703
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:43,990
Uh,

704
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,220
generally one issue,

705
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,210
uh,

706
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,240
heard here is a question of
ineffective assistance of counsel.

707
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:54,700
Obviously the lawyer can't be claiming
to be ineffective while representing

708
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:55,121
someone,

709
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:59,410
the lawyers hopefully providing and
thinks he or she is providing effective

710
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,221
representation.

711
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:02,590
So that question can be decided here.

712
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:03,400
Uh,

713
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,530
suppression of exculpatory evidence,

714
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,310
uh,

715
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,143
often,

716
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:07,630
uh,

717
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,790
more often than than we would like to see,

718
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,820
uh,

719
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,530
find that the prosecution has failed
to disclose some important evidence,

720
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,730
uh,

721
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,570
to the defense.

722
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:17,340
Uh,

723
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,310
and as a result,

724
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,130
uh,

725
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:23,110
the argument is that the trial has not
been fair because the government has a

726
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,530
duty to turn over,

727
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,240
uh,

728
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,210
evidence that tends to show
the person is not guilty.

729
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,160
So that issue could be raised there.

730
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,030
Uh,

731
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,863
sometimes,

732
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,230
uh,

733
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,060
people learn of jury misconduct,

734
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:34,660
uh,

735
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,240
that the jurors may have done something
that they're not supposed to do.

736
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:38,920
So that issue could be raised there.

737
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,320
And that's not exclusive list.

738
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:42,460
But that's an example.

739
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,623
And then again,

740
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,800
depending on the state,

741
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:48,110
it will either go to the
state intermediate court
or it'll go to the state

742
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:49,040
supreme court.

743
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,581
And again,

744
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:52,550
the person can petition in the United
States Supreme Court for review.

745
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,420
Again,

746
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,270
very unlikely the Supreme
Court is going to review it.

747
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,340
Most of the time they're not.

748
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:02,570
But if there's a really important legal
issue there or an issue in which courts

749
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:05,780
are divided than the supreme
court may take the case.

750
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,973
Finally,

751
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:12,010
the last resort for someone sentenced to
death is to file a petition for writ of

752
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:17,150
Habeas Corpus in the United States
district court where they are,

753
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:17,930
uh,

754
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:21,890
this basically is a petition that says,

755
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,110
I the death row inmate,

756
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:24,920
uh,

757
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,630
suing the warden of the facility that's
holding that person and being held here

758
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:32,420
in violation of the constitution
of the United States.

759
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,960
The fact that the state law issues no
longer those could be litigated in state

760
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:38,750
court,

761
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,860
but not in federal court.

762
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,160
There has to be a federal
constitutional violation.

763
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,140
I am held in violation of the federal
constitution in that there was racial

764
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:52,610
discrimination in my jury selection and
violation of the 14th amendment to the

765
00:24:52,611 --> 00:24:53,630
United States constitution.

766
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,320
That's a classic example of
a plane that might be made,

767
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:57,810
uh,

768
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,210
in the United States district court.

769
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,410
Uh,

770
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,150
that court decides the case.

771
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:02,810
Uh,

772
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,980
let's say it rules adversely
to the death row inmate,

773
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,143
uh,

774
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,400
the person can then ask the,

775
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:10,611
well,

776
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:10,881
first,

777
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:15,881
ask the district court to allow him or
her to appeal to the court of Appeals.

778
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,290
They're not entitled to an appeal.

779
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,011
Uh,

780
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:20,750
the district court can
either say yes or no.

781
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:23,000
This issue is important enough
that it can be appealed.

782
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:23,841
A,

783
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:25,820
or if the district court says no,

784
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,600
the person can go to the court of appeals
and make your argument a second time,

785
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,420
uh,

786
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,880
that this is an important issue.

787
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:32,840
Uh,

788
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,990
but very often that court will say no.

789
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,070
And so that's going to pretty much an end.

790
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:38,391
Of course,

791
00:25:38,391 --> 00:25:41,390
the person will petition in the United
States Supreme Court for review,

792
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,560
but failing that,

793
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,610
that person is probably
going to be executed and
probably executed pretty soon.

794
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:47,391
Uh,

795
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:50,150
Texas is executed far more
people than any other state.

796
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:51,230
And one of the reasons,

797
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:51,920
um,

798
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,850
there was a lot of reasons,

799
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:56,540
but one is at once he's case
come to federal district court,

800
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:00,200
they're usually denied
a certificate of appeal.

801
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:02,720
Ability to the court of appeals is denied.

802
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,070
Uh,

803
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,670
so once this court rules,

804
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:05,780
uh,

805
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,920
there's nothing left between that
person and the execution chamber.

806
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,400
So a habeas corpus used to be a way in
which a number of capital cases were

807
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:20,240
reviewed and sometimes
set aside the difference.

808
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:20,931
Life,

809
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:21,890
tenure judges,

810
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,020
these judges are appointed
by the president,

811
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,370
confirmed by the Senate.

812
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,810
They serve for life.

813
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,100
Not to say there's not some
politics both in getting appointed.

814
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,800
And not to say that they're not some
federal judges who are ambitious to go on

815
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,260
to other places,

816
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,020
but at the same time there's
a lot more independence.

817
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,470
Uh,

818
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,550
when you have life tenure,

819
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,330
a judge in the state court
who makes a decision,

820
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:45,460
either a trial judge or a,

821
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:46,360
an appellate judge,

822
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:46,960
uh,

823
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,960
maybe signing his or her political death
warrant if they grant relief in a death

824
00:26:52,301 --> 00:26:53,134
penalty case.

825
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:53,560
Uh,

826
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,420
not so for a federal judge,

827
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,290
uh,

828
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,300
and at one time the federal courts,

829
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,410
uh,

830
00:26:59,410 --> 00:26:59,890
we're,

831
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:00,191
we're,

832
00:27:00,191 --> 00:27:02,530
we're pretty vigorous and
enforcing the constitution,

833
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,160
uh,

834
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,860
Congress passed and President
Clinton signed into law a,

835
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,440
an act which we'll talk about,

836
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:13,690
which greatly restricts the power now
of the federal courts to review these

837
00:27:14,021 --> 00:27:14,800
cases.

838
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,730
So that gives you an overview of just
when we're talking about these cases,

839
00:27:18,731 --> 00:27:20,680
you'll have some sense of where they are.

840
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,790
We'll look at cases,

841
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:25,780
decided by state supreme courts will look
at cases decided by federal courts of

842
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:26,211
appeal.

843
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,180
So you'll know how that got there.

844
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:28,760
Uh,

845
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,351
and of course,

846
00:27:29,351 --> 00:27:31,990
we'll look at a lot of United
States supreme court opinions.

847
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:32,710
Uh,

848
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:37,710
so I hope this gives you some sense of
where we are in the process as we look at

849
00:27:38,411 --> 00:27:39,101
those cases.

850
00:27:39,101 --> 00:27:40,330
And we'll also look at,

851
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:40,961
uh,

852
00:27:40,961 --> 00:27:43,300
examples from trial courts as well,

853
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:46,510
including some transcripts of
jury selection and so forth.

854
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,180
So that's the roadmap
of where we're going.

855
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,560
And we'll next take up,

856
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:50,981
uh,

857
00:27:50,981 --> 00:27:54,280
the historical sort of a backdrop,

858
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:54,580
uh,

859
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,330
leading,

860
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:55,511
uh,

861
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:56,650
to where we are today,

862
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,330
where the death point
of the United States.

863
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:11,810
Okay.
