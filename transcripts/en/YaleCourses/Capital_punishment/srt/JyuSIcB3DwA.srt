1
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,140
Today,

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,140
we know thanks to DNA testing and thanks
to some exceptionally thorough and

3
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:24,330
diligent investigations that had been
carried out that many people who have been

4
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:29,331
convicted and found guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt in both capital and non

5
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:33,900
capital cases are actually
completely innocent of the charges.

6
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,980
A number of people have come off death
row because they're innocent and a number

7
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:40,010
of people convicted of
all sorts of crimes,

8
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:41,550
some of whom have served 20,

9
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:46,380
30 years have been released because the
work of innocence projects all over the

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,180
country as well as lawyers,

11
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,140
public defenders,

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,760
and other people.

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:51,420
Uh,

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,220
it's a disturbing factor when you look
at how close we've come and I think we

15
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:59,280
actually have executed a innocent people.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,060
Uh,

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,840
so we want to talk just a little bit about
that and what the reasons are for it.

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,681
With the guard,

19
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:05,550
the DNA,

20
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:06,270
uh,

21
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,103
testimony.

22
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:07,711
Uh,

23
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:09,420
this fellow here pictured here,

24
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:10,350
Kirk Bloodsworth,

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,490
uh,

26
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,510
was sentenced to death and
1985 of a horrible crime.

27
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:17,880
The rape and murder of
a nine year old girl,

28
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,320
a five witnesses tied him to the crime.

29
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,790
Uh,

30
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,770
Bloodsworth said when he was sentenced,

31
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:26,640
he said,

32
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:28,800
you are sensing an innocent man,

33
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,840
but he was condemned to die.

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,770
Uh,

35
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,600
his sentence was overturned in 1986
because the prosecution had withheld

36
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,830
exculpatory evidence that by
law it was required to give him,

37
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:41,520
uh,

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,690
went to trial again.

39
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,600
Bloodsworth once again is convicted
this time he's not sentenced to death,

40
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:48,770
but sentence to imprison.

41
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,983
Uh,

42
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,310
as it turned out that when lawyers
later looked at Kirk Bloodsworth case,

43
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:56,940
uh,

44
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,940
they found that on the close of
the little girl who was killed,

45
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,670
there was a very small Siemens Day and
by then the forensic experts and learned

46
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:15,261
how to do DNA testing and they tested
the stain and they found it was not Kirk

47
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,000
Bloodsworth.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,220
It turns out this man who
had been condemned to die,

49
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,360
this man who has spent so much time in
prison was absolutely innocent of the

50
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:25,194
crime.

51
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,660
And as often happens with DNA evidence,

52
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,710
they also found out who
actually committed the crime.

53
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,490
So we're going to look at
some of the reasons why,

54
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,270
uh,

55
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,100
people,

56
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,560
uh,

57
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,390
that are innocent,

58
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,760
uh,

59
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,660
are convicted,

60
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,381
uh,

61
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:44,790
and why perhaps we shouldn't put quite
as much faith in the results and the

62
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,740
verdicts that are reached
in the criminal courts.

63
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,251
Uh,

64
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,120
as we do,

65
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,260
uh,

66
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,220
one reason,

67
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:53,160
and perhaps one of the most
prominent is misidentification.

68
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,683
Uh,

69
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,470
the film that's recommended in the
materials murderer on a Sunday morning,

70
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,161
uh,

71
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:05,161
involved a young African American
boy who's riding his bicycle in the

72
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:06,641
neighborhood.

73
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:09,310
A tourist is shot and killed.

74
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:09,840
Uh,

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,370
the police picked this young man up.

76
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,181
He's black,

77
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:14,380
he's in the neighborhood.

78
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:17,890
They take him back to the husband
of this woman who's been killed,

79
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:19,300
who was of course shake.

80
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,110
And you can imagine you've just seen
your spouse shot right before your very

81
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:26,530
eyes and watched her crumbled
to the ground and die.

82
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,170
And they bring a black kid and
put them in front of you and say,

83
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:30,004
is this a kid?

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,941
And he says,

85
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:31,774
yes.

86
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,530
Uh,

87
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,700
it turns out he was wrong.

88
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,600
Uh,

89
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,590
public defenders,

90
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,310
uh,

91
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,600
that represented Butler prove not
only that Butler was innocent.

92
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:45,310
Not only was he acquitted at trial because
of the extraordinary lawyering that

93
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:47,320
was done on his behalf,

94
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,020
but they actually found the
person who committed the crime.

95
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,350
And there was some DNA evidence that left,

96
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:57,640
no question that this other person
was the one that did the crime.

97
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,390
Uh,

98
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,240
mis identification happens
in all kinds of cases,

99
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,330
particularly in large areas where
people don't know each other.

100
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:04,931
Of course,

101
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:05,501
small town,

102
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:06,940
maybe everybody does know each other,

103
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:07,990
so it's less likely.

104
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,040
Uh,

105
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,040
and there've been a lot of efforts
to try to improve the way in which

106
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:15,790
identifications are done.

107
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,690
Uh,

108
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,380
but a lot of one enforcement agencies
had been very resistant to that.

109
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,520
Uh,

110
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,353
how,

111
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,751
uh,

112
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:25,180
the pictures are presented or lineups.

113
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:25,690
Uh,

114
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,420
we know that one of the
most suggestive things,

115
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:28,841
uh,

116
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:32,920
is to just simply take a person
back one on one a and show him,

117
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,580
uh,

118
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,413
to,

119
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:34,660
uh,

120
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,110
the victim has happened
or the witnesses happened,

121
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:37,780
uh,

122
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,740
in Butler's case.

123
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,460
Uh,

124
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,750
so misidentification,

125
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,350
uh,

126
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,490
still a reason that,

127
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,270
uh,

128
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,020
erroneous convictions are made very
often the person who was arrested,

129
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,620
uh,

130
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,730
having to be in the neighborhood,

131
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:49,840
that's why they got arrested.

132
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,710
Uh,

133
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,350
but the aren't the person
who committed the crime.

134
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:53,920
A,

135
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,620
another reason is expert testimony of,

136
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:58,000
of dubious value.

137
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,600
Uh,

138
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,680
there are a lot of experts who work
at crime laboratories or who testify

139
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:04,450
habitually for the prosecution.

140
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:05,380
Uh,

141
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,470
they may be people who are
working in complete good faith,

142
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,340
uh,

143
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,480
and conscientious.

144
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,320
Uh,

145
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,270
but when the crime laboratory is part
of the State Bureau of Investigation,

146
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,890
uh,

147
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,770
sorta develops in some of them at least,

148
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,550
uh,

149
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,420
biases,

150
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,200
uh,

151
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,540
that favor the prosecution.

152
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,190
Uh,

153
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,000
they're also honest
mistakes that are made,

154
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:28,811
uh,

155
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:31,990
in deciding what evidence may mean,

156
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:32,680
uh,

157
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,150
in trying to foul you.

158
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:34,481
Wait,

159
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:35,890
what happened in a case?

160
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:36,131
I mean,

161
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:39,400
a good example is Cameron Todd Willingham.

162
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,271
Uh,

163
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:43,450
this was a man who was
executed by the state of Texas.

164
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,550
He was convicted of an arson,

165
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,271
uh,

166
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:49,480
in which is three little
children were killed.

167
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,550
Here he is with one of them,

168
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,400
amber on,

169
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,500
on his shoulders.

170
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,460
Uh,

171
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,820
the fire department didn't really
know how to investigate a arson cases.

172
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:02,660
They very seldom had a arson
cases in this community.

173
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,381
Uh,

174
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:08,381
the question always in an arson cases
was the fire started accidentally.

175
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,591
Uh,

176
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:13,160
for some reason or another because of
an electric heater that overheated and

177
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:14,120
started a fire.

178
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:14,481
And Chris,

179
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:15,710
this was in the middle of the night,

180
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,020
uh,

181
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,060
or was it arson?

182
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:21,200
Was it intentional?

183
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,071
Uh,

184
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:27,071
the experts in Willingham case that
testified for the state said it was arson

185
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,260
and they gave a lot of reasons for it.

186
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:31,490
And just one example,

187
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,180
uh,

188
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,700
they said that the patterns on the glass,

189
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:35,451
uh,

190
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:36,770
that there were all these,

191
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,604
uh,

192
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,360
they call it a craze glass or the way
the glass was cracked and so forth.

193
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:45,890
It that showed that an accelerant was
used and that was evidence of arson.

194
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:46,791
Well,

195
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,624
it turns out that,

196
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,260
uh,

197
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,690
glass will end up that way.

198
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,530
Uh,

199
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,240
if you get class very hot
and spray cold water on it,

200
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,420
which of course is exactly what
happens when the house burned down.

201
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,290
Uh,

202
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,123
the house,

203
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,710
the fire heats the glass,

204
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,510
the fire department comes sprays water
on the glass and you get this pattern,

205
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,750
which doesn't show then
an accelerant was used.

206
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,160
It actually shows,

207
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,730
uh,

208
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,450
that,

209
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,110
uh,

210
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,300
cold water was poured on high class.

211
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,090
And there were a number
of other examples of this.

212
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,150
There was another case in
Texas involving almost,

213
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:23,871
uh,

214
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:24,770
the same,

215
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,430
uh,

216
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,710
kind of a fire that,

217
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:28,160
uh,

218
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,200
Willingham was convicted of.

219
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,690
It involved a fella named Ernest Willis.

220
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,940
He was convicted of arson.

221
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:35,540
Uh,

222
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,540
he had the very good fortune to have
a New York law firm take his case and

223
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:45,080
consult with the leading arson
experts in the United States.

224
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,590
And they basically took the prosecution's
case apart and showed that a lot of

225
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:55,691
the testimony that had come in had been
based upon sort of these myths or these

226
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:57,111
sort of,

227
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:57,650
uh,

228
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,390
beliefs that a lot of old
timey arson investigators had.

229
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,970
But that science had
proven we're not accurate.

230
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,240
When this information was
taken to the prosecutor,

231
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,200
uh,

232
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,771
in Willis,

233
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:10,604
this case,

234
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,161
uh,

235
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:14,240
the case was dismissed
and Willis was set free.

236
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,230
If you change the lawyers
in those two cases,

237
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,830
if Willingham had had the benefit of
Willis as lawyers and checking out his

238
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:25,544
case,

239
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:30,290
and Willis had the misfortune
of having Willinghams lawyers,

240
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:30,891
uh,

241
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:34,010
you would change the
outcome in those two cases.

242
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,290
The battle rages on about whether,

243
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:36,770
uh,

244
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,500
Todd Willingham was actually innocent,

245
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,470
but the weight of the
evidence is certainly,

246
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,060
uh,

247
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,893
daddy was,

248
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,050
uh,

249
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,020
another way is prosecutorial misconduct.

250
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:51,560
Another way in which innocent
people are convicted,

251
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,350
um,

252
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:52,650
uh,

253
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,070
for you to turn over exculpatory evidence.

254
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,240
We talked about the prosecution.

255
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:01,900
We talked about the responsibility that
prosecutors have if there's evidence of

256
00:09:01,901 --> 00:09:02,640
medicines,

257
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:02,910
uh,

258
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,960
to turn it over.

259
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:04,650
Uh,

260
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,150
there've been several prominent
cases where that's come to light.

261
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,410
John Thompson,

262
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,310
uh,

263
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,520
who won a multimillion dollar verdict,

264
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,121
uh,

265
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:20,121
when it was found that prosecutors knew
that the blood type involved in solving

266
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:24,840
that particular case was not
John Thompson's blood type
and had known for years.

267
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,170
It was only discovered when he was
just weeks away from execution.

268
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,040
Uh,

269
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,640
his verdict was taken away from him
by the United States Supreme Court.

270
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,073
Uh,

271
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,471
uh,

272
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:35,610
Anthony Graves,

273
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,420
uh,

274
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,510
who was sentenced to death also in Texas.

275
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,673
Uh,

276
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,860
his case was set aside
because the prosecution didn't
turn over evidence of the

277
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:49,650
key witness saying that graves was not
involved in that somebody else had been

278
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:54,090
involved when the case came back and
was examined by a prosecutor for,

279
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,073
from Houston.

280
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,160
Uh,

281
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,270
that prosecutor said it was the worst
prosecutorial misconduct she had ever

282
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:00,930
seen.

283
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,240
This was the prosecutor put
in 19 people on death row.

284
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:03,901
I mean,

285
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:07,290
she's not somebody who's terribly
sympathetic to that offense.

286
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,573
Uh,

287
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,610
but what we don't know is how often
these mistakes don't come to light,

288
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,580
uh,

289
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,640
because they're buried
along with the clients.

290
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:20,130
And that would be the
case of Carlos de Luna.

291
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,570
Uh,

292
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,870
Carlos de Luna was
sentenced to death in Texas.

293
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,010
Uh,

294
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:31,010
Jim James Liebman and Professor at
Columbia University Law School and others

295
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:35,070
have a book coming out in 2014,

296
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:35,820
uh,

297
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,870
regarding the case,

298
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:38,880
there's a website about Carlos de Luna,

299
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:39,690
uh,

300
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,040
suggesting that in fact,

301
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,890
the k the crime was
committed by another Carlos,

302
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,480
Carlos and Mendez.

303
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,290
Uh,

304
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,980
and that the prosecution
knew about this other Carlos,

305
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:54,450
but stood up in front of the jury
and said that the other Carlos was,

306
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,350
didn't even exist.

307
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,300
That it was a myth that
it was just something,

308
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,260
a dune.

309
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:58,801
As lawyers,

310
00:10:58,801 --> 00:10:59,634
we're trying,

311
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,210
uh,

312
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:00,950
to,

313
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:01,170
uh,

314
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,520
distract the jury with,

315
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,330
uh,

316
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,020
but,

317
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,290
uh,

318
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,250
convincing case,

319
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:09,840
looking at all the evidence that
Carlos de Luna like Todd Willingham,

320
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:10,620
uh,

321
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,720
even though he was executed was innocent.

322
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,870
Another reason is false confessions.

323
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,200
It's hard to imagine why a person would
confess to a crime they didn't commit.

324
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,590
But we know that if a person is deprived
of sleep for a long period of time to

325
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:34,131
private to food is subject to a
very harsh interrogation techniques.

326
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:36,660
Uh,

327
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,021
we know,

328
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:41,340
particularly if it's a person who has
a limited intellectual functioning,

329
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,740
although that certainly
doesn't mean all the time,

330
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,430
uh,

331
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,920
that people do make false confessions.

332
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,850
Uh,

333
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,061
you know,

334
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:48,960
Gary Geiger,

335
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,480
who was accused of killing his parents,

336
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,070
uh,

337
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,380
ultimately after long
interrogation with the police and,

338
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,420
and being asked to imagine,

339
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,170
uh,

340
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,520
how he would have committed the crimes
if he had ended up with what was

341
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,170
supposedly a confession.

342
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,910
Can Imagine how horrible it would be to
lose both your parents to come home and

343
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:13,210
find your parents dead and then
to be accused of the crime.

344
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:17,800
And since to death row turned out later
that they found out a motorcycle gang

345
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:18,820
had committed the crime,

346
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:19,630
uh,

347
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,630
Earl Washington and sentenced to death
and Virginia with an Iq of about 46 or

348
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:26,920
somewhere in that neighborhood,

349
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,461
uh,

350
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:28,690
would confess to anything.

351
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,651
Uh,

352
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:34,360
and he confessed to committing this
crime for which she had not committed a,

353
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:36,400
he said one time the victim was black.

354
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,350
He said at one time the victim was white.

355
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,230
He was willing to say just about anything,

356
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:41,800
uh,

357
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,240
that he was asked to say.

358
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,200
Uh,

359
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,990
he had very limited
intellectual functioning.

360
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,471
Uh,

361
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:50,200
he saw the police as authority figures.

362
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:50,770
Uh,

363
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,870
he very much wanted to please them,

364
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:53,770
uh,

365
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,460
and he just simply didn't
have the ability to cope,

366
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,241
uh,

367
00:12:58,241 --> 00:12:58,781
with,

368
00:12:58,781 --> 00:12:59,560
uh,

369
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,000
with dealing with the questioning.

370
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:01,511
Of course,

371
00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:03,490
ultimately DNA evidence,

372
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,340
proof that he was absolutely
innocent of the crimes.

373
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,760
And there've been many other
examples that are documented by,

374
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,360
uh,

375
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,320
people who studied,

376
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:11,830
uh,

377
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,850
false confessions.

378
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:13,391
Uh,

379
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:16,210
another reason is false
testimony by informants.

380
00:13:16,211 --> 00:13:17,590
Many cases are made,

381
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,160
uh,

382
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,150
by informants.

383
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,950
Very often people in jails
will tell the prosecution,

384
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:24,880
uh,

385
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,010
if you'll drop my burglary charge,

386
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:30,430
I'll testify that this person
who was in the cell with me,

387
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,780
uh,

388
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,390
confessed or admitted to
me that they did the crime.

389
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,030
We see this in case after case,

390
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:38,500
after case after case.

391
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,580
Uh,

392
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,580
and increasingly people are
realizing that this testimony,

393
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,300
this sort of bought testimony,

394
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:46,961
uh,

395
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:50,290
is that a lot of people say just about
anything to get out of jail or a lot of

396
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,260
people say just about anything
to get their sentence reduced.

397
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,543
And so,

398
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:55,420
uh,

399
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,890
the studies have found that,

400
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,090
uh,

401
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,360
informants are notoriously unreliable,

402
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:03,430
but there's no way
juries are going to know.

403
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:08,410
Some courts now instruct the jury's a
year to be very careful and you're to

404
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:09,970
scrutinize this testimony.

405
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:10,930
Uh,

406
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,930
but the jury is still
at the end of the day,

407
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,130
a person says,

408
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,761
I was there.

409
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:17,770
The person came to me and
they admitted doing it.

410
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:18,670
Uh,

411
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,810
we know that for example,

412
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:20,621
in Los Angeles,

413
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:24,610
they were able to get access to court
records to find out what the details of

414
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:25,444
the crime were.

415
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,460
So the prosecution would argue,

416
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,210
uh,

417
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:32,740
he must've confessed because the
informant would not have known the d the

418
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:35,230
details of the crime if the
defendant hadn't told him.

419
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,040
Uh,

420
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,873
in fact,

421
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,110
the informant had learned,

422
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:38,651
uh,

423
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:39,580
from court files,

424
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,091
uh,

425
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:41,650
what the details of the crime where,

426
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,290
uh,

427
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,720
so this testimony,

428
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,470
uh,

429
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,610
continues to be used.

430
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:48,400
It's a very common,

431
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,090
uh,

432
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,130
in criminal cases today.

433
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:56,150
A poor legal representation is something
that we've talked about in the segments

434
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:56,990
on council.

435
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:57,771
Uh,

436
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,860
it remains a tremendous problem.

437
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:01,470
Uh,

438
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,470
the best protection against an innocent
person being convicted and sentenced to

439
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:12,251
death is competent legal representation
is having a lawyer who will investigate

440
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:13,730
the identification.

441
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,331
A lawyer,

442
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,940
he'll find out everything that can
be found out about the informant,

443
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:22,270
a lawyer who will check into the
forensic testimony that's being used,

444
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:23,960
the opinions of whatever it may be,

445
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:25,010
a medical examiner,

446
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,210
an arson expert,

447
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,430
and then consult with their own experts,

448
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,030
uh,

449
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,390
to see if in fact this evidence stands up,

450
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,200
uh,

451
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,350
that in many cases that just
simply doesn't take place.

452
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,940
In many cases,

453
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:39,860
people are inadequately represented.

454
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,640
Uh,

455
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,500
the government's case is not really
contested because the defense lawyer just

456
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:50,501
simply doesn't have the resources to
hire the expert witnesses or to do the

457
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:51,640
investigation that's,

458
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,513
that's needed.

459
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:53,893
Uh,

460
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,060
they're also procedural barriers
which come into play often.

461
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,790
This evidence is not discovered
until long after the trial.

462
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,470
If it was known before trial,

463
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:05,180
of course it would be presented at trial,

464
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,550
but long after the trial,

465
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,710
some evidence comes to light.

466
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,970
Uh,

467
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,100
and then the question is
how to get it before court.

468
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,210
Uh,

469
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:14,961
sometimes,

470
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:15,140
uh,

471
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,120
Texas for example,

472
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:18,440
you have 30 days after the trial,

473
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,070
uh,

474
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,720
to file a motion for new trial.

475
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:21,920
Uh,

476
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,770
there may be an opportunity in
the state post conviction process.

477
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,520
Uh,

478
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,950
but what happens when you get past that,

479
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,000
uh,

480
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,230
sometimes they're procedural defaults in
the case that his issues have not been

481
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:35,520
properly preserved and then waived,

482
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,110
uh,

483
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,300
because he didn't seem that
significant at the time.

484
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,081
Uh,

485
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:44,081
but now we know that they are
tied to evidence of innocence.

486
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,401
So,

487
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:50,330
and then the final thing is what happens
after a person has gone all the way

488
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:52,040
through the federal review.

489
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,660
The Federal Habeas Corpus Review,

490
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,473
um,

491
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,110
person finds new evidence may be
very critical evidence of innocence,

492
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,480
but you only get to go to
federal court one time,

493
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,770
uh,

494
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,190
with the exception of an innocence claim.

495
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,570
But as we'll see,

496
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,490
a very high standard,

497
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,420
uh,

498
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,280
let's look first at procedural bars.

499
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,001
Uh,

500
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:18,710
the Supreme Court held that it is a
miscarriage of justice to execute an

501
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:19,640
innocent person.

502
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,421
Uh,

503
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:25,421
the court developed at when issues were
procedurally waived or when they were

504
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:26,264
barred,

505
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:26,781
uh,

506
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:31,340
that a person could show cause that is
a reason external to the defense and

507
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,630
actual prejudice,

508
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,291
uh,

509
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,540
and have the issue heard by the court.

510
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,690
But what if the person can't show cause,

511
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:39,680
uh,

512
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,630
or actual prejudice?

513
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,800
Usually there's going to be prejudice
in the cases that involve innocence.

514
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:46,530
Uh,

515
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,920
the court has said where the
constitutional violation,

516
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:51,840
that is the issue that wasn't preserved,

517
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,140
probably resulted in the conviction
of a person who's actually innocent of

518
00:17:57,471 --> 00:18:00,330
federal habeas court may grant the writ,

519
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,860
even though there's no showing of
cause for the procedural default.

520
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,640
And the court has made clear that the
showing is that is probably resulted in

521
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,970
the conviction of an innocent person.

522
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,020
Uh,

523
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,090
the court can grant the writ.

524
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,550
Now it takes a constitutional violation.

525
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,540
That is,

526
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,270
there was a failure to
disclose exculpatory evidence.

527
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,430
It wasn't known until just now.

528
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,170
It's now being brought before the court
and the constitution of violation.

529
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:33,630
If you look at the facts and the
facts develop from those facts,

530
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,560
show that the person is actually
innocent or ineffective.

531
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:38,730
Assistance of counsel,

532
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,680
failure of council to do certain things.

533
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,840
And we know now that if
council had done those things,

534
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:43,440
uh,

535
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,030
the person would be innocent.

536
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:49,920
So it's going to be a combination
of a constitutional violation and,

537
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,120
uh,

538
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,410
evidence of innocence.

539
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:55,440
It's got to establish the
innocence of the person.

540
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:57,150
If that constitutional violation has hurt.

541
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,570
Now let's look at what happens to a
person who doesn't find out about the

542
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,520
evidence of innocence of
the constitutional violation
until after they've been

543
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:11,880
through the federal habeas corpus process.

544
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:12,930
Uh,

545
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:13,651
the supreme,

546
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:16,530
the Congress did this in writing,

547
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,010
uh,

548
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,100
this part of the antiterrorism
and effective death penalty act,

549
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,950
which was adopted in 1996.

550
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,780
A person can try to bring a claim of
innocence tied to a constitutional

551
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:28,614
violation,

552
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,250
uh,

553
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,950
but only if the underlying facts,

554
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,150
if proven and viewed in light of
all the evidence from the trial.

555
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,130
All the evidence that we have as a whole
would be sufficient to establish by

556
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:43,080
clear and convincing evidence,

557
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,670
not probably,

558
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:47,670
but by clear and convincing evidence that,

559
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:49,890
but for the constitutional era,

560
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,220
no reasonable fact finder would have
found the applicant that is the petitioner

561
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,260
guilty of the underlying offense,

562
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,450
some much higher standard.

563
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,990
And the law requires that the petition
first be presented to the United States

564
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:07,170
Court of Appeals.

565
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,590
Three judges here.

566
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:11,100
It decide based on that hearing,

567
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:14,730
whether the papers make
out a sufficient showing,

568
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:15,601
uh,

569
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:17,580
that the person may be innocent,

570
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,361
uh,

571
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:21,960
and that they can make this showing
by clear and convincing evidence,

572
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,420
uh,

573
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,510
that no reasonable fact finder a
would have found the person goatee

574
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,400
extraordinarily high standard to meet.

575
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,990
If the court finds that,

576
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,060
then it sends it to the District Court
for a hearing in which the evidence will

577
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:37,710
actually be presented.

578
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,400
Uh,

579
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,910
but it makes it very difficult
to get back into court.

580
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:42,480
Uh,

581
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,720
once someone has had a
federal habeas corpus hearing,

582
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,230
what about a case in which it's found
that there's a constitutional violation

583
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:53,050
affecting the penalty phase of the case.

584
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,210
And maybe if this had come to light,

585
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:58,780
the person would have a stronger
showing a mitigating circumstances and,

586
00:20:59,030 --> 00:20:59,460
and,

587
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,330
and maybe it would not have
been sentenced to death.

588
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,050
Uh,

589
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:07,030
the Supreme Court has said that in order
to meet this standard with regard to

590
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:08,350
the sentencing phase,

591
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,390
with regard to the
sentence that is imposed,

592
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,030
the person has to show that,

593
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:14,830
but for the constitutional violation,

594
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:18,100
the person would not have been
eligible for the death penalty.

595
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,360
This is almost never going to be the
case because if you have any case where

596
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:25,300
there's one aggravating circumstance,

597
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:25,721
uh,

598
00:21:25,721 --> 00:21:27,850
the person's eligible for the death Polly,

599
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,690
it's going to be the very rare case where
the constitutional violations is going

600
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:34,090
to show that that
aggravating circumstance,

601
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:34,810
uh,

602
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,310
would not be valid,

603
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:37,930
although there could be such a case,

604
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:38,650
uh,

605
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:43,150
but for the kinds of errors that really
affect the penalty phase of capital

606
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:43,984
trials,

607
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,440
uh,

608
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,440
no relief either for procedural bars
or in Second Habeas Corpus petitions,

609
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:52,803
um,

610
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,370
in Herrera versus Collins.

611
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,640
Linelle Herrera,

612
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,540
uh,

613
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,220
didn't have constitutional violation.

614
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,820
He came before the court right before
he was to be executed by Texas and

615
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:08,620
presented what has been referred to
as a free standing claim of innocence.

616
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,250
Uh,

617
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:09,701
that is,

618
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:10,091
he said,

619
00:22:10,091 --> 00:22:13,690
I've got new evidence and the new
evidence shows that I'm innocent.

620
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:14,981
A bite.

621
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:16,870
It's not tied to a
constitutional violation.

622
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,970
It's just new evidence.

623
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:19,780
Uh,

624
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,780
Supreme Court and a decision by
chief justice Rehnquist said the,

625
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,230
in order to bring this
Habeas Corpus action,

626
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:29,980
uh,

627
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,500
there has to be a
constitutional violation.

628
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:38,130
You can't bring a habeas case just based
on a freestanding claim of innocence.

629
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,730
But then in order to get the votes
of Justice Kennedy and just O'Connor,

630
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,740
he adds a paragraph,

631
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,610
uh,

632
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,690
near the end that says,

633
00:22:46,691 --> 00:22:51,691
we may assume for the sake of argument
that a truly persuasive showing of

634
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,104
innocence,

635
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,621
uh,

636
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:54,670
would render the,

637
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,330
uh,

638
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,930
execution unconstitutional and
be a basis for habeas relief.

639
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,670
But Herrera's evidence,

640
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:01,450
uh,

641
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,230
the court makes clear it didn't think
was very strong at all and certainly not

642
00:23:05,231 --> 00:23:07,420
strong enough to make that showing.

643
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:08,351
Uh,

644
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:11,590
the court says the fail safe
here is executive clemency,

645
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:12,641
uh,

646
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,580
and says quite a bit about executive
clemency and the value of it.

647
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,060
Uh,

648
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,100
the problem was in Texas,

649
00:23:18,101 --> 00:23:22,480
there's never really been much executive
clemency because the decisions are made

650
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:27,481
by an 18 member board that never meets
as a group in facts is things around to

651
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,374
each other.

652
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:29,770
Uh,

653
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:33,070
and never really recommends
clemency for anybody.

654
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:33,611
Uh,

655
00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:35,890
so it's not much of a fail safe in Texas.

656
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:36,724
It may be,

657
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,170
uh,

658
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,440
in some other places,

659
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,790
uh,

660
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,840
justice O'Connor,

661
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:41,710
uh,

662
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,670
joined by,

663
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,270
uh,

664
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,560
Justice Kennedy says,

665
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,660
I certainly say that if
it's a truly persuasive,

666
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,220
a showing of innocence,

667
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:52,040
that a person should get
habeas corpus relief,

668
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:52,820
uh,

669
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,870
justice white,

670
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:54,590
uh,

671
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:59,590
says only if no rational trier of fact
could find proof beyond a reasonable

672
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:00,884
doubt.

673
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,491
Uh,

674
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:03,320
Justice Scalia and Thomas,

675
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,280
uh,

676
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,470
say that there's nothing
in the constitution,

677
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:09,710
nothing in the text and the
traditions of the country or practice,

678
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,490
uh,

679
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,580
that requires the court to entertain
and claim of innocence at all.

680
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,940
A Texas attorney general was
asked her an oral argument.

681
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:20,840
You mean if there was a videotape that
showed this person was somewhere else at

682
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:23,900
the time of the crime or showed the crime
and that this person didn't commit it,

683
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,330
you're saying they
could still be executed?

684
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,770
And the answer was yes.

685
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,420
That's what we're saying,

686
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,111
a,

687
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:32,360
that if there's no
constitutional violation,

688
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,410
uh,

689
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,890
the court has no jurisdiction
and nothing to look at.

690
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:37,790
Uh,

691
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:42,410
justice Blackmun joined by justice
Stevens and justice Souter dissented,

692
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,250
uh,

693
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,830
saying that the standard ought to be,

694
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:47,870
whether in light of new evidence,

695
00:24:47,871 --> 00:24:50,750
the result of the trial is sufficiently,

696
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,650
uh,

697
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,610
reliable,

698
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,090
uh,

699
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,700
for the state to be able
to carry out its execution.

700
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,253
So far,

701
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,340
nobody has been able to make a
freestanding claim of innocence.

702
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:05,450
Some judges on the Sixth Circuit Court
of Appeals thought that Paul House had in

703
00:25:05,451 --> 00:25:06,284
his case,

704
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:06,710
uh,

705
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,730
but the supreme court,

706
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:12,550
while finding that house had
made a sufficient showing
to go back and put it on

707
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,670
his claim of innocence,

708
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,420
uh,

709
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,370
found that it was not
a freestanding climb,

710
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:18,920
but he had constitutional
issues in there as well.

711
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,533
Well,

712
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,800
finally,

713
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,740
we'll just take a moment
and talk about Glen Ford,

714
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,731
uh,

715
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:28,210
released in March of 2014,

716
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,150
uh,

717
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,290
after 30 years.

718
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,131
I mean,

719
00:25:31,131 --> 00:25:35,090
this is what happens when
innocent people are convicted.

720
00:25:35,091 --> 00:25:36,830
30 years of this man's life,

721
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:37,580
uh,

722
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,031
gone.

723
00:25:38,031 --> 00:25:39,440
This was taken by his lawyer.

724
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:41,540
This picture of him was
taken by his lawyer,

725
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,171
uh,

726
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:47,171
on the very first day that he was out
after spending 30 years that the notorious

727
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,140
Angola prison and death row in Louisiana.

728
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,340
Uh,

729
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,610
and you see the reasons for
wrongful convictions in this case,

730
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:01,090
the lead attorney was an oil and gas
lawyer who had never tried a case,

731
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,650
never tried a case to a jury,

732
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:06,710
either a civil case or a criminal case.

733
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,920
The other lawyer working on the case
was two years out of law school.

734
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,390
He worked for an insurance defense
firm and he tried slip and fall cases,

735
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:15,230
cases where,

736
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,130
uh,

737
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,730
people would sue a restaurant because
somebody slipped and fell and broke their

738
00:26:19,731 --> 00:26:20,510
hip or whatever.

739
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,220
He would defend the,

740
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,940
the restaurant for the
insurance company in this case,

741
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:27,400
which was tried in Shreveport,

742
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,071
Keto parish,

743
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:28,660
Louisiana.

744
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,010
The prosecutors used all of their strive,

745
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:35,330
user jury strikes to eliminate
all the black people from serving.

746
00:26:35,331 --> 00:26:38,270
So Glen Ford was tried
by an all white jury.

747
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,201
And as I said,

748
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:40,070
he went to,

749
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,290
uh,

750
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,770
Louisiana state penitentiary,

751
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:44,490
the Angola prison,

752
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,420
uh,

753
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,610
spent 30 years on death row there.

754
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,560
And then after 30 years,

755
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:54,210
the prosecutors announced that
they had credible evidence,

756
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,020
uh,

757
00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:00,020
that Ford was neither president or a
participant or an any way involved in the

758
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:03,660
robbery and the murder of
the victim in this case,

759
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,740
uh,

760
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,000
30 years of a man's life.

761
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:06,834
It's a long time,

762
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:07,711
uh,

763
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,090
at least he wasn't executed.

764
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,920
But what we've learned from what we've
been talking about and so much more,

765
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,740
uh,

766
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,530
is that this criminal courts,

767
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:18,750
the criminal courts do make mistakes.

768
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,920
Uh,

769
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,430
and very often the mistakes
are found serendipitously.

770
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,660
Uh,

771
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,380
sometimes the people have been exonerated
because the journalism school at

772
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:30,180
Northwestern law school,

773
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:30,960
uh,

774
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,070
for people on Illinois to throw are
found innocent by journalism students.

775
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:35,610
Uh,

776
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,350
sometimes it's DNA testing.

777
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,760
Uh,

778
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,760
sometimes it's lawyers that do
extraordinary investigations
and work over years

779
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:46,020
and years and years to finally
figure out what happened in cases,

780
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,870
but many times they're
not those people there.

781
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:54,470
And what we know is that this criminal
justice system makes mistakes that

782
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:59,601
innocent people are indeed convicted
far more than people realized,

783
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:00,940
uh,

784
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,320
that the poor legal representation
is a critical part of that.

785
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:05,790
But only one part of it,

786
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:06,930
uh,

787
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:11,460
that is long as the courts are
making decisions based on things like

788
00:28:11,461 --> 00:28:12,510
identification,

789
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,460
based on things like informants,

790
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,930
those sorts of things.

791
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,080
There are going to be
mistakes and unfortunately and
tragically in some capital

792
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:22,314
cases,

793
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,100
uh,

794
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,130
without the kind of extraordinary
work that we've seen.

795
00:28:26,131 --> 00:28:27,030
In some cases,

796
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:31,680
those are going to be fatal mistakes and
innocent people will in fact be put to

797
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:32,514
death as,

798
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,840
as I think they had been already.
