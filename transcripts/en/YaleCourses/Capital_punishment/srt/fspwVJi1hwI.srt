1
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:16,060
We've talked before in the class about
aggravating circumstances and about those

2
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:18,280
being the reasons to
give the death penalty.

3
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:19,330
Uh,

4
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,870
we saw that the mandatory death
penalty statutes were struck down,

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:23,590
uh,

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,550
because there was no consideration of
the individual offender that was taken

7
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:28,330
into account.

8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,330
The Supreme Court in 1976 in the cases
that we looked at back at that time,

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,660
uh,

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,820
the three that were upheld from Florida,

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,380
Georgia and Texas,

12
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:40,270
and the two that were struck
down from Earth Carolina,

13
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:41,104
Louisiana.

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,591
Uh,

15
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:43,870
the fatal problem with the North Carolina,

16
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:47,470
Louisiana statutes were that they did
not allow for consideration of the

17
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:48,730
individual person.

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,480
Uh,

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,590
the court upheld,

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,040
uh,

21
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,900
the Georgia and Florida statutes that
provided for mitigating circumstances.

22
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:58,300
Georgia statute just said
anything in mitigation.

23
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:03,310
Florida gave a long list of mitigating
factors and then Texas as three special

24
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,144
questions.

25
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,500
But the idea was that the,

26
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,770
the jury would be able
to take into account,

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,340
uh,

28
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,370
things about the person
when they decided that,

29
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,001
uh,

30
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:14,110
as the court said,

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:14,830
uh,

32
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,160
the diverse frailties of humankind,

33
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,150
this was in Woodson versus North Carolina,

34
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:19,811
uh,

35
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:20,890
was required.

36
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,083
Uh,

37
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:22,301
now,

38
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:23,134
normally,

39
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,681
uh,

40
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:27,310
the scope of sentencing and what
can come in at sensing is decided by

41
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:27,881
legislature.

42
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:29,170
So by statutes,

43
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:29,870
uh,

44
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,210
and non capital cases,

45
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:31,961
they decide,

46
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:32,561
for example,

47
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:35,650
in the federal system what is going
to be taken into account under the

48
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:36,700
sentencing guidelines.

49
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:37,301
Uh,

50
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:40,230
the question that comes before the United
States Supreme Court that we're going

51
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:41,200
to talk about today,

52
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:41,950
uh,

53
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,150
is now that we know there has to
be individualized consideration.

54
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,020
Uh,

55
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,120
how broad is that or how narrow is that?

56
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:49,630
A,

57
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,890
can the states decide,

58
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:51,461
uh,

59
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:56,170
what factors can be considered as
Florida did with its list of mitigating

60
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:57,004
factors?

61
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,670
And we're going to see where the
Ohio statute a very clear example,

62
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,000
uh,

63
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,680
of a limit on mitigation and then what
the Supreme Court says as a matter of

64
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,270
constitutional law.

65
00:02:07,271 --> 00:02:09,610
In the case of a woman
named Sandra Lockett,

66
00:02:09,611 --> 00:02:12,310
who was involved in a pawnshop robbery,

67
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:12,880
uh,

68
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,713
in Ohio,

69
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,351
uh,

70
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:16,720
if ever there was a sympathetic case,

71
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,650
if a murder case can ever be a sympathetic
case to come before the Supreme

72
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:20,950
Court,

73
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:21,251
uh,

74
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:23,080
it was Sandra lockets case.

75
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:23,590
Uh,

76
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,940
she was 21 years old.

77
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,070
She had no prior record
of any serious misconduct,

78
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:30,701
and she,

79
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:32,110
and a man named Al Parker,

80
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,950
Nathan road,

81
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,150
drew and her brother,

82
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:34,690
uh,

83
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,810
were involved in the
robbery of a pawn shop.

84
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,610
There was no plan to kill.

85
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,300
Uh,

86
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,320
but once the,

87
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:41,920
uh,

88
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,900
the people,

89
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:42,971
uh,

90
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:47,971
she's in the car a while the others go
in to rob the pawnbroker a pawnbroker.

91
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,181
Uh,

92
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:50,690
and while in there,

93
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,630
uh,

94
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,630
a fight breaks out and Parker
shoots and kills the pawn broker.

95
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,550
So he's the main person here in terms
of having committed the committed the

96
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:03,534
homicide.

97
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,140
Uh,

98
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,010
but he pleads,

99
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,240
he pleads guilty and testifies against
the other people in exchange for that,

100
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:10,290
he avoids the death pony.

101
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,080
This is your classic a plea bargaining,

102
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:13,710
uh,

103
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,060
in capital cases.

104
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,090
Lockets brother as tried
and sentenced to death,

105
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,751
uh,

106
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:20,100
and do a,

107
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:23,790
does not receive the death penalty because
it's found that his involvement was

108
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,010
primarily the product
of a mental deficiency.

109
00:03:26,011 --> 00:03:28,230
That is a mental limitations.

110
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:31,890
A excused him from the death poem and
then Sandra Lockett was sentenced to

111
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:32,670
death.

112
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,620
Now let's take a look at the Ohio Statute,

113
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,220
uh,

114
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,540
and what it provided,

115
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,410
uh,

116
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,730
with regard to,

117
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,780
uh,

118
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,690
how the death penalty was
going to be imposed in Ohio.

119
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,330
A seven aggravating circumstances.

120
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:50,100
A person if one or more of those is
found than the death penalty is imposed

121
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:51,780
unless the jury finds,

122
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,291
uh,

123
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,080
one of the three mitigating factors,

124
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,651
uh,

125
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:59,040
one of them being that
the victim of the offense,

126
00:03:59,070 --> 00:03:59,903
uh,

127
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,943
mmm,

128
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,810
uh,

129
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,370
induced or facilitated,

130
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:04,971
uh,

131
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:05,804
the crime.

132
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,890
Uh,

133
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,540
secondly that there was duress,

134
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,360
coercion or strong provocation involved.

135
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:11,860
Uh,

136
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,561
and finally,

137
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:14,480
and this is the one that applied to Mr Do,

138
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:14,931
uh,

139
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:18,950
that the offense was primarily the result
of the offenders psychosis or mental

140
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:19,784
deficiency.

141
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,250
None of these apply to Sandra Lockett.

142
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:22,760
Uh,

143
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,960
she's minimally involved.

144
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:26,640
She's out in the car while the
crime takes place in the pawn shop.

145
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,140
Uh,

146
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,640
she has some other factors,

147
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,121
uh,

148
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:30,380
that she wants to put forward,

149
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:31,670
which we'll talk about in a moment.

150
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,500
But what's Ohio trying to do here?

151
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,770
What Ohio is trying to do is follow what
the court said in the 1976 cases and

152
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:43,160
limit the consideration of aggravating
and mitigating circumstances.

153
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,420
So that it's the same in every case on
the theory that this will mean that the

154
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:50,900
death penalty will be
consistently imposed an Ohio,

155
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:51,801
uh,

156
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:56,300
the problem is it leaves
out considerations of some
fairly compelling mitigating

157
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:57,134
factors.

158
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,153
Ah,

159
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,850
what Sandra Lockett,

160
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:02,900
one of the court to hear.

161
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,450
Uh,

162
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,730
it was about her minor participation in
the crime and not only hear about it.

163
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,011
Of course,

164
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:07,844
they knew that,

165
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,211
uh,

166
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:09,044
from the,

167
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,920
uh,

168
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,910
from the trial,

169
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,330
uh,

170
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,070
but to take that into account,

171
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:13,630
uh,

172
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,590
as a mitigating factor,

173
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:15,780
uh,

174
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,770
as a reason not to give
her the death pony.

175
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,500
Uh,

176
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,590
she also had a testimony
of a psychologist,

177
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,251
uh,

178
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:24,830
that her prognosis for
rehabilitation was good,

179
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,461
uh,

180
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:29,750
that also she was in a drug treatment
program and she was on the road to

181
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:30,584
recovery.

182
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,281
Uh,

183
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:32,060
and,

184
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,331
uh,

185
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:36,650
these factors could not be taken
into account in deciding her sins.

186
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:37,484
And the judge,

187
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,000
uh,

188
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,890
seems to have some reluctance,

189
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:40,641
uh,

190
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:42,000
in imposing the death public.

191
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,190
Uh,

192
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:43,971
in this case,

193
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:48,020
Chief Justice Burger rights for the
court and he goes through at some length,

194
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,561
uh,

195
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:49,490
the plea bargaining,

196
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:49,920
uh,

197
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,120
the offer that was made to send
her lock at two weeks before trial.

198
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:53,670
Uh,

199
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,670
the offer that was made on the day of
trial and the offer that was made to her

200
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:02,840
to get a life sentence to plead guilty
and avoid the death penalty after Parker

201
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:04,430
testified at a trial.

202
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,181
Now,

203
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:10,181
normally settlement negotiations or plea
negotiations have no legal significance

204
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,204
whatsoever.

205
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:11,810
Uh,

206
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,980
but what Chief Justice Burger is clearly
communicating here is that the state

207
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:20,360
really didn't believe that it had to
have the death pony for Sandra Lockett.

208
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,850
It was willing to give her a plea bargain.

209
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,421
Uh,

210
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:27,620
and this is unusual and that all the
plea offers are set out in the Supreme

211
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,453
Court's opinion,

212
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,000
uh,

213
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,833
and brings,

214
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:30,170
uh,

215
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,910
the court to the conclusion,

216
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:32,571
uh,

217
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:36,450
in terms of what can be
considered a and a judge.

218
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,010
She says,

219
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:41,090
Burger writing for the court says that
the eighth and 14th amendment required

220
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:46,091
that the sensor in all but the very
rarest cases is not to be prevented from

221
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,690
considering as a mitigating factor,

222
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,730
any aspect,

223
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,270
uh,

224
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,000
of the life and background
and circumstances,

225
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:53,631
uh,

226
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:57,500
of the defendant as well of course
as the circumstances of the crime.

227
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,090
But any factors,

228
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,510
uh,

229
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:04,400
proffered by the defense as a
basis for sentence less than death,

230
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,150
uh,

231
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,470
failure to consider this,

232
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:07,071
he says,

233
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:11,570
we'll run the risk of the death
police being imposed despite,

234
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,050
uh,

235
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,550
factors that may cause for may
be rezoned for a lesser sentence.

236
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,110
Uh,

237
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,360
and therefore that would be arbitrary
under the eighth amendment that if someone

238
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:22,670
like Sandra Lockett is
receiving the death penalty,

239
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,800
even though they're factors that call,

240
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:25,370
uh,

241
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,370
for her to receive a lesser sins that
violates the eighth amendment's protection

242
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:32,450
against cruel and unusual punishment.

243
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:33,110
Uh,

244
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,320
whether there's not a
unanimity with regard to this,

245
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:37,370
a justice white,

246
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:37,990
uh,

247
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,721
it says this is,

248
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:40,070
we're just going right back to farming.

249
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,460
We're going back to completely unfettered
discretion by juries if they can

250
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:51,311
consider anything and then decide on the
death pony based on anything that's put

251
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:52,250
before them.

252
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:52,401
Uh,

253
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:53,570
we're right back to Fermin.

254
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,890
Interestingly,

255
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,521
uh,

256
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:57,950
when we looked at an
aggravating circumstances,

257
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,401
uh,

258
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:01,850
after the supreme court
decided Zant versus Stevens,

259
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,960
the case that said,

260
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:05,030
once the jury finds an aggravating factor,

261
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:08,600
it can consider anything and impose
whatever punishment it wants.

262
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,280
Justice Marshall had said,

263
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,870
we've gone back to Fermin.

264
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,380
So now we have justices on both
sides of the court who are saying,

265
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:15,831
we're,

266
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:16,170
we're,

267
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:16,550
we're,

268
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,870
we are risking now,

269
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,271
uh,

270
00:08:18,271 --> 00:08:22,460
the arbitrary imposition of the death
pony that we found to be unconstitutional

271
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,830
in Furman versus Georgia.

272
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,470
This case could not be more important,

273
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,400
uh,

274
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,240
because,

275
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,930
uh,

276
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,650
what,

277
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,071
uh,

278
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:33,590
the Supreme Court is saying here is that,

279
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,520
uh,

280
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,353
the defendant,

281
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,110
the defense council decides
what's going to be admitted,

282
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:39,891
uh,

283
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:40,610
in,

284
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,443
uh,

285
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,613
uh,

286
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,760
mitigation in a,

287
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,601
in a case.

288
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:45,141
In other words,

289
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:50,000
the state can't decide that these three
mitigating factors like Ohio did are the

290
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:54,080
only three things to be account taken
into account or that the long list that

291
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:54,621
Florida had,

292
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:57,960
which was much more many
more mitigating factors.

293
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,541
Uh,

294
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:58,830
it,

295
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,570
it has to be not only those,

296
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,890
but anything that the defense proffers
as the basis for a sentence less than

297
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:05,610
death.

298
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,340
And as the death pony develops
after the Lockett case,

299
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:08,801
uh,

300
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:09,320
these,

301
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,511
uh,

302
00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:12,990
become critical in terms of what evidence
is going to be admitted at the penalty

303
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:13,710
phase,

304
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,131
uh,

305
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:15,270
of capital case.

306
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,290
Um,

307
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,010
we see this applied again in the
case of a Eddings versus Oklahoma.

308
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:21,480
This is a 16 year old youth,

309
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,140
uh,

310
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,973
who was,

311
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,120
uh,

312
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,150
convicted and sentenced to death in
Oklahoma for the murder of a state

313
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:27,984
patrolman.

314
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:28,530
Uh,

315
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,540
he had three aggravating factors,

316
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:30,871
heinous,

317
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,700
atrocious and cruel,

318
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,370
avoiding arrest and future dangerousness.

319
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,060
Uh,

320
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,770
the trial judge admitted evidence,

321
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:38,551
uh,

322
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:40,110
of his trouble youth.

323
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:43,740
The fact that his parents divorced
when he was just five years old,

324
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,220
uh,

325
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,630
that his mother was an alcoholic,

326
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:46,830
probably a prostitute,

327
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,371
a,

328
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:50,970
that he was not supervised and that he
was excessively punished by his father.

329
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,530
All this evidence comes in,

330
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,880
but the judge,

331
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:55,710
and this was a sentencing not by a jury,

332
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,760
but by a judge.

333
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,630
The judge says that he
cannot take into account,

334
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,180
uh,

335
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,780
the facts of Eddings violent background.

336
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:04,830
Uh,

337
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,300
Supreme Court decides,

338
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:06,730
uh,

339
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,220
that that violates,

340
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,323
um,

341
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,460
lock it versus,

342
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:10,571
oh,

343
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:11,340
hi,

344
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,780
chief justice Berger who wrote,

345
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:15,330
lock it now to parts company
with a court and says,

346
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,164
wait a minute.

347
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,160
Uh,

348
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:18,390
this is just semantics.

349
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:18,751
Uh,

350
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,584
the judge,

351
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,550
uh,

352
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,840
received all the evidence.

353
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:22,740
Uh,

354
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,240
Miss,

355
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,460
uh,

356
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,300
what he said,

357
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:24,720
uh,

358
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,230
shouldn't be a basis for setting aside
with the majority of the court said,

359
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,080
you've got to not only admit
the mitigating evidence,

360
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,670
but it has to be considered.

361
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:35,100
It has to be a part of
the weighing process,

362
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:40,080
which is what Oklahoma had a has to be
part of the weighing process in deciding

363
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,570
whether or not to give the death pelvic
and Hitchcock versus Dugger the Supreme

364
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:45,570
Court.

365
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,620
And one of the rare times in all of
its stuff pulling cases is unanimous,

366
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,210
nine to nothing,

367
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:51,871
uh,

368
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:56,700
with Justice Scalia writing for the court
and striking down a jury instruction

369
00:10:56,701 --> 00:11:01,701
in Florida that limited the mitigating
circumstances to just the mitigating

370
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,330
those set out in the statute.

371
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,573
Uh,

372
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,521
this is,

373
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:06,030
uh,

374
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,900
we're going to see,

375
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,451
uh,

376
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:09,570
that this does not last long.

377
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,070
Uh,

378
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,300
the Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas,

379
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:14,250
they're going to part company with this,

380
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:15,600
but at least at this one time,

381
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,960
a 1987 when Hitchcock was decided this
was the one place where the court was in

382
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:25,920
complete agreement that anything about
the life and background and the person,

383
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,520
uh,

384
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,540
should be considered.

385
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,220
What about the Texas statute though?

386
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,120
Uh,

387
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,140
we recall that we,

388
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,990
when we looked at that when we talked
about aggravating circumstances,

389
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,441
uh,

390
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:37,080
Texas has these three special questions.

391
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,471
Uh,

392
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:38,520
was it deliberate?

393
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,151
Uh,

394
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:41,740
is the person a future danger,

395
00:11:41,741 --> 00:11:43,830
a probability that there'll
be a future danger?

396
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:44,401
Uh,

397
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:46,200
and was there provocation,

398
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,040
uh,

399
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,960
how is mitigating our,

400
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:52,170
how our mitigating factors
considered in the Texas,

401
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,470
uh,

402
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,303
scheme of,

403
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,250
uh,

404
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,320
the supreme court had
rejected a challenge,

405
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:56,890
uh,

406
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:57,491
in a case,

407
00:11:57,491 --> 00:11:58,990
Franklin versus [inaudible],

408
00:11:59,380 --> 00:11:59,860
uh,

409
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,090
in which he had wanted to put on
or said his evidence in mitigation,

410
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,220
which was as good behavior in prison,

411
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:06,850
uh,

412
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,280
could not be considered
under these three questions.

413
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:09,851
Uh,

414
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:10,960
but the supreme court said,

415
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:14,830
actually it could be considered a
under the questions and therefore,

416
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,221
uh,

417
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:17,080
because when you're looking
at future dangerousness,

418
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:19,240
one thing you could ask
and looking at that is,

419
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,320
has the person,

420
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,790
uh,

421
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,440
adjusted well to prison or jail,

422
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:23,891
uh,

423
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:24,730
in the past.

424
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,151
Uh,

425
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:26,410
so that was rejected,

426
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:29,470
but a very different cases
presented by John Paul penry.

427
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,430
Uh,

428
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,720
his mitigating factor is
his intellectual disability,

429
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,590
or at the time referred to in the
Supreme Court case as mental retardation.

430
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,210
Uh,

431
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,200
and he says that under the three,

432
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:41,820
uh,

433
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,180
Texas questions,

434
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:43,901
uh,

435
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:44,800
this cannot,

436
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,610
uh,

437
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,720
be considered,

438
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,680
uh,

439
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,850
justice O'Connor accepts that argument
for the court and says that evidence of

440
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,300
intellectual disability is
relevant to moral culpability,

441
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:55,920
uh,

442
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,170
so that the jury can express
what she often says in her cases,

443
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,320
a reasoned moral response,

444
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:02,980
uh,

445
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,730
to,

446
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,030
uh,

447
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,400
the crime and the defendants
that are before it.

448
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,181
Uh,

449
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:08,590
and she points out that this,

450
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,280
uh,

451
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,570
evidence of intellectual disability
could not be considered under the,

452
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,380
uh,

453
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,180
three questions that Texas has.

454
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,051
A,

455
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:19,060
it's not appropriate for deliberateness.

456
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:19,481
Uh,

457
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:21,130
it doesn't go to future dangerousness.

458
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:21,641
She points out,

459
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:22,060
it goes,

460
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,230
it cuts both ways because the person
who is intellectually disabled,

461
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:26,710
uh,

462
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,180
may not learn from their mistakes,

463
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:29,140
may not plan,

464
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,730
and therefore it may be a future
danger or it could be used by a jury to

465
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:35,200
conclude that they're a future danger.

466
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:35,561
And of course,

467
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:37,000
it doesn't go to provocation.

468
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:37,541
Uh,

469
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:37,831
the,

470
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:38,040
the,

471
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,550
the last question that's asked,

472
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,600
uh,

473
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,860
here we see the court starting
to disagree about this.

474
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:45,820
Justice Scalia,

475
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:46,390
uh,

476
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,710
writes a descending opinion.

477
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:49,810
He's joined by justice
Rehnquist white and Kennedy.

478
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:50,830
So this is a five,

479
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,360
a to four opinion.

480
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,403
He says,

481
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,010
uh,

482
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,270
Texas has done a perfectly
fine job guiding the
discretion of the jury with the

483
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,400
three questions and we
should leave it alone.

484
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:00,941
Uh,

485
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,110
the Supreme Court has,

486
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,920
uh,

487
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,753
no,

488
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,480
uh,

489
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,313
business,

490
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,333
uh,

491
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:11,550
telling Texas how it is to consider a
mitigating factors is justice Scalia puts

492
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,131
it somewhat.

493
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:12,964
Carl flee,

494
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,470
uh,

495
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,010
this puts all sympathetic factors are
just to be dumped before the jury,

496
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:18,550
uh,

497
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,040
for an outpouring of personal reaction.

498
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,640
And of course what he's saying there
is this is going to be arbitrary too.

499
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:26,170
So the argument is one,

500
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,170
if you don't consider the
individual circumstances,

501
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,340
it will be arbitrary.

502
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:30,940
Uh,

503
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,260
but if you do allow anything to be
taken into account in mitigation,

504
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,710
the death planning is going
to be imposed a arbitrarily,

505
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,460
uh,

506
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,460
in two cases that came not long after
that 1990 Walton versus Arizona and in

507
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,230
1993 grand versus Collins,

508
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:47,890
uh,

509
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,890
Justice Scalia and justice Thomas reject
the Woodson lock at line of cases.

510
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:58,880
That is the cases that say that any
thing offered as a basis for a sentence,

511
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:01,370
less than death has to be
admitted in mitigation.

512
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,420
Uh,

513
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,890
Justice Scalia says in Walton
that there's an inherent tension,

514
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,761
uh,

515
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:12,680
between the requirements of aggregation
that limiting aggravating circumstances

516
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,800
and having unlimited
mitigating circumstances,

517
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,581
uh,

518
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:19,040
and that these contradictory commands,

519
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:19,970
uh,

520
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,050
does not constrain the discretion of
the jury in the way that it should be.

521
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:24,861
Uh,

522
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:26,030
and so his question,

523
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:27,470
and this is what I raised earlier,

524
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,900
whether society,

525
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,450
uh,

526
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:34,450
may specify what factors are going to
be taken into account in sentencing or

527
00:15:35,631 --> 00:15:35,901
not.

528
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:36,501
And in other words,

529
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:38,870
could the state legislature decide,

530
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,340
as Ohio did,

531
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,660
these are the only three
mitigating factors or as Florida,

532
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,140
these are the mitigating factors,

533
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,560
uh,

534
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,210
that we're going to allow.

535
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,110
Uh,

536
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:48,943
as a result,

537
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,430
uh,

538
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,010
he decides that he will no longer follow,

539
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:52,640
uh,

540
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,130
the Woodson locket line of cases.

541
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:56,300
And so from now on,

542
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:01,250
Justice Scalia dissents from any case
involving a consideration of mitigating

543
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:05,810
circumstances where the court says there
was a unconstitutional limitation on

544
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:06,644
that.

545
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,483
Um,

546
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,443
the,

547
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:08,780
uh,

548
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,080
justice Thomas basically the same
thing in grand versus Collins.

549
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:13,370
He takes a different approach.

550
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,340
Says Fermin was a case
about racial discrimination,

551
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,090
uh,

552
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,030
points out that the power
to be lenient is also,

553
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,631
uh,

554
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:21,500
the power,

555
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,040
uh,

556
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,210
to discriminate a and says that
the state should be allowed,

557
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,020
uh,

558
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,800
to,

559
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,370
uh,

560
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,440
limit consideration or mitigating factors.

561
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:30,831
In fact,

562
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:31,664
in his opinion,

563
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,780
just as Thomas,

564
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,530
uh,

565
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,250
in Graham versus Collins makes it pretty
clear that he does not have any problem

566
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,560
with the mandatory death pony statutes.

567
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,041
Uh,

568
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:43,340
that saying that some crimes are so bad
that there always should be punished

569
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:44,090
with death.

570
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:44,511
Uh,

571
00:16:44,511 --> 00:16:47,030
as far as he's concerned
is not violate anything.

572
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,520
Uh,

573
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,560
in the eighth amendment,

574
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,790
uh,

575
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,210
justice Stevens responds to both opinions.

576
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:53,871
Uh,

577
00:16:53,871 --> 00:16:55,820
and he says four things.

578
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:56,480
First,

579
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,360
the death penalty is not
allowed for certain offenses,

580
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,071
uh,

581
00:17:00,071 --> 00:17:02,090
that a number of a rape,

582
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:02,931
uh,

583
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:03,441
other,

584
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:03,770
uh,

585
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:08,770
non homicide cases are no longer even
considered eligible for the death point of

586
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:09,351
kidnapping,

587
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:10,011
armed robbery,

588
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:10,341
other,

589
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:11,420
other crimes like that.

590
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,140
Uh,

591
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,711
secondly,

592
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:17,540
the aggravating circumstances narrow the
class of people who can be considered

593
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:18,051
for the death.

594
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:18,680
Polly,

595
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,670
and this is what the eighth amendment
requires to narrow the class of people who

596
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:23,504
are eligible.

597
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,680
Uh,

598
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,400
he also says the vague and
overbroad aggravating circumstances,

599
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:29,160
um,

600
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,600
uh,

601
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:29,891
are,

602
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:31,220
are not allowed actually,

603
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,030
uh,

604
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,451
as,

605
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:36,380
as we discussed when we talked
about a aggravating factors,

606
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,340
uh,

607
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:41,810
the courts have said that those catch
all aggravating circumstances like

608
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,111
heinous,

609
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:43,250
atrocious and cruel,

610
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:43,940
uh,

611
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,080
can be considered as long as the state
supreme court gives them a limiting

612
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:48,914
instruction.

613
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:49,251
Uh,

614
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:50,260
so whether that's as great,

615
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:51,360
greater protection as,

616
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:51,800
as,

617
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,140
as,

618
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,460
as he says in the opinion,

619
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,050
uh,

620
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:54,280
is,

621
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,290
is questionable.

622
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:55,921
Uh,

623
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:57,000
and finally,

624
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:57,480
uh,

625
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,590
that the consideration of whatever is
offered as a basis for a sentence less

626
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:02,424
than death,

627
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,570
it's consideration of mitigating
circumstances actually further narrows the

628
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:10,170
class because things like abuse,

629
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,310
mental illness,

630
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,700
in this case a intellectual disability.

631
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,200
Those are factors that may call for a
sentence less than death and do coffers

632
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:22,350
sentence less than death in
some cases such as penry.

633
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,910
And so once the death point has
been narrowed by the first three,

634
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,130
then the jury can consider in mitigation,

635
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:29,551
uh,

636
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:30,384
anything,

637
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:30,931
uh,

638
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:31,281
in,

639
00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:34,980
in order to decide the ultimate
question of life and death.

640
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,203
Um,

641
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,970
finally I want to take a look at
a ton are versus a direct fee.

642
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:46,971
This was a case in which the courts have
both Texas and the United States Court

643
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:50,670
of Appeals for the fifth circuit
had limited mitigating factors.

644
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:54,840
One limitation they had put on it was
to say that mitigating factors had to be

645
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:56,280
uniquely severe.

646
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:01,140
These are a number of cases that came
back after the penry decision in which

647
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,640
Texas had to decide,

648
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,733
um,

649
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,150
whether or not the Texas
Court of criminal appeals.

650
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,960
And ultimately the United States Court
of Appeals for the fifth circuit had to

651
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:14,850
decide whether to Nard and others were
entitled a new sentencing hearings

652
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:18,900
because evidence of their
mental limitations or
intellectual disability was not

653
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:19,734
admitted.

654
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,370
Uh,

655
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,240
both courts,

656
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,160
a Texas Court of criminal appeals,

657
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:23,670
uh,

658
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,350
said we find no evidence that,

659
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,070
uh,

660
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,020
tonight is a mentally retarded.

661
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:30,150
So therefore there is no
constitutional violation.

662
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:30,984
In his case,

663
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,620
uh,

664
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,150
the United States Court of Appeals,

665
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:36,150
the fifth circuit said this was not a,

666
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,920
uh,

667
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,750
uniquely severe and permanent handicap,

668
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:40,410
uh,

669
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,800
which burdened the defendant through no
fault of his own and therefore there was

670
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:44,634
no problem.

671
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,150
Uh,

672
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:45,721
the other,

673
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:46,110
uh,

674
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,980
limitation,

675
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:47,461
uh,

676
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:52,461
was the notion that there had to be a
nexus between the mitigating factor and

677
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:53,761
the crime.

678
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:54,331
In other words,

679
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:59,331
the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
said no evidence that his low Iq and to

680
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:03,960
nards case prevented him from appreciating
the wrongfulness of his conduct,

681
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:04,730
uh,

682
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,820
and kept him from,

683
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:06,900
uh,

684
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,510
controlling his impulses
when this crime took place.

685
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,321
Uh,

686
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:11,310
and again,

687
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,770
the fifth circuit said
when it looked at the case,

688
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,280
uh,

689
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,280
there was no evidence that showed that
the crime was attributable to his low Iq.

690
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:22,890
Uh,

691
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,510
Supreme Court rejects that,

692
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:24,730
uh,

693
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,980
s six to three,

694
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:26,581
uh,

695
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:29,790
with justice O'Connor writing
a for a majority of the court.

696
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,290
She's joined by Steven's Kennedy,

697
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:31,591
Souter,

698
00:20:31,591 --> 00:20:32,650
Ginsburg and Bryer.

699
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,840
And she said these tests that the
court in Texas had applied and that the

700
00:20:36,841 --> 00:20:38,640
federal court had applied has no basis,

701
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:41,400
no foundation in the decisions
of the Supreme Court.

702
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,180
That there's no screening that's
done by a judge or by a court,

703
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:45,610
uh,

704
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:50,610
before evidence in has offered to see
if it's uniquely severe or if there's a

705
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:52,320
nexus between it.

706
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:52,950
Uh,

707
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,783
and the,

708
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,061
uh,

709
00:20:54,061 --> 00:20:57,420
the crime that was
committed that she repeats,

710
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:57,870
that,

711
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,170
uh,

712
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,020
mitigation has been very broadly defined,

713
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,850
says that a low Iq is
inherently mitigating,

714
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:09,390
even if it doesn't amount
to a mental retardation,

715
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,100
which would preclude the death penalty.

716
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,780
It may still be a compelling mitigating
factor if the person has limited

717
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,070
intellectual functioning.

718
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:17,940
Uh,

719
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,810
she says the court has spoken
in the most expansive terms,

720
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,511
uh,

721
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:26,310
and defining mitigation that
irrelevant mitigation is evidence,

722
00:21:26,311 --> 00:21:29,130
which tends to prove some
fact or circumstance,

723
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,060
which,

724
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,720
uh,

725
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,560
would be,

726
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,190
uh,

727
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,300
which a fact finder that is the jury
would find had mitigating value.

728
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,410
Uh,

729
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,500
chief justice Rehnquist
Scalia and Thomas dissent.

730
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,693
Uh,

731
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,080
but this is basically,

732
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,040
uh,

733
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,561
the,

734
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:45,180
uh,

735
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,570
uh,

736
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,890
state of the law today,

737
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:47,880
uh,

738
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,713
that the,

739
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,350
uh,

740
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,080
this prevailing view that,

741
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,620
uh,

742
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,760
anything offered in the lie about the
life and background of the defendant that

743
00:21:56,761 --> 00:21:59,970
seen as a basis for a sentence less than
death can be considered in mitigating

744
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,050
in mitigation.

745
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:01,710
Uh,

746
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,200
we will talk next with Susan Marcus,

747
00:22:04,201 --> 00:22:07,560
who has done a lot of work both in
investigating and finding mitigating

748
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:10,980
circumstances and also as a
lawyer in presenting it to juries.
