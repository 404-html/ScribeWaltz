1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,920
Most people facing the death
penalty don't pick their lawyer.

2
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,360
They may be fortunate to have
a lawyer who is a caring,

3
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:20,194
competent,

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:26,310
hardworking person with a enough of a
caseload or reasonable workload that they

5
00:00:26,351 --> 00:00:31,030
can provide the representation that's
required in a death penalty case.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,440
On the other hand,

7
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,060
a poor person accused of a crime
involving the death pony may be assigned a

8
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:38,770
lawyer who's completely incompetent,

9
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:39,280
uh,

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,080
who has 300 400 cases and can't possibly
spend the time that's required to

11
00:00:44,081 --> 00:00:45,310
defend a capital case.

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,510
They may be assigned a lawyer who
doesn't know the law regarding capital

13
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:50,111
punishment.

14
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:54,460
So that law might as well not
exist for this particular client.

15
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,470
So we'll take a look at the quality
of representation provided to people,

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:00:59,980
uh,

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,360
in death penalty cases,

18
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:01,961
uh,

19
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:06,961
because often the lawyer assigned to a
case is the determining factor on whether

20
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:10,330
somebody gets the death penalty or not.

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,320
Uh,

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,660
some states have capital defender offices.

23
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,440
Uh,

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,870
Colorado has had one for a long time.

25
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:20,740
It has only two or three people
usually on death row at any time,

26
00:01:20,741 --> 00:01:25,741
because that office has been so effective
in representing people and preventing

27
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,360
imposition of the death
pony in those cases.

28
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:29,381
On the other hand,

29
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:34,381
you have states like Texas and Alabama
that have no public defender system,

30
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,630
even not to mention a
capital defender office.

31
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,600
So if you're facing the death
plenty in one of those states,

32
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,000
and there are a number of
them all across the country,

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:43,840
uh,

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,900
it may be that the lawyer is the
lawyer from private practice.

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,720
It may be the lawyer doesn't
have an investigator.

36
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,201
Uh,

37
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:53,680
it may be the court doesn't provide
funding for experts or other,

38
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:53,980
uh,

39
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,880
essential,

40
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,930
uh,

41
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,640
aspects of defending a case.

42
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,301
Uh,

43
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:03,280
and the result is that person is to put
it mildly at a tremendous disadvantage,

44
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:03,850
uh,

45
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,020
facing the death penalty.

46
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,410
A number of examples of this are
provided@asecondclassjustice.com.

47
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,023
Um,

48
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,020
in this segment,

49
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:18,790
we're gonna look at a few examples
and explore the reasons why people,

50
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:19,660
uh,

51
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,660
can be condemned to die despite a
grossly incompetent legal representation.

52
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,680
Uh,

53
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,210
generally the right to counsel
is determined not before trial.

54
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,240
Does this person have a competent lawyer
who's going to represent them at the

55
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:39,241
trial but is determined after the trial
when the question is raised looking

56
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:40,510
backwards at the trial,

57
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,870
did the person have effective
assistance of counsel?

58
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,110
And we'll talk about how
the court has defined that,

59
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:47,690
uh,

60
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,690
in a way that makes it possible to
say a person was not defined effective

61
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:55,540
assistance of counsel even
when it's questionable,

62
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,790
whether even when a demonstrably,

63
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,301
uh,

64
00:02:58,301 --> 00:02:58,960
is,

65
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,793
is not true.

66
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,970
Uh,

67
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,900
generally that's the way.

68
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:02,820
There's some exceptions.

69
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,240
There have been lawsuits filed,

70
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:04,811
uh,

71
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,270
to improve representation in,

72
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,380
uh,

73
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,730
criminal cases by,

74
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,270
uh,

75
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,060
dealing with case loads or
other systemic problems.

76
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,280
But for the most part in capital cases,

77
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:19,840
particularly what we're going to see
is an after the fact looked back at the

78
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:21,940
representation that someone had.

79
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,990
And I want to use the case out
of Oklahoma of James Fisher,

80
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,441
uh,

81
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:27,520
as an example.

82
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,390
Uh,

83
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,390
he was tried in 1983 and represented by
a lawyer who not only represented James

84
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:34,600
Fisher,

85
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,930
but tried 24 other cases
during the month of September.

86
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:42,220
Hard to imagine that one
lawyer could try 24 cases.

87
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:47,530
He put on no evidence and said only nine
words during the sentencing phase of

88
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:48,760
James Fisher's trial.

89
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,360
Uh,

90
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,940
the case went to the Oklahoma
Court of criminal appeals,

91
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:56,941
which said it was deeply disturbed
by the representation that Fisher had

92
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:57,851
received,

93
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:58,870
but nonetheless,

94
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,250
it wasn't disturbed enough,

95
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:00,730
uh,

96
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,410
that it gave him a new trial.

97
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:05,530
It upheld both the conviction
and the death penalty.

98
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,070
Uh,

99
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,903
in the case,

100
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,840
uh,

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,770
many years later,

102
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:09,910
2002,

103
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,310
the United States courts of the United
States Court of appeals finds that the

104
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:19,330
lawyer failed to investigate what
was a close case in terms of weather.

105
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,120
Fisher was actually the person
who committed this crime or not,

106
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,500
that the lawyer was grossly
inept and disloyal to Fisher,

107
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,280
uh,

108
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,090
by,

109
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:28,810
uh,

110
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,800
the hostility,

111
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:30,251
uh,

112
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:34,030
that he showed towards his
client and his client's case.

113
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:34,361
So now,

114
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,090
many years,

115
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,861
1983,

116
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:36,694
the trial,

117
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,840
2002,

118
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,560
the United States appellate court
is saying Fisher gets a new trial.

119
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,903
Uh,

120
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,930
2005,

121
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:45,010
he has his second trial.

122
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:45,730
This time,

123
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,340
Fisher gets a lawyer who
was drinking heavily,

124
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,121
uh,

125
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:50,260
and uh,

126
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:50,950
uh,

127
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,030
abusing cocaine.

128
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:52,661
Uh,

129
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:55,330
at one point the lawyer threatened Fisher,

130
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,680
actually asked the deputies to take off
the handcuffs so he and Fisher could

131
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:00,514
have a fist fight.

132
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,391
Uh,

133
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:02,980
this is about as bad as it gets.

134
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,350
An attorney client relations,

135
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,310
uh,

136
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,410
no investigation whatsoever.

137
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,120
Fishers is sends to death,

138
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:10,954
yet again,

139
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,580
a 2009 this time the Oklahoma
Court of criminal appeals says no,

140
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,470
this was ineffective lawyering,

141
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,210
ineffective at the guilt phase.

142
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,420
And the court said Fisher was prejudice
because the prosecution's case was not

143
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:27,190
very strong and other words,

144
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:27,730
Fisher.

145
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,200
Now in 2009,

146
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,270
having been synced to death,

147
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,310
has spent over 20 years,

148
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,450
most of it on death row.

149
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,550
And there's never been a constitutional
determination of whether he's actually

150
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:41,110
guilty of the crime or not.

151
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,610
Because his first lawyer did nothing for
him and his second lawyer did nothing

152
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:45,911
for him.

153
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:47,490
He did not have a,

154
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:47,980
uh,

155
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,150
a fighting chance of presenting his case
and contesting new government's case at

156
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,620
either one of these trials.

157
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,970
In 2010.

158
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,300
The prosecution agrees that Fisher can
be released only if he would admit guilt

159
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,400
and agree to be banished
from Oklahoma forever.

160
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,361
Uh,

161
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:09,290
if you're James Fisher and you've
had the two trials that he's had,

162
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,551
the trial were,

163
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:13,520
the lawyer only said nine
words at the penalty phase,

164
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,850
the trial where the lawyer tried to
get in a fist fight with him and was

165
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:19,010
drinking and abusing cocaine,

166
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,123
um,

167
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,820
it's awfully hard to turn that deal down.

168
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,510
Uh,

169
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,680
we see this in a number of death penalty
cases to get reversed where when they

170
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:28,490
come back,

171
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,770
the prosecution wants to save face,

172
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,080
but knows it probably can't get a
conviction the defendant wants out,

173
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,620
but knows there's some risk that they
may be convicted again and regardless

174
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:46,520
they're going to stay in jail for some
period of time before the new trial.

175
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,310
So they end up taking this sort of,

176
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,060
uh,

177
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,893
deal,

178
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,291
uh,

179
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:56,291
where they agree to plead guilty sometimes
of pleading guilty while maintaining

180
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:57,254
their innocence,

181
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,220
uh,

182
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,500
in exchange for time served basically,

183
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,190
uh,

184
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,210
and they're set free.

185
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:02,631
Uh,

186
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:03,890
this case is a disgrace.

187
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,750
It's a disgrace that the trial judge
didn't stop it at the first trial,

188
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,840
that the trial judge didn't
stop it at the second trial,

189
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,020
and that it took this many years
for James Fisher's right to counsel,

190
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,670
uh,

191
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,320
to be vindicated.

192
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:18,950
Uh,

193
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,240
but it's not that unusual.

194
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:20,870
Uh,

195
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,090
Gregory Wilson since to death,

196
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,631
uh,

197
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:28,280
in Kentucky was represented by a
lawyer who practiced out of his home.

198
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,513
Um,

199
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,120
you may say a lawyer could
practice out of his home,

200
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:36,500
although this was back in the days
before a laptop computers and the kind of

201
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:41,120
technological advantages we have today
that make it possible for lawyer to

202
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:43,340
practice out of his or her home.

203
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:43,851
Uh,

204
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:44,684
in this case,

205
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,210
uh,

206
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,470
the lawyers home had a
big Budweiser beer sign,

207
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,040
uh,

208
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,380
up on the wall in the living room.

209
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,603
Uh,

210
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,590
Wilson found out,

211
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,520
Wilson found out that just a short
time before the police had gone to this

212
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:06,670
office or home of the lawyer and had
taken up the floor in the living room and

213
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:08,750
taking out eight bags of stolen property.

214
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,440
But what really was the final Straw for
Gregory Wilson was when he called the

215
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:15,350
telephone number.

216
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,080
The lawyer gave him in
the answered Kelly's Keck.

217
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,161
Uh,

218
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:24,060
Kelly's keg is a bar right across the
street from the Kenton County courthouse

219
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,830
in Kentucky where Gregory Watson
was tried and it actually worked.

220
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:28,101
I mean,

221
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:30,800
if you call the number for Kelly's Cag,

222
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,180
the bartender would answer and often
summon the lawyer William Hagadorn,

223
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:35,631
uh,

224
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:36,464
to the phone.

225
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,160
Uh,

226
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,290
but unfortunately he may
not remember that call.

227
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,110
The next day when Wilson gets to court,

228
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:43,670
he says to the judge,

229
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,803
your honor,

230
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,320
I want a new lawyer and I'm
facing the death penalty.

231
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,150
I'm from Detroit,

232
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:51,200
I'm in Kentucky.

233
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:54,440
I'm a black man facing the death penalty
and a place where I don't know anybody

234
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,860
and I need a real lawyer.

235
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,421
The judge says,

236
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:57,541
well,

237
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,141
Mr. Wilson,

238
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:00,420
you can have any lawyer you want,

239
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,640
but this is your court appointed lawyer,

240
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,073
Mr Hegg door.

241
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:04,921
Uh,

242
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,240
so if you want to bring in another lawyer,

243
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:06,501
of course,

244
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:06,781
wasn't,

245
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:09,570
had no ability to bring in another lawyer.

246
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,260
Uh,

247
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,041
and as a result,

248
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,000
he went to trial,

249
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:12,510
uh,

250
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,310
with Mr Headquarters is lawyer.

251
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:14,880
Uh,

252
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,421
he was,

253
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,070
it was a somewhat farcical trial.

254
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,300
He was sentenced to death.

255
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,080
Uh,

256
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,090
and in the review process later,

257
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,490
the courts rejected his claim that he
had not been adequately represented,

258
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,880
saying that Wilson had failed
to cooperate with Mr Hegg door.

259
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,020
Of course he was trying to get Mr Hegg
Dorn replaced during all that time.

260
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,830
The question you ask if this case is
how does a person like Gregory Wilson in

261
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:48,861
force the right to counsel the most
fundamental right a person accused of a

262
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:51,750
crime or facing the death penalty has,

263
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,180
what do you do when the
lawyer is incompetent?

264
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:55,950
And you can tell the
lawyers and competent.

265
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,870
But this is the judge,

266
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,250
the lawyer the judge gave you.

267
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,511
Uh,

268
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:05,511
and so here we see an example of when the
most fundamental right a person has is

269
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:07,770
actually a unenforceable,

270
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:11,910
even though it's hard to imagine what
else Gregor Woodson could have done a than

271
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,040
what he did and trying
to get a new lawyer.

272
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,563
Uh,

273
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,630
Jeffery Leonard was tried by a lawyer
who knew so little about him that he was

274
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:24,270
tried under the name James Slaughter.

275
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,920
His lawyer didn't even
know his client's name.

276
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:26,850
Uh,

277
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,690
he had used this,

278
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:32,040
came slaughter as an alias and had been
arrested under that name of the lawyer.

279
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,450
Didn't know that he was brain damage.

280
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:33,990
Uh,

281
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,670
the lawyer did not know a whole lot.

282
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,960
I didn't know anything actually about
his client and when the case was being

283
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:40,411
heard.

284
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:42,840
And the lawyer testified
about his experience,

285
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,160
he claimed that he had been a prosecutor
in New York and that he had tried to

286
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:49,710
the death point of cases
turned out those were not true.

287
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,490
Uh,

288
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,610
he later resigned from the bar in a deal,

289
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,540
uh,

290
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,171
because,

291
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:55,441
uh,

292
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:56,970
of his misrepresentations,

293
00:10:56,971 --> 00:11:01,740
but the courts all the way through the
state and federal courts upheld the death

294
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:03,600
sins for Jeffery Leonard.

295
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,350
He was spared execution only
because the governor of Kentucky,

296
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,990
Ernie Fletcher commuted his sentence,

297
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,640
uh,

298
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:10,940
when,

299
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,090
when he left office.

300
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:12,781
Uh,

301
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:14,340
another example is Hollywood,

302
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,061
uh,

303
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:18,270
Iq in the low sixties.

304
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:23,390
This is an intellectually disabled person
who's tried in Alabama and sentenced

305
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:25,154
to death.

306
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,530
And it turns out that the
lawyers representing him,

307
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:33,531
local lawyers never bothered to go to
the school where Hollywood had been in

308
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:35,610
special education classes.

309
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,870
The special education classes were
held in the basement of the school.

310
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,090
Whether the electricity often didn't work.

311
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,710
It also flooded every time it rained
and it was called by the other students,

312
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:47,550
the mole hole.

313
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,760
And Hollywood was one of the moles.

314
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,253
Uh,

315
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,660
this would have probably been critical
evidence if the jury had only heard it,

316
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,501
uh,

317
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:59,710
that he had an Iq in the low sixties
that he had been in special education,

318
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:01,450
whatever one can say,

319
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,030
uh,

320
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,270
about someone faking mental illness.

321
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:05,440
You can't fake,

322
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,473
uh,

323
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,350
an Iq in the 60s.

324
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,790
At the time we were in grade school.

325
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:10,730
Uh,

326
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,980
and anticipation that many,

327
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,350
many years later you might
face the death public,

328
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,693
uh,

329
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,200
inadequate representation.

330
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,980
Nevertheless,

331
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,270
Alabama courts held that the lawyers
made a reasonable decision not to

332
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:23,110
investigate,

333
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:23,990
uh,

334
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,100
and go to the school and talk to the
teachers and find out what was right there

335
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:27,934
in town,

336
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,600
uh,

337
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,081
and,

338
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:29,261
uh,

339
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:30,820
that that was a reasonable decision.

340
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,910
Alabama executed Hollywood in 1960.

341
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:35,260
There are many other examples.

342
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:35,531
I mean,

343
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:37,060
if you go to Texas,

344
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,720
uh,

345
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,980
three death penalty cases in which
the lawyer slept during the trial,

346
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,000
uh,

347
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
judges presiding over cases where the
lawyer representing the person facing the

348
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:50,710
death pony is asleep,

349
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,320
even snoring in some cases,

350
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,140
one of the judges was
asked by a journalist,

351
00:12:56,141 --> 00:13:01,141
how can you preside over a case
where the defense lawyer is asleep,

352
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,090
uh,

353
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,820
and trying the case?

354
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,841
And the judge said,

355
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:05,674
wow,

356
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,080
the constitution guarantees you a lawyer.

357
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,620
Uh,

358
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,560
but it doesn't guarantee you
that the lawyer has to be awake.

359
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,580
Uh,

360
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,413
and so,

361
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,050
uh,

362
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,130
Calvin Verdeyen,

363
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,480
uh,

364
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,650
to other people since to
death and Kevin Burdens case,

365
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:22,750
the case goes to the United
States Court of Appeals.

366
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,720
And the state of Texas argues that,

367
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,410
uh,

368
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,490
even though the lawyer,

369
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:28,330
Joe Cannon,

370
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,860
who also slept in another death point of
case and was an older lawyer who often

371
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:35,230
slept after lunch when he tried cases,

372
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,640
and yet the judges in Houston continued
to appoint him to case after case.

373
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,530
Texas made the argument that,

374
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,450
well,

375
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,940
this was not inadequate loitering
or ineffective lawyer in,

376
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:46,930
because after all,

377
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,320
the court upheld cases where the
lawyers run of the influence of alcohol,

378
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:50,770
uh,

379
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,570
drugs,

380
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:51,760
uh,

381
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,940
even a case where a lawyer has all timers.

382
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,820
Uh,

383
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,820
but the court decided that a sleeping
lawyer was unconscious and so was

384
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:05,221
therefore unlike the alcoholic Liam
paired lawyer or the drug impaired lawyer,

385
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,011
uh,

386
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:10,480
and found that a burden was
entitled to a new new trial.

387
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,673
Another cannon,

388
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:12,641
a client,

389
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:15,580
another person represented
by Joe Frank Cannon.

390
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,600
Uh,

391
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,290
Carl Johnson was executed by the
state of Texas and George Macfarlane,

392
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,510
who was represented by John Ben,

393
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:24,310
another lawyer who actually snored,

394
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:24,880
uh,

395
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,350
during the trial,

396
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,280
uh,

397
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,611
is,

398
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:30,070
is still on death row in Texas,

399
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,510
another lawyer in Texas,

400
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:36,511
his drone guide notes who practices in
Houston and who in three different death

401
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:41,641
penalty cases has missed the deadline for
filing a federal Habeas Corpus action.

402
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,430
So about as basic a responsibility
as a lawyer has in any kind of case,

403
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:53,420
whether it's an automobile negligence
case or any other kind of case file within

404
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,450
the deadline filed within
the statute of limitations,

405
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,141
he missed it.

406
00:14:57,141 --> 00:14:57,974
Not once,

407
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,590
you would've thought that would've been
enough to suspend them from practice.

408
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:02,690
Not twice but three times.

409
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,420
And yet the state bar
of Texas did nothing.

410
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,080
The Texas Court of criminal
appeals did absolutely nothing.

411
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,080
The trial judge's in Houston did nothing.

412
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:12,914
In fact,

413
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:17,120
he's still being appointed
to criminal cases,

414
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:18,860
including capital cases in Texas.

415
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:19,101
Today.

416
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:21,440
You're not very lucky if you
get this guy as your lawyer.

417
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,490
Uh,

418
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,690
not very lucky at all.

419
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,201
Uh,

420
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:29,201
and yet nothing has been done despite
what really should be a basis for some

421
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:34,610
disciplinary action by the bar in terms
of missing the statute of limitations.

422
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,320
How can it be,

423
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,220
uh,

424
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:37,910
that,

425
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,360
uh,

426
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,260
this happens,

427
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:39,890
uh,

428
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:40,723
in cases?

429
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,451
Well,

430
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:45,860
the Supreme Court held 1942 in a case
called Glasser versus United States.

431
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,830
That the right to counsel
is two fundamental,

432
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:53,831
an absolute for courts to indulge in
Nice calculations as to the amount of

433
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:56,690
prejudice from its denial.

434
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:57,171
In other words,

435
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:59,210
if somebody has denied
the right to a lawyer,

436
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,800
that's so fundamental,

437
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,360
we can't get into whether the case
would have come out the same way or not.

438
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,250
We've got to give them a new trial.

439
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,110
The court changed its mind,

440
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:09,921
uh,

441
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:14,450
and decided actually courts could make
a fairly rough calculation of what

442
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:15,320
difference it made.

443
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:15,770
A,

444
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:19,760
in the case of Strickland
versus Washington in 1984,

445
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,560
this was a death penalty case.

446
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,780
David Washington was sentenced to death
in Florida and had raised the fact that

447
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:31,130
his lawyer had done virtually nothing
to prepare for the penalty phase of his

448
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:31,950
case.

449
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,340
Uh,

450
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:37,340
the Supreme Court said that a lawyer
is not ineffective if the judges can

451
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,090
conclude after looking at the case
that it didn't make any difference,

452
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:44,150
that the lawyers in competence
didn't make any difference.

453
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,100
If the court asks this question,

454
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:48,770
is there a reasonable probability that,

455
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:50,870
but for the lawyers performance,

456
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:52,220
the deficient performance,

457
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,630
the result would be different.

458
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,853
In other words,

459
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,980
do the acts and omissions of the lawyer
undermine confidence in the outcome of

460
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:01,304
the case?

461
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,383
Uh,

462
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,230
this is the,

463
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,160
uh,

464
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,701
prejudice,

465
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:07,940
prom Strickland versus Washington.

466
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:08,840
There are two parts of it.

467
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:12,830
I'm going to take the prejudice part first
because this is where the court said,

468
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:13,610
uh,

469
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,890
that judges can decide.

470
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:16,724
And other words,

471
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,160
even though a lawyer may be incompetent,

472
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,640
I've judge can say there was no violation
of the right to counsel because the

473
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:29,150
judge concludes that the case
would come out the same way,

474
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,540
even if the person had been
represented by competent counsel.

475
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,350
Chris,

476
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,910
very hard for judges to know that,

477
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,630
uh,

478
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,770
they weren't there at the trial.

479
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,260
Uh,

480
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,510
they didn't hear the witnesses.

481
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:38,970
Uh,

482
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,960
they weren't sitting in the jury and they
didn't know how the jury assessed the

483
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:42,770
case.

484
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,770
And yet every day courts decide to uphold
cases where people have head deficient

485
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,890
legal representation,

486
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:50,820
uh,

487
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,710
on the basis that there's not
a substantial probability that,

488
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:59,060
but for the representation
the person received a,

489
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,080
they would have gotten the death penalty.

490
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:01,921
Uh,

491
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:06,921
so even though courts are saying lawyers
are not quote ineffective legally,

492
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,400
they're not saying or the lawyer can
still be incompetent but not legally and

493
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:16,164
effective.

494
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,430
And so as a result,

495
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,580
it's a way in which courts can paper
over the poorer quality representation.

496
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,130
Uh,

497
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,570
that happens in many cases,

498
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,360
capital and non capital as well.

499
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,910
The other part of the test is,

500
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,550
was the performance of
the lawyer deficient.

501
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,360
And the court has said that's
measured by what our prevailing,

502
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:36,900
uh,

503
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,250
professional norms did.

504
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:43,251
The lawyer's representation meet whatever
the sort of standard of care in the

505
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:47,310
legal profession is for representing
somebody in a death penalty case.

506
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:47,461
Now,

507
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:48,630
that would be a,

508
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,370
an objective assessment.

509
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,150
But the court added a couple or three
things to make it very difficult to

510
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:54,984
conclude,

511
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,933
uh,

512
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,250
uh,

513
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,610
that the lawyers performance
fell below the standard.

514
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,211
Uh,

515
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:00,661
first of all,

516
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:02,520
the court said judicial review.

517
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:04,920
It's going to be highly deferential.

518
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,323
In other words,

519
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,020
the judges are not to second
guess lawyers as a general matter.

520
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,153
Uh,

521
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,220
the courts are to indulge
a strong presumption that
the lawyer rendered adequate

522
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,154
assistance.

523
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:17,881
In other words,

524
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:19,410
regardless of whether
the lawyer did or not,

525
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,710
the of course are going to presume that
the lawyer was adequate and made all

526
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:29,010
significant decisions based
upon professional judgment.

527
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,070
The lawyer may have been
completely clueless,

528
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,170
but the Supreme Court says,

529
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:36,870
we'll presume that any
decision not to call a witness,

530
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:38,190
not to do an investigation,

531
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:43,191
not to do whatever was a professional
decision and tactical decisions or

532
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:47,100
strategic choices made after
thorough investigation,

533
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:52,101
which may or may not be an issue in some
cases are virtually on challengeable.

534
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,710
So what the court is basically doing
here is making it fairly hard for a court

535
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:02,970
considering a claim of
ineffective loitering,

536
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:03,630
uh,

537
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:08,220
to find the lawyer a deficient in the
performance because of these presumptions,

538
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:11,880
although they can be overcome and
they are from time to time in cases.

539
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,870
Uh,

540
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,270
but then the court can also decide,

541
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,860
as I talked about a moment ago,

542
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:17,280
uh,

543
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,900
that it didn't have an
effect on the outcome.

544
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:19,060
It was,

545
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,950
we're all been the same.

546
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,600
Uh,

547
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,540
and there we'd be,

548
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,500
well,

549
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,030
a Justice Marshall descents,

550
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:24,840
uh,

551
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,270
he says this standard is so malleable,

552
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,130
it will either have no grip at all or
there will be all kind of variations.

553
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:32,940
In other words,

554
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,480
there won't really be a
standard of representation,

555
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,830
a four people,

556
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,341
uh,

557
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:38,561
in,

558
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:39,630
in these cases.

559
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,321
Uh,

560
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:42,120
and he also says this presumption,

561
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:47,121
all these presumptions put a very heavy
burden of persuasion on the WHO's been

562
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,570
convicted or sentenced to death,

563
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,471
uh,

564
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:51,490
and says there,

565
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:54,100
once you show back to what
the court had said in Glasser,

566
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,600
once a determination is made that the
lawyers performance was deficient,

567
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,460
then that should be the end.

568
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,420
The court shouldn't indulge in this
speculation about whether or not it made a

569
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:05,254
difference.

570
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,660
Let me take one case to just illustrate,

571
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,440
uh,

572
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:08,741
what,

573
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:10,530
what happens here that the,

574
00:21:10,531 --> 00:21:14,770
the judicial rulings on denial of
council in the state courts are made by

575
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,120
elected judges.

576
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:16,591
Uh,

577
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:19,030
often the very same judges,

578
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:19,780
uh,

579
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,700
who appointed the lawyer
in the first instance.

580
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:23,500
It's not always but often the case,

581
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,041
uh,

582
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:27,160
and then reviewed on Habeas
Corpus by the federal courts,

583
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,540
life tenure judges.

584
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,750
But they can set aside a conviction only
if they conclude that the decision of

585
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:34,990
the State Court,

586
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,470
which is where almost all these cases
come from was an unreasonable application

587
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,450
of Strickland versus Washington or was
contrary to Strickland versus Washington.

588
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,570
Let's take a look at
Robert [inaudible] case.

589
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,693
Um,

590
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,040
this was a man since to death in Georgia.

591
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,620
It turns out that his lead defense lawyer,

592
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:57,311
uh,

593
00:21:57,311 --> 00:22:01,780
drank a quart quart of vodka every night
during the trial because he was getting

594
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:05,830
ready to be indicted and ultimately
disbarred and ultimately convicted,

595
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,461
uh,

596
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:07,110
for,

597
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,300
uh,

598
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,650
stealing client funds.

599
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,300
The lawyer said he probably shouldn't
been allowed to represent anybody.

600
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:13,900
Uh,

601
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,640
during this time period.

602
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,450
Uh,

603
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,380
he didn't present.

604
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:19,270
This man is intellectually disabled,

605
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,910
but no evidence was presented about that.

606
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:22,601
Uh,

607
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:23,890
he had been subject to,

608
00:22:23,891 --> 00:22:28,891
this is from judge Bork cats to said
that he was subject to abuse that was so

609
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:30,640
severe,

610
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,510
so frequent,

611
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:35,050
and so notorious that his neighbors
called his childhood home.

612
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,250
The torture chamber.

613
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,080
All of this evidence not presented by
this lawyer who's drinking a quart of

614
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:43,000
vodka every day during a capital trial,

615
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,110
uh,

616
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,340
Georgia trial judge says,

617
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:50,341
no one can seriously believe that Hosely
received the constitutional guarantee

618
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,204
of the right to council.

619
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,980
It seems pretty obvious.

620
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:54,760
Uh,

621
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,440
but the Georgia Supreme Court says,

622
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,160
well,

623
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,520
there's no substantial probability
that the case would have come out

624
00:23:00,521 --> 00:23:01,354
differently.

625
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,220
That even if he had had a sober lawyer,

626
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,880
even if he had had a lawyer to put
on all this evidence about his mental

627
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,870
limitations,

628
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,510
about the abuse he received as a child,

629
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,291
we,

630
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:14,470
the Georgia Supreme Court justices
don't think it would have come out any

631
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:15,304
differently.

632
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,400
And the United States Court of
Appeals for the 11th circuit says,

633
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,210
well,

634
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,370
we defer to the Georgia Supreme Court.

635
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,043
Uh,

636
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,380
it's not an unreasonable application
of Strickland versus Washington because

637
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:31,120
fair minded jurists can disagree,

638
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:31,750
uh,

639
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,770
with regard to it.

640
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,610
Uh,

641
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,110
so in other words,

642
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,050
even though the trial judge who saw
the witnesses and heard about this,

643
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:42,820
found that a violation of the right to
counsel the Georgia Supreme Court doesn't

644
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:47,910
make any finding that the lawyer was
on vodka and about to be indicted was

645
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:48,920
competent.

646
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,310
They just find that it would've
made any difference if he had had,

647
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:52,850
uh,

648
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,740
another lawyer in his case.

649
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,430
So just as James Fisher,

650
00:23:58,910 --> 00:23:59,330
uh,

651
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:04,120
would probably be denied under
the law as it is today if the,

652
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,490
if you had this deference that
was applied and Jose's case,

653
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:08,450
uh,

654
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:13,450
Robert Hosely probably would have
received a new trial if his case had been

655
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,400
before the federal
courts back at the time.

656
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,610
Fisher's case was before the United
States Court of Appeals for the 10th

657
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:20,444
circuit.

658
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,231
In other words,

659
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:23,660
when these cases came
before the federal courts,

660
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:28,430
one was when the law did not require
deference to state court findings.

661
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:29,264
That's Fisher.

662
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,000
And he got a new trial
and he's a free man today.

663
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,880
Holst Lee's comes before the court.

664
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:35,570
Uh,

665
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:40,570
when the courts do have to defer the
federal courts to the state courts and

666
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:42,200
because of this restraint,

667
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,580
we're causing this deference.

668
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,653
He loses.

669
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,510
So timing is everything.

670
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,920
They're going to be a lot of.

671
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:52,010
Robert Holst was a lot of people who are,

672
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,060
and there are a lot who are sends
to death who the state courts say,

673
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,910
well the Lord may not have been great
but we don't think it would've made a

674
00:24:58,911 --> 00:24:59,744
difference.

675
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,140
Uh,

676
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,140
and the federal courts then are going
to apply this deferential standard of

677
00:25:05,961 --> 00:25:10,961
review basically as Justice Marshall
predicted in his dissent and strictly,

678
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:11,810
uh,

679
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,480
this standard has turned
out to be so malleable,

680
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,360
uh,

681
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,520
that it's an eye of the beholder standard.

682
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,200
Some judges will look at a lawyer's
performance and say this was deficient.

683
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,120
It affected the outcome.

684
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,160
The person's entitled for new trial.

685
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,000
Another judge will look at
the same set of facts and say,

686
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,460
we don't think it made any difference.

687
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,720
And if you're a federal judge,

688
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:33,680
you can even say,

689
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,101
well,

690
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:36,260
we may not agree with
the state court decision.

691
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,810
We may not agree with the
Georgia Supreme Court,

692
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,250
but it's not unreasonable because
fair minded judges can disagree.

693
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,530
And if fair minded judges can disagree,

694
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,543
then we're going to,

695
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,150
uh,

696
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,770
let the state courts decide.

697
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:53,030
The reason this is so important and
we'll talk about judges at another time,

698
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:53,630
uh,

699
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,610
is because the state
court judges are elected.

700
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,511
Uh,

701
00:25:56,511 --> 00:26:00,890
and very often the decision making
in the state courts is influenced,

702
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:01,791
uh,

703
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:04,320
as justice Stevens has
recognized it's just a soda.

704
00:26:04,321 --> 00:26:05,450
My IRS recognized,

705
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:05,960
uh,

706
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,320
by the political pressure
that's often present.

707
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,011
Uh,

708
00:26:10,011 --> 00:26:12,560
when you have elected
judges to signing cases,

709
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,550
the federal judges,

710
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:13,990
uh,

711
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,730
life tenure judges have a
little more independence.

712
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:17,843
Um,

713
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,000
can prejudice be presumed?

714
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,040
Uh,

715
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,720
this is an interesting case
that was decided the same
day that the Washington or

716
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,070
Strickland versus
Washington case was decided.

717
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:28,891
Manny,

718
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:30,110
Moe Harrison chronic,

719
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,190
uh,

720
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,430
is the government spends four and a half.

721
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,490
The United States government spends four
and a half years getting his case ready

722
00:26:37,491 --> 00:26:38,324
for trial.

723
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,141
Uh,

724
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:39,621
it's,

725
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:41,990
he's charged with 13
counts of check kiting.

726
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,170
Uh,

727
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:48,170
and the case involves thousands of
documents about how there's check kiting

728
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,590
scheme worked.

729
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,461
Uh,

730
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:55,461
and he's given a real estate lawyer who
had never tried a case 25 days before

731
00:26:57,481 --> 00:26:58,314
trial.

732
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:58,861
Look at this.

733
00:26:58,861 --> 00:27:01,380
The government's been four and
a half years getting ready,

734
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,800
and his lawyer has 25 days
to get ready for trial.

735
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,140
The lower court looked at this and said,

736
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:07,974
well,

737
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:08,401
I mean,

738
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:12,660
of course this couldn't
possibly be a lawyer,

739
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:14,850
couldn't possibly represent somebody.

740
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,960
In this situation,

741
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,590
a supreme court unanimously
reversed and said,

742
00:27:19,591 --> 00:27:22,800
we're not going to presume a prejudice.

743
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:23,641
Uh,

744
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,510
in this case,

745
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,111
uh,

746
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:30,111
we are going to require that the court
looks at it under the Washington versus

747
00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:31,290
Strickland standard.

748
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,251
In other words,

749
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:33,960
we're going to look at
the lawyer's performance,

750
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:35,400
was it the deficient performance?

751
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,540
And secondly,

752
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,290
uh,

753
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,170
was there any prejudice as a result,

754
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,290
a chronics case was sent
back to the lower court.

755
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,750
It actually found that even
under the Strickland standard,

756
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:46,650
uh,

757
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,520
he was ineffective.

758
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,110
The lawyer was ineffective.

759
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:49,680
Uh,

760
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,970
he was given a new trial.

761
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,180
He was convicted to the new trial,

762
00:27:53,181 --> 00:27:53,791
but on appeal,

763
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:57,930
the court said there wasn't even
sufficient evidence to convict him.

764
00:27:57,931 --> 00:27:59,550
And he double jeopardy principles,

765
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,660
uh,

766
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,460
prevented him from being tried again.

767
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,110
Uh,

768
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,451
again,

769
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:05,880
that case might not come out the same way,

770
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,270
uh,

771
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,103
today.

772
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,740
Uh,

773
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,080
but of course this is a case
out of the United States,

774
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,560
uh,

775
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,510
prosecuted by the United States.

776
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,650
So it's not quite the same,

777
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,250
uh,

778
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:14,970
as the,

779
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,710
as the state cases that are reviewed,

780
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,221
uh,

781
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:18,510
on Habeas Corpus,

782
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,633
um,

783
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,570
for the most part,

784
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,101
the denial,

785
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,330
the court's going to make clearer,

786
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:28,020
didn't make clear in a number of
cases after this that very seldom will

787
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:29,550
prejudice be presumed.

788
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,560
In the Calvin Verdeyen case,

789
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:34,170
which I mentioned where the
lawyers slept during the trial,

790
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,850
the United States states court of Appeals
for the fifth circuit sitting with a

791
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:43,851
whole court held that there they would
presume prejudice because a lawyer who

792
00:28:44,671 --> 00:28:48,120
was asleep was basically
absent from the trial.

793
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,110
And a sleeping lawyer is
really no lawyer at all.

794
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,750
And therefore we will presume prejudice.

795
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,471
Of course,

796
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:56,750
that's an extraordinary kind of case.

797
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:59,700
That's not your typical case
where there's a sleeping lawyer.

798
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:01,380
There may be a very bad lawyer,

799
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:04,830
but usually the lawyers can manage
to stay awake during the trial.

800
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:05,611
Uh,

801
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:09,300
so generally the cases are going
to be looked at under strict one.

802
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:09,901
Again,

803
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:12,690
it's going to be very much
the courts that look at it.

804
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:13,140
Uh,

805
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,030
the political pressures that come to bear,

806
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:19,140
the very deferential standard of
assessing whether or not the lawyer's

807
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:21,840
performance was deficient or not.

808
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:27,410
And then finally of course decision
about is there a substantial probability?

809
00:29:27,571 --> 00:29:28,980
Do we think it made a difference,

810
00:29:28,981 --> 00:29:31,590
a substantial probability
that it affected the outcome.

811
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,933
As a result,

812
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:36,030
many people who receive
inadequate representation,

813
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:36,691
uh,

814
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,600
are not going to have
their cases set aside,

815
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,191
uh,

816
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:41,220
and are going to be executed.

817
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:41,751
Of course,

818
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:45,590
there are going to be some cases and
there were cases decided by the United

819
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,490
States Supreme Court,

820
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,480
uh,

821
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,100
the Williams case out of Virginia,

822
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:49,821
Terry Williams,

823
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:53,570
where the court held that there
was an effective representation,

824
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,310
the Wiggins case out of Maryland,

825
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:55,581
again,

826
00:29:55,581 --> 00:29:58,280
where the court found in
effective representation,

827
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:58,881
but,

828
00:29:58,881 --> 00:29:59,081
and,

829
00:29:59,081 --> 00:29:59,850
and the,

830
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,360
uh,

831
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,540
Ron pillowcase from polo
versus beer where again,

832
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:05,840
the United States Supreme Court
found ineffective representation.

833
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,970
But against those cases,

834
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,650
you find case after case,

835
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:13,940
including a number of cases where the
Supreme Court has just granted a review of

836
00:30:13,941 --> 00:30:17,150
a case and reversed a grant of
ineffective assistance of counsel.

837
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:22,460
And we see many courts in the country
where it's almost impossible to prevent,

838
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,241
to excuse me,

839
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:26,870
to prevail on a claim of
ineffective assistance of counsel.

840
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,550
What does this mean going forward?

841
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:33,730
It means that people facing the death
penalty may have the good fortune to have

842
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,881
good lawyers,

843
00:30:34,881 --> 00:30:35,900
well trained lawyers,

844
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:36,860
capable lawyers,

845
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:37,551
uh,

846
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:38,780
but they may also not.

847
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:39,920
And if they don't,

848
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,850
uh,

849
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,620
there may be no relief for them.
