1
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,200
Our guest is Steve Singer,

2
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:15,240
who's a professor at the university.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,070
Uh,

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,120
ally Ola University College of law.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,030
Steve Singer graduated
from Harvard law school,

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,450
went to the public defender service in
the district of Columbia where he was a

7
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:25,350
public defender,

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,890
uh,

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,730
for a number of years,

10
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:31,731
and then went to Louisiana where he
joined the Louisiana capital assistance

11
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:32,401
project.

12
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:34,080
And for four or five years,

13
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:34,651
excuse me,

14
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:37,230
was doing capital cases in Louisiana.

15
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,070
Uh,

16
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,270
he went to the law school,

17
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:42,810
but then when Katrina hit in 2005,

18
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,330
uh,

19
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,660
took a leave of absence and went to,

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,410
uh,

21
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,650
build a new public defender
office in New Orleans.

22
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:51,330
And I want to talk with Steve Today,

23
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,830
uh,

24
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,520
about both the building,

25
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,980
if that public defender
office and capital,

26
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:56,461
uh,

27
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:57,660
representation,

28
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,111
uh,

29
00:00:58,111 --> 00:00:59,010
in Louisiana.

30
00:00:59,011 --> 00:00:59,281
Steve,

31
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:00,390
thanks for joining us.

32
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,703
My pleasure.

33
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,900
Would you just describe to us what
was the representation for poor people

34
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:07,980
accused of crimes?

35
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:09,690
Like in New Orleans,

36
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:10,770
Orleans parish,

37
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:11,940
the city of New Orleans,

38
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:12,450
uh,

39
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,800
before Hurricane Katrina
hit the city in 2005.

40
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,080
Um,

41
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,530
well,

42
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,880
what you had was,

43
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,270
um,

44
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:20,660
and I,

45
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,400
I'm originally from Chicago and what you
had is what I would describe as a very

46
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:27,500
classic patronage system.

47
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,623
Um,

48
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,490
the judges ran the
public defender's office.

49
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,630
They didn't do it directly.

50
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:36,350
They were the local criminal
court judges appointed a board,

51
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,130
um,

52
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:41,000
of like three to five to
seven members who then ran,

53
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,300
who then ran up the
indigent defender office.

54
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,550
But the board members were selected
by the judges and they were basically

55
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:53,360
private criminal defense lawyers
who were friends with the judges and

56
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:55,730
contributed to their campaigns,

57
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:56,870
their judicial campaigns,

58
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:59,750
and got other people to contribute
to their judicial campaigns.

59
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,710
And so then they were on the board and
they were then able to hire their friends

60
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:06,380
and the judges friends
as public defenders,

61
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,460
um,

62
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,530
and the indigent defense system,

63
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,940
if you were to defy,

64
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,380
devise a system,

65
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,303
um,

66
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:13,910
um,

67
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,080
that was set basically
to screw the clients.

68
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,850
That's what you had.

69
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,880
What you had was you had public defenders
who were part time and on salary.

70
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,030
So they were part time in
the sense that they had,

71
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:33,800
they had private criminal defense
practices and then they had a part time,

72
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:35,780
salaried position as a public defender.

73
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,980
And what you'd have is one or you'd
have like two or two to four public

74
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:42,350
defenders assigned per
judge per courtroom.

75
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,750
And they would split it up whatever they,

76
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,360
the way they negotiated with their judge.

77
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,600
So you might have one lawyer
take Mondays and Wednesdays,

78
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:53,750
the other wire take Tuesdays and
Thursdays and then maybe they'd alternate

79
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:57,050
Fridays or they do a system
where they'd have one,

80
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,050
they'd be on one week as a public defender
and then they'd be off for two weeks

81
00:03:01,051 --> 00:03:04,380
and the next public defender would take
the next week and then the next week.

82
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,730
Um,

83
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,900
and what that meant for
the clients was since you,

84
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,410
since they were on salary,

85
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,420
it didn't matter whether they spent
two hours or two minutes on a case,

86
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,770
they got paid the same.

87
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,130
So obviously the financial incentive was
to spend as little time as possible on

88
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:27,501
your indigent public defender cases so
that you could spend more time on your

89
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:29,250
private pain cases.

90
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,570
Um,

91
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,010
and so this obviously worked to the great
detriment of the clients because they

92
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:36,690
got as little time as possible.

93
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:37,430
Um,

94
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,780
and,

95
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,700
and one of the things you have to say
about the lawyers is some of these lawyers

96
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:42,534
were,

97
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,290
they're not,

98
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,150
they weren't necessarily bad people,

99
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,200
but they were stuck in a really
bad system because at the time,

100
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:49,861
for example,

101
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:50,491
New Orleans,

102
00:03:50,491 --> 00:03:52,140
the public school system was terrible.

103
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,150
So if you give,

104
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,240
if you give a person a choice while
you can spend the right amount,

105
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:59,340
you can spend more time on this criminal,

106
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:01,350
on this public defender indigent case,

107
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,010
or you can spend less time of it and you
can earn some more money and send your

108
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,930
kids to private school to a good,

109
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:09,210
decent school and get your
kids a decent education.

110
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:09,451
Well,

111
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:10,650
that's no kind of choice at all,

112
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:11,730
obviously for people.

113
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,450
Um,

114
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,140
so it wasn't necessarily that the
individual lawyers were bad people,

115
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,470
but they were stuck in a system that
really was set up to make sure that as

116
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:25,590
little time as possible with
spent on indigent defense client.

117
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,740
And what kind of support did they
have in terms of office space and

118
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:34,110
investigators and other things that are
deemed pretty essential to representing

119
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:35,400
people accused of crimes?

120
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,680
They had nothing because remember,

121
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:38,880
it's a patronage system.

122
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:40,380
And so when a patronage system,

123
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,611
any money,

124
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:42,060
any,

125
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,893
any sick,

126
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,011
any,

127
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:49,011
every penny that goes somewhere other
than to a person is wasted money.

128
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,690
Because when you spend money on people,

129
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,520
they then can contribute back to your
campaigns and they can get their friends

130
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:59,100
and family and other people to
contribute to your campaigns.

131
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,350
But computers,

132
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,640
office space,

133
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,200
Xerox machines,

134
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,430
experts,

135
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,563
um,

136
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,590
investigators,

137
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:09,630
all of these other things
other than lawyers,

138
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,770
they don't,

139
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,190
they don't,

140
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,020
they don't contribute
to judicial campaigns.

141
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,480
They don't send the money back
a percentage of the money back.

142
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,440
They don't kick it back.

143
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,700
So as a consequence,

144
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:18,510
they had nothing.

145
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:23,160
The judges gave them for free one room
in the courthouse because of course the

146
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:25,920
judges didn't want any money
going to office space either.

147
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,780
But it was like one room.

148
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,190
There were no private offices,

149
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:33,090
no place to meet privately with
clients or family members or witnesses.

150
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,050
Um,

151
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,240
they had four computers.

152
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:40,440
Two of which were hooked up to the
Internet by dial up connections.

153
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,430
They had one xerox machine that
only worked some of the time.

154
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,443
Um,

155
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,320
they never had to file any motions cause
the judges weren't require them to file

156
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:49,741
motions.

157
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:53,850
Cause again that would be wasted money
that wasn't going to people's salary,

158
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,000
lawyer salaries that could
then come back to the judges.

159
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,853
So they had,

160
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,520
um,

161
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,060
in the,

162
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:04,060
I went through the books and the year
before Katrina for approximately 12,000

163
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:06,800
cases,

164
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,090
um,

165
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,960
all told they spent in that
entire year on 12,000 cases,

166
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:14,540
they spent $9,000 on experts.

167
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,973
Wow.

168
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,350
No doing capital work,

169
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,770
spend $9,000 in a cup
in an hour and a half.

170
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,330
Right in the morning.

171
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,090
Now were these lawyers
also doing capital cases?

172
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,410
The office Yasso office
had a capital unit as well.

173
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,130
Umm,

174
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,320
those lawyers were generally full time.

175
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,513
Um,

176
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,950
but when I took over the office,

177
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,210
the capital lawyers,

178
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,120
the eight,

179
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,120
the National Aba standards are like
one to two capital cases per lawyer per

180
00:06:46,361 --> 00:06:47,100
year.

181
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,500
Um,

182
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,440
and the Louisiana state standards
were a little bit more generous.

183
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:53,800
They were like two to four
capital cases per lawyer per year.

184
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:54,610
Um,

185
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,610
these lawyers had on average
around 15 to 18 capital cases.

186
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:02,290
Some were over 20 capital cases,

187
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,100
um,

188
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,920
for an individual lawyer at a time.

189
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,371
Let,

190
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:07,220
let me ask you this.

191
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:12,221
What was the situation after Katrina
hit in terms of people who had cases

192
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:14,270
pending in the courts?

193
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,061
Okay.

194
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:19,710
What happened after Katrina was the public
defender's office was funded largely

195
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:25,050
based on fines and fees on everyone
who was found guilty of any criminal

196
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:25,884
offense,

197
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,560
which in Louisiana
included traffic offenses.

198
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,080
So by and large traffic offenses,

199
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:31,770
um,

200
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,250
um,

201
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,020
funded the public defender's office,

202
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,640
obviously once Katrina hit,

203
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,110
there were no street lights.

204
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,280
There were no stop signs,

205
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,121
there were no cars,

206
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:40,020
there were no people.

207
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:44,760
There was no police and law enforcement
doing traffic enforcement at least.

208
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,241
Um,

209
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:47,130
and so the funding completely dried up,

210
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,730
which meant the public defender's
office basically went down to,

211
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,181
uh,

212
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:54,420
I think one had five lawyers
in one administrative person.

213
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,900
And what happened to the clients was
one of the things that the pre-katrina

214
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,480
office did not have was they didn't
have any sort of case management system.

215
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,340
So they didn't know
who their clients were.

216
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,550
They would just walk into the courtroom
and whoever showed up in the courtroom

217
00:08:08,551 --> 00:08:08,941
that day,

218
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:09,780
they represented.

219
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,350
So when Katrina scattered everybody,

220
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,910
they had no list of people.

221
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:15,601
So,

222
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:17,940
so all of the defendants just got,

223
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,320
they got transferred to jails throughout
Louisiana and some even to other states

224
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:23,154
throughout the south.

225
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,900
And they were just lost in the system.

226
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,741
They were nameless,

227
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:26,574
faceless,

228
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,420
um,

229
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,430
and they basically suffered miserably

230
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,540
because if I understand it,

231
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,021
the jail,

232
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:32,950
they're in New Orleans,

233
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:35,710
what's called the Orleans
parish prison flooded,

234
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:36,011
right?

235
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:39,850
So the inmates who were in there had
to be taken and distributed all across

236
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:40,541
Louisiana.

237
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,201
And as you said,

238
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:42,370
even some out of state.

239
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,380
Right.

240
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,700
And it was truly horrible.

241
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:45,900
It completely flooded.

242
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,930
And you can look back at
the pictures post Katrina,

243
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,590
there's the broad street overpass
that goes over the expressway,

244
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:53,700
right by the jail.

245
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,460
And basically you had inmates swam,

246
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,780
you know,

247
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:02,370
waited and got through all of the muck
to this bridge overpass where it was dry

248
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,670
and they generally spent from three to
seven days in basically hot blazing sun,

249
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:13,010
95 to 100 degree temperatures with no
food and no water surrounded by a bunch of

250
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:16,200
guards who had some food and some water,

251
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:18,240
but would not share it with the inmates.

252
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,340
Then they got transferred to um,

253
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:21,840
um,

254
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,420
what was called what was called
Hunt Correctional Center,

255
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:28,440
which was the classification prison where
most inmates would go before getting

256
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:29,880
sent to various prisons.

257
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:30,540
Um,

258
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,230
and they were all,

259
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:31,800
they were,

260
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,800
all of the Orleans parish inmates were
put in one big outside Penn that was

261
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:38,340
fenced in in a field.

262
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,720
Um,

263
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,580
which meant also you had,

264
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,110
you had juveniles,

265
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,250
you had young kids,

266
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:49,251
you had people charged with disorderly
conduct or drunk and or carrying an open

267
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:54,240
container and very minor offenses all
mixed in with people charged with murder,

268
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:54,690
rape,

269
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,530
armed robbery,

270
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,820
very violent people.

271
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:57,690
And you had,

272
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,140
you had,

273
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,840
you had strong men with young boys,

274
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:01,680
young kids,

275
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,780
and they were all mixed in,

276
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:03,750
in one big pen.

277
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,160
It,

278
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,070
and it was so dangerous.

279
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,570
The guards wouldn't even go in.

280
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,530
What they would do at feeding time was
the guards would just stand outside the

281
00:10:10,531 --> 00:10:13,290
fence and they would toss over the fence,

282
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,690
sandwiches and bottles of water.

283
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:16,951
And of course,

284
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:20,070
what happened in that environment
is if you are big and strong,

285
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,240
you got food and water.

286
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,750
If you were weak or meek or mild mannered,

287
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,810
you didn't get anything
and you got beat up.

288
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:28,710
Um,

289
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,221
and you've got,

290
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:30,054
and you suffered.

291
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:30,721
I mean,

292
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:31,170
just,

293
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:31,381
I mean,

294
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,780
we're talking unspeakable abuse.

295
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:39,170
And also eventually some of these inmates
then got dispersed to jails throughout

296
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,830
rural Louisiana.

297
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,851
Most of,

298
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:43,480
obviously the Orleans parish inmates.

299
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,590
You're talking in our African American
men and they got sent to rural Louisiana

300
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,100
where there were large,

301
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,230
largely where it's largely white.

302
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,393
Um,

303
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,690
and uh,

304
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,400
they suffered horrible,

305
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,490
horrible abuse at the hands of prison
guards at these local jail facilities.

306
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,890
And then also the prison guards
would let other prisoners,

307
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:05,670
uh,

308
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,690
other inmates,

309
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,350
um,

310
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,160
abused them,

311
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,850
beat them.

312
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,151
I mean,

313
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:12,090
literally like just
horrible being beaten up,

314
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,780
raped,

315
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,640
just horrible abuse.

316
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,920
And there were no records regarding these
people so that you didn't know whether

317
00:11:18,921 --> 00:11:21,500
somebody perhaps should have
been released the next day,

318
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:24,320
but they could be lost out in
one of these jail somewhere.

319
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:24,750
Right,

320
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,140
right,

321
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,411
right.

322
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:25,800
There were no,

323
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,440
there were no records of the public
defender's office didn't have records.

324
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:28,920
Um,

325
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,740
and so they were really
nameless and faceless and right.

326
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:32,400
And one of the,

327
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,233
of course,

328
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,020
um,

329
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,790
things that was really typical of
the Louisiana justice system was,

330
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,450
you know,

331
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,410
if during Katrina,

332
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:42,690
if you were charged with
a really serious offense,

333
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:44,520
like murder or rape,

334
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,340
and as a consequence of
Katrina and the flood,

335
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,720
the evidence was lost.

336
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,920
Well,

337
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,220
if,

338
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,490
if,

339
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,630
if after a year or two,

340
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:52,980
if you spent a year or two with no,

341
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,420
and just sort of moving throughout the
system and then eventually at the end

342
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,520
you've got released because
there was no evidence.

343
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:58,981
Well,

344
00:11:58,981 --> 00:12:00,270
you kind of made out like a bandit.

345
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,873
On the other hand,

346
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,190
if you were charged with
a very minor offense,

347
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:09,191
like disorderly conduct or
an open container and we're
in for like a day or two

348
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:13,280
or five days right before Katrina
hit and you spent six months,

349
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:17,420
six or eight months in the system
getting abused and raped and beaten up,

350
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,780
you of course really got
the short end of the stick.

351
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,130
And so of course the people who were,

352
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:27,020
who were charged with very minor offenses
who we would all agree we're least

353
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:28,760
deserving of any bad treatment,

354
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,050
they got the worst of it.

355
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,330
And then of course the most violent,

356
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:33,410
dangerous people,

357
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,180
they sort of made out like bandits.

358
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Tell us what you did to try to re or what
you did in fact go to restructure the

359
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:43,340
public defender office in New Orleans.

360
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,043
Um,

361
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,220
well what we did was,

362
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:46,800
uh,

363
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,190
um,

364
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,761
there were,

365
00:12:47,761 --> 00:12:47,910
uh,

366
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,170
there was a small group of people who
sort of immediately app after the storm,

367
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:52,861
um,

368
00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:55,230
sort of recognize this as an opportunity.

369
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:55,830
Um,

370
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,700
there was some people in the capital
field guy by the name of Ben Cone,

371
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,570
um,

372
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:00,990
um,

373
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,760
who does capital litigation.

374
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,360
Um,

375
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,260
and then the chief judge of the court
at the time who was Calvin Johnson,

376
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,320
who had been a public defender and been
a good advocate even on the bench for

377
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,910
indigent defense.

378
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:15,720
Um,

379
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,140
and it decided the perk decision on
ineffective assistance of counsel due to

380
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:21,630
case loads back in the early nineties.

381
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,620
Um,

382
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,130
they wreck,

383
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,110
we recognize this as an opportunity.

384
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:25,640
Um,

385
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,730
and the biggest opportunity was
because all of the funding dried up,

386
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,760
the public defender's office had to lay
off all or almost all of the lawyers,

387
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,250
which meant because it had
been a patronage system.

388
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,630
Once the money dried up,

389
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,210
the judges no longer
had an interest in it.

390
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,060
And once all the lawyers were laid off,

391
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,780
you didn't have a vested group interested
in keeping the old system and their

392
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:51,420
jobs and keeping things the way they were.

393
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,310
And so we,

394
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,900
we took this opportunity,

395
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:55,710
um,

396
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,690
and basically we,

397
00:13:57,691 --> 00:13:59,100
because the funding dried up,

398
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:00,360
we got some help from,

399
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,223
I had a friend,

400
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,300
a Harvard law school classmate who
was in charge of funding at the Soros

401
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:06,660
Foundation,

402
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,510
and we put them together
with the chief judge,

403
00:14:09,511 --> 00:14:10,590
Calvin Johnson.

404
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:11,550
Um,

405
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,550
and we're able to leverage some emergency
funding into reforming the office.

406
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:18,270
And initially,

407
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,100
um,

408
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,290
really Calvin Johnson did a lot of the
heavy lifting in terms of getting the

409
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,610
judges to,

410
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,660
um,

411
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,740
the old board.

412
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:28,590
Everybody had sort of
moved and left New Orleans.

413
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:33,150
And so we got the judges to appoint a
new board that was really interested in

414
00:14:33,151 --> 00:14:33,984
reform.

415
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,680
Um,

416
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,610
and uh,

417
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,001
um,

418
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:39,510
it had Derwyn Bunton who I think you've
spoken to and Denny Leboeuf on it.

419
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,210
It had somebody from two
lane and from Loyola,

420
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,190
Pam Metsker and Dane Seal Lino and some
local lawyers who were interested in

421
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:48,024
reform.

422
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,751
And then,

423
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:49,440
uh,

424
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,040
uh,

425
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,040
and I got hired on as the person on the
ground to reshape the public defender's

426
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:58,520
office because as Calvin Johnson put it,

427
00:14:58,521 --> 00:14:58,910
he came,

428
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,480
came to me and the Dean and he
asked the Dean to loan me out from,

429
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,090
from Loyola law school to
fix it because he was like,

430
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,481
well,

431
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:08,450
Steve's the only one who has actually
been a public defender in a good

432
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:09,890
functioning public defender's office.

433
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:10,610
And who knows?

434
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,200
Who knows what one of these things look,

435
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,113
looks like.

436
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,390
Um,

437
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,410
and because I had been at,

438
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:15,721
uh,

439
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:17,810
the public defender
service in Washington DC.

440
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,190
And what were the,

441
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:21,290
what were the fundamental changes,

442
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:21,500
uh,

443
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,070
that,

444
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,090
that resulted

445
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:23,950
the,

446
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,450
the,

447
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:24,850
the,

448
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,140
the biggest change?

449
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:29,110
And I would say the absolute
most important thing and sort of,

450
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:33,310
I guess what I would call sort of the
dirty little secret about public defense

451
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:38,311
and industry indigent defense is the most
important thing is not the structural

452
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:41,100
things are sort of the,

453
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,440
the way things look
structurally or the system.

454
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,220
Um,

455
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,920
but the most important
thing is the people.

456
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:53,850
You have to have dedicated people as
you yourself know from doing capital

457
00:15:54,491 --> 00:15:58,660
defense in the south you can have
low salaries and small resources,

458
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,880
but if you have really dedicated,

459
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:01,714
committed,

460
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,831
energetic,

461
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,390
smart people,

462
00:16:04,391 --> 00:16:05,224
lawyers,

463
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,030
you can go a long way.

464
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,230
Of course,

465
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,770
good lawyers and good dedicated people
will do better in a good system and a

466
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,810
good structure then in a bad structure.

467
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,600
But if you have bad people
who aren't interested,

468
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,030
it doesn't matter how good a
system or structure you have,

469
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:21,070
it doesn't matter what
the funding looks like,

470
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,113
it won't be good.

471
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,320
So the first thing I quite frankly
did was I just started hiring people.

472
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,270
I just started hiring good young,

473
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:29,440
energetic people,

474
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,460
um,

475
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,020
to fill up all the spots.

476
00:16:32,021 --> 00:16:33,340
And as I got more money,

477
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:36,940
I made sure I immediately hired
people to fill up that money.

478
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,631
So that it,

479
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:37,981
so that,

480
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:38,191
that,

481
00:16:38,191 --> 00:16:38,770
so that the,

482
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,120
so that the judges and the other political
powers couldn't force some of the

483
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,103
old,

484
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,130
um,

485
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,960
old people back into the system.

486
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,670
So then when you hire people full time,

487
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:50,504
right.

488
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,190
That was one of the first
changes we made was we went,

489
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,690
we,

490
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,080
we,

491
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,340
we immediately eliminated
the park time system.

492
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,850
Everyone was full time.

493
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,730
They had to be a full
time public defender.

494
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,040
We raised their salaries to,

495
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:02,640
to,

496
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,910
to match the district attorney's office
salaries so that they can have a good

497
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:06,840
living wage.

498
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:07,500
Um,

499
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,820
and we created a real salary structure
instead of this just flat part time,

500
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,560
$35,000 fee.

501
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,110
So you got more money
as you got experience.

502
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,300
Um,

503
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:17,640
we,

504
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,980
we hired investigators re I got Rick.

505
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,490
One of the first things I did was I was
the investigators that they had were

506
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,730
basically former cops just
double dipping in the system.

507
00:17:26,731 --> 00:17:30,780
And so we've got rid of all of the
investigators and hired new investigators.

508
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:35,781
I hired some investigators from the public
defender's office in DC to then hire

509
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:39,270
to create like an intern
investigative program.

510
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,463
Um,

511
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,980
we hired a,

512
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,950
we ha we got together,

513
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,930
we got hired social workers,

514
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,760
we've got office space.

515
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,001
You know,

516
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:51,600
one of the biggest first things
to do was we got office space,

517
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,500
um,

518
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,490
computers,

519
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,900
laptop computers that they could
take into court and plug in.

520
00:17:57,901 --> 00:17:59,550
They didn't have any of these basics.

521
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,060
Um,

522
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,530
there was no voicemail system.

523
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:02,680
They had no phone systems.

524
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,060
So we had to get a phone
system with voicemail.

525
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,100
We got office space with offices
for meeting with clients,

526
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:08,880
um,

527
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,160
and with witnesses and
with family members.

528
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,213
Um,

529
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:12,541
right.

530
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:12,691
They,

531
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:16,020
the way they used to take messages was
that it was just one phone line and they

532
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:18,270
would call in and people
would just pin a message,

533
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:18,991
a secretary.

534
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:21,000
We just pin a message to a message board.

535
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,110
Um,

536
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,120
so we got a real voice mail system.

537
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:24,510
Um,

538
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,650
just things that you would,

539
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,250
the normal accoutrements
of a regular law office.

540
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,230
And then the way you approached
representing clients,

541
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:34,690
you said before they
didn't even have files,

542
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:37,600
but now you took a
different approach as I am.

543
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,120
Right.

544
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,920
We created a case management system.

545
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:40,701
The other thing that,

546
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:40,881
that,

547
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:44,690
that was very symptomatic of
the system was in Louisiana.

548
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,560
Um,

549
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,940
you would get arrested and then your
bond would be determined at a first

550
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:50,960
appearance.

551
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,040
Uh,

552
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,040
but then the district attorney's office
had anywhere from 45 to 60 days if you

553
00:18:57,051 --> 00:19:02,051
were in jail up to 150 days if
you bonded out to file charges.

554
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,560
And that the public defender's office
didn't represent anybody during this pre

555
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:07,430
charging time.

556
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,880
So it could be anywhere from two to three
months if you were in jail up to six

557
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:13,431
months,

558
00:19:13,431 --> 00:19:16,700
if you were out of jail before
you ever got a public defender,

559
00:19:16,701 --> 00:19:18,710
a lawyer assigned to your case.

560
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,270
Um,

561
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,830
and of course if you're after six months,

562
00:19:21,831 --> 00:19:25,580
if you had an alibi or if
there was evidence it was gone.

563
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,170
It was long gone by that time.

564
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,390
If there was evidence
to prove your innocence.

565
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:29,991
Um,

566
00:19:29,991 --> 00:19:31,940
so one of the first things
we started started doing,

567
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:33,050
we went full time,

568
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,490
a full time lawyers and to a
system of vertical representation.

569
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,670
What do they mean by the
time the players right away,

570
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,840
at first appearance.

571
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,670
And then by vertical you mean those
lawyer stay with the client all the way

572
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,070
lawyer that they would get assigned a
lawyer at first appearance and that lawyer

573
00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:53,680
would stay with them throughout the case,

574
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:55,060
through all the stages of the case,

575
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,710
all the way till through
trial and sentencing rather
than the old system where

576
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,080
whatever lawyer was in
the courtroom at the time,

577
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,580
on the day you walked in.

578
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,590
That's what lawyer handled
your case that day.

579
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,620
Whether it was the same lawyer or a
different lawyer than you had before.

580
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,030
And how,

581
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,200
how did this was a huge
change then for New Orleans?

582
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:15,960
I mean before the lawyers
that almost acted like clerks,

583
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:17,700
they were in the courtroom
and they handled,

584
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,661
as you said,

585
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:19,500
whatever came in.

586
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:21,570
If lawyers who were following clients,

587
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:22,270
uh,

588
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,930
they're now going to different courtrooms.

589
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,810
So it's not quite as smooth
an operation as it had been.

590
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:28,644
Right,

591
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,493
right.

592
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,340
Of course.

593
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,000
Um,

594
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,220
the sold patronage because
the system had been,

595
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,680
the pre-katrina system had
been set up by the judges.

596
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:40,000
It worked extraordinarily well for the
judges because the lawyers just came to

597
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:41,200
the courtroom and lay,

598
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:42,034
as you said,

599
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,120
they were just like having,

600
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:45,640
they were just like the clerk or
the court reporter or the deputy,

601
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:47,170
they were just part of the accoutrements,

602
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,910
the judge in the courtroom
and they were just,

603
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,380
and they were just facility.

604
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,490
They were going to have a lawyer,

605
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,500
a name for the sixth amendment purposes
on the transcript and on the docket so

606
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:58,430
that the judge could move.

607
00:20:58,431 --> 00:20:59,500
I could move the docket.

608
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,320
Once we went to this system
of vertical representation,

609
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:05,320
of course the lawyers were running around
from courtroom to courtroom and we're

610
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:07,570
also going to the jail
to see their clients,

611
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,700
which was a tremendous novelty,

612
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,560
um,

613
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:10,970
um,

614
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:11,803
for the judges.

615
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,510
And they of course did not like the system
because it meant things took longer.

616
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,970
They could not get on and
off the bench just quickly.

617
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,780
Um,

618
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,010
they used to generally leave the
bench by certainly well before noon,

619
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:24,850
um,

620
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,710
most days unless they had a trial.

621
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,330
And so their reaction to that was
to try and use the contempt power,

622
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,633
um,

623
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,840
to lock people to,

624
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,860
to lock lawyers up to,

625
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,753
uh,

626
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:40,480
in order to try and force things
back the way they wanted them.

627
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,650
Um,

628
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,120
one of the first things I did,

629
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,810
uh,

630
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:47,050
when I started hiring lawyers is I
made a commitment to all the lawyers,

631
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,800
um,

632
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,760
that if they ever got in trouble
with any of the judges I would,

633
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:52,960
I wanted to keep,

634
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:57,010
I want it to keep all the
heat on management and off
of the individual lawyers

635
00:21:57,011 --> 00:22:01,090
because the individual lawyers were the
ones standing next to the clients and

636
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:02,530
had to represent the clients.

637
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,390
I and the other administrators.

638
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,740
We had no clients.

639
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:10,950
So I wanted all of the judges in political
anger focused on management and off

640
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:12,790
of the individual lawyers.

641
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,100
And I want to just the
individual lawyers to say,

642
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:15,791
look,

643
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:19,120
here's Steve singers number or
here's Christine Layman's number.

644
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,740
They're the ones in charge,

645
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,603
call them.

646
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,350
And so as a consequence,

647
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,810
I would go to court whenever
anyone had to go to jail.

648
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,790
I made sure I was the
one who went to jail,

649
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,530
not the individual lawyers.

650
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,790
So one we could keep the individual
lawyers working on the cases and also so

651
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,970
that the judges wouldn't take
it out on them and the clients.

652
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:37,631
And,

653
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:37,961
and,

654
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:42,580
and you were held in contempt and taken
into custody a number of times where

655
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:43,414
you're not?

656
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:43,911
Oh,

657
00:22:43,911 --> 00:22:44,540
yes,

658
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:44,960
many,

659
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,793
many times.

660
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,250
Um,

661
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,160
I was probably cited for contempt,

662
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,550
maybe somewhere between 10 and 20 times.

663
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,630
I'm held in contempt probably
eight to 10 times in,

664
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:57,351
locked in,

665
00:22:57,351 --> 00:22:59,240
locked up and put in jail.

666
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,230
Um,

667
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,390
probably eight to 10 or 12 times.

668
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,390
Um,

669
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:03,710
uh,

670
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,900
especially during the
first year or two that I,

671
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,070
that I was there.

672
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,083
Um,

673
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,601
you know,

674
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:08,930
but,

675
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,763
but we were,

676
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,120
but we were ready for that.

677
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:13,640
And because of my background
in Capital Litigation,

678
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,120
um,

679
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,510
we,

680
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:18,380
we had people set up with
the right pleadings to file
and the right documents to

681
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:19,730
fought to file,

682
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,240
um,

683
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,800
that it was never for very long.

684
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,693
And one of the,

685
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,800
one of the things I had learned from,

686
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,670
uh,

687
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,990
basically from you and from Clive doing
capital work was the beauty of sort of

688
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:30,824
contempt,

689
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,490
um,

690
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,200
was I could pick,

691
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:36,590
we could pick and choose when to fight
and when nine to fight we could pick and

692
00:23:36,591 --> 00:23:37,670
choose our battles.

693
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:38,923
So,

694
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,930
and if you and the judges were terrible,

695
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,070
we're terrible lawyers.

696
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,280
They weren't very good at litigators
because never had to really let a gate,

697
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:47,031
cause they were judges.

698
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:47,900
They got to rule.

699
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,153
Um,

700
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,940
which meant,

701
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,360
um,

702
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,880
out of all the Times I was
held in contempt and throw it,

703
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,500
not one ever stuck.

704
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,480
I never lost one of these in all the
times I was cited for contempt and held,

705
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,530
held in contempt,

706
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,280
you know,

707
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,260
20 times over a couple of years.

708
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,820
I never,

709
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,511
ultimately,

710
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:10,100
I never lost a single one of them because
if you pick and choose carefully where

711
00:24:10,101 --> 00:24:11,060
you fight your battles,

712
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:13,010
you pick and choose on
ground that you can win

713
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,600
and you would take these to the appellate
courts and they would vacate the

714
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:18,081
contempts.

715
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:18,480
Right,

716
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:18,830
right.

717
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,040
Nate would vacate the contempt.

718
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,150
The procedures were,

719
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,030
one of the things was I just learned
a lot about the minutia of contempt

720
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:24,870
procedures and,

721
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:25,231
and,

722
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:26,000
and they were very,

723
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,240
they were complicated enough that the
judges could rarely follow them precisely

724
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:32,460
and correctly in order to do it right.

725
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,740
And you'd go and you'd win.

726
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:34,951
I mean,

727
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:36,780
like a good example of that for example,

728
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:37,430
was,

729
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,830
um,

730
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:42,120
in one case a lawyer was
too ill to do a trial.

731
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:47,400
So the judge made me do the trial and I
of course knew nothing about the case.

732
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,730
And so I told the judge I wasn't going
to do anything cause I didn't know

733
00:24:50,731 --> 00:24:51,570
anything about the case.

734
00:24:51,571 --> 00:24:53,280
I couldn't do anything intelligently.

735
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,180
And so the judge started voire
deer and had the prosecutor do,

736
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,330
do her voire deer and then told me,

737
00:25:00,331 --> 00:25:00,571
okay,

738
00:25:00,571 --> 00:25:01,950
it was my turn to do my voir dire.

739
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,360
And I told the judge back in chambers,

740
00:25:03,361 --> 00:25:03,601
I said,

741
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:04,410
I'm not gonna,

742
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,221
I'm not gonna do anything.

743
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:07,230
I'm just going to stand up and say
I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen,

744
00:25:07,231 --> 00:25:09,930
I can't ask any questions cause I
don't know anything about the case.

745
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,333
Um,

746
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,690
and she and the judge,

747
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:13,560
the judge,

748
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:13,860
you know,

749
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,191
said,

750
00:25:14,191 --> 00:25:14,371
well,

751
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:16,590
we're going to go out there and
you're going to go do voire deer.

752
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:21,120
And she ordered me out there and of course
I said it did exactly what I said and

753
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:25,050
she stopped the trial and got an excuse
the jury and then held me in contempt.

754
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:29,100
But of course she was holding me in
contempt for not asking any questions in

755
00:25:29,101 --> 00:25:29,934
voir dire.

756
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:30,721
Well,

757
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:33,660
obviously that was not going to stand
up because if you don't want to,

758
00:25:33,661 --> 00:25:35,950
if a lawyer doesn't want to
ask any questions in war deer,

759
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,220
there's nothing that says that you
can have with the lawyer has to ask

760
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:39,054
questions.

761
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,433
So they would,

762
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,140
they would fight on sort of
foolish grounds like that.

763
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,000
Um,

764
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,370
where,

765
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,300
where I could always win.

766
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,451
Well,

767
00:25:46,451 --> 00:25:47,141
let me ask you this.

768
00:25:47,141 --> 00:25:48,190
How would you say,

769
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:48,910
uh,

770
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:52,630
since 2005 with this new office,

771
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:54,700
with a new approach to handling cases,

772
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,600
uh,

773
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,590
where is indigent defense
the representation of poor
people accused of crimes in

774
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,640
New Orleans today?

775
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,370
I think it's each certainly vastly,

776
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:09,090
vastly improved from where
it was right before Katrina.

777
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,470
And certainly after Katrina,

778
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,070
but,

779
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,020
but it's much better than
it was before Katrina.

780
00:26:13,021 --> 00:26:14,190
Just to give you an idea,

781
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,400
the total funding for the
office pre Katrina was about
1.75 to maybe $2 million,

782
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:22,110
maybe some years.

783
00:26:22,111 --> 00:26:24,960
It was 2.1 million per year.

784
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,173
Um,

785
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,670
by the time I left in 2009,

786
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,450
it was,

787
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,980
it was 6.2 million.

788
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,150
Um,

789
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,700
and subsequently get went up from that.

790
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,953
Um,

791
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,320
and a lot of people have heard
in the news about recent cuts,

792
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:40,740
um,

793
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,210
to the public defender's budget,

794
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:47,660
but those cuts were cuts back from 9
million back to about six and a half or 7

795
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:48,960
million.

796
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,220
So you're still talking a good three
or four times what it was in terms of

797
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:54,240
resources,

798
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:54,720
um,

799
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,970
what it was pre Katrina.

800
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,690
And then of course the resources
are being used much better.

801
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,770
You have fulltime,

802
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,420
you have everyone at all.

803
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:04,660
Lawyers are full time,

804
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,090
you have no part time.

805
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,343
Um,

806
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,040
you have,

807
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,550
uh,

808
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:08,910
you have,

809
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,450
you have,

810
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,520
you have a good supervisory structure,

811
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,030
um,

812
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,090
with experienced lawyers in
supervisory positions in good young,

813
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,070
energetic lawyers being hired.

814
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:21,360
The hiring isn't just local from the
local private criminal defense bar who

815
00:27:21,361 --> 00:27:22,920
contributes to judges campaigns.

816
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:27,360
Instead they hire nationally from the
top law schools all around the country.

817
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,050
Um,

818
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,910
just like a good law office would.

819
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,133
Um,

820
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,130
and uh,

821
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:32,580
um,

822
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:32,970
and they have,

823
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:33,300
they have,

824
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,520
they have several social workers on staff.

825
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,660
They have a whole,

826
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,710
they have a whole pre-charge unit that
deals with clients sort of in this

827
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:42,960
pre-charge phase with their bond,

828
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:43,770
um,

829
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,990
and getting work and getting,

830
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,330
getting situated back into the community.

831
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,290
Um,

832
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,330
so it's significantly better now.

833
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:55,770
Some of the progress has slowed down as
sort of state budgets with the recession

834
00:27:55,771 --> 00:27:57,450
and the end of the federal stimulus.

835
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,830
Some of the fast advancement that we
had in the first three or four years,

836
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:03,360
things have sort of leveled off,

837
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:07,800
but I think there are still
well positioned and well
situated to take advantage

838
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:12,150
once the economy revives and state
budgets revive to take advantage and keep

839
00:28:12,151 --> 00:28:13,170
progressing forward.

840
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:17,070
And one of the things I try and tell
people is I came from the public defender

841
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,330
service in Washington DC,

842
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:20,880
which is regarded as a great
public defenders office.

843
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:26,510
But even the public defender service in
DC wasn't what it wasn't in 1975 what it

844
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:27,420
is now.

845
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,253
It takes,

846
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,341
it takes 20,

847
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:29,701
30,

848
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:31,680
40 years to really build,

849
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:32,910
um,

850
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:33,743
a good,

851
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,090
a really good solid office like that.

852
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:40,200
And so I think you have to take the long
view and so there'll be some ups and

853
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:43,710
downs and they're probably in a little
bit of a leveling off or a down period

854
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:44,011
now.

855
00:28:44,011 --> 00:28:45,420
But I expect that,

856
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,040
um,

857
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,630
there,

858
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,680
there will be well positioned to take
advantage and keep moving forward,

859
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:50,880
I think over the long haul.

860
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,950
I hope so.

861
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,240
Let,

862
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,810
let me ask you this professor's singer,

863
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:59,150
could we switch topics just a bit and
let me ask you to talk about a person

864
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:01,490
facing the death penalty in Louisiana.

865
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:03,980
Louisiana is still sentence
a number of people to death.

866
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:05,840
It has a number of
people on its death row.

867
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,033
Um,

868
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,560
what,

869
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,720
what is the quality representation in
Louisiana for people facing the death

870
00:29:11,721 --> 00:29:12,554
penalty?

871
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,310
It is,

872
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,230
it is very uneven.

873
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,820
It's very uneven.

874
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,270
Uh,

875
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,070
the state operates,

876
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,330
uh,

877
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,390
a number of spa.

878
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,780
The state public defender
Board operates a number of,

879
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:24,863
um,

880
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,990
capital programs that are,

881
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,480
that are basically
regional capital programs.

882
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:34,481
There's one up in Shreveport for in Caddo
parish for sort of the northwest part

883
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:35,804
of the state.

884
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,900
There's one in baton rouge for
the central part of the state.

885
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,650
There's one down in New Orleans for the,

886
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,040
uh,

887
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,080
sort of southeast region of the state.

888
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,440
And then there's my old office Clive's
Clive's old office LCAC Louisiana Capital

889
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:50,710
Assistance Center.

890
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,480
That's sort of a jet super
regional office that goes around.

891
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:56,470
And it,

892
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,060
it sort of depends who you get.

893
00:29:58,061 --> 00:29:58,894
There are some,

894
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,600
there are some very good
high quality lawyers.

895
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,010
Um,

896
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,000
certainly the people at Lcac,

897
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,240
um,

898
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,021
Richard Bark,

899
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:06,190
Christine laymen,

900
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,473
um,

901
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:07,780
uh,

902
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,980
Elizabeth Co,

903
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:09,970
the lawyers,

904
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:14,290
the lawyers that that office are really
quite good and if you're lucky enough to

905
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,630
get them on your case,

906
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:17,720
um,

907
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,250
um,

908
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:18,960
or people are,

909
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,760
or them working with other
local lawyers on your case,

910
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,520
you can get quite good representation,

911
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,260
which of course as you know,

912
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,540
generally results in no death penalty.

913
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,110
Um,

914
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,430
if you have decent lawyer ring,

915
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,463
um,

916
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:35,060
and there are a number of lawyers
carry Coocha in the southeast,

917
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,490
the New Orleans office.

918
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:37,360
Um,

919
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,350
he's a very good,

920
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,420
good capital lawyer and he runs a pretty,

921
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:40,600
uh,

922
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,860
a very good shop,

923
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,083
um,

924
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:43,990
then,

925
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,280
but elsewhere in the state,

926
00:30:45,281 --> 00:30:46,850
if you're not fortunate to get one,

927
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:47,770
a lawyer,

928
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,200
you know,

929
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,840
one of these really good lawyers,

930
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:54,160
if you get just a local lawyer
or one of the weaker cap,

931
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,380
it'll programs in the state,

932
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,430
then you're in,

933
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,990
then you're in really dire straits,

934
00:30:58,991 --> 00:30:59,824
then you're in trouble.

935
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,900
And occasionally it
does this still happen.

936
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:03,734
I know.

937
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,720
And Jason Reeves case,

938
00:31:05,721 --> 00:31:09,800
it was first handled by one
of these regional offices
that you mentioned and was

939
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,570
a hung jury at the guilt phase.

940
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:12,140
Uh,

941
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,580
but then the local public defender who
protested that he had so many cases,

942
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:20,780
but against his will was forced
onto the case and occurs.

943
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,300
That pretty much decided
the case right there.

944
00:31:23,301 --> 00:31:24,830
Reeves was sentenced to death.

945
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,150
Uh,

946
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,470
does that still happen?

947
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:33,170
That still does happen and it especially
happens in it where Jason Reeves

948
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:37,290
happened in Lake Charles up
in Caddo parish in Shreveport.

949
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,453
Um,

950
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,160
sort of in the northern and
western parts of the state.

951
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:41,760
Um,

952
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,400
they try and keep out the,

953
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:48,990
the best lawyers who are generally not
surprisingly are in the big metropolitan

954
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,740
regions of Baton Rouge and,

955
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,200
uh,

956
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,560
and New Orleans,

957
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,280
which I did most generally
the most desirable places
to live in where there's a

958
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,840
lot of good legal talent.

959
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:58,890
Um,

960
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:02,610
and so that sort of thing still does
happen and there's a lot of resistance.

961
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,080
Um,

962
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,820
I would say especially
now in Caddo parish,

963
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,040
up in Shreveport,

964
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:11,850
up in the northwest corner of the state
to anyone from down in the New Orleans

965
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,770
Baton Rouge area coming up there.

966
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,933
And uh,

967
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,100
that generally determines your fate.

968
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:17,281
Yeah.

969
00:32:17,281 --> 00:32:19,110
Jason Reeves was a really stark example.

970
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:20,740
They saw what happened
with good lawyering,

971
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,950
so they decided to change that.

972
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,900
And of course that changed the outcome.

973
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,250
And unfortunately you were saying
that still happens in some places and

974
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:30,690
particularly in Shreveport.

975
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,291
Yeah,

976
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:33,630
I would say particularly in
Shreveport and the north,

977
00:32:33,631 --> 00:32:34,050
north,

978
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,580
the further north and west you get,

979
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:40,070
the closer you get to the Texas border
to Houston and Dallas outside of sort of

980
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:41,450
the western part of the state.

981
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:42,290
Um,

982
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:46,070
that's still a real problem where
they are extremely resistant,

983
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,283
um,

984
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,370
to people like the Richard Barks and,

985
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,640
and Christine Layman's and the
really good capital lawyers.

986
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,211
You know,

987
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:54,044
for example,

988
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:54,890
um,

989
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:58,940
previously one of the big death
penalty jurisdictions in the state,

990
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,110
one of the four big,

991
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,000
the four big ones where Jefferson parish,

992
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:02,601
Louisiana,

993
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:04,910
which was the white flight
area from New Orleans,

994
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,770
Baton Rouge,

995
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,970
east Baton Rouge,

996
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:08,540
um,

997
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,100
Caddo parish up in Shreveport
and calc issue Paris,

998
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,651
which was late.

999
00:33:11,651 --> 00:33:14,300
Charles Jefferson was one of the worst,

1000
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,260
um,

1001
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:19,010
Lcac Richard Bark and Clive
Stafford Smith and Ben cone.

1002
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,560
They basically made
Jefferson parish a project.

1003
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,590
Jefferson parish now never break.

1004
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,341
They don't bring their,

1005
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:27,320
not interested in bringing
capital cases anymore.

1006
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,900
They just don't even charge
the death penalty anymore.

1007
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,820
The local prosecutor,

1008
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,721
not officially,

1009
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:33,321
but unofficially,

1010
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:34,250
is basically said,

1011
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,180
it's not worth it.

1012
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,250
We'll just take the life without parole.

1013
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,120
And they've shut down the death
penalty in one of the four biggest

1014
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:42,080
jurisdictions.

1015
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,690
So it shows you what
good lawyering can do.

1016
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:45,973
Um,

1017
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,940
but then obviously the opposite
is true elsewhere in the state.

1018
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,000
And we've seen that in some other places
that are talked about in the materials

1019
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:55,410
that people have for the course,

1020
00:33:55,411 --> 00:33:59,220
which is other places like Philadelphia
and places that have started capital

1021
00:33:59,221 --> 00:34:00,090
defender offices.

1022
00:34:00,091 --> 00:34:03,660
And the difference that that has
made with regard to representation,

1023
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:04,720
it,

1024
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:04,960
it's,

1025
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,731
it's unbelievable.

1026
00:34:05,731 --> 00:34:05,911
I mean,

1027
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:10,470
one of the things I'd like to say
say is that other than one volunteer,

1028
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,220
since I've been in Louisiana since 1999,

1029
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,210
um,

1030
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:20,070
there's was one volunteer a couple of
years ago and then there was less smart in

1031
00:34:20,071 --> 00:34:22,010
2002 and no,

1032
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,730
in,

1033
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,221
you're talking,

1034
00:34:23,221 --> 00:34:25,290
so in the past 14,

1035
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:25,981
15 years,

1036
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:29,430
there have been two
executions in a deep south,

1037
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:32,790
southern high death penalty state.

1038
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,980
There've been two executions.

1039
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:39,900
And the reason for that
is basically during the,

1040
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:43,260
during the mid to late 1990s
and early two thousands,

1041
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,520
you add a small,

1042
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,830
you're talking about
basically five lawyers.

1043
00:34:46,831 --> 00:34:48,450
You're talking to Clive Stafford Smith,

1044
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:49,710
Denny Leboeuf,

1045
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:54,990
nick trying to Costa Neil Walker and
Ben comb five very committed lawyers for

1046
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:03,590
working hard shutdown the death penalty
in the state of Louisiana essentially.

1047
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:05,500
Well,

1048
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,450
Jay a spa,

1049
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,020
it's um,

1050
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,960
it's amazing what a small
group of really smart,

1051
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:10,501
talented,

1052
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:12,750
committed lawyers can do.

1053
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:13,530
Um,

1054
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,650
even in a death penalty
hotbed location like,

1055
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,850
like Louisiana.

1056
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:18,991
And,

1057
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,210
and this is both at the trial level,

1058
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:24,100
but also in the appeals process that

1059
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,710
you had.

1060
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,041
You had,

1061
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:26,880
you had three or four,

1062
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:27,630
you had,

1063
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:27,990
you had,

1064
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,500
you had people like Denny Leboeuf and
Clive Stafford Smith and Neil Walker do

1065
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:33,420
and myself doing trial work.

1066
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,590
And then you had people like nick trying
to Costa and Ben Cohen and Denny doing

1067
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:42,591
appeals and post conviction and that
end handling it all the way through and

1068
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:44,580
that basically shut it down.

1069
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,180
Um,

1070
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,890
and now that a lot of
those people have left,

1071
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:50,400
were worried what things are going to
look like five or 10 years down the road

1072
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:52,950
that they won't look like
the last 10 or 15 years.

1073
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,590
But it is remarkable.

1074
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,683
Um,

1075
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:57,870
I mean,

1076
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:01,230
nothing makes your article on how the
death penalty is for not for the worst

1077
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:01,591
crimes,

1078
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:02,530
but for the worst lawyers.

1079
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,413
True.

1080
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:08,340
Then if you look at Louisiana from
the early 1990s to the present,

1081
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:09,790
professor,

1082
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,051
singer,

1083
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:13,440
thank you very much for your
time and for your insights.

1084
00:36:13,441 --> 00:36:14,490
We are most grateful.

1085
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,750
My pleasure.
