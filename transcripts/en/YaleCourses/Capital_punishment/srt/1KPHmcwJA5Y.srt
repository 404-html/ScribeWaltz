1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,180
Once the supreme court upheld the
death pony in 1976 and the three cases,

2
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:23,040
Greg versus Georgia profit versus
Florida and a jerk versus Texas,

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:23,621
uh,

4
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:26,900
there were still a number of issues
remaining for the court to decide.

5
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:27,870
Uh,

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,540
one of those was a,

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,810
the proportionality,

8
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:32,550
what crimes to the death penalty,

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:33,181
uh,

10
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:34,014
applied to,

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:34,741
uh,

12
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:36,660
what about the role of the,

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,321
uh,

14
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:38,760
offender in the crime?

15
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,120
Uh,

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,000
the role that a person played
where several people were involved,

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:42,721
uh,

18
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:43,770
for certain crimes.

19
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:43,981
Uh,

20
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:44,281
the,

21
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:46,140
all of the three cases handled,

22
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:46,710
uh,

23
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,730
in are decided by the court
in 1976 were murder cases.

24
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:51,181
Uh,

25
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:54,720
but what about the death penalty for
cases in which the victim is not killed?

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,720
Many of the states which adopted
new death penalty statutes,

27
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:58,730
particularly Georgia,

28
00:00:59,030 --> 00:00:59,310
uh,

29
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,600
provided for the death pony,

30
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:01,710
not only for murder,

31
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:02,491
but for rape,

32
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:03,324
kidnapping,

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:03,871
uh,

34
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:04,980
and other offenses.

35
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:05,551
Uh,

36
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:08,010
and so the court ultimately decided that,

37
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:08,940
and then finally,

38
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:09,750
uh,

39
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,860
for certain offenders,

40
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,370
uh,

41
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,610
particularly people who are
mentally disabled and children,

42
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,361
uh,

43
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:18,930
is the death penalty
excessive or disproportionate,

44
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,620
uh,

45
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,630
for those individuals.

46
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,910
And what we're going to
see in today's class,

47
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,950
as we look through this,

48
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:29,100
as the court is going to
be counting the states,

49
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:30,360
how many states have,

50
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:30,990
uh,

51
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,823
provided,

52
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,280
uh,

53
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,851
for,

54
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:33,150
uh,

55
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,590
whatever the court's considering.

56
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,131
Uh,

57
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:39,420
is this show that there's a trend or
does it show that there is a consensus

58
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:40,470
among the states?

59
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,281
Because again,

60
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:43,620
we're back to what we talked
about where the eighth amendment,

61
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,910
what are the evolving
standards of decency that mark,

62
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,510
uh,

63
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:48,871
the,

64
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:49,470
the,

65
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,540
the development of the law.

66
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,111
Uh,

67
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,740
and then we'll also see the court look
at whether or not with each of these

68
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,574
questions,

69
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:56,910
uh,

70
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,070
the purpose of punishment is served.

71
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:01,950
And that's a deterrence and retribution.

72
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:02,870
Uh,

73
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,990
so let's first look at the question
of the role of the offender.

74
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,470
Uh,

75
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,303
in the crime,

76
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,730
uh,

77
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,720
several people are engaged say,

78
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:12,120
in carrying out a crime,

79
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,470
each person has a different role.

80
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,250
Uh,

81
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,660
one person may be the lookout,

82
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:18,420
one person may be the
driver of the getaway car.

83
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,350
Uh,

84
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,270
and perhaps there was no intent when
this crime was plan for there to be any

85
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:26,280
injury to any one or any loss of life.

86
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:26,920
Uh,

87
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,830
but often unexpected things happen.

88
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,580
The police respond and shots
ring out and someone is killed.

89
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,620
Uh,

90
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,730
and then we assess the,

91
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,810
uh,

92
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,340
role of each person.

93
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,390
Uh,

94
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,540
they're all going to be guilty as
we'll talk about in a moment of murder.

95
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:42,960
Uh,

96
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,050
but the degree of
culpability may be different.

97
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,580
And so the question is going to be,

98
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:50,580
are they culpable enough
to be sentenced to death?

99
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:52,200
And I'd like to talk about two cases,

100
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:52,831
uh,

101
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:57,831
where the supreme court decided that
both of these cases involve the felony

102
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:58,824
murder rule,

103
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,080
which is a rule that just basically says
anyone who commits a felony and the co

104
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,750
or committing a felony in
which a murder is committed,

105
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:08,350
uh,

106
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,020
that person is guilty of murder,

107
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,100
first degree murder,

108
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,500
regardless of whether he or she committed
or attempted to commit or intended to

109
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:19,420
commit the murder.

110
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,493
And other words,

111
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,480
going back to my example,

112
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:23,830
three people are involved.

113
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,700
The person who's the lookout is going
to be just as guilty of murder as the

114
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:31,090
person who actually fired the
trigger that brought about the death.

115
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,240
But there's obviously different degrees
of culpability between the lookout and

116
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:38,500
the person who actually pulls the trigger.

117
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,251
Uh,

118
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:39,821
and of course,

119
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:42,340
part of that is going to be
based on what the people do.

120
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,031
That was,

121
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:44,290
what actions did they take.

122
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,960
And part of it is going to be
based on the state of mind.

123
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:47,920
Uh,

124
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,720
this first came to the court in the
case of Earl Inman versus Florida.

125
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,760
This was the getaway driver,

126
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,180
uh,

127
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,170
in an arm robbery.

128
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:56,921
Uh,

129
00:03:56,921 --> 00:04:01,570
and the question the court had to decide
was could he be sentenced to death?

130
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:02,920
He had been sentenced to death.

131
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,001
And the question was,

132
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:07,870
could he be sentenced to death if
his participation in the crime was,

133
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,711
as the court said,

134
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:12,460
tangential and he had no attempt,

135
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,121
excuse me,

136
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:16,300
no intent to kill or for life to be taken.

137
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,411
Uh,

138
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:18,131
in the case,

139
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:23,131
the court looks at the different states
and it finds Florida's one of only eight

140
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:27,940
states that allows the death penalty for
a person who participates in a robbery

141
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,940
where the other robber is the
person who takes the life.

142
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:31,811
Uh,

143
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:36,811
they find that of the 739 people who
were under death sentence at the time,

144
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:40,810
the Inman case was decided only 41,

145
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:41,590
uh,

146
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,070
where people who had not
actually taken the life.

147
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:45,941
So again,

148
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:49,960
the court is looking at what are the
states provide and then they're looking at

149
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:53,560
what has been the practice even
in the states that allowed this.

150
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,130
Uh,

151
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,830
then the court examines
retribution and deterrence,

152
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,610
uh,

153
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,050
and they decide in this case that
retribution and deterrence is not served a

154
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:02,231
bill,

155
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:04,480
cause Edmonds participation,

156
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,050
uh,

157
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,210
was so tangential.

158
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,710
So the court,

159
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,320
uh,

160
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,630
holes that the death
penalty is disproportion,

161
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:12,460
very close case.

162
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,630
It's a five to four decision justice
white writing for a majority of the court

163
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,790
and Justice O'connor as well.

164
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:19,481
If she says this,

165
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:22,800
Berger and Justice Powell and
Justice Rehnquist dissenting,

166
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:23,860
uh,

167
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,520
the court is now going to look at a
case with a very different set of facts,

168
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,031
uh,

169
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:29,620
and we're going to see justice white,

170
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,130
uh,

171
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,530
move over to the other side.

172
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,490
Uh,

173
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,760
Ricky and Ricky Wayne and Raymond Curtis.

174
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:40,600
Tyson a broke their father
out of a prison in Arizona.

175
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,391
Uh,

176
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:43,780
they had a large amount of a weapons,

177
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,351
uh,

178
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:45,370
in an ice chest,

179
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:48,310
which they snuck into the prison
and they actually succeeded,

180
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:48,940
uh,

181
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,200
in this breakout there.

182
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:52,750
Father Gary Tyson and another prisoner,

183
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:53,350
uh,

184
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,520
Randy Greenwall,

185
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,330
uh,

186
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,150
we're,

187
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,840
uh,

188
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,410
broken out of prison and while
they're trying to make their getaway,

189
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,770
they end up breaking down on the road,

190
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,080
a couple stops to give help.

191
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,180
And it was just a terrible crime.

192
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,380
Uh,

193
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,090
Greenwalt and Gary Tyson,

194
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:11,924
the father,

195
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,620
uh,

196
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,453
kill,

197
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:13,791
uh,

198
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:17,480
this couple who had been so nice to stop
and offer them a ride as well as their

199
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,260
children.

200
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,240
So it's a horrendous crime.

201
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:20,930
Uh,

202
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,763
but,

203
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,581
uh,

204
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:25,670
the police apprehend
them after a shootout,

205
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,200
but Gary Tyson has died.

206
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:30,380
He goes out into the desert
and he can't find his way back.

207
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:30,950
Uh,

208
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,540
he dies of exposure.

209
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,490
So the brothers are,

210
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:35,690
the people left to be tried.

211
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:36,820
Greenwald gets the death penalty.

212
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,840
There's no question about his involvement.

213
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,030
But the Garret,

214
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,060
the two brothers are arguing that
they did not intend to kill anyone,

215
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,630
that father and the other fellow had
taken these people away and that they were

216
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:53,240
walking back to the car.

217
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,200
At the time the shots rang out and they
found out that these people had been

218
00:06:57,201 --> 00:07:01,880
killed and they said also they didn't
cause the death of the victims in this

219
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:02,330
case.

220
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,620
And as a result of that,

221
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,340
their argument was that while
they were guilty of murder,

222
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,490
they can't be subjected
to the death penalty.

223
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:12,650
They can be put in prison
for the rest of their life,

224
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:13,381
but not the death.

225
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:13,850
Polly,

226
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,700
this time the court looks at the breakout,

227
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,920
looks at the guns involved,

228
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:19,820
looks at the,

229
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:25,030
all of the factors in the case and
decides five to four that this the death

230
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:29,330
penalty can be imposed
against the Tyson brothers.

231
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:29,901
Uh,

232
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:31,730
justice O'Connor writes for the court,

233
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,270
uh,

234
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,540
joined by the chief justice as well
as just as white who had written the

235
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:39,320
previous opinion in
Edmond Powell and Scalia.

236
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,131
Uh,

237
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:43,970
and the court finds that there
is a consensus among the states,

238
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,601
uh,

239
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:46,400
that major participation.

240
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,090
Remember that Earl elements
participation was tangential.

241
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,300
Now the court's talking
about major participation,

242
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:54,680
breaking someone out of prison,

243
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:59,681
trying to escape with them and a mental
state that the court calls reckless

244
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,480
disregard for human life.

245
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,110
That if you participate
in an activity like this,

246
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,980
you're likely to realize the risk
that there may be human life taken,

247
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,581
uh,

248
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:14,750
as a part of it.

249
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:19,751
And therefore the level of culpability
is more than Emonds and that's sufficient

250
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,160
for the death penalty.

251
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,720
A Justice Brennan,

252
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,290
uh,

253
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,560
joined by three other
members of the court dissent.

254
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,020
Uh,

255
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,130
they would treat the Tyson's just like
Inman and they would say that because of

256
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:36,131
the role that they've played because they
weren't the actual killers and because

257
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:41,000
they didn't intend to kill because they
were surprised by what their father and

258
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,330
the other person did that they should
not be subject to the death penalty.

259
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:47,930
But the court is now established
that major participation,

260
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:53,140
reckless disregard is going to be enough
to make someone eligible for the death

261
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,770
penalty and codefendant cases.

262
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,113
Um,

263
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,720
the court next turns to the question
of whether crimes that don't involve a

264
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:06,030
homicide are subject to the death penalty.

265
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:06,660
Uh,

266
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,850
very soon after the,

267
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:09,451
for the,

268
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:09,720
uh,

269
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,160
1976 cases,

270
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:14,370
the court looks at coker versus Georgia.

271
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,440
And the question presented there to the
Supreme Court is whether the sentence of

272
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:23,940
death for the rape of an adult woman
violates the eighth amendment's cruel and

273
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:25,440
unusual punishment clause.

274
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,360
It's important to note adult woman
because even after this court or the court

275
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,530
decided this case,

276
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,041
uh,

277
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:37,041
there remained a question about whether
or not a sexual abuse or rape of a child

278
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,440
might be eligible for the death penalty.

279
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,653
Uh,

280
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,850
but George's problem and arguing for
the death penalty for the crime of rape,

281
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:47,790
uh,

282
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,650
was that it was fairly well isolated,

283
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,250
uh,

284
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,440
after the Ferman decision had come down.

285
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:55,950
And his number of states adopted
new death penalty statutes.

286
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:56,701
Only three,

287
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:57,480
Georgia,

288
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,160
North Carolina and Louisiana,

289
00:09:59,370 --> 00:09:59,640
uh,

290
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,430
provided the death penalty
for the crime of rape.

291
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,600
Uh,

292
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,560
but the North Carolina,

293
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:09,561
Louisiana statutes were both found to
be unconstitutional in 1976 and Woodson,

294
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,321
uh,

295
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:13,200
versus North Carolina and
Roberts versus Louisiana.

296
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:13,870
Uh,

297
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,290
so Georgia now has left as the only state,

298
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,040
uh,

299
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,480
that makes this provision.

300
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:22,920
So when the court now does this
examination of how many states have this

301
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:23,750
punishment,

302
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,970
uh,

303
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,190
Georgia finds itself all alone.

304
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:26,890
Uh,

305
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:31,890
the court looks at the last 50 years and
notices that are majority of the states

306
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:36,981
have not punished rape with the
death penalty in the last 50 years.

307
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:37,711
Uh,

308
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:39,000
in 1925,

309
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,800
18 states provided,

310
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,430
uh,

311
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,690
for the death penalty and as well as
the district of Columbia and the federal

312
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:46,450
government,

313
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:46,740
uh,

314
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,240
by 1971,

315
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,740
that number gone down just a bit,

316
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:52,650
16 states and the federal government.

317
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,810
But by the time cokers decided,

318
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,411
uh,

319
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:56,730
in 1977,

320
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,590
only Georgia.

321
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:04,260
So Georgia is one out of 50 states
that provides this punishment.

322
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,180
The court then looks to what if the jury's
in Georgia been doing with regard to

323
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:11,610
this and it finds that of the,

324
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,390
uh,

325
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,390
63 rape cases that have happened or
that had been tried capitally uh,

326
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,460
in Georgia since this statute was adopted,

327
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,150
uh,

328
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,750
only six times have juries
impose the death penalty.

329
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,140
So the court concludes
that it's infrequent.

330
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,090
That is only one state has it.

331
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,800
And even in the state that has it,

332
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,830
it's infrequently used a justice white,

333
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:35,760
uh,

334
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,740
writes the opinion and expresses the,

335
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,980
not only does the counting of the states
but expresses the abiding conviction

336
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:47,010
that the death penalty is
excessive for the crime of rape,

337
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,660
particularly since some people who
actually kill people don't get the death

338
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:52,440
pony.

339
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,780
What we're seeing here is the
court is roughly going to say,

340
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,500
uh,

341
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,500
that the death pony is limited to cases
and where life has taken the same day

342
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,730
that a coker was decided.

343
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:05,380
The Supreme Court just issued a little,

344
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:10,240
a one paragraph opinion in a case called
Everhart versus Georgia in which it

345
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:13,780
said that the death penalty cannot be
imposed for the crime of kidnapping where

346
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:15,370
there had not been a loss of life.

347
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,000
Uh,

348
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,811
and as we'll see,

349
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:19,480
the court is going to decide
and Kennedy versus Louisiana,

350
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:21,610
the even in the case of a child,

351
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,300
uh,

352
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,230
the death penalty cannot be imposed
where there is no loss of life.

353
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,430
Uh,

354
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,670
Brennan and Marshall in this case
say that the death ponies always

355
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:31,780
unconstitutional.

356
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,351
Uh,

357
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:37,351
so they join the majority of justice
white rights and they side with him.

358
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:38,980
But for different reason.

359
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,090
Uh,

360
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:45,040
Justice Powell says the death pony may
be constitutional for aggravated rape.

361
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,061
Uh,

362
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:48,010
and then just as Chief Justice Burger,

363
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:48,700
uh,

364
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,290
joined by Justice Rehnquist says
that rape is not disproportionate.

365
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,251
Uh,

366
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:56,410
and he looks at coker in particular.

367
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:57,160
Uh,

368
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,120
in three years,

369
00:12:58,121 --> 00:12:59,590
coker had raped three people.

370
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,460
He had killed one.

371
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:02,530
He had tried to kill
another and he had escaped.

372
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,870
If ever there is a person,

373
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,770
chief justice burger is saying for whom
the death penalty is appropriate for

374
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:09,640
this crime.

375
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,743
It's coker.

376
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:11,620
Uh,

377
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,300
he describes him as a,

378
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,500
or the chief justice describes coker as
a chronic rapist and a continuing threat

379
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:19,474
to society.

380
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,170
Uh,

381
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,270
but that's the descending opinion.

382
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:22,740
Uh,

383
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,560
so the result of the case is that the
death penalty cannot be imposed in a rape

384
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:29,140
case where there's no loss of life.

385
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,750
Now we move to Kennedy versus Louisiana
in which the court took on the sort of

386
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:35,650
exception here.

387
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,750
Coker had been about an adult,

388
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:38,410
uh,

389
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,243
person,

390
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:39,670
uh,

391
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,910
Kennedy versus Louisiana
presents the question of a child.

392
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:43,570
Uh,

393
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,171
once again,

394
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:45,880
this is just as Anthony Kennedy,

395
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:46,421
uh,

396
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:48,820
is going to write the opinion
for the Supreme Court.

397
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:49,870
Uh,

398
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,890
very interesting.

399
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,610
Uh,

400
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,630
what he says,

401
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:52,990
uh,

402
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:53,700
at the,

403
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,890
in prefacing his analysis
of the issue here,

404
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,440
that when the law punishable by death,

405
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,191
uh,

406
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,490
it risks its own sudden
descent into brutality,

407
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,110
uh,

408
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,140
transgressing the constitutional
commitment to decency and restraint.

409
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,720
He says the evolving standards of decency
counsel us to be most hesitant before

410
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:17,320
interpreting the eighth amendment in
a way that's going to extend the death

411
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:17,920
pony.

412
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,480
The court is limited in many ways and now
justice Kennedy is saying we should be

413
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:27,481
very hesitant to extend the death
pelly decency in its essence a presumes

414
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:34,111
respect for the individual
and this moderation and
restraint in the application

415
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,590
of capital punishment.

416
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,041
Sure.

417
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:40,150
Markable statement for a majority of
the Supreme Court he's writing for a

418
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:41,140
majority of the court,

419
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,650
uh,

420
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,670
in this opinion,

421
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:43,241
uh,

422
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:43,810
which,

423
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,500
uh,

424
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,330
shows some hesitancy certainly
to extend the death penalty and,

425
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:49,780
uh,

426
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,780
some concern that whenever the court
is dealing with the death penalty,

427
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:55,671
it is,

428
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:56,361
he says,

429
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:56,750
uh,

430
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,110
uh,

431
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,380
risks its own sudden
descent into brutality.

432
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,950
When we look at some of the other
death pony cases decided by the court,

433
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:06,260
we don't quite see that same concern.

434
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,483
Uh,

435
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,510
well the court does,

436
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,141
once again,

437
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:14,141
it looks at the states and it finds that
44 states have not made such a crime

438
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,890
punishable by death,

439
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:16,520
uh,

440
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,170
since 1964,

441
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,620
which is even back before affirming to
eight years before Ferman only Louisiana

442
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,960
has sends to anyone to
death for this offense.

443
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:27,560
Uh,

444
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,560
no one has been executed for a non
homicide crime since 1963 and only two

445
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:35,174
people,

446
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:35,540
uh,

447
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,920
both in the Louisiana,

448
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,600
we're under the death sentence,

449
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,010
uh,

450
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,940
at the time for the rape of a child.

451
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,450
So the court sees here that
with regard again to looking,

452
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:49,070
is there a consensus in the country
with regard to this punishment?

453
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:50,900
Death is extraordinary punishment.

454
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:52,460
This era vocable punishment,

455
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,301
uh,

456
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:55,460
for even a terrible crime.

457
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:59,530
And there's no question the crime in
this case and any case involving a child

458
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:01,490
and a sexual abuse of a child is a,

459
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:02,630
is a horrible crime.

460
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,230
Uh,

461
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,580
but does it,

462
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:05,510
uh,

463
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,580
is a cup ability,

464
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,630
the offender such that
death can be imposed.

465
00:16:08,631 --> 00:16:09,464
And the court,

466
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:09,920
uh,

467
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,240
here says,

468
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,780
uh,

469
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,530
we're not going to have the death
penalty where there's not a loss of life.

470
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:16,763
Uh,

471
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,160
points out that retribution,

472
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,271
uh,

473
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:24,330
the difference between a
particularly deprived murder,

474
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:24,890
uh,

475
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,770
where the person is killed and
where the person is not killed,

476
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,611
uh,

477
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:31,010
is the distinction that
has to be made here.

478
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:31,641
Uh,

479
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:32,750
that deterrence,

480
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,771
uh,

481
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:35,810
actually this may cut against,

482
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:35,861
uh,

483
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:36,640
turns,

484
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:36,920
uh,

485
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,680
because Justice Kennedy sees
the risk of non reporting.

486
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,490
Of course,

487
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,310
the court was informed
by a number of briefs,

488
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:44,210
some of them for,

489
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,530
from advocates for children who pointed
out that most of the sexual assaults

490
00:16:48,531 --> 00:16:53,180
that take place or not by strangers who
break into the child's bedroom in the

491
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:54,050
middle of the night.

492
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,620
Uh,

493
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,940
but by family members,

494
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:57,590
by teachers,

495
00:16:57,591 --> 00:16:58,400
coaches,

496
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,150
priests,

497
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,983
ministers,

498
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:00,530
uh,

499
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,363
people that the,

500
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:01,730
the,

501
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,870
that the family knows.

502
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:06,290
And that if you know that that
person who's been abusing you,

503
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,190
uh,

504
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,770
might be subject to the death Poli,

505
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,620
uh,

506
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,910
it might be a reason,

507
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:11,570
uh,

508
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:16,190
for some children to not report the
crimes is this is not going to serve the

509
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:17,000
purpose.

510
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,571
Uh,

511
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:22,571
and also this gives the
perpetrator a motive.

512
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,350
Uh,

513
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:24,651
if,

514
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:24,921
if,

515
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:26,960
if the perpetrator is going
to be subject to the death,

516
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:29,030
plenty to kill the victim.

517
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:29,720
Uh,

518
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,790
finally he adds this,

519
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,360
uh,

520
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,170
point,

521
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:33,460
uh,

522
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,590
special risk of wrongful execution,

523
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,461
uh,

524
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:42,461
that children will cause they're highly
susceptible to suggestive questioning,

525
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,390
uh,

526
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,283
are,

527
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,160
uh,

528
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:52,070
unlike are there to be at least sometimes
not that they're likely to give,

529
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:52,580
uh,

530
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,290
evidence that's not going to be accurate,

531
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:54,921
but that this is,

532
00:17:54,921 --> 00:17:58,730
there's a risk of this happening and this
is what the court is concerned about.

533
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,240
And all of these cases are we worried
about a risk of the death penalty being

534
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:04,010
imposed in a case where it shouldn't be.

535
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,780
And particularly here in a case where
44 other states have decided not to have

536
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:12,430
the death penalty for this crime and
only two people had been sentenced.

537
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:14,360
So the court puts all that together,

538
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:14,961
uh,

539
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,520
and comes to the conclusion,

540
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,120
uh,

541
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,360
that the death penalty is
not appropriate in this case.
