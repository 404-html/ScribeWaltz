1
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:11,971
In this session,

2
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,860
we take up the peremptory strike.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That is strikes exercise by
the prosecution and by the
defense lawyers to remove

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,920
prospective jurors after,

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,760
uh,

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,520
this is not the same as
the challenges for cause.

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,540
Those challenges are based upon the
inability of a juror to be fair and

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:31,374
impartial,

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,440
either because of what the
juror has read or heard,

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,360
or fields or attitudes about the death
penalty or any other factor that would

11
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:42,720
keep a person from objectively
being fair and impartial.

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,260
The parties have the right
to strike a certain number,

13
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:48,060
usually set by statute.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,080
Uh,

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,100
let's say 10,

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,210
uh,

17
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,860
10 jurors for any reason whatsoever.

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,761
Uh,

19
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:54,810
and for years,

20
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:59,610
the perimetry strike was used to exclude
African Americans from jury service,

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,540
uh,

22
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,490
in the communities where they were in,

23
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,030
uh,

24
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,170
the jury pools,

25
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:04,771
uh,

26
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:05,850
Robert Swain,

27
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:06,710
uh,

28
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,590
a black man was sentenced to
death and Talladega County,

29
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,453
Alabama,

30
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,910
a 26% of the population of Talladega
county was African American.

31
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,270
Uh,

32
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,950
but they were underrepresented
in the jury pools only 10 to 15%,

33
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:23,620
uh,

34
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,390
of the average jury pool
and no black person,

35
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:31,050
no African American had
ever served on a jury.

36
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:31,841
Uh,

37
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,270
in Talladega,

38
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,533
uh,

39
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,010
Robert Swayne's lawyers
presented to claims based on
the equal protection clause

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,050
of the 14th amendment
to the Supreme Court.

41
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,380
First of all at the prosecutor
discriminated in Swayne's
case that is in Robert

42
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,870
Swayne's case by striking all six black
people who were in the group of people

43
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,620
there for jury duty.

44
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,191
Uh,

45
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:59,790
and secondly that the
prosecutor regularly one,

46
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,230
not just in Swayne's case,

47
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:02,850
but in virtually every case,

48
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,740
the prosecutor struck African Americans,

49
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,210
uh,

50
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,210
from jury service and at this practice
violated the rights equal protection.

51
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,450
It's interesting to look
at when Swain was decided,

52
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,520
this is right during the midst of what's
been called the Warren Court's Criminal

53
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:21,960
Law Revolution.

54
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:22,830
Uh,

55
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,830
when the court was deciding cases like
Miranda versus Arizona and was trying to

56
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:32,190
do something about some of the abusive
practices that were going on and just to,

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:32,700
uh,

58
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,250
trying to provide some
procedural fairness,

59
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,000
uh,

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,770
in the criminal justice system.

61
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,431
Uh,

62
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:43,431
it also came down in the mid
1960 [inaudible] when much
of the country was still

63
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:46,200
segregated on the basis of race.

64
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:51,201
This is not that long a time period
after the court had decided brown versus

65
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:55,560
board of education requiring a
into segregation in the schools,

66
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:59,040
and there was massive resistance
to the Brown decision.

67
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,831
Uh,

68
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:03,730
and this is right in the midst
of the civil rights movement.

69
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,391
Uh,

70
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,224
and yet,

71
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,010
uh,

72
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,010
the court ignores the discrimination.

73
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,840
It was obvious that Robert Swain and then
everybody knew happened in every case.

74
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:18,841
That it was just a routine
practice for prosecutors to strike,

75
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:19,900
uh,

76
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,550
people on the basis of race.

77
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,653
Uh,

78
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,530
and,

79
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:23,920
and,

80
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,700
uh,

81
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,150
the court instead celebrates
the preemptory stripe.

82
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,141
Uh,

83
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:32,980
it says that it can be
exercised on any grounds,

84
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,670
uh,

85
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,410
including race,

86
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:36,244
religion,

87
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,300
nationality,

88
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,490
occupation or affiliation.

89
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,330
Uh,

90
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,190
and in case that wasn't clear enough,

91
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,740
a lawyer may strike any group,

92
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,570
whether they be Negroes,

93
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,231
Catholics,

94
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:47,861
accounts,

95
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,930
or those with blue eyes.

96
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,220
Uh,

97
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,930
you can imagine that more strikes were
probably being used against black people

98
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,030
than people with blue eyes.

99
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,140
Uh,

100
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,140
and the court goes on to say in the
quest for an impartial and qualify jury,

101
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,880
Negro and white,

102
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:10,670
Protestant and Catholic are
subject to the perimetry strike.

103
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,360
Think of that sentence again.

104
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:16,360
In the quest for an
impartial and qualified jury,

105
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,490
Negro and white,

106
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:23,491
Protestant and Catholic are subject to
being struck just because of their race

107
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,990
or because of their religion.

108
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,093
Uh,

109
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,540
from jury service.

110
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:28,661
Well,

111
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:28,901
of course,

112
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:29,980
if you're in a minority,

113
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,000
uh,

114
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,800
if you're the black people,

115
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,381
uh,

116
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:38,381
and you're only six blacks in the jury
veneer from which Robert's Wayne's trial,

117
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:38,891
uh,

118
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:42,610
was chosen and the prosecution
struck you because you are black,

119
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,570
that's pretty much going to mean that
they're not going to be any blacks serving

120
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:47,404
on juries,

121
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:47,890
uh,

122
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,180
in Talladega county.

123
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,420
The court here makes again,

124
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,680
a wrong call,

125
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,250
uh,

126
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,140
in dealing with racial discrimination.

127
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,610
I think looking back on it now,

128
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:01,540
we can say that this is a case like
Plessy versus Ferguson or like,

129
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:02,110
uh,

130
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:07,110
the dred Scott decision or what the court
will later too in McCleskey vs Klemp

131
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,400
Kemp,

132
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,990
uh,

133
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,910
where the court sanctions and puts its
stamp of approval here really more than

134
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:13,930
in any other place.

135
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:18,640
The court puts its stamp of approval on
race discrimination in jury selection.

136
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,210
Uh,

137
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,890
and it continues to this day.

138
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,520
We'll look at what's been
done to try to stem it.

139
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:25,990
To some extent,

140
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,430
but I don't think anybody doubts that
when peremptory strikes are used,

141
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,500
where neither side has to give a reason,

142
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,950
that one of the primary
considerations is race,

143
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,570
even though it's illegal.

144
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,093
Uh,

145
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,660
the court also,

146
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,230
uh,

147
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,310
took a look at Swains claim
with regard to the systemic,

148
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:45,970
uh,

149
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,590
challenge the prosecutor,

150
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,220
uh,

151
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,990
striking people all the time.

152
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:50,950
Uh,

153
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,950
but it's set an impossible standard
to me that when the prosecutor,

154
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:57,860
in case case,

155
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:59,300
no matter what the circumstances are,

156
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:00,280
whatever what crime is,

157
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:00,930
is,

158
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:01,370
is,

159
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:01,770
uh,

160
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,310
uh,

161
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,143
accused,

162
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:03,681
uh,

163
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:04,790
no matter who the defendant,

164
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,930
no matter who the victim,

165
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:06,800
uh,

166
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,800
if the prosecutor in every case like that
removes blacks and they don't serve on

167
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:14,480
juries at all,

168
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,620
uh,

169
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,360
it might be possible,

170
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,080
uh,

171
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,080
to conclude that the prosecution was
striking on the basis of race and denying

172
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,080
black people.

173
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,320
Jury Service Accord is
pretty stingy though.

174
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,530
It goes on to say such proof might support
a reasonable inference that negroes

175
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:36,980
are being excluded for reasons
wholly unrelated to the case.

176
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,510
And that the peremptory strike is
being used to deny black people.

177
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:41,880
Uh,

178
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,790
they're writing an opportunity to present,

179
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,181
uh,

180
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:48,740
to participate in the administrative
of administration of justice like other

181
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,574
people.

182
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,420
Uh,

183
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,280
but Swayne's lawyer hadn't proven,

184
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,011
uh,

185
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:57,140
that it was the prosecution responsible
for the fact that there had never been

186
00:06:57,141 --> 00:07:00,830
an African American on a
jury and Talladega County,

187
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:01,664
Alabama.

188
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,220
So he fails a on that.

189
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,070
But when you think about
this test going forward,

190
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,300
it means that a prosecution
can discriminate in one case,

191
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,060
but unless you can prove
that over every case,

192
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:15,200
no matter who the defendant,

193
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,190
no matter who the victim,

194
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:17,870
no matter what the issue is in the case,

195
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,290
unless it's a practice across the boards,

196
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,890
the court holds that it doesn't
violate the equal protection clause.

197
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,110
Well,

198
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,390
uh,

199
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,100
the Swain case,

200
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,240
uh,

201
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,560
well let me mention the dissent.

202
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,813
Uh,

203
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,830
just as Goldberg joined by Chief Justice
Warren and Douglas a descend from this,

204
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:40,790
the court points out that
this adds additional barriers.

205
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,630
Uh,

206
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,800
we know that discrimination is going on
in the selection of jurors and instead

207
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:50,801
of doing something to try to stem
the tide to try to change it,

208
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,960
the court sets of burden that's almost
impossible to meet in this case.

209
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:57,230
As the court said,

210
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,340
uh,

211
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,840
or just as Goldberg said,

212
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:00,741
uh,

213
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:03,860
the court keeps the word
of promise to our ears.

214
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,670
Uh,

215
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,200
but it breaks it to our hope.

216
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,393
Uh,

217
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,430
he points out that neither side
has the right to printers strike.

218
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,800
This is not provided
for in the constitution,

219
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,910
may be provided for him,

220
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,780
some state laws.

221
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,471
Uh,

222
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:19,520
but this is not a constitutional
right that's at stake here.

223
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,271
Uh,

224
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:21,050
and,

225
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,450
uh,

226
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,150
it's just as Marshall points out,

227
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:23,660
uh,

228
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,060
later on in Mcrae versus New York,

229
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,193
uh,

230
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:32,370
the Swain case was subject to scathing
criticism and yet it took 20 years,

231
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:34,730
uh,

232
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:39,140
before the court did anything about the
fact that this case made it perfectly

233
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:44,141
okay for a prosecutor and striking a
jury to strike people because they were

234
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:49,391
black or because they were Catholic or
because of any other characteristic that

235
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:51,050
they might have.

236
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:51,681
A,

237
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:53,600
whether or not that
changes made a difference,

238
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,261
uh,

239
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:55,320
is subject to,

240
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:55,920
uh,

241
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,753
debate.

242
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,180
Uh,

243
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,350
but in 1986,

244
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:02,190
the court modified Swain
or the standard and Swain,

245
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:02,730
uh,

246
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,730
still relied upon the equal protection
clause of the 14th amendment that is

247
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:10,410
intentional racial discrimination.

248
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,910
But said no longer is it necessary
to prove in case after case,

249
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,320
no matter who the victim,

250
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,940
no matter who the defendant,

251
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,740
that the prosecutor is striking,

252
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,310
uh,

253
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,710
all the blacks in every case,

254
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:23,190
uh,

255
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,190
you can infer a court can
infer discrimination from
a disproportionate use of

256
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,820
strikes in a single case.

257
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,781
In other words,

258
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:31,860
the prosecutors strikes,

259
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,850
he was 10 peremptory strikes and nine of
the strikes are against the nine black

260
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:36,780
people in the veneer.

261
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,760
So there's an all white jury,

262
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,601
the court,

263
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,800
and that happened all the time.

264
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,550
Uh,

265
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,690
the court says you can infer from that
race discrimination and it doesn't mean

266
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:46,201
there was,

267
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:47,520
but you can infer from that.

268
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,211
Uh,

269
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:49,410
and if that happened,

270
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,491
the judge,

271
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:54,120
the prosecutor then has to
give race neutral reasons,

272
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,750
uh,

273
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,810
has to say why I didn't strike
that man because he was black.

274
00:09:57,811 --> 00:09:59,850
I struck him for some other reason.

275
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:01,980
I didn't strike that woman
because she was black.

276
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:04,410
I struck her for some other reason.

277
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,630
And then finally,

278
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,250
after the court looks at the strikes and
any other evidence that's presented on

279
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:14,730
discrimination looks at the
reasons given by the prosecutor,

280
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,490
the burden of proof is on the defendant,

281
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,330
that challenger,

282
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,081
uh,

283
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:21,960
to show intentional race discrimination.

284
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:27,290
And the judge decides that now what
this requires a trial judge to find is

285
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:34,041
intentional racial discrimination by a
prosecutor and that the prosecutor lied

286
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:40,320
about it by giving a pre
textual reason for the strike,

287
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,850
uh,

288
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,790
when really the reason was race a very,

289
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,920
very difficult psychologically,

290
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:47,941
uh,

291
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:52,770
and just practically for judges to make
that finding a many jurisdictions in

292
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:53,341
this country,

293
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:55,560
prosecutors and judges
work together all the time.

294
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:56,251
Uh,

295
00:10:56,251 --> 00:11:00,240
the judges know Morgan
accuse that prosecutor of
discriminating and lying about

296
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:00,870
it,

297
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,680
uh,

298
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,513
because,

299
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,791
uh,

300
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,370
it politically it may be
impossible for one reason.

301
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,060
Uh,

302
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,721
but secondly,

303
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:08,880
they may have a relationship in which the,

304
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:10,110
the judges wouldn't do that.

305
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,330
Or the judge may have racial attitudes,

306
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:12,961
uh,

307
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:13,680
that,

308
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,160
uh,

309
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,540
don't find objectionable.

310
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,340
A striking all the blacks,

311
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:19,500
very often people go to the bench,

312
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:19,980
uh,

313
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,690
from having been in prosecutor's offices.

314
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,823
So,

315
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,170
uh,

316
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,910
may be the judge was at one time the
district attorney himself and he may have

317
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:30,000
struck all the African
Americans when picking juries.

318
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:35,040
Now he's the judge and his chief assistant
as the prosecutor and he's striking

319
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,300
African Americans.

320
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,403
Um,

321
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:42,890
but that's who the courts
look to to protect the rights
of black people to serve

322
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:45,354
on juries.

323
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,980
That trial judges,

324
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,940
uh,

325
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,760
there's been a tremendous
amount of resistance to Bateson,

326
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:51,630
uh,

327
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,440
by,

328
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:52,870
uh,

329
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,460
both courts and lawyers,

330
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,030
uh,

331
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,361
ever,

332
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:56,920
ever since it has been decided.

333
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,660
A Justice Marshall who of course
had seen race discrimination,

334
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:02,920
personal and up close,

335
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:03,820
uh,

336
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,840
correctly predicted in his concurring
opinion in bats and that it was not going

337
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:09,820
to prevent race discrimination,

338
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,600
uh,

339
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,830
pointed out first of all,

340
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,560
that because you have to show
a disproportionate number
of blacks were struck in

341
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:19,690
order to make out a prima facia case.

342
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,610
If the prosecution,

343
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:22,870
uh,

344
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,420
struck one or two blacks
because they were black,

345
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:26,783
uh,

346
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,280
it can get away with that because that
doesn't establish a prima facia case.

347
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,210
It's only when it's something,

348
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:31,721
like I said,

349
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:32,560
nine out of 10.

350
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,190
So there are only a few
African Americans in the jury.

351
00:12:36,191 --> 00:12:37,330
The prosecutors strikes him.

352
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:38,950
Maybe the reason is because they're black,

353
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:41,290
but we'll never know
because in those cases,

354
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,260
the prosecutor probably won't
be asked to give reasons.

355
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,101
Secondly,

356
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:46,600
he points out that any prosecutor,

357
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,171
uh,

358
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:47,800
can,

359
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,071
uh,

360
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:53,071
assert a facially neutral reasons and the
tragedies aren't going to know whether

361
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,160
those reasons are true or not.

362
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,090
And so they're not going to be able to
second guess the prosecutor with regard

363
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:01,924
to the reasons.

364
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,711
Thirdly,

365
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:06,790
he points out what the Supreme
Court had recognized in Turner,

366
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,750
uh,

367
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,750
that a prosecutor's conscious or
unconscious racism might very well be the

368
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:15,430
reason that he's striking head juror,

369
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:20,320
that he might see a black person and
think that that juror is salon or distant.

370
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,220
Uh,

371
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,540
but he might see a white juror
who acts exactly the same way,

372
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,040
but he doesn't have that same,

373
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,210
uh,

374
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,100
feeling,

375
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,380
uh,

376
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,220
about the jurors.

377
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:31,630
These demeanor reasons,

378
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,990
saying that jurors didn't pay attention
or that they appeared uncomfortable or

379
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,520
all sorts of things
that they were selling.

380
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,220
A,

381
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,510
those are reasons that
prosecutors give all the time,

382
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,050
uh,

383
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,270
for striking African Americans.

384
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:46,751
Uh,

385
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:50,560
and it's virtually impossible for judges
to know whether they're true or not.

386
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,720
In the litigation over,

387
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,780
uh,

388
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,760
the use of a peremptory
strikes and North Carolina,

389
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,350
it was actually discovered that the
prosecutors had a list of race neutral

390
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:03,184
reasons,

391
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,740
so that if they had struck a juror
and they had to give a reason,

392
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:07,000
they could just look down and say,

393
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:07,540
well,

394
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,740
that juror was solid.

395
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,060
Uh,

396
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,150
so it didn't necessarily have to
relate to the particular juror.

397
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,640
It was just a race neutral reason,

398
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,031
uh,

399
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:16,930
that was available,

400
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,900
I should say bats and
now applies to everyone.

401
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,260
It applies in civil cases to
plaintiffs and defendants,

402
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:24,010
lawyers.

403
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,281
Uh,

404
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,890
it applies to defense
lawyers and criminal cases.

405
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:27,610
Uh,

406
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,150
but still where it comes up
most often is in prosecutors,

407
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,050
uh,

408
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,980
striking African Americans,

409
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,540
uh,

410
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,740
from jury service.

411
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,690
And we'll look a little
more at that in a moment.

412
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,890
Uh,

413
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:43,890
but here the court starts basically
cutting back on this and Hernandez versus

414
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:46,451
New York,

415
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:50,230
the prosecutor struck for Latinos
because they could speak Spanish.

416
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:55,710
And prosecutor's reason was that they
would not trust the interpreter if they're

417
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:57,141
Spanish speaking.

418
00:14:57,141 --> 00:14:59,030
People on the witness stand,

419
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,020
uh,

420
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,010
these Latinos would understand what they
were saying and he didn't want anybody

421
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:06,860
to understand where they were saying
he wanted people to only go by what the

422
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:07,790
interpreter said.

423
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,550
A supreme court says,

424
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:11,420
first of all,

425
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,950
the fact that it has a discriminatory
impact because this reason of course

426
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:18,680
applied only to Latinos
that spoke Spanish.

427
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,980
So it meant that they were
excluded from the jury.

428
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,790
Uh,

429
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,630
secondly,

430
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,510
the fact that a reason
correlates with race,

431
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,260
uh,

432
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,093
does not,

433
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,280
uh,

434
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,160
mean that it's an impermissible.

435
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:33,410
It can still be a race neutral reason,

436
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,440
even though it may result in all the,

437
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,200
in this case Latinos or in another case,

438
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:41,480
all the blacks being excluded.

439
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,830
A third,

440
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,800
the court talks about
deference to the trial judge,

441
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,790
uh,

442
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,640
reversed only if clearly erroneous.

443
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,840
So it's going to be very
difficult for a defendant,

444
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:54,740
uh,

445
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,740
who makes us challenge
to a prosecutor's strike.

446
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,160
And the trial judge rejects that
and lets the black juror sins,

447
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:04,520
the watch your home,

448
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,300
it's going to be very difficult to get
that reversed because of this clearly

449
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,350
erroneous standard.

450
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,220
Uh,

451
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,240
justice Stevens,

452
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:11,750
uh,

453
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,190
joined by Justice Marshall,

454
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:13,760
uh,

455
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,600
would have found,

456
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:14,991
uh,

457
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:16,010
discrimination,

458
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,640
uh,

459
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,480
in the case,

460
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,633
uh,

461
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,570
not long after that,

462
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:20,900
uh,

463
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,500
the court decides per cat versus him.

464
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,190
In 1995,

465
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,270
uh,

466
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,103
here,

467
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,640
some people wondered if Batson really
meant anything at all because the court

468
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:32,390
said,

469
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:32,930
uh,

470
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,760
prosecutor in this case struck to blacks.

471
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,900
Uh,

472
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,730
he said those two African Americans
were the only people in the whole jury

473
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,440
veneer that had facial hair,

474
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:47,480
mustache and goatee and one and
one of them had long curly hair.

475
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,640
And he didn't strike them
because they were black.

476
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,070
He struck them because they had beards.

477
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,550
And because the one had long curly hair,

478
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,540
uh,

479
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,040
the case got reversed below.

480
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,630
The Supreme Court says,

481
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,870
that's acceptable reasons.

482
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,430
Uh,

483
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,080
the reason need not be
persuasive or even plausible.

484
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,460
It can even be silly.

485
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,450
You're superstitious,

486
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,500
uh,

487
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,360
as long as it's not based on race.

488
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,680
Now that doesn't mean that the court
can't still find discrimination.

489
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:16,551
Uh,

490
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:20,720
at step three of the bats and process
step one being the defendant raises the

491
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:21,950
objection and says,

492
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:22,341
your honor,

493
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,174
I object.

494
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,020
The prosecutor just struck that juror
and I believe it's on the basis of race.

495
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:27,830
And I would ask the PR,

496
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,200
the judge not to allow that as step one.

497
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:30,951
Step two,

498
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:31,731
the prosecutor says,

499
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:32,031
your honor,

500
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:33,530
I didn't strike that juror based on race.

501
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,730
I struck that juror because he had long
curly hair and he had a mustache and

502
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:38,564
goatee.

503
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,070
Then at the third step,

504
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,540
the court considers all of that
evidence and decides whether there was

505
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,940
intentional racial discrimination.

506
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:47,870
Uh,

507
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,250
this case certainly,

508
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,120
uh,

509
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,930
said that the reasons don't
have to be very persuasive.

510
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,840
Uh,

511
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,211
silly.

512
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:57,180
You're superstitious.

513
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,260
But it did say maybe they wouldn't
be persuasive at that third step,

514
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,120
but that's up to the trial judge.

515
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:08,490
A court finds that there is no bats in
violation here with the strikes of these

516
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,570
African Americans.

517
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:09,931
Uh,

518
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:13,050
just as a and briar a dissent,

519
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,530
uh,

520
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,430
they would find,

521
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,523
uh,

522
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,230
uh,

523
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,570
discrimination in this particular case.

524
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,883
So,

525
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:20,220
uh,

526
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,080
what's the impact of Batson?

527
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,951
Uh,

528
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:26,760
we know that in Philadelphia and not
long after Batson came out or prosecutor

529
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:30,900
was conducting a training session and
he basically spent most of it telling

530
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,740
people how to consider race
in making jury strikes,

531
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,431
uh,

532
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:39,330
after the supreme court had just said
that it violates the equal protection

533
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:40,470
clause to do so.

534
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,340
Uh,

535
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,140
the Illinois Court of Appeals says,

536
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:45,900
when it gets to the
Batson issue in a case,

537
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,710
we now come to the charade called Bateson.

538
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,470
Uh,

539
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,470
surely every prosecutor's office has
a manual or a list of Handy Dandy race

540
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,180
neutral reasons,

541
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:57,790
uh,

542
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,740
that it can,

543
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,220
uh,

544
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,641
give.

545
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:02,310
And of course we know that's
true because in North Carolina,

546
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,060
uh,

547
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,980
it actually came out in evidence that
there was such a handy dandy list of race

548
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,750
neutral reasons that were being used,

549
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:10,800
um,

550
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,370
and made up before the
prosecutor ever saw the jurors,

551
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:14,880
uh,

552
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,890
and knew what to object about.

553
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,180
Uh,

554
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,020
and then we see these cases
out of Louisiana where the
Louisiana Supreme Court

555
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:27,021
says that bear statistics alone is not
enough to establish a prima facia case,

556
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:30,090
which seems completely
contradictory to Batson,

557
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,253
which said,

558
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:36,210
disproportionate number of strikes in
the defendant's case could be a basis for

559
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:37,500
inferring race discrimination.

560
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,550
Uh,

561
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,160
but the Louisiana court
now in a number of cases,

562
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:44,850
even one where the
prosecution used 11 strikes,

563
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,890
10 of them against blacks,

564
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,330
nine of them against women.

565
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,210
The court says there's
no prime aphasia case.

566
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,810
There's no need for the
prosecutor to even give reasons.

567
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:55,560
A,

568
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,660
because no prime aphasia case,

569
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,150
uh,

570
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,370
has been established.

571
00:19:59,640 --> 00:19:59,850
Uh,

572
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,790
Louisiana has been a one
of many jurisdictions,

573
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:07,791
which is almost never have the appellate
courts found a of bats in violation.

574
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:11,400
One case where the prosecutor
said he struck someone,

575
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:11,881
uh,

576
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:13,620
because he was a young black male,

577
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,010
uh,

578
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,390
that case did get reversed,

579
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:16,650
but that was pretty obvious.

580
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,550
Uh,

581
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:22,260
that person had not gotten the a handy
dandy list of race neutral reasons and

582
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:25,770
didn't know that you couldn't give
ray a racist and explicit reason.

583
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,060
But for the most part,

584
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:27,540
uh,

585
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,130
state supreme courts to deferring to
trial judges and trial judges are very

586
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,780
reluctant to reverse or to
say that prosecutors are
intentionally discriminating

587
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,050
and are not telling the truth about it.

588
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:42,870
The practice continues
and case after case,

589
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:43,381
uh,

590
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:47,220
but some cases had been reversed and
some of them are quite extraordinary.

591
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,040
The middle or case out of Texas Thomas
Middle [inaudible] who was sentenced to

592
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:56,041
death in Dallas and who
had a Swain hearing that is
under Swain versus Alabama.

593
00:20:56,651 --> 00:21:01,240
He wanted to show that the prosecutors
in Dallas in case after case,

594
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:02,710
no matter who the defendant,

595
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:03,610
no matter who the victim,

596
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,560
that they had a pattern and practice
of striking people of color.

597
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,140
Well then the Batson decision came down.

598
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,320
So the court took that evidence as well
as the evidence of the strikes and the

599
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:21,160
particular case trial judge
in Houston and Dallas,

600
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:21,611
excuse me,

601
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:22,840
the trial judge in Dallas,

602
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,771
no problem.

603
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:24,780
No race discrimination,

604
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,780
court of criminal appeals,

605
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,400
no race discrimination,

606
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,790
federal court and the United States
Court of Appeals for the fifth circuit.

607
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,590
No race discrimination.

608
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,140
But the supreme court sees it differently.

609
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,470
And look at the facts
that had decided on a,

610
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:42,850
the DA's office had a formal
policy of striking blacks.

611
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,470
It had a manual that said to
strike blacks when picking jurors.

612
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,130
Uh,

613
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,600
it trained had testimony from people who
had been in the prosecutor's office at

614
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:52,991
the time.

615
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:57,460
Miller else case was tried that said
we were trained to strike blacks.

616
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:57,881
Uh,

617
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:59,290
when we pick the jury.

618
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,340
Uh,

619
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,780
also it was obvious in the
transcript of the jury selection,

620
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:09,430
which went on for some time here that
the prosecutor questioned black jurors

621
00:22:09,431 --> 00:22:11,320
differently than white jurors.

622
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:16,590
The prosecution even use
some trick questions to try
to disqualify black jurors

623
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,360
but didn't ask those same questions,

624
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:19,931
uh,

625
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:21,430
of white jurors.

626
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,570
Texas has some very unusual
practice called the jury shuffle,

627
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:27,280
where the jurors are all,

628
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,090
uh,

629
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:28,901
shuffle that is,

630
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:30,570
they're put in a different order to,

631
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,453
to sit.

632
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:31,991
Uh,

633
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:34,210
and anytime that blacks
would be near the front,

634
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:38,140
the prosecution would call for a jury
shuffle and hopes that the blacks would be

635
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:39,700
moved further back.

636
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,140
But then what was probably most critical
was what justice Souter called a side

637
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:49,141
by side comparisons that the prosecution
had excepted whites who had the same

638
00:22:51,491 --> 00:22:55,240
characteristics of blacks that
the prosecutor had struck.

639
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,261
In other words,

640
00:22:56,261 --> 00:23:00,760
there's no real difference between
these jurors except for their race.

641
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,571
Uh,

642
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:02,800
and for that reason,

643
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,281
uh,

644
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:08,281
justice Souter a writing for the court
finds that even under the deference that

645
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,290
the Texas Court of criminal appeals,

646
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,870
which had decided this
case on direct appeal,

647
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,970
even with the deference that was required
under the antiterrorism and effective

648
00:23:18,971 --> 00:23:19,870
death penalty act,

649
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:24,970
that is that in applying Batson
it had to be contrary to,

650
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:28,540
or an unreasonable application
of the Batson decision.

651
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,240
That there was a constitutional violation
here and there was discrimination and

652
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:38,710
the selection of Thomas Miller L's trial
and he's entitled to a new trial with a

653
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:39,430
fairly,

654
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,263
uh,

655
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,290
select a jury.

656
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:41,950
Uh,

657
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,360
three justices dissented,

658
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,591
justice Thomas,

659
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:47,540
chief justice Rehnquist
and Justice Scalia.

660
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:52,010
But a lot of people have said that's
an extraordinary case because of the

661
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:52,844
manual,

662
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:53,631
the training,

663
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:54,464
the policy,

664
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,060
all those things in Dallas.

665
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:56,990
Uh,

666
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,600
what about the more typical case,

667
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,020
uh,

668
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,960
where you don't have that
kind of overwhelming evidence?

669
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:03,501
Well,

670
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:08,000
Snyder versus Louisiana was a
case that came on direct appeal,

671
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:08,620
uh,

672
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,950
not a habeas corpus case,

673
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:12,590
but Snyder was convicted
in Jefferson parish,

674
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:16,850
Louisiana where the prosecutor's
office had a long history of striking,

675
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:17,510
uh,

676
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,890
black people from juries.

677
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,611
In fact,

678
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:24,080
a group of ministers in Jefferson parish
filed a friend of the court brief with

679
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:25,610
the supreme court that basically said,

680
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:30,470
we're just not a part of the jury system
here because we're always excluded.

681
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,250
Uh,

682
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,220
because of the prosecution's
use of strikes.

683
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,350
A Alan Snyder's case was no different.

684
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,040
Uh,

685
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,030
there were five African Americans
that were in the jury pool.

686
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,170
Jefferson parish at that time
had about 15% African Americans.

687
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:45,891
Uh,

688
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:48,980
it had been represented in
the legislature by David Duke,

689
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,670
the,

690
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,170
uh,

691
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,270
the grand wizard of the Klu Klux Klan.

692
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,760
I did voted for Duke when he ran for
governor in the United States senator.

693
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,043
Uh,

694
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:00,920
and so it wasn't a really good place
for an African American to be on trial.

695
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:01,940
Uh,

696
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,890
and particularly with an all white jury.

697
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,730
The case centered around a
student named Jeffrey Brooks,

698
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,170
who had said that he needed to get back
to school for his student teaching.

699
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,011
Uh,

700
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,320
but then when the dean was called,

701
00:25:14,321 --> 00:25:16,610
it was told that it was okay
that he could serve on this case.

702
00:25:16,611 --> 00:25:18,260
This case only took about three days,

703
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:20,630
day and a half for jury selection
day and a half for trial.

704
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,970
And Alan Snyder was on death row.

705
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,781
Uh,

706
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:24,410
what,

707
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:24,741
uh,

708
00:25:24,741 --> 00:25:28,880
the court found was that
while Brooks was struck,

709
00:25:28,881 --> 00:25:30,140
while Jeffrey Brooks was struck,

710
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,890
the prosecutor had accepted white people,

711
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,551
uh,

712
00:25:34,551 --> 00:25:37,280
as jurors including one in Ronald laws,

713
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,060
uh,

714
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,510
who had a far more urgent reason to
get back to what they were doing.

715
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:44,480
Laws had to close on two
houses that he was selling,

716
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:46,700
one the next weekend and
one the weekend after that,

717
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,300
his wife was having surgery and he was
having to take his children everywhere.

718
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,390
If there was anybody who
wouldn't want to be on a jury,

719
00:25:53,391 --> 00:25:54,350
it would be laws.

720
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:54,831
Uh,

721
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:59,831
and yet he was accepted and served on
the jury and Jeffrey Brooks was struck.

722
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,530
Uh,

723
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,250
so,

724
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:01,550
uh,

725
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,200
prosecution use five for five,

726
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:05,630
only one is examined by the Supreme Court.

727
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:06,200
Uh,

728
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,891
Jeffrey Brooks,

729
00:26:06,891 --> 00:26:11,530
the court says there was intentional
race discrimination in striking Brooks,

730
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,230
uh,

731
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,200
and therefore Snyder,

732
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,640
uh,

733
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,590
it gets a new trial.

734
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:16,850
Uh,

735
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,600
well,

736
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,433
uh,

737
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,300
the discrimination continues,

738
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,111
uh,

739
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:25,820
in the selection of juries
and particularly in the
use of peremptory strikes.

740
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,300
A trial judges very reluctant to find,

741
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,320
uh,

742
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,170
intentional race discrimination
for political reasons,

743
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:36,260
for relationship reasons
and for other reasons.

744
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:36,950
Uh,

745
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,590
secondly,

746
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,840
procedural rules,

747
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,531
uh,

748
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,470
you see often courts
rejecting that some claims,

749
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,690
even though the,

750
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,530
uh,

751
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,310
defendant's lawyer can point to side by
side comparisons like we're made in the

752
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:51,144
Miller l case,

753
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,440
here's a black person who was struck
and a white person with the same

754
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:57,210
characteristics who was not struck.

755
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,553
Uh,

756
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,970
and uh,

757
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,950
therefore it shows racist combination.

758
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:02,461
A lot of times.

759
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:03,271
Now the courts are saying,

760
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:03,660
well,

761
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,530
you didn't say that at the
trial at the time you objected.

762
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,760
Of course at that time,

763
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:12,810
it's sometimes hard to know
the characteristics of all
the jurors if there's a

764
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:16,440
large number of people being
considered a for jury service,

765
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:21,441
but very strict procedural
rules to try to defeat,

766
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,290
uh,

767
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:22,860
these,

768
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,280
uh,

769
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,113
claims,

770
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,391
uh,

771
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:26,310
reluctance of state supreme courts.

772
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,820
Again,

773
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,451
most states,

774
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:28,350
supreme court's not all,

775
00:27:28,351 --> 00:27:29,880
but most are elected.

776
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:33,660
Certainly the ones in the south
and the death belt are elected.

777
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:34,441
Uh,

778
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:36,600
and there is reluctance there,

779
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,260
uh,

780
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,360
to grant relief in any capital case.

781
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:41,760
But certainly based on jury selection,

782
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:46,140
I think many people may think it jury
would have convicted no matter what.

783
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,300
But we all know that who participates
in a jury is critically important for a

784
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:52,051
lot of reasons,

785
00:27:52,051 --> 00:27:54,690
both in terms of the quality
of the decisions that are made,

786
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:57,000
but others that I'll mention in a moment.

787
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,520
The other factor of the clearly erroneous,

788
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,210
uh,

789
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,043
standard,

790
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,620
which means that state supreme
courts can often just simply,

791
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,640
uh,

792
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,473
ignore,

793
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,613
uh,

794
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,040
or,

795
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,710
or can affirm what the
trial court has done,

796
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:11,640
uh,

797
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,420
saying,

798
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:12,811
well,

799
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:14,070
we may not agree with it,

800
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:19,071
but we don't think it raises to the
rises to the level where it was clearly

801
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,760
erroneous.

802
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,780
The other thing that we've seen a lot
of courts do is accept multiple reasons

803
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,520
where in one case,

804
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,450
the prosecutors,

805
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,780
first reason was he struck a juror
because she was a black woman.

806
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:35,100
But then he went on to give some
other reasons and the court said,

807
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:35,940
well,

808
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,670
the first reason was a race based reason,

809
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:42,510
but the other reasons we're not
and therefore it was upheld.

810
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:43,763
So,

811
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,783
uh,

812
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,530
as a result,

813
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,860
the incentive to prosecutors is give as
many reasons as you possibly can give

814
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:56,610
four or five six it surely one of them
is going to pass muster as a race neutral

815
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:56,971
reason.

816
00:28:56,971 --> 00:28:57,571
On the other hand,

817
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:57,840
some,

818
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,260
uh,

819
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,700
some courts have said the fact that the
prosecutor gives the laundry list of

820
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:07,701
reasons may be a indicia of
race discrimination right there.

821
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,880
So that's still to be sorted
out by the Supreme Court.

822
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,910
One of the other questions to
be sorted out as this Louisiana,

823
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,660
uh,

824
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,950
Supreme Court decisions that you haven't
made out a prime aphasia case just by

825
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:24,630
showing a disparate number of strikes
against African Americans or women.

826
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,530
Uh,

827
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,330
but for the most part,

828
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:28,463
uh,

829
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,030
discrimination,

830
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:30,570
uh,

831
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,470
continues.

832
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,660
That's an objections are made.

833
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,760
They're very seldom sustained.

834
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,630
That is usually the prosecution is
going to get away with striking,

835
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:40,180
uh,

836
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,950
the people of color from the jury.

837
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,000
Uh,

838
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,440
justice briar has suggested that it may
be time to abolish peremptory strikes

839
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:47,651
this,

840
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:49,120
as mentioned from time to time,

841
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:53,050
just as Goldberg pointed out way
back in Swain versus Alabama,

842
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,910
there's no right to a peremptory strike.

843
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:58,030
And if you've got to choose between
racist combination of peremptory strike,

844
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:03,520
you should choose to eliminate race
discrimination just as Marshall and his

845
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:05,800
concurring opinion in Bateson said,

846
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,240
if we really want to prevent this,

847
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,560
Batson is not going to work.

848
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,030
What we decided in this case,

849
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,440
if we really want to present,

850
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,720
prevent race discrimination,

851
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,240
we need to eliminate peremptory strikes.

852
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:16,810
Uh,

853
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,643
once more,

854
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,130
uh,

855
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,150
Justice Marshall,

856
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,600
uh,

857
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,320
I think,

858
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,620
uh,

859
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,011
got,

860
00:30:21,011 --> 00:30:21,850
got it right.

861
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:22,660
Uh,

862
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,411
but beyond that,

863
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:27,670
Batson is a very poor way to
deal with what is a practice,

864
00:30:27,671 --> 00:30:29,920
a regular practice taking one juror at,

865
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:30,754
at time.

866
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:35,850
And looking at the reason for that juror
sort of takes it out of the context of

867
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:38,230
what's going on in case after case.

868
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,070
Uh,

869
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,060
with prosecutors,

870
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:44,290
a lot of times now the prosecution will
leave one African American on the jury,

871
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:45,310
or maybe even too,

872
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,670
particularly if in a state where you
don't have to have unanimous verdict,

873
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,953
uh,

874
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,200
but we'll still end up striking a
lot of people on the basis of color.

875
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:56,080
Uh,

876
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,760
I tell lawyers it's like a lottery,

877
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,480
a buy your ticket,

878
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:04,500
make her objection point out the side
by side comparisons point out that the

879
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,750
black jurors were questioned
differently than the white jurors.

880
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,291
Uh,

881
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:12,250
all of those things challenged the
reasons given because a lot of the reasons

882
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:16,360
and one of the reasons given for striking
Jeffrey Brooks and the Snyder case was

883
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,830
he was nervous.

884
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:18,821
Well,

885
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:19,451
the lawyers said,

886
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:19,810
well,

887
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,010
everybody's nervous.

888
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:21,251
I mean,

889
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:23,800
you brought all these people down here
to decide whether to kill another human

890
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:24,520
being.

891
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:24,790
Uh,

892
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,660
everybody's nervous.

893
00:31:25,661 --> 00:31:26,494
I'm nervous,

894
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,333
we're all nervous.

895
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,650
And it was a way of sort
of basically saying this,

896
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:30,131
this reason,

897
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:31,630
then the plot applies to everybody.

898
00:31:31,631 --> 00:31:33,670
So there's no reason to strike,

899
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,270
uh,

900
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,890
Jeffrey Brooks,

901
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:36,820
uh,

902
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:41,820
but ultimately the continuing
exclusion of people of color,

903
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:42,970
uh,

904
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:43,840
from juries,

905
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:49,000
even in communities that have very
substantial African American population,

906
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:49,720
uh,

907
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,670
is undermining the credibility
and the legitimacy of the courts.

908
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:59,200
One of the things that was stated in
Snyder brief was that African Americans in

909
00:31:59,201 --> 00:32:00,011
Jefferson parish,

910
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:00,581
Louisiana,

911
00:32:00,581 --> 00:32:05,581
and know that they are not going to
serve on juries and it undermines their

912
00:32:07,271 --> 00:32:11,950
respect for the courts and nothing
the white people know it too.

913
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,840
And the fact is that when the
community is not all involved,

914
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:20,170
when you don't have everybody
in the community represented,

915
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,900
and when one group is
targeted for exclusion,

916
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:26,200
as tragically continues to be the place,

917
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,120
the case in many places today,

918
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,140
uh,

919
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:34,140
it undermines the quality of decision
making by the courts and the legitimacy

920
00:32:34,391 --> 00:32:35,620
and credibility of those courts.
