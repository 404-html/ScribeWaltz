1
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,190
Today we're going to look at
challenges to the Supreme Court,

2
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:18,980
uh,

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,890
in the Supreme Court to the death penalty.

4
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,510
In 1971,

5
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:23,650
a challenge was launched.

6
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:26,560
This was based on the due process
clause of the 14th amendment.

7
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:30,640
It was unsuccessful the
very next year in 1972,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,350
another challenge was made,

9
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:35,020
but this time under the eighth
amendment of the constitution,

10
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:38,470
the cruel and unusual punishment
clause and it was successful.

11
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,600
This was the case of
Furman versus Georgia.

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,120
The declared the death
penalty unconstitutional.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,980
But then just four years later,

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,550
after a number of states had
enacted new death penalty laws,

15
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:49,211
uh,

16
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:52,690
the supreme court upheld the death
pony at least for some states.

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,290
And we'll look at that struck
down the death only a four others.

18
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:56,921
Uh,

19
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:58,630
so we'll get a bit of history,

20
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,231
uh,

21
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:00,640
out of what we're going to look at,

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:00,860
uh,

23
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,100
in terms of the death penalty
and how it had been practiced.

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,480
And then we'll look at the procedures
that were adopted in 1976 and where the

25
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:08,110
court,

26
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:08,440
uh,

27
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,670
ha ha has gone.

28
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,210
Uh,

29
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,043
from there,

30
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,261
uh,

31
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:12,720
the first case I want to talk about it.

32
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,320
Mcgautha versus California.

33
00:01:14,321 --> 00:01:16,090
This was a case out of,

34
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:16,580
um,

35
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,141
two states,

36
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:17,381
really.

37
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:22,381
California mcgautha himself and a phoneme
Wilkerson were appealing of state out

38
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:22,870
of a,

39
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,351
excuse me,

40
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:25,780
appealing a Dustin's out of California.

41
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,621
Uh,

42
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:27,760
and uh,

43
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,230
James Edward Crampton was appealing
his de essence out of Ohio.

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:32,711
Now,

45
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:36,580
there were differences in the way these
cases were treated back at this time.

46
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:37,030
The,

47
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,540
the,

48
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,240
the California case
involved a bifurcated trial.

49
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:43,930
That meant there was one trial on
guilt or innocence and one trial,

50
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:44,440
uh,

51
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,870
with regard to punishment
with regard to sentencing,

52
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,481
uh,

53
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:49,750
the Crampton case which came out of Ohio,

54
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,140
had what was pretty much the
standard practice at that time.

55
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,440
One trial and the jury decided both guilt
and punishment and basically the way

56
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:01,150
it worked was the jury,

57
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:06,070
if it found the person guilty of murder
could come back with a recommendation of

58
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:06,904
mercy,

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,600
in which case the judge would impose
will a sense of life imprisonment.

60
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,480
Or if there was no
recommendation of mercy,

61
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:13,990
uh,

62
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,360
then the death sentence will be imposed.

63
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,550
So two different practices.

64
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:19,750
Crampton is much more

65
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,150
universal in terms of the wave
statutes worked at that time.

66
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,320
Um,

67
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,041
this is,

68
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:27,281
I say,

69
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,410
based on the due process clause,

70
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:29,980
uh,

71
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,813
of the,

72
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,843
uh,

73
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,870
14th amendment and basically
what they're saying,

74
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:35,351
as I said,

75
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:37,990
California two phase
trials we've talked about.

76
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,480
Now notice the difference
here and California,

77
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:43,750
the jury is instructed that
it may be influenced by pity,

78
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,710
sympathy,

79
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:45,281
uh,

80
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:46,210
or mere sentiment.

81
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:46,810
Uh,

82
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,810
in Ohio the jury is told it must not
be influenced by sympathy or prejudice.

83
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:55,900
So different practices
in the different states,

84
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:56,770
uh,

85
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,430
the is in both these and Ohio,

86
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:00,941
and excuse me,

87
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:01,331
California,

88
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:03,100
they're specifically instructed,

89
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,270
um,

90
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,300
that they're entirely
free to consider anything,

91
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:07,900
uh,

92
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,150
with regard to their judgment conscience.

93
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:14,140
There absolute discretion whether
to impose the death pony or not.

94
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,801
Uh,

95
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:15,790
in Ohio,

96
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,520
uh,

97
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,450
they're basically just told if
you find them guilty of murder,

98
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,020
uh,

99
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,970
then he's going to get
the death pony unless you,

100
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:22,630
uh,

101
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,590
impose,

102
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,630
uh,

103
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,463
uh,

104
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,523
uh,

105
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,390
unless you make a recommendation of mercy.

106
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,080
Uh,

107
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,690
so both of these people,

108
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,230
uh,

109
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,820
the California people and cramped in,

110
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,040
in Ohio are basically saying there's
no guidance given to the jury here,

111
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:39,671
uh,

112
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:40,540
about when,

113
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,673
uh,

114
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,870
the death penalty can be
imposed and when he can't,

115
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:48,130
there are no guidelines or the jury's
not told what it can consider a and what

116
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:48,880
it can't.

117
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,211
Uh,

118
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:54,211
so the question that's before the court
in mcgautha is what weight do we give to

119
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:57,250
the fact that this has been
the established practice?

120
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:57,850
Uh,

121
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,050
pretty much throughout the history.

122
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:03,340
At one time we had mandatory death
sentences for a number of crimes that was

123
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:07,780
softened somewhat by the legislatures
when they went to this additional

124
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,740
provision for mercy as the
jury having that option.

125
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,380
So that if the jury felt
like the person yes,

126
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:15,191
was guilty of murder,

127
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:15,581
but no,

128
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:16,540
they shouldn't be executed,

129
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,820
they could add mercy to their,

130
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,690
to their verdict,

131
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,973
uh,

132
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,310
uh,

133
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:21,581
the,

134
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:25,540
the court looks at this and basically
just to put it in everyday language.

135
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:25,911
Well,

136
00:04:25,911 --> 00:04:27,190
we've always done it this way.

137
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:27,790
Uh,

138
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,500
why would we do it differently?

139
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,570
Now a justice,

140
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,200
uh,

141
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,970
Douglas suggest that,

142
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:34,540
uh,

143
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,290
maybe,

144
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:35,501
uh,

145
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:37,720
the requirements of
due process can change.

146
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:38,261
Or as he says,

147
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,094
he evolve,

148
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,700
uh,

149
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,260
as time goes by.

150
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:41,800
Uh,

151
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,150
and then the question that,

152
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,180
that these people are putting before the
court is how important is consistency?

153
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:52,600
They're saying the jury and our case
could impose the death penalty for any

154
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:53,350
reason.

155
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,600
The jury and another case
can impose if for any reason,

156
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:57,550
so cramped and may get the deaf,

157
00:04:57,551 --> 00:05:02,260
Colleen mcgautha may get the death pony
when somebody else a guilty of a crime,

158
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,363
um,

159
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,750
equally or maybe far more heinous than
those crimes does not get the death

160
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:08,140
point.

161
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,330
It's that create a constitutional problem.

162
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,021
Uh,

163
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:15,790
and is it possible to tell a
judge and a jury ahead of time?

164
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,160
These are the factors
that you must consider.

165
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,180
And deciding whether or not
the death point should impose,

166
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:22,840
uh,

167
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,280
be imposed.

168
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:23,501
Well,

169
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:24,670
in 1971,

170
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,950
supreme court said it's not possible.

171
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:27,791
Uh,

172
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,970
and mcgautha the court says
to identify before the facts,

173
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:32,860
the characteristics of the criminal,

174
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:33,610
uh,

175
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,800
homicides and the perpetrator,

176
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,401
uh,

177
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:39,430
which can be taken into account to decide,

178
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,300
uh,

179
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,000
whether a desk should be imposed or not.

180
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,280
Our task beyond our ability,

181
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:45,730
uh,

182
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,190
this is not something we can do.

183
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,020
And the court goes on to say that it is
impossible to say that committing to the

184
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:54,730
complete discretion of the jury,

185
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:55,361
uh,

186
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:56,740
the power to enter the,

187
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,570
to impose the death sends a offense.

188
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:00,950
Anything in the constitution.

189
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,770
Basically the courts
saying Justice Harlan,

190
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,480
a writing for the majority,

191
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,140
uh,

192
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,973
saying,

193
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:07,700
um,

194
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,690
if a jury has given the
awesome responsibility of
whether or not to impose the

195
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:12,770
death penalty or not,

196
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,290
it will make that decision
in good conscience.

197
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,300
And this is what we rely upon,

198
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:17,840
uh,

199
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,840
in terms of making sure that this
punishment is imposed in a reasonable way.

200
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,170
Uh,

201
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,010
justice Douglas and Brennan a dissent,

202
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,590
uh,

203
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,423
saying,

204
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,030
uh,

205
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,940
surely the states can
create some guidelines.

206
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:36,170
There's gotta be some information given
to the jury about what information it

207
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:36,801
can consider,

208
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:38,480
what information it can consider,

209
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,250
but that draws only three votes.

210
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:40,730
Uh,

211
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,310
in 1971 a year later,

212
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,720
the court is going to come to
exactly the opposite conclusion.

213
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,770
Uh,

214
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,890
now the court is going to look at
this under the eighth amendment,

215
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,890
the cruel and unusual punishment clause.

216
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:59,240
The Eighth Amendment provides that
excessive bail shall not be required or

217
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:00,650
excessive fines imposed.

218
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:05,651
And then the part we're interested in nor
cruel and unusual punishment imposed a

219
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:11,030
number of cases that are in the
materials that accompany the clarity.

220
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,930
They're part of the class,

221
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,531
uh,

222
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:16,010
that most of the supreme court
cases up until this time,

223
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:16,731
uh,

224
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:19,100
had been about the method,

225
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:20,990
the way in which a person is executed.

226
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,330
Is it unusual to shoot someone,

227
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,210
uh,

228
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,450
in Utah for our crime?

229
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:28,670
Supreme Court said that's not unusual and,

230
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:28,910
uh,

231
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,421
you could,

232
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:29,900
uh,

233
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,580
could carry out an execution that way.

234
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Electrocution electrocution was first
introduced challenge to the practice of

235
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:38,630
electrocution and the Supreme Court said,

236
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,610
states can use electrician,

237
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,140
uh,

238
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:42,974
electrocution.

239
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,671
Uh,

240
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,504
and then,

241
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,260
uh,

242
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,330
Willie Francis his case on Louisiana,

243
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:51,200
they tried one time to execute Willie
Francis and it wasn't successful.

244
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,000
And so the question was,

245
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:54,800
can you try a second time,

246
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:55,610
uh,

247
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,840
to put a person to death?

248
00:07:56,841 --> 00:08:01,400
And that case made it made its way to
the supreme court before they try it a

249
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:02,234
second time.

250
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:02,871
Uh,

251
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:07,730
and Supreme Court said you
could and Willie Francis
was executed by the state of

252
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:08,564
Louisiana.

253
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:09,200
But,

254
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,000
but those,

255
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,720
those decisions not very
helpful for people challenging
the death pony under the

256
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:15,554
eighth amendment.

257
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:15,950
Uh,

258
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,290
but there are a couple of
cases that are important,

259
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:18,771
uh,

260
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:20,090
as sort of the backdrop,

261
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,541
uh,

262
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,160
for the Supreme Court's decision,

263
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,710
uh,

264
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,543
in Ferman.

265
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:23,931
Uh,

266
00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:26,930
the first is a case that came
out of the Philippines when,

267
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,501
uh,

268
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:31,160
it was a territory of the United States
in cases would be reviewed by the United

269
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,550
States Supreme Court called
Weems versus United States.

270
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,001
Uh,

271
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:40,001
Williams was severely punished for the
crime of falsifying a public document.

272
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:46,810
And the Supreme Court decided in the case
that the punishment was too severe for

273
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:47,804
the crime,

274
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,320
uh,

275
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,580
that he was imprisoned.

276
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:50,170
He was a,

277
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,240
in a hard labor perpetual,

278
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,343
uh,

279
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,230
uh,

280
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,063
surveillance,

281
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,510
uh,

282
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,343
number of,

283
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,233
uh,

284
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,703
harsh,

285
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,170
uh,

286
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,160
and severe penalties imposed
for just falsifying a document.

287
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,970
And here we get some tools that the
supreme court uses when it looks at the

288
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:10,320
death penalty that the cruel and unusual
punishment clause may acquire meaning

289
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,520
as public opinion becomes
enlightened by humane justice.

290
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,420
In other words,

291
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,630
the cruel and unusual punishment clause
of the eighth amendment is not limited

292
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:25,770
to just what it meant when it was adopted
at the time the bill of rights was

293
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:26,640
adopted at that time.

294
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,960
There were all sorts of punishments.

295
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:28,890
Uh,

296
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,230
there was a hanging shooting.

297
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,780
There was cutting off fingers branding,

298
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,081
uh,

299
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:36,300
a number of other kinds of punishments,

300
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:39,090
which the society doesn't
really use any more.

301
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:39,691
Uh,

302
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:41,640
and the Supreme Court and Williams says,

303
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,010
you look to what is,

304
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,200
what is society except today,

305
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,370
not what society,

306
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:49,500
except back in the 17 hundreds.

307
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,041
Uh,

308
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:54,360
it also introduces the notion that
a punishment may be excessive.

309
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,321
And the,

310
00:09:55,321 --> 00:10:00,321
in determining that we look to the purpose
of the punishment and can the purpose

311
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:02,190
of the punishment,

312
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:02,850
uh,

313
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,330
be fulfilled without resort
to such a severe punishment.

314
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,021
In other words,

315
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:11,880
is there a way to punish falsifying
a public document or any crime,

316
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,320
including murder?

317
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,190
Uh,

318
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,290
that is less than the most severe sends,

319
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:16,840
uh,

320
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,641
that's imposed.

321
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:18,660
And if that's the case,

322
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,050
then it may be an excessive
unconstitutional sentence
as the sentence imposed

323
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:26,730
upon Williams was,

324
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,331
uh,

325
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:27,840
in,

326
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,260
in,

327
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,010
uh,

328
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,810
under the cruel and
unusual punishment clause.

329
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,640
The other important cases,

330
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:33,720
troop versus Dallas,

331
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,610
a troop was denied.

332
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,210
He was naturalized,

333
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:37,760
uh,

334
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,470
as a result of a
desertion during war time.

335
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,810
And the question became,

336
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,240
is this punishment too much,

337
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,990
uh,

338
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,960
for uh,

339
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,180
leaving him stateless?

340
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,560
Is this too much of a,

341
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:50,400
too severe,

342
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:50,831
uh,

343
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:54,780
a punishment under the cruel and
unusual clause of the eighth amendment?

344
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,230
Uh,

345
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,700
the Supreme Court held that it was,

346
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,480
uh,

347
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,313
justice,

348
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:58,560
uh,

349
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Chief Justice Warren riding
for four members of the
court says the basic concept

350
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,070
underlying the eighth amendment
is nothing less than the dignity,

351
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,130
uh,

352
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,590
of humankind.

353
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,521
Uh,

354
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:14,160
and it provides some important language,

355
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:16,980
which we'll be looking at
all through the course,

356
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,500
uh,

357
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,410
that the eighth amendment draws its
meaning from the evolving standards of

358
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:24,570
decency that mark,

359
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:25,020
uh,

360
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,540
the progress of a maturing society.

361
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,141
Again,

362
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:29,490
much like what we've said,

363
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,980
but at the court looks at what are
the evolving standards of decency.

364
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,360
The,

365
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,260
the eighth amendment doesn't necessarily
mean what it said at the outset,

366
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,163
as I said,

367
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,520
and finally and controversially
a but not at that time.

368
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,560
International standards are relevant.

369
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,020
Uh,

370
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,300
when they looked at the punishment
that had been imposed upon troop,

371
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,540
they said civilized nations
all through the world,

372
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,570
virtually unanimous against this
severe a punishment for this crime.

373
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,260
Uh,

374
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:58,930
the,

375
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,090
the one thing about
troop that is important,

376
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,380
it only got four votes.

377
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,311
Uh,

378
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:04,960
so it was not a majority opinion.

379
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:08,410
Justice Brennan wrote a concurring
opinion in which he laid out his,

380
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,071
uh,

381
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:11,350
understanding of the
cruel and unusual clause,

382
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,861
uh,

383
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:15,790
and joined in the outcome or
troops sentence was struck down.

384
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:16,570
Uh,

385
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,530
but that took a little bit away
from the force of this decision.

386
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,131
Nevertheless,

387
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:22,360
we get some concepts.

388
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:25,930
Here are some principles under the eighth
amendment from these two cases that

389
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:29,590
are going to come into play when the
supreme court takes up Furman versus

390
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:30,424
Georgia.

391
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:30,941
But first,

392
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:31,631
let's just back up.

393
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:36,631
Can you really make an argument that
the death penalty is unconstitutional?

394
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,073
Uh,

395
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,820
uh,

396
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,980
the constitution provides,

397
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,720
takes into account,

398
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,380
uh,

399
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,860
the idea of the death pone of the fifth
amendment to the constitution says no

400
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:51,940
one shall twice be put in
jeopardy of life or limb.

401
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,360
I suppose some would say it's even
constitutional to remove a limb.

402
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:57,850
Uh,

403
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,530
but that practice is pretty much,

404
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,040
uh,

405
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,731
been abandoned.

406
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:01,220
But,

407
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,481
uh,

408
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:04,540
they talk about putting
one in jeopardy of life,

409
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,100
not deprived of life
without due process of law.

410
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,780
And then in the 14th amendment,

411
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,170
uh,

412
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,850
adopted after the civil war,

413
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,773
once again,

414
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,380
uh,

415
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,300
the constitution says,

416
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,433
uh,

417
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,440
a person is not to be deprived of life
as well as liberty or property without

418
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,220
due process of law.

419
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:29,430
So the constitution itself
clearly contemplates that
the states and the federal

420
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:30,370
government,

421
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:30,701
uh,

422
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:32,170
will use the death pony.

423
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,550
So if the argument is going to be made
that the death penalty a violates the

424
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:37,331
constitution,

425
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:41,350
it's going to have to be based upon
something about the way in which the deaf

426
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:44,290
pony is imposed or the way
in which it's carried out.

427
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,740
It's not going to be that
the death pony is per se,

428
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,600
a violation of the constitution.

429
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,030
And that's the question
that came before the court.

430
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,530
And Furman versus Georgia.

431
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,763
Uh,

432
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,683
uh,

433
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,400
Farman was convicted of murder,

434
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:58,840
uh,

435
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,471
in Georgia.

436
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,460
William Henry Farman,

437
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,050
Lucius Jackson,

438
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:02,620
uh,

439
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,080
was convicted of rape
in Georgia at the time.

440
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,790
Fermin came before the court.

441
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:08,890
That death punny was given
for a number of crimes,

442
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,390
not only for murder,

443
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,830
but also for rape,

444
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,730
armed robbery,

445
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,713
kidnapping,

446
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,030
a number of other crimes,

447
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,421
uh,

448
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:18,310
Elmer branch also convicted of rape.

449
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:19,150
But in Texas,

450
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:19,601
uh,

451
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:24,601
these three defendants all convicted and
trial courts in the states of Georgia

452
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:25,420
and Texas,

453
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,870
and they bring this case to the
Supreme Court and ask it to answer this

454
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:29,704
question.

455
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,693
Uh,

456
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,910
does the death pally violate the cruel
and unusual punishment clause of the 14th

457
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:37,954
amendment?

458
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,471
Uh,

459
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:41,890
and so the court decides that it does,

460
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,440
but in one of the most
remarkable opinions,

461
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:45,130
uh,

462
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:47,440
maybe unprecedented in the Supreme Court,

463
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,260
no two justices can agree on why it does.

464
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,520
So we have five different
opinions and the majority,

465
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,790
and we have four separate opinions in
the minority and each justice has their

466
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:05,921
own take on what this phrase and the
eighth amendment means cruel and unusual

467
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:07,963
punishment.

468
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,511
Uh,

469
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:13,511
and so we don't come out of from and with
any sort of clear guidance as to what

470
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:16,310
the constitution does and does not allow.

471
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,020
But we come out with a lot of principals,

472
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,590
uh,

473
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,180
from the different judges' opinions,

474
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,280
which will be very important
in looking at the death.

475
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:22,940
Connie,

476
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,180
uh,

477
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,013
later on,

478
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:24,590
uh,

479
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,240
let's look first to justice Douglas.

480
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:27,380
As most senior judge,

481
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:27,860
uh,

482
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,380
justice on the court appointed
by Franklin Roosevelt,

483
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,830
he saw a desire for equality,

484
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,670
uh,

485
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,220
in the ban against cruel
and unusual punishment.

486
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,090
And he went back through a English
history at some lengths to talk about why,

487
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,540
uh,

488
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,320
one of the concerns of the framers
when they adopted the cruel and unusual

489
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:46,154
clause was,

490
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:46,660
uh,

491
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,550
equality in the way people were treated.

492
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,391
Uh,

493
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:51,224
also,

494
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:51,770
uh,

495
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,730
discrimination.

496
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:54,720
That of course relates to equality.

497
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:55,430
Uh,

498
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,300
a penalty is unusual because we
are dealing with a death pony.

499
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:00,410
So we don't have to really,

500
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,360
uh,

501
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,690
as the question of is it cruel?

502
00:16:03,691 --> 00:16:06,710
A court is going to say the death
point is unlike any other penalty.

503
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,760
It's extraordinary penalty
because it just ends a human life.

504
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:11,191
Uh,

505
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:14,900
it's a revokable no way to go back and
change it if you find out you made a

506
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:15,734
mistake.

507
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,040
Uh,

508
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,150
but the question really is,

509
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,380
is it unusual,

510
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:18,981
uh,

511
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:20,340
under the cruel and unusual clause?

512
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,950
Uh,

513
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,460
Justice Douglas says it's unusual if
it discriminates by reason of race,

514
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,061
religion,

515
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:26,810
wealth,

516
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,520
a social position in class,

517
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:33,080
and he Marshall's a lot of evidence which
shows that the death penalty has been,

518
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,130
uh,

519
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,630
carried out in the country,

520
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,381
uh,

521
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:40,100
in a way in which it's certainly
fallen more heavily on,

522
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:40,490
uh,

523
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,980
African Americans in
particular at that time,

524
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:43,731
uh,

525
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:46,370
and almost exclusively on the poor.

526
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,660
Douglas says at one point,

527
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:48,201
in his opinion,

528
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:51,290
you can search in vain
for a wealthy person,

529
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:51,810
uh,

530
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:51,990
who,

531
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,180
who was sentenced to death.

532
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:53,811
Uh,

533
00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:58,811
and what he's interested
in is the risk of these,

534
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,750
uh,

535
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,070
factors coming into play.

536
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:04,580
He didn't say you have to
prove that race motivated.

537
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,301
Uh,

538
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:09,110
the prosecutions in these cases or race
was the reason that the death penalty

539
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:13,400
was sought when life imprisonment
might've been a completely sufficient

540
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:14,234
punishment.

541
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,661
Uh,

542
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:19,130
but that the death penalty
is unconstitutional if,

543
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,220
uh,

544
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,220
there are procedures that give room for
the play of race and poverty to come

545
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:26,234
into account.

546
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,890
So that's,

547
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,690
that's one vote to strike
down the death penalty.

548
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:30,490
Uh,

549
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,201
next is,

550
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:32,540
is Justice Brennan,

551
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:33,520
uh,

552
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,840
Hoover importing to the court
by President Eisenhower.

553
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,630
Uh,

554
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,550
and he has basically a four part,

555
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,960
a way of looking at the cruel
and unusual punishment clause.

556
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:42,740
First of all,

557
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:42,980
he,

558
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,330
he goes back to this notion of dignity
that we got out of truth versus Dallas.

559
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,171
And he says,

560
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:51,360
a punishment cannot be
severe and degrading.

561
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,590
Even the convicted criminal
has a measure of dignity.

562
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:56,461
Uh,

563
00:17:56,461 --> 00:18:01,320
and therefore there's some limit on what
kind of punishments can be imposed and

564
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:02,850
it can't be degrading.

565
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,491
Uh,

566
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:05,460
it cannot be arbitrary.

567
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,211
Uh,

568
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,620
he says that the death
pony in terms of how,

569
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,520
and this is going to be a theme
we see throughout these opinions,

570
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,880
it smacks of little more
than a lottery system,

571
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:15,691
uh,

572
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:18,150
that some people get the death
pony and some people don't.

573
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:23,151
But there's no real basis that we can
discern except for race perhaps as to why

574
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:27,270
some people get it and others don't.

575
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,010
Third question he asked is,

576
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:32,130
is it acceptable to contemporary society?

577
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:32,941
Here again,

578
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:35,610
we're talking about the
evolving standards of decency.

579
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,950
Does the country today,

580
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,784
except it,

581
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,140
there were punishments,

582
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:40,560
uh,

583
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,760
as I said a moment ago,

584
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,600
uh,

585
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,800
like whipping people,

586
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,170
most people would say today that,

587
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,741
you know,

588
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:49,500
whipping has been
abandoned by every state.

589
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,760
And so is it acceptable
to contemporary society?

590
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:54,990
The answer probably know,

591
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,471
uh,

592
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:57,570
this is a punishment
that's been abandoned.

593
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,380
Uh,

594
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:58,950
such a,

595
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,970
so has branding,

596
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:01,350
so has cutting all fingers,

597
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:01,981
uh,

598
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:05,190
those kinds of punishments
once accepted in this country,

599
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,530
but no longer acceptable.

600
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,640
So does a contemporary society except it.

601
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:12,480
And then finally,

602
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,160
the notion that we saw in,

603
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:14,900
uh,

604
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,150
in Weems of excessive a will,

605
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:21,630
a less severe punishment
serve the same purpose.

606
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,471
Uh,

607
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:26,190
and so Brennan sort of ads
in this element of necessity.

608
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:27,024
Does the,

609
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,050
does the state need the death Tali,

610
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:29,820
uh,

611
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,130
to punish the crimes
that are involved here?

612
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:33,870
Rape and murder,

613
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,770
uh,

614
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,410
if it can punish those crimes
with life imprisonment and,

615
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,770
and serve the same interest
that the state has,

616
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:44,430
which is preventing people from committing
these crimes and punishing them,

617
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:44,940
uh,

618
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,773
if they do,

619
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,873
um,

620
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,030
well then we go to potter.

621
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:48,471
Stewart.

622
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:53,471
Justice Stewart is a republican appointee
appointed by President Eisenhower had

623
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:55,990
been on the Sixth Circuit
Court of Appeals and,

624
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:56,280
and,

625
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,880
um,

626
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,180
uh,

627
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,013
Cincinnati.

628
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:58,860
Uh,

629
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:03,210
he says it's unusual if
it's infrequently imposed.

630
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,433
Uh,

631
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,400
he says for murder,

632
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:07,200
it's infrequent and for rape,

633
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,910
it's extraordinarily rare,

634
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,420
uh,

635
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,300
that the death pony,

636
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:10,630
uh,

637
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,463
is imposed,

638
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:11,970
uh,

639
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:12,803
for that.

640
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,261
Uh,

641
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:15,500
and he used a very colorful language.

642
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,970
Capriciously selected handful,

643
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:18,691
uh,

644
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:23,400
receive the death pony while others who
commit crimes just as reprehensible do

645
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:23,910
not.

646
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,391
Here again,

647
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:28,950
we see this question of consistency are
some people getting the death penalty?

648
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,881
And some people,

649
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:30,420
not.

650
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,530
Stuart says receiving the death pony
is like being struck by lightning.

651
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,340
Uh,

652
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,210
there's no,

653
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:36,900
uh,

654
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,610
some people get it while others don't,

655
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:42,060
and there's no reason
for those distinctions.

656
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:43,200
So He's worried about,

657
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:43,890
uh,

658
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,210
the infrequency,

659
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,781
uh,

660
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:46,950
and also,

661
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,390
uh,

662
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,490
the capriciousness,

663
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:48,900
uh,

664
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,370
of the way in which the
death penalty is imposed.

665
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,150
Uh,

666
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,950
he goes on and talk about
a little bit about race.

667
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,620
He says my concurring brother and,

668
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,400
uh,

669
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,400
have demonstrate that if there's any
basis for why these few get the death pony

670
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:03,484
when many others,

671
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,030
uh,

672
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,840
don't,

673
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,171
uh,

674
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:08,650
it is the constitutionally
impermissible reason of race.

675
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:09,963
But he says

676
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,970
race discrimination has not been
proven and I put it to one side.

677
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:21,420
I simply conclude that the eighth and
14th amendments cannot tolerate this

678
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,410
unique penalty,

679
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,940
the death penalty to be imposed
in a wanton and freakish manner.

680
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:28,841
Uh,

681
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:29,830
and so again,

682
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,270
sort of colorful language that,

683
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:31,720
uh,

684
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,160
justice Stewart uses in describing
what he sees as problematic.

685
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:40,420
Notice though that Justice Stewart here
is not saying I find the death Polly

686
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,970
unconstitutional in all situations.

687
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,910
He's saying when it's freakishly imposed,

688
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,710
when it's very infrequent,

689
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,611
uh,

690
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:50,050
when it's like being struck by lightning,

691
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:50,710
uh,

692
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,150
which is the way the depth punny
had operated up until 1972,

693
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,100
at least according to his view of it,

694
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,520
then that makes it cruel and unusual,

695
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,340
unusual in the arbitrariness of it,

696
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,690
the infrequency of it.

697
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,540
A very important vote here.

698
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:07,781
Uh,

699
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:10,060
Justice Byron White pointed to the court,

700
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:10,600
uh,

701
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:10,941
by,

702
00:22:10,941 --> 00:22:11,090
uh,

703
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,270
the only appointment by President John F.

704
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:13,520
Kennedy,

705
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:13,870
uh,

706
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,703
Justice White,

707
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:15,640
uh,

708
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,640
normally fairly conservative
on criminal law matters,

709
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,240
uh,

710
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,160
but he votes to strike
down the death polling.

711
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:21,821
He,

712
00:22:21,821 --> 00:22:22,654
again,

713
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:27,400
like Justice Stewart talks
about the infrequency the
fact that the death penalty

714
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:29,530
is so seldom used,

715
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,080
uh,

716
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,660
that it doesn't really serve the deterrent
purpose that its supporters claim,

717
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,181
uh,

718
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:36,014
that it has.

719
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,760
Uh,

720
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,630
he also,

721
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,110
uh,

722
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:43,110
finds it excessive that there is
a negligible return to the states,

723
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,410
uh,

724
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,850
for enforcement.

725
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:46,211
Uh,

726
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:46,430
the,

727
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:46,901
this,

728
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:47,500
uh,

729
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,780
is more again,

730
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,633
gets into this,

731
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,290
uh,

732
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:50,780
question.

733
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,030
Uh,

734
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,110
the Brendan talks about,

735
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,050
about necessity,

736
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:53,861
uh,

737
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:58,750
the pointless and needless extension of
life with only marginal contributions

738
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:03,340
only marginally serves the state
purpose when it has another sentence,

739
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:03,681
which is,

740
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:04,514
can impose,

741
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,140
uh,

742
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,760
just as well as he said,

743
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:09,700
the legislative purpose
will not be frustrated,

744
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,450
uh,

745
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,590
because it can still punish.

746
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,820
And so we're not saying you can't punish
these crimes were just saying you can't

747
00:23:15,821 --> 00:23:16,654
punish them.

748
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:16,941
Uh,

749
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:17,860
with the death valley,

750
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,580
you can punish them with life imprisonment
or a term of years or whatever.

751
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,350
And then finally and critically,

752
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:23,920
uh,

753
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,420
just as a white says,

754
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:30,421
there's no principled way to separate
the few who get the death pony from the

755
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:33,130
many who do not notice.

756
00:23:33,131 --> 00:23:33,670
Again,

757
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,430
this is our second justice
now along with Stewart,

758
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,880
who's not saying I'm necessarily
opposed to the death pony,

759
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,260
but I'm opposed to it in the
way it's used infrequently,

760
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,423
uh,

761
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,550
arbitrarily,

762
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,031
uh,

763
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:50,720
and without any principle basis
for why some people get it.

764
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,040
And some people do not.

765
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,840
You read this opinion and you think,

766
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:54,200
well,

767
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,970
if there was a principle basis,

768
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,240
which is what the states are
going to try to do after farming,

769
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,050
uh,

770
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,400
you'd probably get justice white's
a vote to uphold a new death sins,

771
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,270
which we will see,

772
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,900
uh,

773
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,733
happens.

774
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,340
Uh,

775
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,050
I think justice white at the time,

776
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:09,801
uh,

777
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:11,840
and the court perhaps overall,

778
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:12,410
uh,

779
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,450
thought the death pony was on its way out.

780
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,190
I just a few years before Furman
was the only time in the late 1960s,

781
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:19,941
uh,

782
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:21,530
when the supreme court,

783
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:21,981
or excuse me,

784
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:25,970
when the public opinion polls show that
more people were opposed to the death

785
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:27,860
penalty a then support it,

786
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,410
the rest of the time zone has been
more support for the death penalty than

787
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,270
opposition to it.

788
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,020
Uh,

789
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,040
but beyond that,

790
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,280
the court had decided a case called
Weatherspoon versus Illinois,

791
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,330
which we'll talk about when we talk about
juries in which the court had talked

792
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:43,490
about excluding people from juries,

793
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,180
uh,

794
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,280
because of their position
on the death penalty.

795
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,680
And notice that a large segment of
the population was being excluded.

796
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,250
Uh,

797
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,150
and it sort of talked about the people
qualified or the people left behind is a

798
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:59,330
dwindling minority of people
who supported the death point.

799
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,321
In other words,

800
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:00,541
the,

801
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:00,731
the,

802
00:25:00,731 --> 00:25:02,540
the practice of imposing the death.

803
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:06,080
Polly had declined a
great deal in the 1960s.

804
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:06,730
Uh,

805
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,090
the,

806
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:07,460
uh,

807
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,090
public opinion polls tended to show people
who are opposed to the death penalty.

808
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:11,871
Uh,

809
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:13,100
and by 1972,

810
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:16,010
the court sort of looks back at all those
and things and it's been a moratorium.

811
00:25:16,011 --> 00:25:17,720
No DeCinces had been carried out,

812
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:18,231
uh,

813
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:19,310
for some period of time.

814
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,570
And so the court thinks,

815
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,260
uh,

816
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,011
that death pony,

817
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:24,350
this is sort of a society,

818
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,260
American society like the English,

819
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:27,771
the French,

820
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:27,971
and,

821
00:25:27,971 --> 00:25:28,131
and,

822
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:31,790
and Scandinavians in so many other people
are ready to abandon the death point.

823
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:32,450
Uh,

824
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,780
what the court didn't anticipate
obviously was that the,

825
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,320
uh,

826
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,010
1968 presidential election and
president Nixon's running on,

827
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:40,250
uh,

828
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,120
being very tough on crime and crime
becoming a very big political issue.

829
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:44,740
Uh,

830
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,220
the public opinion polls had
changed dramatically by 1972.

831
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,690
The court's a little
behind the curve here.

832
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,500
Uh,

833
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:51,951
but it,

834
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:55,520
we'll find out soon that there's
more support for the death,

835
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:56,090
plenty,

836
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:56,361
uh,

837
00:25:56,361 --> 00:25:58,250
than it thinks a justice.

838
00:25:58,251 --> 00:26:01,340
Thurgood Marshall was
the only member as a,

839
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,580
I've mentioned the only member of the
supreme court ever actually handled the

840
00:26:04,581 --> 00:26:05,391
death pony case.

841
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:08,150
He actually set in a chair,

842
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:08,930
uh,

843
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,291
you know,

844
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:12,080
back when very few black
lawyers who are practicing,

845
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:12,580
uh,

846
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:17,330
beside other African Americans and
represented them before juries in capital

847
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:17,811
cases.

848
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:19,550
He appealed death penalty cases.

849
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:21,470
He knew that innocent people,

850
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,070
uh,

851
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,010
could be sentenced to death
because he had seen that happen.

852
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:25,580
And one of his,

853
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,413
one of his own,

854
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:26,840
uh,

855
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,430
not sentenced to death but convicted.

856
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,170
And one of his own cases,

857
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:30,650
uh,

858
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,450
as far as just Marshall was concerned,

859
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:35,060
that death pony is purposeless vengeance,

860
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,890
morally reprehensible,

861
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,660
and he finds that retribution
is unacceptable as a purpose.

862
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,930
One of the debates that were going to
see within the court here is if we have

863
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:46,764
the death pony,

864
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,860
what government interests does it serve a,

865
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,170
if it serves a retribution,

866
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,790
is that a proper interest,

867
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:54,300
uh,

868
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,280
for a punishment to serve?

869
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,420
Uh,

870
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,800
does it serve rehabilitation?

871
00:26:58,801 --> 00:27:01,200
Obviously the death pony doesn't serve,

872
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:01,560
uh,

873
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,370
rehabilitation.

874
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,203
Did Terrence,

875
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:03,690
uh,

876
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,860
does it deter?

877
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:05,480
Uh,

878
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,470
and we'll see the debate back and forth,

879
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,160
uh,

880
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,821
in the court,

881
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:11,010
both in this case in 1972,

882
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:12,180
Furman versus Georgia,

883
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,440
but also later in 1976
when the court addresses,

884
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:16,860
uh,

885
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,810
the new death pony statutes.

886
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,411
Uh,

887
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:20,460
but here also,

888
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:24,690
Marshall says the American people would
never support the death penalty if they

889
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:26,220
knew that it was imposed.

890
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:30,240
Discriminatorily and he Marshall's a lot
of statistics and a lot of historical

891
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:32,100
information and supported that.

892
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:36,720
One of the most dramatic being that since
the Justice Department started keeping

893
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,220
statistics,

894
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,030
uh,

895
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,710
on the death pony in 1930,

896
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,490
uh,

897
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:44,010
from 1938 until 1972,

898
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:48,090
there had been 455 people
executed for the crime of rape.

899
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:48,810
Uh,

900
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,180
405 African Americans.

901
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,220
One of the more damning statistics,

902
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:53,700
uh,

903
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,530
in our national history,

904
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,360
he also pointed out that innocent people,

905
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,080
uh,

906
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,220
had been sentenced to death.

907
00:27:59,520 --> 00:27:59,881
Uh,

908
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:00,451
and it probably,

909
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:01,500
most people don't know that,

910
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:02,334
but if they did,

911
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,500
they probably wouldn't
support the death penalty.

912
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:09,660
And then finally picks up the theme that
Justice Douglas had set at the outset.

913
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,651
It's the poor,

914
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:11,281
the ignorant,

915
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:13,470
and the underprivileged
who get the death penalty.

916
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,790
A while.

917
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,770
People of means people who are
better off are and justice,

918
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,430
guilty,

919
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:19,690
uh,

920
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,930
and perhaps crimes just as reprehensible,

921
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,380
uh,

922
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,640
they escaped the death pony.

923
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,260
Uh,

924
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,370
so justice Marshall clearly,

925
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:26,940
uh,

926
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,450
believes that the death
police time has come and gone.

927
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:30,870
Uh,

928
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,510
he and Justice Brennan would oppose and,

929
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,040
and Justice Douglas probably,

930
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:35,581
uh,

931
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:36,460
the death pony in,

932
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:37,410
in any case.

933
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,130
Uh,

934
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,420
but then we have two justices,

935
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:40,021
as I said,

936
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:44,730
just to Stewart and justice white who
find that because of the way the death

937
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:49,710
plenty is imposed as they see it
in 1972 arbitrarily freakishly,

938
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,730
uh,

939
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:50,940
uh,

940
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,260
that it's unconstitutional.

941
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,633
Um,

942
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,800
so let's look at the dissenters.

943
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:56,520
Uh,

944
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,530
Chief Justice Warren Burger trucks about,

945
00:28:58,531 --> 00:28:59,460
and this basically,

946
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:03,030
if we want to look at
what divides the majority,

947
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:04,920
the five justices in the majority.

948
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:05,401
All right.

949
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:06,234
Separate opinions,

950
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,970
the four and the minority.

951
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,391
All right.

952
00:29:09,391 --> 00:29:10,081
Separate opinions.

953
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,650
But what is the basic
separation between the two?

954
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,480
Uh,

955
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,540
and I believe it's what,

956
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,050
uh,

957
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,220
Justice Burger trucks about here,

958
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:19,680
the primacy of the legislative role.

959
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,190
The dissenters believe this is a
question for the legislature's.

960
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:23,851
Uh,

961
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:28,851
it's not a question for the court to take
up the five and the majority feel like

962
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:30,900
this is a constitutional issue.

963
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,470
Does the death penalty violate the
eighth amendment of the United States

964
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:35,304
constitution?

965
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:35,971
Uh,

966
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:38,790
and that's a judicial
determination to be made.

967
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:43,330
A Burger also points out that the
death penalty is not a repugnant.

968
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:44,290
He looks at these,

969
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:44,950
uh,

970
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,240
other eighth amendment cases,

971
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:46,991
as I said earlier,

972
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:51,991
about whether a particular method shooting
electrocuting trying a second time,

973
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:54,490
uh,

974
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,070
do those things violate the
criminal unusual punishment?

975
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:01,600
He says this is not like a burning
people at stake or those types of things.

976
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:02,434
This is a,

977
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,131
a,

978
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:04,480
a punishment that,

979
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,090
uh,

980
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,360
is not only a accepted,

981
00:30:07,361 --> 00:30:08,830
it's not universally condemned.

982
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:11,350
He points out that 40 states
and the federal government,

983
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,280
uh,

984
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,210
have the death pony.

985
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:16,840
The federal government had even
added some desk statutes in the,

986
00:30:16,841 --> 00:30:17,860
in the last decade.

987
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,521
Uh,

988
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:20,050
and then here's the interesting,

989
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,950
a division between the
majority and the minority.

990
00:30:23,951 --> 00:30:27,070
We see the justices in the majority,

991
00:30:27,071 --> 00:30:32,071
the five talking about how unusual the
death pony is and how infrequent it is.

992
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:37,390
A Justice Burger turns us around looking
at it from another angle and says the

993
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:42,340
infrequency shows the jurors are very
cautious about imposing the death Pollock,

994
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,451
uh,

995
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:47,020
that they are very cautious
and whether to impose it.

996
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:48,970
So you look at the same set of facts,

997
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,520
the fact that the death
penalty is imposed,

998
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,280
a hit here and there,

999
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:54,830
uh,

1000
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,020
in different parts of Georgia,

1001
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,000
different parts of Texas and other states,

1002
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:58,511
uh,

1003
00:30:58,511 --> 00:31:01,480
one group of justices sees
that as arbitrariness.

1004
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,171
Uh,

1005
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:05,170
there's like being struck
by lightning just as burger.

1006
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:09,700
And some of his colleagues in dissent
see that as juries are very careful when

1007
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,580
they're given a person's
life in their hands.

1008
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,470
They're very careful about,

1009
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:14,860
uh,

1010
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,500
whether or not to impose
the death penalty.

1011
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:17,190
So,

1012
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,950
um,

1013
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,100
you can look at sort of the same
facts as the court does here,

1014
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:21,610
uh,

1015
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,460
and see two different realities.

1016
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,220
But the primary one for Justice Burger,

1017
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:27,680
uh,

1018
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,170
is that this is something that
courts shouldn't be involved in this,

1019
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,070
that we are to leave it
to the legislature's.

1020
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:33,850
Uh,

1021
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,930
same thing for justice.

1022
00:31:34,931 --> 00:31:35,764
Blackmun.

1023
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,100
Uh,

1024
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,890
justice Blackmun had never
liked the death pony.

1025
00:31:38,891 --> 00:31:42,430
He had made that clear when he was on
the United States Court of appeals and he

1026
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,080
looked at a death penalty case side.

1027
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,351
Well,

1028
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:44,861
many death,

1029
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:45,311
plenty of case,

1030
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:47,230
but one in particular how to Arkansas.

1031
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:47,861
Uh,

1032
00:31:47,861 --> 00:31:52,060
and he talked about how difficult it
was for him to sit on these cases.

1033
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,020
Uh,

1034
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,090
but he said it's a legislative judgment.

1035
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:55,721
Uh,

1036
00:31:55,721 --> 00:31:58,960
whether a state has the duff punny
or not is up to the legislatures.

1037
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,200
We as justices on the supreme court should
respect what the state legislature's

1038
00:32:05,261 --> 00:32:06,094
do.

1039
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:06,610
Uh,

1040
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,750
Justice Powell,

1041
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:08,890
uh,

1042
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,570
pointed again by all of the dissenting
justices appointed by President Richard

1043
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:16,450
Nixon after his election in 1968.

1044
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,400
Uh,

1045
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,221
just as Palestinian,

1046
00:32:18,221 --> 00:32:18,611
first of all,

1047
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:21,490
if we're looking at the
evolving standards of decency,

1048
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,000
uh,

1049
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,280
we want to look at what
the legislatures have done.

1050
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,630
Again saying,

1051
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,080
we defer to the legislatures
and his Burger had pointed out,

1052
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,630
40 states had the death pony at this time.

1053
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:31,931
Of course,

1054
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:33,250
many of them were not using it.

1055
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,061
Uh,

1056
00:32:34,061 --> 00:32:36,280
it was being used primarily
in the southern states,

1057
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,810
but it was on the books,

1058
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,290
uh,

1059
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,220
in a number of other other states.

1060
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,001
Uh,

1061
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:46,001
and Powell again takes issue with this
notion that the fact that it's not being

1062
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:51,281
imposed very often is some indication
that the death penalty has been rejected

1063
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:52,550
by modern society,

1064
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:53,384
which is what,

1065
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:53,810
uh,

1066
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:57,230
Justice Brennan says when he talks
about is it acceptable to contemporary

1067
00:32:57,231 --> 00:32:58,064
society.

1068
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,430
He looks at how few death
cases are imposed and says,

1069
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,030
uh,

1070
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,100
basically the,

1071
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,250
the country has turned its
back on the death pony.

1072
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,320
A pal says,

1073
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:06,950
well,

1074
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,370
uh,

1075
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,160
not so fast.

1076
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,570
The death penalty was imposed a
about two depth pennies a week,

1077
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,151
uh,

1078
00:33:12,151 --> 00:33:14,570
or imposed throughout
the country in the 1960s.

1079
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,531
Uh,

1080
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:18,800
and then on Brendan's notion of necessity,

1081
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,620
which also seems to be a little
part of Justice White's opinion,

1082
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,790
uh,

1083
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:27,230
power responds to that by saying there's
nothing in the constitution that says

1084
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,150
that a penalty is invalid.

1085
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,710
Just because there's a lesser penalty
that would serve the same purpose.

1086
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:34,941
In other words,

1087
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:39,320
what white is saying and what Brennan is
saying is that the states don't really

1088
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:40,310
need the death poly.

1089
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:45,311
It's serving only a marginal value
because they can punish these crimes with

1090
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:46,310
life imprisonment.

1091
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,910
Just as saying,

1092
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,960
there's no constitutional rule that says
a state has to use the lesser penalty.

1093
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:54,510
Uh,

1094
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,460
and that that's a reason for
striking down the greater penalty.

1095
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,690
Um,

1096
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,070
he also talks about race,

1097
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:01,910
uh,

1098
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,010
but in a sort of resigned way,

1099
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:04,910
uh,

1100
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,780
just as Powell says,

1101
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:08,180
it's always the poor and minorities,

1102
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:08,840
uh,

1103
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,760
that are treated poorly,

1104
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:11,780
who get punished.

1105
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,180
Uh,

1106
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,620
but he said the reason for that is
because they grow up in poverty.

1107
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:16,430
Uh,

1108
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,080
there's not the parental and,

1109
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:18,351
uh,

1110
00:34:18,351 --> 00:34:22,040
other supervision and that what we
really ought to do is deal with the root

1111
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:26,060
causes of poverty and income inequality,

1112
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:26,751
uh,

1113
00:34:26,751 --> 00:34:29,390
and not abolish the Death Poli.

1114
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,440
Uh,

1115
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,440
and then he seems to suggest that race
is not really that big a factor anymore.

1116
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:37,670
Uh,

1117
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,970
he said the great race has greatly
diminished because now we have blacks hung

1118
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:42,830
juries when we come to juries.

1119
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,020
Will see that's not the case even today.

1120
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:45,710
Uh,

1121
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,620
but it certainly wasn't the case in 1972,

1122
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:49,220
uh,

1123
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,250
when Justice Powell said that,

1124
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,150
uh,

1125
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,380
because at the time,

1126
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:54,770
uh,

1127
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:58,070
prosecutors were able to strike
African Americans from jurors.

1128
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:58,491
And of course,

1129
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:01,760
if you've got a group that's
in a minority to begin with,

1130
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:02,540
uh,

1131
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,540
it's going to be fairly easy for the
prosecutor to use his or her discretionary

1132
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:09,171
strikes,

1133
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:12,020
what we call a peremptory
strikes to exclude people.

1134
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:12,770
So,

1135
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:13,490
uh,

1136
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:17,540
still in a lot of places where the
death pony was being concerned was being

1137
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:18,360
imposed.

1138
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:18,660
A,

1139
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,340
there were not any blacks on the jury
and there weren't any African Americans

1140
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,420
anywhere in the decision making
process in the prosecutor's office,

1141
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:29,740
which decides whether to seek the death
penalty or whether it a plea bargain.

1142
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,583
The cases,

1143
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,100
uh,

1144
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,880
no,

1145
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,630
uh,

1146
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,170
black people on the bench and judges and,

1147
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:36,320
and most of the states,

1148
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:37,650
particularly the states,

1149
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,521
uh,

1150
00:35:38,521 --> 00:35:42,180
and generally cases being
tried to all white juries.

1151
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:42,871
Uh,

1152
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:43,704
and then,

1153
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,280
uh,

1154
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,980
we talked about history
in an earlier session,

1155
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:47,820
uh,

1156
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,370
and the role that the criminal justice
system has played in racial oppression

1157
00:35:51,371 --> 00:35:52,830
and throughout the
history of this country,

1158
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:53,310
uh,

1159
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:57,720
from the time of slavery to convict
leasing to mass incarceration today,

1160
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,290
uh,

1161
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,190
Powell says,

1162
00:35:59,310 --> 00:35:59,461
well,

1163
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:00,810
past discrimination,

1164
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:01,261
uh,

1165
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:03,090
is no reason to strike
down the death point.

1166
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,370
And this is a question
that we will wrestle with.

1167
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,300
To what extent,

1168
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:06,930
uh,

1169
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,460
do we look at the past?

1170
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,510
Do we look at how much this history,

1171
00:36:12,511 --> 00:36:17,130
this utterly corrupt criminal justice
system that sent convicts out,

1172
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:17,681
uh,

1173
00:36:17,681 --> 00:36:20,580
into the fields and to the
railroads and the coal mines,

1174
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:21,331
uh,

1175
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:21,960
that,

1176
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,680
uh,

1177
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,250
helps slavery by providing for
the deaf 20 for so many people?

1178
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:26,670
Uh,

1179
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,490
to what extent is that
bleed into the present?

1180
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:30,121
Uh,

1181
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:33,810
and to what extent have we have
the criminal courts overcome it?

1182
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:34,470
Uh,

1183
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,490
but that will take up,

1184
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,061
uh,

1185
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:36,571
as,

1186
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:37,650
as we go forward.

1187
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,100
Uh,

1188
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:38,670
finally,

1189
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,270
uh,

1190
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,103
we have,

1191
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,830
uh,

1192
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:44,040
Justice Rehnquist and Justice Rehnquist,

1193
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,090
uh,

1194
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:45,930
says that,

1195
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:46,591
uh,

1196
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:47,424
again,

1197
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:47,881
uh,

1198
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:50,940
the court is not a roving commission.

1199
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:53,280
He again is going to defer
to the legislature's,

1200
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,151
uh,

1201
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:58,200
is not going to strike down laws based
upon what he says is just the majority.

1202
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,600
It's just making a policy
determination here.

1203
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,920
Uh,

1204
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,940
he says a decision by unelected judge
that something is constitutionally

1205
00:37:05,941 --> 00:37:06,774
prohibited,

1206
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,380
uh,

1207
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,870
interferes with the right of
people to govern themselves.

1208
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:14,280
If the people of Alabama or Texas
or Georgia one have the depth pony,

1209
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,690
the court should,

1210
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,140
uh,

1211
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,980
let them have it.

1212
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:17,550
Uh,

1213
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,600
and his main point,

1214
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,150
judicial self restraint,

1215
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:21,900
uh,

1216
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,240
that the judges should,

1217
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:24,960
again,

1218
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,411
as I said,

1219
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:29,100
the primary difference between those and
the minority and those are the majority

1220
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,990
is what's the judicial role here?

1221
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:36,260
Is the judicial role to examine this and
decide whether or not the death penalty

1222
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:41,601
is constitutional or is it to stand
back and let the legislature's decide,

1223
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:42,060
uh,

1224
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,560
whether they're going to
have the death penalty,

1225
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:47,430
what crimes will be punished by the
death point and how juries or to come to

1226
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,264
their decision.

1227
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:53,420
But the end result of this is the death
pony is declared unconstitutional as

1228
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,490
applied in 1972.

1229
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:58,290
This resulted in a,

1230
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:00,360
the end of the death
pony for the time being.

1231
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:04,290
Every person about 560 people
were on death row at the time.

1232
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,430
Ferman was decided,

1233
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:05,911
uh,

1234
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:10,911
this decision affected not only the
people in Georgia where Furman came from

1235
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:11,581
and,

1236
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:12,414
and Texas,

1237
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:12,900
uh,

1238
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,720
but it affected all the death sentence,

1239
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:16,260
the state and federal
throughout the country.

1240
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:16,830
And,

1241
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,120
and,

1242
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,230
and we sort of get this
out of these cases,

1243
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:19,771
uh,

1244
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:21,950
the notion of arbitrariness,

1245
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:22,561
uh,

1246
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:25,320
as part of the notion of unusual,

1247
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,740
the process of imposing the
death pony must be rational.

1248
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:33,360
There's got to be some principled
basis to distinguish the few.

1249
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:35,160
This is going back to
justice white's opinion.

1250
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,570
A few who get the death Polly,

1251
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,080
uh,

1252
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,610
from the many who do not.

1253
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:40,780
Uh,

1254
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:45,780
Justice Douglas says there's gotta be
some protection in any death pony statute

1255
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:51,030
that prevents the risk of discrimination
based on race or poverty or,

1256
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:52,660
or other factors.

1257
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,930
So we come away with that as sort of a,

1258
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:55,251
uh,

1259
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:56,680
an eighth amendment principle,

1260
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:57,270
uh,

1261
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,360
out of these cases.

1262
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,470
Uh,

1263
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,940
and also,

1264
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:01,301
uh,

1265
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:04,120
this notion of the evolving
standards of decency,

1266
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:04,780
uh,

1267
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,370
the meaning of the eighth amendment.

1268
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:07,720
Can change what it meant.

1269
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:08,690
Uh,

1270
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:08,980
and,

1271
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,311
and,

1272
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:09,460
uh,

1273
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,293
1970,

1274
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:10,640
uh,

1275
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,080
in 1776 a is not necessarily
what it means today.

1276
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:14,800
Uh,

1277
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,790
punishments that,

1278
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:16,360
uh,

1279
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,920
did not violate the eighth
amendment then may violate it today.

1280
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:21,940
Uh,

1281
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,511
as I said,

1282
00:39:22,511 --> 00:39:27,160
society has reached a consensus that some
punishments are no longer acceptable.

1283
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:29,860
At the time of the
founding of the country,

1284
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,170
uh,

1285
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,180
there were no presence.

1286
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,030
And so people were often
punished physically,

1287
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:34,871
uh,

1288
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:36,070
with say whipping.

1289
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:36,880
Uh,

1290
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,661
but today,

1291
00:39:37,661 --> 00:39:40,150
if some state enacted a statute that said,

1292
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:44,500
we are going to provide a 10 lashes
for the crime of shoplifting,

1293
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:45,640
uh,

1294
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,870
probably the supreme court would say
that violates the eighth amendment cruel

1295
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:53,620
and unusual punishment clause because
society has basically abandoned if there's

1296
00:39:53,621 --> 00:39:54,520
not another state,

1297
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,300
49,

1298
00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:00,300
the other 49 states don't use
whipping a as a punishment anymore.

1299
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,421
And therefore,

1300
00:40:01,421 --> 00:40:02,920
even though it was constitutional,

1301
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:03,701
uh,

1302
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,590
at the time the eighth
amendment was adopted,

1303
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,070
uh,

1304
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,260
not constitutional today.

1305
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,550
But here's the problem.

1306
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:14,410
How do we decide what the
evolving standards of decency are?

1307
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,190
Uh,

1308
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,350
do we measure it by what juries do,

1309
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:19,210
which is what Justice
Brennan talked about.

1310
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,130
Do we look to legislatures,

1311
00:40:21,131 --> 00:40:23,500
which is what the dissenters talked about.

1312
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,510
Do we look at public opinion polls?

1313
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,050
Uh,

1314
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:30,580
we will see going forward that the supreme
court is going to wrestle with this,

1315
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,060
uh,

1316
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:36,060
for some time about how to measure
the evolving standards of decency.

1317
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,220
It's easy in the examples that I gave.

1318
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:42,490
If no other state is using
a particular punishment,

1319
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,210
then you can say society
has turned its back on it.

1320
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:46,800
Well,

1321
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,490
but what if 20 states are using it in
30 or not a what if in the 20 that are

1322
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:53,290
using and it's only being
used every now and then,

1323
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,071
uh,

1324
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:55,960
and the juries aren't
imposing it very often,

1325
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,010
uh,

1326
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:02,010
has society evolve to the point that
that's no longer an acceptable punishment.

1327
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,100
But we will see that with regard
to the death punny in general.

1328
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,641
Uh,

1329
00:41:06,641 --> 00:41:11,410
and we will see that with regard to the
death penalty for a certain kinds of

1330
00:41:11,411 --> 00:41:12,244
crimes,

1331
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,181
accomplices,

1332
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:14,014
for example,

1333
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:14,681
uh,

1334
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,180
and for certain people,

1335
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,080
uh,

1336
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:17,913
children,

1337
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,913
uh,

1338
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:19,870
have the,

1339
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:20,500
uh,

1340
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,500
the society except anymore,

1341
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:22,821
uh,

1342
00:41:22,821 --> 00:41:23,920
the death penalty for children.

1343
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:28,750
Does it accept the death pony for
people who are intellectually disabled?

1344
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,501
Uh,

1345
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:30,970
and we will get to all those,

1346
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,170
uh,

1347
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,431
in,

1348
00:41:32,431 --> 00:41:33,264
in the future.

1349
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:33,590
Uh,

1350
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:37,790
but we see today the court beginning to
wrestle with how it's going to decide on

1351
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:40,250
the evolving standards of decency,

1352
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:45,670
a proportion or excessiveness
necessary justice Brennan a suggest,

1353
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:51,350
as we talked about the need for a
relationship between the severity of the

1354
00:41:51,351 --> 00:41:53,690
punishment and the government purpose.

1355
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,140
The government wants to punish
people for the crime of murder.

1356
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:57,980
Uh,

1357
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,431
it does.

1358
00:41:58,431 --> 00:41:58,791
So,

1359
00:41:58,791 --> 00:41:58,991
and,

1360
00:41:58,991 --> 00:42:01,730
and Georgia and Texas by
providing for the death penalty.

1361
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:02,300
Uh,

1362
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,380
but the question is,

1363
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:03,830
uh,

1364
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,300
if they have life imprisonment,

1365
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:08,710
is it necessary to have the death poem?

1366
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,150
And Douglas would,

1367
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:10,730
eh,

1368
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:11,450
would add,

1369
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,400
particularly if it's discriminating.

1370
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:13,990
Uh,

1371
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,130
and I don't think there's
much question today,

1372
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:16,910
uh,

1373
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:17,810
that certainly,

1374
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:18,500
uh,

1375
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,790
throughout our history,

1376
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,720
the death pony has been used in a
discriminatory manner that it was a

1377
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:25,940
particularly against African Americans,

1378
00:42:25,941 --> 00:42:29,360
both during the time of
slavery and up until 1972,

1379
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:29,810
uh,

1380
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:30,980
after the civil war,

1381
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:31,490
uh,

1382
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,323
was over.

1383
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:32,900
Uh,

1384
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,550
and then the notion of dignity,

1385
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:35,151
uh,

1386
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:35,781
which was,

1387
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:36,614
uh,

1388
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:41,930
what Chief Justice Warren thought was
the central principle of the eighth

1389
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:43,370
amendment and truth versus Dallas.

1390
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:44,563
Uh,

1391
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,420
we're going to see two
different notions of dignity,

1392
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,410
uh,

1393
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,340
hear from the court,

1394
00:42:49,341 --> 00:42:50,870
but Justice Brennan's concern,

1395
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:51,581
uh,

1396
00:42:51,581 --> 00:42:56,300
about the punishment not be
being unnecessarily degrading.

1397
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:57,340
Uh,

1398
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,400
Justice Arthur Goldberg,

1399
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:00,920
who had been on the court
before once said that,

1400
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:01,670
uh,

1401
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:06,670
the deliberate institutionalized
taking of human life as the ultimate

1402
00:43:07,071 --> 00:43:08,090
degradation,

1403
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:08,900
uh,

1404
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,950
of a human being.

1405
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:10,821
Uh,

1406
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:11,960
and so for Brennan,

1407
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,270
that answers the question right there.

1408
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:15,950
But we will see later,

1409
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:16,291
uh,

1410
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:17,600
that for other justices,

1411
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,460
what dignity means is you take into
account the individual characteristics of

1412
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:23,210
the person,

1413
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:28,210
but it doesn't necessarily mean that
you don't allow the death penalty all

1414
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:29,340
together.

1415
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:29,660
Uh,

1416
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:32,240
and then this notion
that death is different,

1417
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,270
that somehow the procedures,

1418
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:36,111
uh,

1419
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:39,710
are going to be a more careful,

1420
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:40,671
uh,

1421
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,520
in cases involving the death pony because,

1422
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,091
uh,

1423
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:45,550
the death penalty is era.

1424
00:43:45,551 --> 00:43:48,440
Vocable eliminates a person
from the human community.

1425
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,011
Uh,

1426
00:43:49,011 --> 00:43:50,960
and the courts have to be very careful,

1427
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:51,650
uh,

1428
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:52,640
with regard,

1429
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:53,270
uh,

1430
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,050
to,

1431
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:54,860
uh,

1432
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,530
the,

1433
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:55,790
uh,

1434
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:57,960
fairness and reliability
in which the death pony,

1435
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:58,730
uh,

1436
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:03,730
is imposed clear that as we've discussed
that not all five members of the

1437
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:06,950
majority think the death penalty
is always unconstitutional.

1438
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,370
The four and the minority
clearly think to death.

1439
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:11,440
20 is unconstitutional.

1440
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:12,200
Uh,

1441
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,550
con is constitutional and would
defer to the legislatures as soon as,

1442
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:17,120
uh,

1443
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,290
firmer was decided,

1444
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:19,573
uh,

1445
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,050
a number of states,

1446
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:22,003
Georgia,

1447
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:22,731
Florida,

1448
00:44:22,731 --> 00:44:23,151
Texas,

1449
00:44:23,151 --> 00:44:26,000
among them start passing
new death penalty statutes,

1450
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,620
35 states in all.

1451
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:28,551
Uh,

1452
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:32,910
and that's what we'll review next is
when the court comes in 1976 to look at

1453
00:44:32,911 --> 00:44:37,260
those statutes and decide whether or
not they're constitutional or not.

1454
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:37,591
We'll see.

1455
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:42,300
The court upholds some and
find some others do not
satisfy the eighth amendment.
