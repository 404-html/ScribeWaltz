1
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,370
Person accused of any crime,

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,860
including one facing the death.

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,410
Boy Not only needs a lawyer,

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,050
but in most cases there's
a need for an investigator.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,280
There's a need for someone to investigate
the strength of the government's case,

6
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:31,140
the prosecution case against the person
accused and a person who go investigate

7
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:32,100
things like that.

8
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:36,170
The person was somewhere else at the
time of the crime or some other factors

9
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:38,940
self-defence whatever may be the defense,

10
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:39,370
uh,

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,770
that is presented in the case.

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,310
There may also be a need for
expert witnesses to be presented.

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,330
Now in,

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,163
uh,

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,520
public defender offices,

16
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:51,600
particularly capital defender offices
that specialize in defending capital

17
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:52,434
cases.

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,620
There will usually be investigators
that are part of the staff.

19
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:57,090
There may be social workers,

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,650
mitigation specialists,

21
00:00:58,651 --> 00:01:02,520
which look into the mitigating
circumstances in a case.

22
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,740
Some private lawyers will also have
investigators that they rely upon all the

23
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:08,574
time.

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,503
Uh,

25
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,380
public defender offices may have
a budget for expert witnesses.

26
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,041
Uh,

27
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,530
but very often private
lawyers do not have.

28
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,740
And,

29
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,660
and some public defender offices do not.

30
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,040
And as a result,

31
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,690
they're going to apply to the court
for funds for an expert witness.

32
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,170
So let's look a little bit at what the
needs are and then what the court has

33
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:28,730
said,

34
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,070
uh,

35
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,360
with regard to this,

36
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,320
uh,

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,400
expert witnesses,

38
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,061
uh,

39
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:35,040
are going to help us decide things like,

40
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,300
does the evidence,

41
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:38,220
tell us what happened in the case?

42
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:40,500
What was the angle of the wound,

43
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:40,740
uh,

44
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,260
where the people drinking
at the time of the crime?

45
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,100
Uh,

46
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,410
did the bullet come from
the defendant's gun?

47
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:49,740
There'd be all kind of expert
witnesses are just a few examples,

48
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,820
um,

49
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,030
where their bodily
fluids left at the scene.

50
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,750
Uh,

51
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,020
was there an accidental fire arson?

52
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:57,540
Uh,

53
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,540
we know that many wrongful convictions
have been in arson cases because there

54
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:07,821
has been a faulty or mistaken belief
that an arson was committed when in fact

55
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:11,400
the fire was accidental.

56
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,760
So it may be very critical for
a person who's accused of arson,

57
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:15,594
for example,

58
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:15,990
uh,

59
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,630
to have their own expert in fire science,

60
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,150
uh,

61
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,640
come and evaluate the scene,

62
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,474
evaluate,

63
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,231
uh,

64
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:25,710
the whatever tests were conducted upon,

65
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,190
uh,

66
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,570
the remains of the scene,

67
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,080
uh,

68
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,190
to see whether or not we know that
Todd Willingham was executed in Texas,

69
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,200
even though in all probability,

70
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:34,850
uh,

71
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,530
it was an accidental fire
rather than an arson.

72
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:38,820
So experts are critical,

73
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,240
uh,

74
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,640
because generally the lawyers
are not going to know that.

75
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,031
Uh,

76
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:45,390
did the baby die because it was shaken a,

77
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:45,961
in other words,

78
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:47,760
the person's accused of murdering a child.

79
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:50,970
That's a terrible crime and they're
going to be punished severely.

80
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,480
Uh,

81
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,480
but it may be that it was sudden infant
death syndrome or that some other factor

82
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,820
contributed to getting
an investigation and,

83
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,301
and,

84
00:02:59,301 --> 00:02:59,980
and uh,

85
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,320
expert witnesses are
going to look into that.

86
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,440
How long ago did the crime take place
an expert's opinion about how long a

87
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:08,680
person,

88
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,310
uh,

89
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,240
had been dead?

90
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:10,421
How,

91
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:11,530
when the killing took place,

92
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:12,000
uh,

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,030
may be critical if the defendant
was at a certain place at that time.

94
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,990
Uh,

95
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,700
and so the case can be determined,

96
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,980
maybe determined on something like that.

97
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:21,191
Again,

98
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:22,600
these are just examples.

99
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,650
Um,

100
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,483
also,

101
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,050
uh,

102
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,340
expert witnesses are
needed in the area of,

103
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,360
uh,

104
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,193
mental health.

105
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,300
Was the defendant suffering
from a mental illness?

106
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:34,841
Uh,

107
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:35,620
if so,

108
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,453
what was it?

109
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,240
Uh,

110
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,540
how did it affect the person's behavior?

111
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,680
Um,

112
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,380
was the defendant sane at
the time of the offense?

113
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:49,381
Not often are people going to be
successful in raising an insanity defense,

114
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:54,391
but there are times when people are so
profoundly mentally disabled that they do

115
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:59,110
not appreciate the
criminality of their behavior.

116
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,220
And so there may be a question about their
sanity at the time they committed the

117
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:04,054
crime.

118
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,120
A is the defendant competent to
stand trial is the person accused,

119
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,270
uh,

120
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,930
mentally able to understand
what's going on in the courtroom,

121
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:14,560
uh,

122
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,880
to cooperate with a lawyer,

123
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,541
uh,

124
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,610
and participate in the proceedings.

125
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:21,760
It person has to be a
competent to stand trial.

126
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,331
Uh,

127
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:26,650
is the defendant intellectually disabled
what was previously referred to as

128
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:27,484
mentally retarded?

129
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,310
This is critically
important in capital cases,

130
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,860
uh,

131
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,700
because a,

132
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,490
a person who is,

133
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,420
uh,

134
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,470
intellectually disabled,

135
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:35,810
uh,

136
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,620
cannot be put to death under
the Supreme Court's decision.

137
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,440
So that is a determination,

138
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,160
uh,

139
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,200
that may depend very much on testing.

140
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,960
Upon review of records upon childhood,

141
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:47,680
uh,

142
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,780
record schooling and all of that.

143
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,411
Uh,

144
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:55,120
the Supreme Court has said that the death
pony is disproportionate for children.

145
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:57,250
That is people who are under
18 at the time of the crime.

146
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,770
And for people who are
intellectually disabled,

147
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,770
that is people with sub average
intellectual functioning,

148
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,791
uh,

149
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:07,630
that are not held to the same standard
as people that have normal intellectual

150
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:09,130
functioning with age.

151
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,761
It's easy.

152
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:12,850
You just simply find the person's
birth certificate and do the math.

153
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,060
What are they under 18 at the
time the crime took place.

154
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:16,601
Uh,

155
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:19,540
but with regard to
intellectual disability,

156
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,790
there can be very closely contested
question of whether the person is one of

157
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,230
those people who is,

158
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,130
uh,

159
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,910
intellectually disabled to an extent
that they are not subject to the death

160
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:35,911
penalty or is not quite intellectually
disabled enough and are still eligible

161
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,271
for the death.

162
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:37,950
Tony,

163
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,380
uh,

164
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,550
and the other big question,

165
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,700
future danger to society in Texas,

166
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,120
the critical question and whether
it's somebody who sends to death is,

167
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:51,121
is this person a future danger to society
and expert witnesses testify about

168
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:52,900
that.

169
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,620
Um,

170
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,453
so,

171
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,413
um,

172
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,890
the penalty phase of a capital trial,

173
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,880
again,

174
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,040
there's a need for
expert witnesses because,

175
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,173
uh,

176
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,210
it's going to be necessary to investigate
and reconstruct the complete life

177
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:10,160
history of the defendant.

178
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,060
Uh,

179
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,750
who,

180
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,170
uh,

181
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,840
was he his parents?

182
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,410
Uh,

183
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,720
what childhood did he have?

184
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:21,110
What intellectual or mental impairments,

185
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,530
uh,

186
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,130
might,

187
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,610
uh,

188
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,950
he or she have most,

189
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,520
uh,

190
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:25,971
obviously,

191
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:26,481
as I said,

192
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:30,980
may have a mitigation specialist or a
social worker and investigator who will go

193
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:33,050
out and gather that evidence.

194
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:33,590
Uh,

195
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,450
but then there is going to be,

196
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,350
uh,

197
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,050
a need for some mental health testing,

198
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,681
uh,

199
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:40,491
Mris,

200
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:41,540
functional Mris,

201
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,171
cat scans,

202
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:43,460
those sorts of tests.

203
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,510
Those all cost money.

204
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:44,940
Uh,

205
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,130
they require specialist.

206
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:46,731
Uh,

207
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:50,870
and so what do you do if you're facing
the death penalty and the person has a

208
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:53,810
fairly significant mental health issue?

209
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,980
Uh,

210
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,070
you're going to investigated in part
by doing the work of the mitigation

211
00:06:58,071 --> 00:06:59,600
specialist or social worker,

212
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,310
finding out the facts regarding that
persons behavior throughout their life.

213
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:04,880
Uh,

214
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,750
but there's also going to be
a need for expert witnesses.

215
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,913
Uh,

216
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,010
and there may also be a need
for psychological testing,

217
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,740
particularly with regard
to intellectual disability.

218
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:16,250
Uh,

219
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,480
psychological testing,

220
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,001
uh,

221
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:20,780
is going to be very important.

222
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:21,531
Again,

223
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:21,951
as I said,

224
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:25,520
in case states with a capital
defender office or a public defender,

225
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,380
some of these people may be on staff
and there may be a budget for the other

226
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:31,190
people.

227
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:31,520
Uh,

228
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,380
but in states where that's not the case,

229
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,600
then it's going to be necessary for the
defense to apply to the court saying,

230
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,160
I can get a fair trial unless
I have the expert assistance.

231
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:43,640
Uh,

232
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,510
in this case,

233
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,593
uh,

234
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:50,240
and a case that illustrates this and
the case that established the right,

235
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,010
uh,

236
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,380
of a person to expert assistance
is Ake versus Oklahoma.

237
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,340
Uh,

238
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,210
Glenn Bird Naik,

239
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:56,811
uh,

240
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:57,351
was,

241
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:57,590
uh,

242
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,640
charged with killing a couple of wound
in their two children in Oklahoma.

243
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:02,840
Uh,

244
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,840
his behavior was so bizarre that the
judge ordered that he be examined.

245
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,020
Uh,

246
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,020
and the diagnosis was that he was
probably a paranoid schizophrenia.

247
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,450
It was reported that ache appears to be,

248
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:22,451
frankly delusional claims to be the sword
of vengeance of the Lord and thought

249
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:25,490
that he would sit at the
left hand of God in heaven.

250
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,920
It's the person seems not to
be well grounded in reality.

251
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:31,881
Uh,

252
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:32,810
and so,

253
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,560
uh,

254
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,920
after they take a look and
see what the diagnosis is,

255
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:39,170
the court finds that he's
incompetent for trial.

256
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:39,471
That is,

257
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:43,850
he cannot assist his lawyers
understand what's going on at trial.

258
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,710
And so he's committed to a hospital,

259
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,600
but not long after that,

260
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,440
uh,

261
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,220
the hospital reports that he's
now he's been taking thorazine,

262
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,173
which was the,

263
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,230
uh,

264
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,840
uh,

265
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,680
psychotropic drug often given at the
time that ache was in the hospital,

266
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,520
uh,

267
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,353
and that,

268
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:00,780
uh,

269
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,180
he is now competent for trial,

270
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,520
but the doctors did not examine him on
the question of whether he was insane.

271
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,650
That is whether he had
an insanity defense,

272
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,190
uh,

273
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,230
based on his mental health
at the time of trial.

274
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,600
So let's go to his trial.

275
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,260
Uh,

276
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,093
guilt phase.

277
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,990
He clearly did the crime.

278
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,700
The only question is,

279
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,790
was he criminally responsible?

280
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,361
That is,

281
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:27,810
could he appreciate the
wrongfulness of his behavior?

282
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:28,591
Uh,

283
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:33,591
and the law in Oklahoma at the time was
that it was on the defendants side that

284
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:40,110
that issue had to be raised and that
some doubt had to be raised about sanity.

285
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,500
If a doubt was raised by the defendant
and the burden was on the state to prove

286
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:44,820
it beyond a reasonable doubt.

287
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,810
But here,

288
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:46,643
um,

289
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,190
uh,

290
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,170
no expert testified on either side.

291
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,110
So there was no evidence with regard to,

292
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,840
uh,

293
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,460
aches,

294
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,293
sanity,

295
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,900
and therefore he was unable to
present his insanity defense,

296
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,620
uh,

297
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,071
at all.

298
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:02,760
And obviously this a case where it sounds
like that would have been at least a

299
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:06,150
possible defense in
the case penalty phase,

300
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,950
even more critical because they're,

301
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:09,840
the issue is future dangerousness.

302
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,440
Is He a future danger to society?

303
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,070
Uh,

304
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:19,070
prosecution has three psychiatrists
who testify that he is a ache,

305
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,233
has nobody.

306
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:21,691
Uh,

307
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:23,520
so in terms of the trial,

308
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,593
uh,

309
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,890
he has nobody to present and
supportive his insanity defense.

310
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,120
Nobody to present on the
question of future dangerousness.

311
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,480
His appeal to the United States Supreme
Court is that he's entitled to an expert

312
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,850
witness and an opinion
by Thurgood Marshall.

313
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,271
Uh,

314
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:44,850
the Supreme Court said
that he is entitled,

315
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,920
or that he has to have an adequate
opportunity to present his defense fairly,

316
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:50,480
uh,

317
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,480
within the adversary system using what
Justice Marshall characterized as the

318
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:56,610
basic tools,

319
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,511
uh,

320
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:57,960
of,

321
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,350
uh,

322
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,183
a defense.

323
00:10:59,460 --> 00:10:59,761
Uh,

324
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:03,150
the court bounces three factors in
this opinion by Justice Marshall.

325
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,760
Uh,

326
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,280
the private interest aches,

327
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,114
interest,

328
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,380
obviously he has a compelling need
because he can't present it a fence and he

329
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:14,550
can't put on any evidence on future
dangerousness unless he has an expert.

330
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,380
So his need pretty,

331
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,303
pretty clear.

332
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,790
Uh,

333
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:22,530
the state's interest and Justice
Marshall rejects the notion that does,

334
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:27,531
is too expensive for the state to provide
a mental health expert for a state

335
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,300
could provide mental health experts,

336
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:30,690
uh,

337
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,800
for the prosecution.

338
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:32,521
Uh,

339
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:35,700
and it said the state has no
interest in this strategic advantage,

340
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:36,390
uh,

341
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,330
by denying somebody
the evidence they need,

342
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:39,930
uh,

343
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,820
to contest the issues in the case.

344
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,570
Uh,

345
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,403
so,

346
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,130
uh,

347
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,980
basically says finally
the public interest,

348
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,500
which is also kind of a state interest,

349
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,341
uh,

350
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:51,000
that,

351
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,451
uh,

352
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:51,781
the,

353
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:52,080
the,

354
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,510
the state has an interest in these
issues being adequately litigated.

355
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,960
A and being reliably determined.

356
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,183
Uh,

357
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,390
Justice Marshall points out most states
provides psychiatrists or mental health

358
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:09,391
experts and in cases that there
is an issue of or a likelihood,

359
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:10,841
uh,

360
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:11,180
of,

361
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:11,520
uh,

362
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,670
uh,

363
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,430
inaccurate resolution,

364
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,030
uh,

365
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:20,170
in these cases that psychiatry
is not an exact science,

366
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:20,710
uh,

367
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,580
and therefore,

368
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,623
uh,

369
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:28,140
that ache is entitled to have evidence
to present on his side of the question is

370
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:29,620
basically it's a,

371
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,440
it's a descendant of
Griffin versus Illinois.

372
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,400
The case in which the Supreme Court
said that the two people from Illinois,

373
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,850
we're entitled to a transcript
for their appeal here.

374
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:42,700
The court much more realized
upon the due process clause.

375
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:46,240
While it does rely on the due process
clause and not equal protection,

376
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,171
but says,

377
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:49,030
as a matter of fundamental fairness,

378
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,890
the defense is entitled,

379
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,490
uh,

380
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,720
to present,

381
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,040
uh,

382
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,650
expert evidence in the
state has to pay for it.

383
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,710
But only in these situations
where it's a significant factor.

384
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:00,820
In Nick's case,

385
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,800
obviously it was a significant factor at
the guilt phase and sanity was the only

386
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:06,634
issue.

387
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,760
It was a significant factor
at the sentencing phase
where future dangerousness

388
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,481
was.

389
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:18,481
The only issue of course says there's
no right of the defense to select the

390
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:19,270
expert.

391
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,480
Of course the prosecutor selects the
experts that are going to testify for the

392
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:23,320
prosecution.

393
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,890
The right recognized an ache is basically
just simply a right of a defendant

394
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,570
through his lawyer to go to the court
and ask for an expert and the court can

395
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:38,380
appoint a whatever expert
the judge wants to a point.

396
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,560
As a practical matter,

397
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,450
most of the time the defense is
going to go to the judge and say,

398
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:45,490
this is the particular expert I need.

399
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:50,350
I needed a neurologist because this issue
is presented or I need a psychologist

400
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:51,910
because we need to do testing.

401
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,400
The need has to be set out.

402
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:55,360
Uh,

403
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,610
but one competent expert is all,

404
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,040
at least the constitution titles you to,

405
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,000
uh,

406
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,850
the expert can assist in
preparing the defense.

407
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,020
That is the defense may need an
expert to just simply look at what the

408
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,840
prosecution's expert is set and,

409
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,560
uh,

410
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,000
help the defense decide.

411
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,040
Is this something we can contest?

412
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:15,670
Uh,

413
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,710
perhaps after consulting with an expert,

414
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,180
the defense will conclude
that the prosecution is
right or the export is right,

415
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:22,871
uh,

416
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:24,670
and concede the point on the other hand,

417
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:28,540
it may be something that can be
contested and aix case clearly.

418
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,021
Uh,

419
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:32,470
the question of his sanity and the
question of future dangerousness were

420
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,090
probably subject to,

421
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,780
uh,

422
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,390
being,

423
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:35,710
uh,

424
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,543
challenged.

425
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:36,851
Uh,

426
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:41,800
Chief Justice Burger concurring says this
is limited just to a depth pony cases

427
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:43,150
and just the mental health experts.

428
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:43,871
But as a,

429
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:44,201
again,

430
00:14:44,201 --> 00:14:45,400
as a practical matter,

431
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,530
courts all over the country,

432
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:51,010
state courts as well as
federal courts have recognized,

433
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,040
uh,

434
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,030
there is a need for funds for
all sorts of expert assistance.

435
00:14:56,031 --> 00:15:00,170
It may be ballistics in a case where
there's a question about where the bullet

436
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:00,860
came from,

437
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,450
whose gun was it fired.

438
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:02,931
Uh,

439
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:07,931
it may be a bite marks in a case where
the state is putting forward that very

440
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:09,350
controversial,

441
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:09,831
uh,

442
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:10,311
evidence,

443
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:11,121
whatever the facts,

444
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:13,460
but it has to be a significant factor.

445
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,130
If it's not a significant
factor in the case,

446
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,110
then the court is probably not going
to be required to provide the expert

447
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:21,944
assistance,

448
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,400
uh,

449
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,360
but where it is,

450
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:23,870
uh,

451
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,970
where it's critical as it was an aix case,

452
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:26,541
uh,

453
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,830
then there's going to be,

454
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:28,310
uh,

455
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,590
the trial judge should order funding.

456
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,810
They're always going to be questions
far more than we can get into.

457
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:37,850
And in this brief session about
the adequacy of the funding,

458
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:38,480
uh,

459
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,100
often one sexpert start examining
a records and a defendant,

460
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:45,230
there may be a need to
do additional testing.

461
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:46,850
There may be a need for additional,

462
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,661
uh,

463
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:49,190
other experts to come in.

464
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,600
Uh,

465
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,180
all of those are issues that are going
to come up in cases from time to time.

466
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:53,870
Uh,

467
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,470
and the judges are going to decide these
as they come in and they're going to be

468
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:58,550
subject to appeal.

469
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,530
Very often the question on appeal is
going to be whether the defense made a

470
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:07,550
sufficient showing of neat and
are the words the defense shows.

471
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,830
This was a critical witness that
we had to have for our defense.

472
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:13,580
Uh,

473
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,300
finally,

474
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:19,300
generally an ache itself indicates
that this has to be made x party.

475
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,811
That is,

476
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:21,351
in other words,

477
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:23,180
just to the judge from the defense,

478
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:26,840
the prosecution is not involved and
the reasons for that are twofold.

479
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,033
One,

480
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,100
obviously a person of means a person
who could afford his or her own expert,

481
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:33,891
uh,

482
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:38,670
would not be required to reveal
who they were retaining and why,

483
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,140
uh,

484
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,100
to the prosecution.

485
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,180
The only reason that a poor person must
do it is because they're applying to the

486
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:44,890
court,

487
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,180
uh,

488
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,013
for the funding.

489
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:46,641
Uh,

490
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:51,641
the second reason is that often in order
to meet this very stringent standard of

491
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:53,300
showing of need,

492
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,081
uh,

493
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,810
the defense is going to
have to reveal to the judge,

494
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,590
uh,

495
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,090
communications with the client,

496
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:01,790
privileged communications
between attorney and client.

497
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,590
A is going to have to use a,

498
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:05,240
a reveal some of the work product,

499
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:05,760
uh,

500
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,770
that the lawyer has done.

501
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:10,820
These are the things that
normally are not ever made public.

502
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,451
Uh,

503
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:14,210
and so it would be very
prejudicial to the defendant,

504
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,960
uh,

505
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,020
if that information were
revealed to the prosecution,

506
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,890
the prosecution,

507
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:19,670
uh,

508
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,430
may at some point if the
expert is going to be used,

509
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,680
receive a report from the expert,

510
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,370
uh,

511
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,110
but as a general matter,

512
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,690
the basis for getting the expert,

513
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,140
uh,

514
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,930
is not going to be revealed
to the prosecution.

515
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:36,380
So this protects the poor
person in that situation.

516
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,633
Um,

517
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,960
let's talk for just a moment about
where and when people have a right to a

518
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:42,794
lawyer.

519
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,251
Uh,

520
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:46,880
we have talked about the right to
a lawyer at trial sixth amendment.

521
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:51,480
The constitution of the United States
says that every person accused of a crime

522
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:52,830
is entitled to a trial.

523
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:57,450
And the assistance of counsel at that
trial and the supreme court basically said

524
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,540
anytime a,

525
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,700
there's a loss of liberty,

526
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,271
uh,

527
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:03,540
there's a right to a lawyer and certainly
in a death penalty case where there's

528
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,890
a loss of life,

529
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,970
um,

530
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,550
there is a right to a lawyer.

531
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,773
Um,

532
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,670
but then the question becomes,

533
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,700
are you entitled to a
lawyer for your appeals?

534
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,840
Uh,

535
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,630
in,

536
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:16,890
uh,

537
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,510
the sixth amendment only applies to trials
the same day the court decided Gideon

538
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:22,440
versus Wainwright.

539
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,190
Uh,

540
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,080
the case that held that a poor person
accused of crime in a state court was

541
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:32,250
entitled to a lawyer at
State expense to defend them.

542
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:37,170
The court handed down a decision in a
case called Douglas Versus California in

543
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:42,171
which the court held that a person was
entitled to a lawyer for one appeal

544
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,130
and it base that not of course
on the right to counsel,

545
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:48,540
which only applies to trial,

546
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,660
but based on the case of
Griffin versus Illinois,

547
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,900
the case that had said there can be no
equal protection equal justice when the

548
00:18:57,301 --> 00:19:01,470
kind of justice a person gets depends
upon the amount of money he or she has.

549
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,870
The court repeated that phrase,

550
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,830
uh,

551
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,190
later.

552
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,330
Nate versus Oklahoma.

553
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,040
We don't see that language again.

554
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:11,010
We only see the due
process part of Griffin.

555
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:11,640
Uh,

556
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,490
but later the court
decides in another case,

557
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:16,800
Ross versus Moffitt out of North Carolina,

558
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,550
that while a poor person has a
right to a lawyer for one appeal,

559
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,280
that in a state where
there's a second appeal,

560
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,960
let's say there's an intermediate
appellate court in the state and then an

561
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:29,610
appeal to the state Supreme Court.

562
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,031
No,

563
00:19:30,031 --> 00:19:30,864
right to a lawyer.

564
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,580
Almost every state provides
lawyers at that point.

565
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,470
And remember estates can always do more
than what the constitution requires.

566
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,480
But Alabama for example,

567
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:47,160
does not provide a lawyer to seek review
in the Alabama Supreme Court only for

568
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:49,950
the first appeal to the Alabama
Court of criminal appeals,

569
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,210
even in death penalty cases.

570
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,200
Uh,

571
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,900
once the case has been
decided by the state courts,

572
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:58,590
either at the intermediate quarter
by the State Supreme Court,

573
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,910
a person can petition the United States
Supreme Court to review the case.

574
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,710
But there's no right to a lawyer for that.

575
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,290
So a poor person,

576
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:07,860
uh,

577
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,860
who's convicted and sentenced is going
to be dependent upon some volunteer

578
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:18,270
lawyer or perhaps if the state has a
public defender system or a capital

579
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:18,900
defender,

580
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,470
part of its role will be to represent
people before the United States Supreme

581
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:22,950
Court.

582
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,880
But in some states,

583
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,080
that's not the case.

584
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:30,230
But basically the constitution says
right to a lawyer at trial and one appeal

585
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,990
after the case is decided on appeal,

586
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:39,230
a person can file a petition for writ
of Habeas Corpus or file under whatever

587
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,510
vehicle the state provides,

588
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,320
uh,

589
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,380
for uh,

590
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,820
post conviction review where issues
like ineffective assistance of counsel,

591
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,590
jury misconduct,

592
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,310
uh,

593
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:56,310
the prosecution's failure to re
to disclose exculpatory evidence.

594
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:01,380
Those kinds of issues can be litigated
in a separate action because you may not

595
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:06,750
know about the prosecution's failure to
disclose exculpatory evidence and until

596
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,523
you become aware of it,

597
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,060
I went to the Lord becomes aware of it.

598
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:10,870
Uh,

599
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,870
normally ineffective assistance of counsel
can only be raised in post conviction

600
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:20,530
because obviously a person that's
defending a case can't raise their own

601
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:21,340
ineffectiveness.

602
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,410
They're trying to do
the best job they can,

603
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,570
but someone later may decide that the
lawyer was not competent and that in fact

604
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:30,490
the person was denied a fair trial.

605
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,100
Uh,

606
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,680
the sixth amendment right to counsel,

607
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,060
but no right to a lawyer
even in death penalty cases,

608
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:36,820
uh,

609
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,620
the court held sometime ago.

610
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:39,821
No.

611
00:21:39,821 --> 00:21:40,151
Right.

612
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:42,970
For the average non death case,

613
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,640
no right to a lawyer for
this stage of the process.

614
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,460
And then in Murray versus Jaron Tonto,

615
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,593
even though,

616
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,460
and Tonto makes the argument,

617
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,450
this is definitely case
my life is at stake.

618
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:00,730
It's complex law and there's a very short
timeframe because I have an execution

619
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:05,731
date and I need to get into court in
order to file for a stay of execution.

620
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,490
Supreme Court says it doesn't matter,

621
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,051
it matters,

622
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:14,080
but it doesn't matter in
terms of a right to counsel,

623
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:14,741
uh,

624
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:16,720
that basically what Virginia was doing,

625
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:17,860
which was providing,

626
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,370
uh,

627
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,180
lawyers at the prisons to give advice
to people so they could follow their own

628
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:23,014
pleadings,

629
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:23,590
uh,

630
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,350
which of course it's totally
unrealistic in a capital case,

631
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:26,980
uh,

632
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,670
but that,

633
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,960
that was adequate.

634
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:29,561
Uh,

635
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:33,550
Justice Kennedy and a concurring opinion
also pointed out that in depth pony

636
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:33,941
cases,

637
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:38,941
people usually get lawyers from either
volunteer lawyers from law firms are

638
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:40,900
public interest organizations,

639
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,470
uh,

640
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,520
that represent them.

641
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,090
Uh,

642
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:47,770
some states do provide
lawyers either by providing a,

643
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,300
uh,

644
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,290
an organization,

645
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,120
a program that represents people,

646
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:52,750
uh,

647
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,430
in the post conviction process.

648
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:54,910
Uh,

649
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,990
but many do not.

650
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:56,651
Uh,

651
00:22:56,651 --> 00:22:57,820
and as a result,

652
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,540
uh,

653
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:03,540
people may be dependent upon a volunteer
lawyer to represent them at that stage.

654
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:04,990
Uh,

655
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,200
but basically a person
who's not synced to death,

656
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,903
uh,

657
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,420
probably has very little
ability to poor person.

658
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,531
Of course,

659
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:18,400
a person to means can hire a lawyer and
take advantage of the post conviction

660
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:19,390
review process.

661
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,720
But a poor person generally once their
case is affirmed on direct appeal,

662
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,150
unlikely that they're going to be
able to find a lawyer and raise a post

663
00:23:29,151 --> 00:23:29,984
conviction.

664
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,860
A challenge to their conviction,

665
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,970
uh,

666
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,530
will cause they're not
entitled to a lawyer.

667
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:37,240
The state may not provide a lawyer.

668
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:37,810
Uh,

669
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,640
and there's a time limit.

670
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:40,474
There's a deadline,

671
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:40,900
uh,

672
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,850
which is going to vary
from state to state,

673
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:44,440
but can be as short as six months.

674
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:45,800
And as long two years.

675
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,010
But most people who are convicted and
particularly poor people do not have the

676
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,820
legal knowledge,

677
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,450
uh,

678
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,310
to raise these claims.

679
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,263
Finally,

680
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:56,601
uh,

681
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,380
every person sends to death finally has
an opportunity to present their case to

682
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:01,310
the federal courts,

683
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,330
um,

684
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,400
by seeking habeas corpus relief.

685
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,650
This final stage of the process,

686
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,753
uh,

687
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,920
the congress in adopting the federal
death penalty law provided that in capital

688
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:15,524
cases,

689
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,030
the federal courts can provide lawyers
to people facing the death Palette.

690
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:25,630
Some federal public defender offices have
capital Habeas units that is a part of

691
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:32,030
their office and specialized lawyers
who specialize in representing people at

692
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:33,320
this stage of the process.

693
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:33,891
Uh,

694
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:34,521
interestingly,

695
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:35,031
Texas,

696
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:40,031
the of the state that is executed over
well over 500 people has the most death

697
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:43,910
sentences of any state in
terms of carrying them out.

698
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,610
Uh,

699
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,500
does not have a capital Habeas unit
in any of the offices at the time.

700
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,131
Uh,

701
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:49,611
that,

702
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:50,110
uh,

703
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,200
that I'm talking.

704
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,071
Uh,

705
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:52,790
and uh,

706
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,900
but other places do,

707
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:54,410
uh,

708
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,243
Philadelphia,

709
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,170
Atlanta,

710
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:56,450
uh,

711
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,310
some and other places do not,

712
00:24:58,311 --> 00:24:58,870
but,

713
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:59,000
uh,

714
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,890
the court can also appoint a lawyer.

715
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,371
Uh,

716
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:06,350
but generally the issues that are going
to be raised in the federal system are

717
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:10,310
going to be issues that should have
been raised as well in the state post

718
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:11,420
conviction process.

719
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,250
So hopefully,

720
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:13,880
uh,

721
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,570
the person has a lawyer
who's raised those issues.

722
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,600
They're presented the evidence because
the federal courts are going to look

723
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:22,400
pretty much at the record,

724
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,110
uh,

725
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,860
of what has been developed,

726
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:25,430
uh,

727
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,480
in the state courts.

728
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:27,643
So,

729
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:28,071
uh,

730
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:28,431
again,

731
00:25:28,431 --> 00:25:29,600
non capital cases,

732
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:33,170
probably no lawyer for any of these steps,

733
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,400
capital cases,

734
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,050
it's going to depend on the state,

735
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:39,080
but only a constitutional
right to a lawyer,

736
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:41,090
a trial and one appeal.

737
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,290
And then whether or not their lawyers
at these other stages a statutory right

738
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,850
when they get to federal court.

739
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,180
But you've got this state
proceeding in between here.

740
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,550
There's a lot of variation
from state to state.

741
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:56,090
A and some states have done a very
good job of providing lawyers,

742
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:56,810
uh,

743
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:59,810
for people in post conviction
and other states like Alabama,

744
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:04,550
which was sort of called out by Justice
Ginsburg and maples versus Thomas and

745
00:26:04,551 --> 00:26:05,480
Supreme Court opinion,

746
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,510
have really done almost nothing
at all to provide lawyers.

747
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:08,960
And,

748
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,141
uh,

749
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:10,610
the post conviction process.

750
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,010
So there's a great variance
from place to place,

751
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,140
but the lawyer,

752
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,000
the qualifications,

753
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:17,460
a little lawyer,

754
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,450
the resources lawyer,

755
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,480
all these things are absolutely critical,

756
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:21,110
uh,

757
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:25,260
to the review of death sentences and
the question of whether somebody is

758
00:26:25,261 --> 00:26:26,094
sentenced to death,

759
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:26,620
uh,

760
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,290
but because of the crime they committed
and the circumstances of the crime and

761
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:34,010
the factors about the person or
whether sentenced to death though,

762
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,100
cause they had the misfortune of
being assigned the worst lawyer.

763
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,080
Yeah.
