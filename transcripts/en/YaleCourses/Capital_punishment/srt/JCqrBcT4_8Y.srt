1
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,700
Let's spend just a few minutes
talking about clemency.

2
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,990
Clemency is the power which the president,

3
00:00:17,991 --> 00:00:20,130
United States has governors have.

4
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:21,000
And some states,

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,193
pardon?

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:22,821
Pardon?

7
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:27,821
And parole boards have to
commute or preve or forgive a,

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,210
uh,

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,240
a crime in a particular case.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,230
Uh,

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,500
normally not subject to judicial review.

12
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,250
Important.

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,130
Just to make a couple
of distinctions here,

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,263
pardon,

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,310
is to forgive a person completely,

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:44,700
uh,

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,451
for the sentence.

18
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:47,970
They're no longer under any judicial,

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:48,880
uh,

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,400
comp,

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:49,770
you know,

22
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,610
supervision,

23
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,061
uh,

24
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:51,580
whatever.

25
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,370
They're no longer being
punished for their crime.

26
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,060
Uh,

27
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,790
clemency is reducing the crime.

28
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:57,541
For example,

29
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:02,250
what comes up most often in capital cases
is that the governor or the pardon and

30
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:02,851
parole board,

31
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:05,430
whoever has the authority
in that particular state,

32
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,090
uh,

33
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,730
Ken Commute the death
sentence to life imprisonment.

34
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,060
So the person is still subject to spending
life in prison or spending a certain

35
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:16,230
number of years in prison.

36
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:16,740
Uh,

37
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,820
but not the death sentence.

38
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,040
Any sentence can always be commuted
to a shorter sentence to time served.

39
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,731
For example,

40
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:25,530
in a non capital case,

41
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:31,050
a reprieve is when the governor or
whoever has the authority just simply

42
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,530
temporarily halts and execution perhaps
to get more information or to have time,

43
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,470
uh,

44
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,440
to uh,

45
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,950
consider some factors
or consult some people,

46
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,341
uh,

47
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:42,810
with regard to the decision.

48
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,190
And that happens not very often,

49
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:45,300
but from time to time.

50
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:45,751
Now,

51
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:49,920
these are not to in any way
be confused with parole.

52
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,461
Uh,

53
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:53,610
which means that a person
who sends a serving a prison,

54
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:55,770
sins is released on parole.

55
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,260
They're still under sends,

56
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,040
they can be revoked and brought back,

57
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,050
or a person who's on probation,

58
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:01,890
uh,

59
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,250
who is just basically allowed to
serve their sentence in the community.

60
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,061
Uh,

61
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:08,340
but very often at the end of the process,

62
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:12,720
whether it's a person in the federal
system who will apply to the president of

63
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,590
United States,

64
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,161
uh,

65
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:15,960
for clemency or,

66
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,291
uh,

67
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:20,010
and one federal death case was
commuted by President Bill Clinton.

68
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,581
Uh,

69
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:25,581
Ronald Chandler's Destin's was commuted
from death to life imprisonment or more

70
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,480
likely in the states.

71
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,170
Uh,

72
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,170
there'll be an appeal to the
governor for a clemency in a case.

73
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,840
A historically clemency has been
given more often than it is today,

74
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:41,640
although it is given
from time to time today.

75
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,220
Uh,

76
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,200
Edmond Brown,

77
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:48,201
who was the governor of California
in the late fifties and early 1960s,

78
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,480
actually wrote a book
about his experience,

79
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,110
uh,

80
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,470
in terms of handling clemency
request there in California.

81
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:57,600
It's called public justice private mercy.

82
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,471
Uh,

83
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:01,420
and he talks about the decisions he made,

84
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:03,430
the considerations that went into them.

85
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,060
Uh,

86
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,650
he granted 23,

87
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:06,581
uh,

88
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:08,800
and he denied 36,

89
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,600
so 36 people were executed.

90
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,150
23 people were granted clemency.

91
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:18,151
That's a much higher rate of granting
clemency than we see in any state today.

92
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:20,890
Uh,

93
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,730
so far,

94
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,420
uh,

95
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,380
with the death penalty,

96
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:24,214
we've had,

97
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,180
uh,

98
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,590
at least at the end of 2020 13,

99
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,820
uh,

100
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,750
we had had,

101
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,561
uh,

102
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:37,561
about 1300 death sentences carried
out in the United States and 273 ca

103
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,490
mutations.

104
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,700
But several of those
commutations are a large number,

105
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,361
uh,

106
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:45,580
were accounted for by a,

107
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,463
a very,

108
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,111
you know,

109
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:48,010
a few governors,

110
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:48,820
uh,

111
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,610
modern practices in for Texas for example,

112
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,391
uh,

113
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,950
there's almost no clemency for,

114
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,230
there's no meaningful clemency process.

115
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:59,650
There's a huge board of 18
people that never meets,

116
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,480
uh,

117
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,970
that denies in virtually every case.

118
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:06,850
The governor doesn't have as
much power as most people think.

119
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:07,684
In Texas.

120
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,650
The governor cannot commute
a death sentence unless the
pardon and parole board,

121
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,340
uh,

122
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,960
recommends the governor can grant
reprieves that is temporarily halt an

123
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:17,794
execution.

124
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:18,430
Uh,

125
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,920
but the real power is with the board,

126
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,160
which is not inclined
to commute sentences.

127
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,270
Uh,

128
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,050
the most,

129
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,440
uh,

130
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,020
people commuted and certainly at one time,

131
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:29,510
uh,

132
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,570
was in Illinois by Governor George Ryan.

133
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,140
Uh,

134
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,861
Governor Ryan,

135
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:35,740
who had been a supporter of the death
pony and voted for it when he was a

136
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:38,530
Republican member of
the state legislature,

137
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,221
uh,

138
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:40,780
after becoming governor.

139
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,200
And after seeing a number of
people exonerated sometimes
by journalism students

140
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:48,490
at Northwestern University,

141
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,570
uh,

142
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,380
begin to have grave concerns about
the death penalty in Illinois.

143
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,070
Uh,

144
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,230
he appointed a commission
that looked into it,

145
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,070
found that there were a number of problems
with the death penalty that a number

146
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:03,640
of people who were innocent,

147
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,091
uh,

148
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:04,960
at the time,

149
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,063
uh,

150
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,020
Anthony Porter was exonerated not
long after Governor Ryan took office.

151
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:14,500
There had been 13 people
exonerated and only 12 executed.

152
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:17,800
So the percentages weren't very
good in terms of Illinois stuff.

153
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:22,150
Polly governor Ryan became convinced
that for more people on death row were

154
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:22,571
innocent,

155
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,610
he pardoned those people.

156
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,181
Uh,

157
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:28,420
and then in 2003,

158
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,520
he commuted the entire death row,

159
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:32,290
167 people,

160
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,430
uh,

161
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,200
from the death pony,

162
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,930
two sentences in prison.

163
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,850
So that was one of the,

164
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,910
uh,

165
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,240
as the largest number of
people to leave death row,

166
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,900
except for when the Supreme Court decided
the case of Furman versus Georgia,

167
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:47,830
which resulted in,

168
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:48,340
uh,

169
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,450
in all the states,

170
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:50,290
basically,

171
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,423
uh,

172
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,280
vacating the death sentences and going to,

173
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,050
to life imprisonment on those cases.

174
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,673
Uh,

175
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,710
the extent to which the courts could
get into this was challenged in,

176
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:01,040
um,

177
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,520
uh,

178
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,120
Ohio adult parole
authority versus Woodard.

179
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,600
A case that went to the Supreme Court in
1997 and the argument was how much due

180
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:12,800
process,

181
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,970
how much fairness,

182
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:18,971
what procedures is a person entitled
to a that's going to have clemency.

183
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,530
And it was sort of started by the fact
that the board and Ohio was going to

184
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:28,430
interview Woodard and
what it was complaining.

185
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,060
Uh,

186
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,721
first of all,

187
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:29,841
it,

188
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:31,220
it was too short a notice.

189
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:32,750
There wasn't time to prepare,

190
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,883
uh,

191
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,170
wanted to have a lawyer there,

192
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:38,060
but board wouldn't allow that.

193
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:38,720
Uh,

194
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,170
and then it could make a
statement to the board,

195
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:44,570
but then there was some concern
with that would be used for,

196
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,370
although at this point of the process,

197
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,330
um,

198
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,163
probably,

199
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:48,770
uh,

200
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,210
Megan statement to the board is in
an effort to convince it is probably

201
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:54,800
something most people would do.

202
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,731
A,

203
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:56,600
at any rate,

204
00:06:56,601 --> 00:07:00,080
the Supreme Court of the United States
said that there's no substantive

205
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:01,550
expectation of clemency.

206
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:05,900
Clemency is an act of grace by the
executive according to the court,

207
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:06,621
uh,

208
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:08,840
is not part of determining
guilt or innocence.

209
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,410
Uh,

210
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,990
it's committed to the
authority of the executive.

211
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:12,801
Uh,

212
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:15,800
and there's no fifth amendment
right to remain silent.

213
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:18,050
I guess if a person doesn't
want to talk to the board,

214
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:18,540
uh,

215
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,520
they don't have to.

216
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,060
Uh,

217
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,740
but on the eve of execution,

218
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,913
um,

219
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,780
maybe more important to talk to the
board then to exercise one's a fifth

220
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:27,620
amendment rights.

221
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,743
Uh,

222
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,460
justice O'Connor concurring,

223
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:31,970
uh,

224
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,970
she said the protections for someone
in the clemency process are minimal,

225
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,890
but there are some,

226
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:40,341
she said,

227
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:40,971
for example,

228
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:41,421
if a,

229
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:46,100
they just flipped a coin and decided
who got clemency or who not based on,

230
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,810
uh,

231
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,460
how the coin flip came out.

232
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:53,990
Or if some people were just arbitrarily
denied any clemency process at all,

233
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,810
that might be a due process concern.

234
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,680
Uh,

235
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,870
justice Stevens,

236
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,630
uh,

237
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:03,920
took the position that there were
particular guarantees to a person,

238
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,310
uh,

239
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,350
facing clemency for a fair process.

240
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:06,831
Uh,

241
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:08,510
he pointed out that appeal,

242
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,040
it always surprises people,

243
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,530
but there's no right to appeal a,

244
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,010
every state provides for an appeal and
the federal government provides for

245
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:16,730
appeals.

246
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,690
And the Supreme Court has held that
when something is a universal practice,

247
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:23,390
such as that you have a right to a lawyer,

248
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:24,440
transcripts,

249
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:24,810
all,

250
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,990
all of the necessary,

251
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:29,510
all the things necessary
to handle an appeal.

252
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,021
He said,

253
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:31,190
why is this any different?

254
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:31,940
Uh,

255
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,620
basically the federal government and
the states all provide for some clemency

256
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:37,454
process.

257
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,520
And so there ought to be
some sort of protections,

258
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,470
maybe minimal,

259
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:43,790
but some protections,

260
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,300
uh,

261
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,133
for people,

262
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,531
uh,

263
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:46,580
in the process.

264
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,460
The bottom line is that this
case is pretty much said,

265
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,100
uh,

266
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,090
this is going to be up to the governor
or up to the pardon and parole board and

267
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:54,020
states that have it.

268
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,243
Uh,

269
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,000
I should say just a few states,

270
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:58,240
Georgia being one.

271
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:58,710
Uh,

272
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,690
the governor has no authority whatsoever.

273
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,360
It's decided by a board
of pardons and parole.

274
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,980
In some other states.

275
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,880
The governor has completed 30 and
can do whatever he or she wants to,

276
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:09,631
uh,

277
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,920
and yet other states,

278
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,760
uh,

279
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,690
the board,

280
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,620
uh,

281
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,011
right,

282
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:18,510
makes a recommendation to the governor
will often interview the person who's

283
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:23,070
going to be executed or will receive
information from both the prosecution and

284
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:23,640
the,

285
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,500
the condemned persons lawyers.

286
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,190
Uh,

287
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,140
make a recommendation to the governor.

288
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:28,770
Uh,

289
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,580
some states the governor can either
accept or ignore that recommendation.

290
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,210
Uh,

291
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,270
some states the governors bound
by the recommendation if the,

292
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,250
if the board doesn't authorize it,

293
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,240
uh,

294
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,240
then the governor cramp can't grant
clemency the most extreme examples,

295
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:45,300
Pennsylvania,

296
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,570
which has a five member board,

297
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,170
uh,

298
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,170
which has to be unanimous
before the governor,

299
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:52,740
uh,

300
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,450
can,

301
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:53,850
uh,

302
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,730
commute a death sentence or a
sentence of life without parole.

303
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:57,240
Uh,

304
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,260
this was because,

305
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:58,921
uh,

306
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:02,700
when a mutation was granted
of a life sin sometime ago,

307
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,420
uh,

308
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,440
and the person,

309
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,220
uh,

310
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:05,671
three,

311
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:08,850
three to two vote of the board and the
person went out and committed other

312
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:09,684
crimes,

313
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,111
uh,

314
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:13,680
the Pennsylvania Constitution
was amended to say,

315
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,300
now the vote has to be unanimous.

316
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:15,811
So very,

317
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:16,141
very,

318
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:19,230
it's going to be very difficult
for anybody to have a commutation,

319
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,030
uh,

320
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,270
in,

321
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,020
in the state of Pennsylvania.

322
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,970
But it differs from state to state,

323
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:24,690
uh,

324
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,240
in terms of who decides and the power.

325
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:30,630
But primarily it's going to
be the executive branch is
going to be the governor.

326
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,261
Uh,

327
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:32,220
in most states,

328
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,300
uh,

329
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,350
reasons that,

330
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,320
uh,

331
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,390
governance have granted.

332
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,750
We just look at why
have some people gotten,

333
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,740
uh,

334
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,700
out on,

335
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,331
or excuse me,

336
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:43,830
had their death sentences commuted,

337
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,520
uh,

338
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,710
during the last 40 years.

339
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:47,460
Uh,

340
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,450
doubts about guilt.

341
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:50,250
It's probably one of the most compelling.

342
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,440
Sometimes the governor will say,

343
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:52,981
Ah,

344
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:55,440
I'm not convinced this person is innocent.

345
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,400
Uh,

346
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,510
but on the other hand,

347
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:59,850
I have enough doubts
about their innocence,

348
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:00,691
uh,

349
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:03,420
that I'm not going to
let them be executed.

350
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,780
A oral Washington was
such a person in Virginia,

351
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,501
uh,

352
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,550
in his case,

353
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,361
uh,

354
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:10,920
the governor of Virginia,

355
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,910
Governor Wilder,

356
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,960
uh,

357
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,960
had enough reservations about his guilt
that he commuted his sentence to life

358
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:20,880
imprisonment turned out
good thing that he did.

359
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,440
Uh,

360
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,100
because later DNA evidence proof that
Washington was completely innocent and had

361
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:30,810
absolutely nothing to do
with the murder at all.

362
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:31,830
Uh,

363
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,510
the same thing happened with governor
Taft in Ohio and Jerome Campbell's case,

364
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,111
uh,

365
00:11:37,111 --> 00:11:40,050
this wasn't a case that
turned out as clear cut.

366
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,190
Is there a Washington's,

367
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:44,730
but it was a case where
there just was not a,

368
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,740
just not enough certainty,

369
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,341
uh,

370
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:48,720
with regard to guilt.

371
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,500
And so the governor commuted the sentence
of the person's still serving life

372
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:54,334
imprisonment.

373
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:54,940
Uh,

374
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,950
but at least it's not executed.

375
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:58,870
So that if some additional information,

376
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:00,490
and in other cases like this,

377
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:03,730
if some additional information comes to
light as it did in rural Washington's

378
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:04,564
case,

379
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:04,900
uh,

380
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,770
the person will still be alive and can
get back to the rest of their lives.

381
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,000
Uh,

382
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,620
another is the role of the person,

383
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,311
uh,

384
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:13,150
in the crime.

385
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:13,900
Governor,

386
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,320
uh,

387
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,360
Kernan of Illinois granted that,

388
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:16,690
uh,

389
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,390
granted clemency in the
case of Darnell Williams,

390
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,230
uh,

391
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,220
because of that,

392
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:24,730
because of his role in the
crime compared to others.

393
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,960
Uh,

394
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,861
other factors,

395
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:31,540
sometimes his mental illness and
the person's a role in the crime.

396
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,380
Uh,

397
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,310
Michael Daniels,

398
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:34,144
again,

399
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,350
same governor,

400
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:35,771
uh,

401
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:39,460
of Indiana granted a
clemency in that case,

402
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:41,560
committed to case to life in prison.

403
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,131
Uh,

404
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:42,701
in that case,

405
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:47,110
the victim's son was supporting
a commutation of the sentence,

406
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:47,944
which probably,

407
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,023
uh,

408
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,950
certainly contributed to the governor,

409
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,400
uh,

410
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,930
making a decision about it.

411
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,590
Uh,

412
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,490
the Georgia,

413
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,660
uh,

414
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,390
board of pardon and parole,

415
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,380
uh,

416
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,880
commuted the Destin's right when he
was about to be executed of Alexander

417
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,240
Williams.

418
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,421
Uh,

419
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:06,050
this was a man who was tremendous,

420
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,990
incredibly mentally ill,

421
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:08,831
uh,

422
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:13,720
was forcibly medicated by the prison
in order to keep him manageable.

423
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:14,261
Uh,

424
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,570
he was a juvenile at
the time of his crime.

425
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:20,350
This was when it was still possible to
execute people who are juveniles at the

426
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:21,250
time of their crime.

427
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,503
Um,

428
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,583
the,

429
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,580
uh,

430
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,140
just to show how disturbed,

431
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:26,974
uh,

432
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,550
uh,

433
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,620
Alexander Williams was a,

434
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,000
after the board commuted his sentence
and he went to service life since just a

435
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:35,260
very short time after that,

436
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:39,370
he committed suicide and
ended his life that way.

437
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,241
Uh,

438
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:44,840
another reason is that some people
just ultimately the board finds a,

439
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,090
these people are,

440
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:46,840
uh,

441
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,510
not appropriate for the death pony,

442
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,291
uh,

443
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,840
for reasons that may not have
been presented to the jury,

444
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:54,190
but are now known.

445
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,770
One of those was a Willie James Hall,

446
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,341
uh,

447
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:58,180
in Georgia.

448
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:58,900
Uh,

449
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,240
he had no prior record.

450
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,170
He had good to conduct
in prison and even had a,

451
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:07,060
one of the things that is most unusual,

452
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:10,900
the prosecutor said that life imprisonment
without parole would be okay with

453
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:11,620
him.

454
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,890
So after Georgia had convicted
this man since him to death,

455
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:16,240
gone through the appellate process,

456
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:18,040
gone through all the review process,

457
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,163
um,

458
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,690
the board commutes,

459
00:14:20,691 --> 00:14:24,880
the sentenced to life imprisonment and
hall is serving life in prison instead of

460
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,590
having been executed.

461
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:27,291
Uh,

462
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:29,920
another example is gale
Owens in Tennessee.

463
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:30,610
Uh,

464
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,860
her case became quite the cause there.

465
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,460
Uh,

466
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,890
at one point she was a battered spouse,

467
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:36,520
uh,

468
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,353
who was,

469
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:37,990
uh,

470
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,860
sentenced to death.

471
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:39,694
One of the,

472
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,540
uh,

473
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,610
she hired somebody to kill her husband.

474
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,660
Uh,

475
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,780
and one thing that happened in
her case is they offered a plea,

476
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,120
which would have spared
her the death pony.

477
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,290
She wanted to take the plea,

478
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,910
but the prosecution said,

479
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:53,061
well,

480
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:54,410
only if the codefendant,

481
00:14:54,411 --> 00:14:55,340
only if the,

482
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,930
the hitman would take it.

483
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:57,670
Uh,

484
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,730
and he would not take it.

485
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,720
Uh,

486
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,720
so she was sort of drug into a capital
trial against her will and was sentenced

487
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:06,194
to death.

488
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,500
You know,

489
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,930
she was a model inmate while on death row.

490
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,590
And the governor looked at her case
and then looked at a lot of other cases

491
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:14,810
where people in similar situations,

492
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:18,380
particularly battered women
who had killed their spouses,

493
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,250
uh,

494
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,410
and concluded that the death pony was,

495
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,330
was out of line for her.

496
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,510
And ultimately a commuted her sentence,

497
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,690
not very long after her
sentence was commuted,

498
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:30,740
she was paroled,

499
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,340
uh,

500
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,720
and return to the community.

501
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:37,721
So one day she's facing execution
and not that long afterwards,

502
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,013
CCI,

503
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,870
she is actually out in the community.

504
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,131
Uh,

505
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:44,960
and then life circumstances,

506
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,740
uh,

507
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,740
mitigating evidence that maybe
it wasn't presented at trial.

508
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,460
I mean,

509
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,840
two cases of this or,

510
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,380
uh,

511
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,030
Joseph Murphy in Ohio,

512
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,020
uh,

513
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,990
who was beaten and starved
and sexually abused.

514
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:59,750
And all of these things
that happen to him,

515
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,710
uh,

516
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,200
resulted in ultimately the governor,

517
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:03,920
uh,

518
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,753
granting,

519
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,990
uh,

520
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,340
or commuting his case,

521
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:11,600
granting clemency in his case so
that he wasn't executed by Ohio.

522
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,291
Uh,

523
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,280
in Delaware.

524
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,450
Uh,

525
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,460
same reason basically for,

526
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,090
uh,

527
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,420
Robert Gaddis death
penalty being a commuted,

528
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,320
uh,

529
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,930
just the most horrific sexual abuse,

530
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,030
uh,

531
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,520
imaginable visited upon
Gaddis when he was a child.

532
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,140
There was some question
about the reliability of this
because it hadn't had come

533
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:34,010
out earlier.

534
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,210
Uh,

535
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,110
the pardon and parole board and making
their recommendation to the governor

536
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,251
said,

537
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:42,440
even if half this information is true,

538
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:43,730
uh,

539
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,220
this man shouldn't be executed.

540
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,941
Uh,

541
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:48,590
and that recommendation was,

542
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,101
uh,

543
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:50,420
accepted by the governor.

544
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,080
Uh,

545
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,913
and,

546
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,783
uh,

547
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,180
his sentence was commuted
to life in prison.

548
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:01,100
It's just a couple of other observations
that I would make about the clemency

549
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:01,934
process.

550
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,450
Uh,

551
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,051
first of all,

552
00:17:03,051 --> 00:17:04,160
in most states,

553
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,121
uh,

554
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:08,210
it's very unpredictable
and it's very political.

555
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,590
If the number,

556
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,260
if a number of executions
have been carried out,

557
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,700
then the governor may feel
like a case can be commuted,

558
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,300
uh,

559
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,040
because he's already shown how tough
he is by executing other people.

560
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,061
On the other hand,

561
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:27,920
if it's been a long time since any
[inaudible] anybody's been executed,

562
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,430
uh,

563
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,360
governor may be very reluctant to commute
a sins no matter how compelling the

564
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:33,194
case,

565
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:33,630
uh,

566
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,500
because it might create an uproar.

567
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,490
Uh,

568
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,180
so where people are in the queue to
be executed can be very important.

569
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,910
Once the governor's granted a commutation,

570
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:44,780
in one case,

571
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,910
very unlikely that,

572
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,480
that,

573
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,940
that the governor's going to grant
a Comutation in the next case.

574
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:51,960
Uh,

575
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,793
so,

576
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,460
uh,

577
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,220
those kind of political factors,

578
00:17:56,221 --> 00:17:56,491
I mean,

579
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:58,020
Edmond Brown in his book,

580
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,741
uh,

581
00:17:58,741 --> 00:17:59,574
about,

582
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,520
uh,

583
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,390
computations that he granted as
governor and talked about in one,

584
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,940
he didn't do it because he
didn't want to alienate,

585
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:06,920
uh,

586
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,090
a legislator who's vote he needed,

587
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:09,840
uh,

588
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,850
for a program that he was supporting.

589
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:12,631
Uh,

590
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:16,560
the other thing is that in places that
have part in parole boards or where

591
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:21,561
information has just submitted to the
governor in some places where there is no

592
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,900
board to make a recommendation
to the governor,

593
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,890
uh,

594
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,810
the information is just provided,

595
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,530
uh,

596
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,790
to the governor's lawyer,

597
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,170
the governor's legal counsel.

598
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,460
Uh,

599
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,200
but regardless of whether it's
provided to a board or the council,

600
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,670
at least in my experience,

601
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:39,930
most of the time,

602
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:40,801
uh,

603
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:42,840
it's sort of a star chamber proceeding.

604
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,100
Uh,

605
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,100
the person who's condemned can submit
any information and letters and all kinds

606
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:51,270
of supporting information saying,

607
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:53,910
here's why I'm entitled to parole.

608
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,260
On the other hand,

609
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,680
people who po kind
mutation on the other hand,

610
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,460
uh,

611
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,460
people who oppose commutation can
submit all sorts of letters and uh,

612
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,440
and can say all sorts of things about
the person accused the person of crimes.

613
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,760
Maybe they didn't commit,

614
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,960
but that information is not
shared with a condemned person.

615
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:21,300
So you don't know what the board or
what the governor is considering or the

616
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:22,620
governors advisors,

617
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,210
uh,

618
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,060
are considering.

619
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:24,961
Uh,

620
00:19:24,961 --> 00:19:28,140
and it may very well be that there's
information in there that's false,

621
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:29,040
that's not right,

622
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,990
but there's no opportunity to rebut it,

623
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,720
uh,

624
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,880
because you don't know what it is.

625
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,560
Uh,

626
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,460
so very different from a court process
where there's notice of what the

627
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:39,360
information is.

628
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:41,220
There's an opportunity to cross examine.

629
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:44,220
There's an opportunity
to rebut the evidence.

630
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:44,760
Uh,

631
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,040
none of that in most states.

632
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,641
Uh,

633
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:48,990
in the clemency process,

634
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:51,840
it's a very sort of closed process.

635
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:54,030
It's often a very informal process,

636
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:54,870
uh,

637
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,980
in terms of how,

638
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,640
uh,

639
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,160
the governor exercises a clemency,

640
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,500
but it's a critically important process.

641
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,770
The Supreme Court said in
Herrera Versus Collins,

642
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:05,370
uh,

643
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,300
the case in which it said there no
such thing as a free standing claim of

644
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:10,134
innocence.

645
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,710
Uh,

646
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,240
the court said this is what
a commutation powers for,

647
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:15,871
uh,

648
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:16,620
that,

649
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:16,980
uh,

650
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,410
if a person has a claim of innocence,

651
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,040
uh,

652
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,090
they can present it.

653
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,250
But of course there's no guarantee,

654
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,060
uh,

655
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,420
that the governor is going to
be receptive to that claim.

656
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,591
But as we've seen,

657
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:31,440
there may be other things that
governors are receptive to.

658
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,250
Uh,

659
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,030
it may differ from governor to governor
and one state has the governor who's

660
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,210
more compassionate and grants a
clemency and cases the next governor,

661
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,540
it's not going to do that.

662
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,610
Maybe the next governor
is a career prosecutor.

663
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,940
He doesn't want to grant
clemency any cases.

664
00:20:47,941 --> 00:20:52,560
So there are a lot of political factories
and other facts and other vagaries

665
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:57,450
that sorta go into this process of whether
or not someone receives clemency or

666
00:20:57,451 --> 00:20:58,250
not.

667
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:58,620
Uh,

668
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,250
generally this is the last decision
that's made before someone's put to death.

669
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:02,910
Uh,

670
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:07,080
this was a decision that Bill Clinton
made in the case of Ricky ray rector a,

671
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:10,140
that when he decided to
deny clemency for rector,

672
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:14,070
which of course was he was politically
compelled to do because he was on the

673
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:15,720
ballot and the New Hampshire primary,

674
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:16,883
uh,

675
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,600
that sealed the fate of Reiki rector.

676
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,840
And as a result,

677
00:21:21,841 --> 00:21:23,670
he was put to death in that case.

678
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:29,060
And generally that's the clemency
decision is going to seal the fate of most

679
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:32,020
people facing the death Polly,
