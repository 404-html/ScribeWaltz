1
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:11,491
Welcome.

2
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:15,420
I'm Steve Bright and this
is a course on how race,

3
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:16,254
poverty,

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,460
mental illness,

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,070
intellectual disability affect people
in the criminal justice system and

6
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:25,890
particularly in cases
involving the death penalty.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,280
I want to spend a little time in this
first class talking about what we're going

8
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:31,890
to cover over the course of this course.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:32,671
Uh,

10
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:36,240
and then we're going to look
some at an introductory case,

11
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:39,540
the case of a Arkansas
versus rookie rector.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,280
Then look at some historical background,

13
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:48,360
which is going to set us up for looking
at these issues as they come up,

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,410
uh,

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,280
in the future.

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,331
Let me just say it.

17
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:51,930
The first,

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,111
uh,

19
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:53,580
this class is not about,

20
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,451
uh,

21
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:59,190
the sort of philosophical questions of
whether the Moro or theological questions

22
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:02,040
of whether the death penalty
is a good idea or not.

23
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,080
Whether it's morally wrong or,

24
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:05,410
or or not a,

25
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,800
those are very worthwhile inquiries,

26
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,160
but they're not the ones we're
going to make a in this session.

27
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:11,851
Uh,

28
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:14,640
this is really going to be a class,

29
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,211
uh,

30
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:15,980
about,

31
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,410
uh,

32
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,410
the challenges of one accused of a crime
who is first poor and the consequences

33
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:26,430
of poverty is we'll be talking about is
that you have a court appointed lawyer

34
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:27,750
usually representing you,

35
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:28,261
uh,

36
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:30,450
and often deficiencies,

37
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,980
uh,

38
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,813
race,

39
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:32,281
uh,

40
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:36,150
the fact that a person is a
member of a racial minority,

41
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:36,690
uh,

42
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,140
and,

43
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:37,201
uh,

44
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:39,930
the person that is accused or a,

45
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,380
that people of a certain race
are excluded from participation.

46
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:43,890
Uh,

47
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,180
as I'll talk a little bit more,

48
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:45,750
uh,

49
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,500
later.

50
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:46,741
Uh,

51
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:47,401
and then finally,

52
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:47,881
as I said,

53
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:51,900
people who are intellectually disabled
are suffering from mental illnesses,

54
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:54,690
which present a number of
question in the context,

55
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,891
uh,

56
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:55,950
of these cases.

57
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,570
Now these issues are present
in almost all criminal cases,

58
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:05,571
but they come into particularly bright
relief for clear relief in capital cases.

59
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,810
So we're going to look at them
in the context of capital cases,

60
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:14,280
but they do have broad
applicability to all kinds of cases,

61
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,370
particularly a poor
people accused of crimes.

62
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,001
Uh,

63
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:19,230
in our legal system.

64
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,220
Uh,

65
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,200
Hugo black ones road
for the supreme court.

66
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:27,201
There can be no equal justice when the
kind of trial a person gets depends upon

67
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,670
the amount of money he or she has a,

68
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,690
but of course we know today that that of
course nothing probably counts more in

69
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:40,290
terms of the kind of justice a person
receives a than how much money they have.

70
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,380
A and in our court system today,

71
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:43,950
uh,

72
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,030
the criminal courts,

73
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:45,691
uh,

74
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:49,110
about 90% of the people
accused of crimes are poor.

75
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,191
Uh,

76
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:51,930
and the consequence of that,

77
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:52,441
uh,

78
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:57,441
as we will talk about the
major consequences having
a court appointed lawyer,

79
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:57,991
uh,

80
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:02,991
that a person who is accused of a crime
does not choose his or her lawyer,

81
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:06,340
doesn't go to the leading
criminal defense lawyer in town,

82
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:06,881
uh,

83
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:08,440
and sign them up.

84
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,890
Enormously expensive to
have a private lawyer.

85
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,330
As we see in some of these cases in
which people are defended by private

86
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:17,164
counsel,

87
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,740
uh,

88
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,760
without a lawyer.

89
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,270
Uh,

90
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,640
all of your constitute
without a competent lawyer,

91
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:22,474
I should say.

92
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,190
All of your constitutional rights,

93
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:24,760
uh,

94
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,593
mean nothing.

95
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,460
The lawyer is the person that the
client counts on to know the law,

96
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,050
to assert the law,

97
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:32,830
uh,

98
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,030
to uh,

99
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,950
and do the investigation of the case.

100
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:39,400
Investigate both the government's case
to see if there really is a prosecution

101
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:40,660
case against the person.

102
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,460
Also do an independent investigation
of a whatever facts there may be.

103
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,820
So one is completely dependent
upon the lawyer for that,

104
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:49,900
but we have this problem.

105
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,790
Why would the government,

106
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,630
uh,

107
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:57,550
that is trying to convict and execute a
person or a fine or in prison or person?

108
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,150
Why is the government going
to pay for a lawyer to defend,

109
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,060
to defeat that very purpose.

110
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,340
But because of course the states are
responsible and I should say 95% of

111
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:13,270
criminal cases are in the state courts.

112
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:15,040
We often think about the federal courts,

113
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:15,874
but most,

114
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,600
uh,

115
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,790
criminal cases are in the state courts,

116
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:23,791
meaning primarily there before elected
judges and they're handled by elected

117
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:26,440
prosecutors.

118
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:27,340
And as we'll see,

119
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,570
those kinds of political considerations
are going to come into play when a

120
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,250
person,

121
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:32,480
uh,

122
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:32,721
is,

123
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:36,490
is facing any kind of criminal charges.

124
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,623
Um,

125
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,420
uh,

126
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:38,831
finally,

127
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:39,161
of course,

128
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:40,870
poverty may have an impact,

129
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:41,590
uh,

130
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,990
on a person in many other ways.

131
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:47,020
And we'll talk about that as
well over the course of the term,

132
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:49,000
how it is that poverty,

133
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,500
someone who grows up in poverty,

134
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:53,560
who is affected by poverty
and all kinds of ways.

135
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,690
What legal significance,

136
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:56,524
if any,

137
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:56,920
uh,

138
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,590
that that may have a race.

139
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,100
Uh,

140
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,200
this is the court house in Jenkins County,

141
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,610
uh,

142
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,983
Georgia.

143
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,411
Uh,

144
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:06,460
as you can see,

145
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,060
uh,

146
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,331
it's,

147
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:07,570
uh,

148
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,630
quite a memorial to the confederacy and,

149
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,170
uh,

150
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,990
people including black people
who are called for jury duty,

151
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:14,500
uh,

152
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,640
who come as witnesses.

153
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,331
And of course,

154
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:17,051
most importantly,

155
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:18,880
those who come accused of a crime,

156
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,420
uh,

157
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,350
pass by,

158
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:20,981
uh,

159
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:21,610
this,

160
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:21,940
uh,

161
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,571
memorial.

162
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:23,530
If you're in Shreveport,

163
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,370
Louisiana,

164
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,700
you pass by a this
memorial and Keto perish.

165
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:28,534
That's the courthouse.

166
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,661
Now,

167
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,840
there's been some complaints
about this monument,

168
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:35,560
which ultimately resulted in the
confederate flag being taken down,

169
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,190
uh,

170
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,460
but still this huge
monument to the confederacy,

171
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,330
uh,

172
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,950
stands outside the courthouse where every
person coming in to do business in the

173
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:45,640
court,

174
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:45,911
uh,

175
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,340
walks past it with the
statutes of Robert E.

176
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,450
Lee and stonewall Jackson.

177
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:52,720
And other confederate heroes.

178
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,530
Uh,

179
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,400
the courts are the institutions that
have been least affected by the civil

180
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:02,810
rights movement and the
part of the country where I
have spent the last 30 years

181
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:03,920
practicing law.

182
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,300
I see a lot of changes.

183
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:05,820
Uh,

184
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,310
I see African Americans on city councils
and the state legislatures and mayor of

185
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:11,210
Atlanta of course,

186
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:12,290
and other places.

187
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,910
But when I go into the courts,

188
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,410
nothing's changed.

189
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,581
I come into the court,

190
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:17,030
the judges,

191
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,880
white people at the
prosecution table or White,

192
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,330
uh,

193
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,520
the court appointed
lawyers are usually white.

194
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,070
And even in communities that have 25,

195
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,440
30% African American populations,

196
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,790
you look in the jury box and
every one of the jurors is white.

197
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:31,420
Uh,

198
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,570
all the only person of color who's
going to be before the rail there in the

199
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:37,970
front of the courtroom is
going to be the person accused.

200
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,440
And we're going to talk about,

201
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:39,830
uh,

202
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,270
what the dynamics are.

203
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:41,751
A,

204
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:42,980
when that happens,

205
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:43,551
uh,

206
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:45,050
race influences everything.

207
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,860
Uh,

208
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,180
in the criminal justice system,

209
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:51,290
we know that a person of color is more
likely to be stopped by the police.

210
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:51,380
The,

211
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,870
so called driving while
black or driving while Brown,

212
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,411
uh,

213
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:56,150
we know that during that stop,

214
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,640
uh,

215
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,370
they're more likely to be abused.

216
00:06:58,371 --> 00:06:58,641
That is,

217
00:06:58,641 --> 00:06:59,810
they may have a gun pulled on them,

218
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:01,250
they may be put in handcuffs,

219
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:02,810
they may be thrown to the ground,

220
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:03,680
uh,

221
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,060
they're more likely to be arrested,

222
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:05,601
uh,

223
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:06,740
at the end of that stop.

224
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:08,420
And this continues all the way through,

225
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:09,254
more likely,

226
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:09,560
uh,

227
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,290
to be sent to jail instead
of put on probation in a,

228
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:12,711
in a,

229
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:14,360
in a first offender case,

230
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:14,961
uh,

231
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:19,790
and all the way through to the severity
of the sentence that is imposed.

232
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,110
I want later in this session
to look at the history,

233
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,690
uh,

234
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,360
that the criminal courts have played,

235
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,230
uh,

236
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,790
with regard to racial oppression.

237
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:29,540
Uh,

238
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,270
because this backdrop
can't just be ignored.

239
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:32,471
The,

240
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:33,440
the slavery,

241
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,040
the failure after the civil
war of the criminal courts,

242
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,000
the courts generally,

243
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:38,570
uh,

244
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,880
to provide equal protection.

245
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,880
That is to protect the freed slaves from
the Klu Klux Klan and the riders and,

246
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:46,250
and,

247
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,360
and other people,

248
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,500
uh,

249
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:48,740
uh,

250
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,700
convict leasing,

251
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,301
uh,

252
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:50,960
which,

253
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,240
uh,

254
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,360
a lot of people don't even know about,

255
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:53,810
uh,

256
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,580
but which really perpetuated slavery by
arresting people and leasing them out to

257
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:03,350
plantations and railroads and so forth
really perpetuated slavery all the way up

258
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:04,790
until about 1940,

259
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,450
uh,

260
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,500
Jim Crow Justice,

261
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:08,690
which we will talk a
little bit about later.

262
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,171
Uh,

263
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:11,480
and of course today mass incarceration,

264
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:11,940
uh,

265
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,840
all of these things have a tremendous
impact with regard to race and,

266
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:17,960
and on African Americans,

267
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:19,550
Latinos and other people.

268
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:23,360
So we want to examine how it is
that that happens in particularly,

269
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:23,850
uh,

270
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,121
in,

271
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:24,411
in,

272
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:25,430
in depth senses.

273
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:26,240
Uh,

274
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,310
how does one identify racial prejudice?

275
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:31,310
We're going to look at who
makes discretionary decisions.

276
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,150
Uh,

277
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,230
are there any limits?

278
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Are there any guidelines when a prosecutor
decides whether to seek the death

279
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:38,114
penalty or not?

280
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,070
Are there any restrictions on that?

281
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:40,490
Uh,

282
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,650
does anyone review that decision?

283
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,630
Can that one person make a decision
all by him or herself and not have it

284
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:48,290
reviewed?

285
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,810
Or is that going to be a reviewed?

286
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,180
If we find discrimination,

287
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,940
if we find people who are being
excluded from juries because of race,

288
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:57,510
uh,

289
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,130
if we find that people are being
prosecuted and race is a factor,

290
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,020
is there a remedy for it?

291
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:04,981
And the law,

292
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:07,770
we're always asking not
only what's the injury,

293
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:08,340
uh,

294
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,200
but what's the remedy for that injury
and then is the remedy adequate?

295
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,910
And one of the things we'll look at in
the class has been a number of remedies,

296
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:18,300
uh,

297
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,300
that fall far short of accomplishing
what we would hope they would,

298
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:23,970
uh,

299
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,290
with regard to race.

300
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,250
Uh,

301
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,570
we'll also talk about
mental illness and limited,

302
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:29,820
uh,

303
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,480
or,

304
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,313
uh,

305
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,230
limited intellectual functioning
or intellectual disability.

306
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,010
Uh,

307
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:40,010
largest mental institution in any
community is the local prison or jail.

308
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,480
And there are a number of issues
that will arise out of mental,

309
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,320
uh,

310
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,780
issues that come out and in,

311
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,290
in other kinds of criminal cases,

312
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:53,130
but particularly dramatically
sometimes in capital cases.

313
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:53,580
Uh,

314
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,750
is the person,

315
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,853
um,

316
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,340
uh,

317
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,620
was the person saying at
the time of the crime,

318
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:01,250
do they understand why they committed?

319
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,300
Are they competent for trial?

320
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:06,660
Can they work with a lawyer
and participate in trial?

321
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:07,110
A,

322
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,460
are they a future dangerous?

323
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:11,310
This is a reason for imposing
the death penalty in many states.

324
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:14,790
Is the person a future
danger to the community?

325
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:20,090
And we really asking there is this
person so mentally impaired that we treat

326
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:27,060
that person because we don't hold them
to the same degree of culpability that we

327
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:32,061
would hold someone who's not mentally
impaired or do we kill that person because

328
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:33,720
they're so dangerous?

329
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,710
Uh,

330
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,543
which is,

331
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,060
uh,

332
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,160
somewhat of an eye of
the beholder question.

333
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:38,550
Uh,

334
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,650
we'll see how that comes
up in death penalty cases,

335
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:41,640
mitigating factors.

336
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,990
Also a death penalty cases,

337
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:43,741
uh,

338
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:46,420
are things about the life
and back in the middle,

339
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,370
uh,

340
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:47,821
illness,

341
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,980
the mental limitations of a person,

342
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,900
something we take into account.

343
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,501
And if so,

344
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:56,820
how in deciding to sentence
competency to waive appeal,

345
00:10:56,821 --> 00:11:01,050
sometimes people who are sentenced to
death decide they don't want to appeal,

346
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,830
they give up their appeals and,

347
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:04,050
and they're executed.

348
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,410
Uh,

349
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,430
are they mentally competent
to make that decision?

350
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,121
Uh,

351
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:10,050
or uh,

352
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:10,501
should,

353
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:11,010
uh,

354
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,420
should the courts not allow that?

355
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,880
And then finally
competency to be executed.

356
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:17,520
The courts have held it before
somebody can be executed.

357
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,040
And we see this in the Ricky rector case,

358
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,450
which we'll talk about in a moment.

359
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,051
Uh,

360
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:27,051
the question of does that person
understand why they're being put to death?

361
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,081
Uh,

362
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:31,740
and so all of these
issues will be taking up.

363
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,790
Uh,

364
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,930
and then we have the question,

365
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:35,130
even those without,

366
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,990
and this particularly in capital cases,

367
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:42,020
even those people without a diagnosable
melanomas maybe profoundly damaged,

368
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,790
uh,

369
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,540
in terms of,

370
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:45,691
uh,

371
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:49,140
of their view of the world and so forth
because they'd been physically abused,

372
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:49,951
sexually abused,

373
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:51,150
psychologically abused.

374
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:51,984
They've lived in a,

375
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,650
uh,

376
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,550
grew up basically in a war zone,

377
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:58,570
maybe within their home
domestically because there
was so much violence maybe in

378
00:11:58,571 --> 00:11:59,500
their community,

379
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,010
uh,

380
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,600
because there was a lot of violence,

381
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,080
uh,

382
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,680
maybe a person that's been injured
even before they were born because the

383
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:06,470
mother,

384
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,670
uh,

385
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,340
ingested alcohol during the pregnancy.

386
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:10,930
And so they have fetal alcohol syndrome.

387
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,420
And so that affects the
way their brain works.

388
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:15,670
And so how does that come into play,

389
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:18,670
particularly when we come to
the question of sentencing?

390
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:19,490
Uh,

391
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,230
and then we'll talk some about what are
the challenges of representing someone,

392
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,040
uh,

393
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,330
who may have any of these
disabilities that I've talked about.

394
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,980
How do we tell their story?

395
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,060
Uh,

396
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,020
it's very complicated in these cases
and the death penalty cases because the

397
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:38,680
people of course are accused
of very serious crimes.

398
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,090
Uh,

399
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,810
this is not question like who's denied
going to school or who's denied being

400
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:46,810
able to live in a certain
place just because their race.

401
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,730
Race certainly plays a factor here.

402
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,451
And as a,

403
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:51,130
as we will see a very important factor,

404
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:54,850
but also there's always going to be
the argument this person committed.

405
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,500
And particularly in the capital cases,

406
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,660
this person committed a heinous crime,

407
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,160
a terrible crime.

408
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:00,751
Uh,

409
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:02,740
and so often these cases,

410
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,180
and one of the challenges these cases
is so often they're caught up in the

411
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:08,590
passions of the moment.

412
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,371
Uh,

413
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,270
and often,

414
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,690
uh,

415
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,540
we don't function our best
when we're caught up in the,

416
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,040
in the passions of the moment.

417
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,280
And we don't always make
the sound is decisions.

418
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,533
Um,

419
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,493
so,

420
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,040
uh,

421
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,480
we'll also examine,

422
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,050
uh,

423
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,861
the death penalty,

424
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:26,260
which was declared
unconstitutional in 1982.

425
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:27,730
We'll take that up in the next session.

426
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:28,181
Uh,

427
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:29,590
but then just four years later,

428
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,660
the supreme court upheld the death toll.

429
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,140
And so we'll look at the
death penalty and what,

430
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,010
uh,

431
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,490
the court says is required to have
a constitutional death penalty.

432
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,520
What people can and cannot
be sentenced to death,

433
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:43,300
children,

434
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,100
people with intellectual disabilities.

435
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:45,880
Uh,

436
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,170
those sorts of questions.

437
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,540
And then what kind of
procedures are required,

438
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,110
uh,

439
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,310
for a death penalty case.

440
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:51,911
Uh,

441
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:53,440
and then we'll look at
the different people,

442
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,220
uh,

443
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,840
who play a role in this system,

444
00:13:55,841 --> 00:14:00,070
the prosecutor and the
discretion exercised by the
prosecutor and seeking the

445
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:03,970
death penalty and deciding whether or
not to resolve cases with plea bargains.

446
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:05,050
Most cases are,

447
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:08,080
and most death point cases are
resolved with plea bargains,

448
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,010
not with trials.

449
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,570
So we'll explore that.

450
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,991
Uh,

451
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:13,860
we're talking about the judges
and the role that judges play,

452
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:15,970
particularly judges who are elected,

453
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:16,550
uh,

454
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,380
and who have to stand for election every
four or six years and how that might

455
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:24,730
influence the way they look upon cases
and how they decide legal issues.

456
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:28,810
Because some decisions in death
penalty cases if cost judges,

457
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:29,260
uh,

458
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,160
their jobs.

459
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:30,941
Uh,

460
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:33,430
we'll look also at the
role of the defense lawyer,

461
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,211
uh,

462
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:35,044
and what,

463
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,410
uh,

464
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:39,790
how the quality of representation provided
to a poor person accused of crime.

465
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,860
The resources available to that lawyer,

466
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,000
the ability of that lawyer to mount
a defense on behalf of that person.

467
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,410
And then we'll look at the way jury's
function and other aspects of this system.

468
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,020
Uh,

469
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,480
as we,

470
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,313
as we go,

471
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,960
when we look at these legal issues,

472
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:56,450
we want to think about what law applies,

473
00:14:56,451 --> 00:15:01,220
what constitutional provision are we
talking about that we say governs this

474
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:02,270
particular issue,

475
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,210
what legal standards
that does it establish.

476
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:05,771
And,

477
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:06,031
and,

478
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:06,271
and,

479
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:06,771
and we'll,

480
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:09,260
we'll go into that with
regard to different subjects.

481
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:13,280
But basically we're asking what must
a party prove in order to prevail?

482
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:16,310
Either what must the prosecution
prove in order to prevail?

483
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:18,200
Or what must the defense
prove in order to,

484
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,580
to when it's motion,

485
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,630
uh,

486
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,050
who has the burden of proof and
what is that burden of proof,

487
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:24,801
uh,

488
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:26,570
and then what evidence is needed,

489
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:27,200
uh,

490
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,010
to,

491
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,490
uh,

492
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,323
provide,

493
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,290
uh,

494
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,510
to satisfy the burden of proof,

495
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,900
uh,

496
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,890
that has established,

497
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,430
we'll deal with this in more detail as
we deal with each of these subjects,

498
00:15:37,431 --> 00:15:41,660
but basically it gives you just some sense
of how we want to look at these legal

499
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:42,410
issues,

500
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:42,830
uh,

501
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,490
during,

502
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,420
during the course.

503
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,643
Um,

504
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,460
I want to talk just a minute
generally about sentencing,

505
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,570
uh,

506
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,230
because one of the questions that
we're going to ask in this course is,

507
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:54,890
uh,

508
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,630
what is sentencing based upon?

509
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,640
What are the objectives of sentencing
people to death or not sensing people to

510
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:02,420
death?

511
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:02,990
Uh,

512
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,590
and how important is
consistency in sentencing?

513
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,371
Uh,

514
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:09,770
if you look at the reasons
people give for sentencing,

515
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:14,771
one most primarily incapacitation
that we want to take people out of the

516
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:15,674
society,

517
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,680
lock them up so that society is protected
from any future danger sacks by that

518
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:24,530
person to Terrance both
to turn the individual,

519
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,510
which is certainly a achieved by
executing a person or putting a person in

520
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:31,850
prison without any possibility of parole.

521
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,380
But general deterrents,

522
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:35,390
a very controversial subject,

523
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,550
whether or not having the death penalty,

524
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,090
uh,

525
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,850
or other a very severe punishments,

526
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:41,360
uh,

527
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,040
has a general effect of deterring
people from committing crimes.

528
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:46,760
Uh,

529
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,331
at one point,

530
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:48,260
rehabilitation,

531
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,090
uh,

532
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,950
was seen as a major goal of sentencing.

533
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:55,700
But today we have so many people in prison
and such limited prison budgets that,

534
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,181
uh,

535
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,270
rehabilitation has fallen
far down on the list.

536
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,670
Probably much higher
should be retribution.

537
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,320
A person gets there,

538
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:04,610
just results.

539
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,250
Uh,

540
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,230
in terms of a,

541
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:07,340
you did this crime,

542
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:07,790
uh,

543
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,740
here's what you do to pay for that crime.

544
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:11,660
The others keep people off the streets,

545
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:15,860
those kind of a rounding up the homeless
people and all that other ways in which

546
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:17,720
the criminal law is used.

547
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,763
Uh,

548
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,680
in other objectives that it has.

549
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,700
Uh,

550
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,600
but then the question,

551
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,140
who decides who decides what objective
we're seeking here and how to go about

552
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:30,441
it?

553
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:31,161
Theoretically,

554
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:32,060
it's at the start,

555
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:35,780
at least it's legislators because they're
going to decide what laws to pass.

556
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:38,150
They're going to decide
what punishments to,

557
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,720
uh,

558
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,250
provide for those laws.

559
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:40,790
Uh,

560
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,630
some legislature,

561
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,261
17,

562
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,330
do not provide for the
death penalty at all.

563
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,170
Uh,

564
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:45,950
the others,

565
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,190
uh,

566
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,630
do provide for the death pony,

567
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,050
also a mandatory minimums.

568
00:17:50,051 --> 00:17:51,660
So life imprisonment without parole.

569
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:54,030
These are all sentences
of the legislature,

570
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,080
uh,

571
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,040
may adopt.

572
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,030
Uh,

573
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:02,030
the prosecutor has a great deal of
discretion in deciding which laws are we

574
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:03,684
going to enforce,

575
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,290
how rigorously are we going
to enforce those laws?

576
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,320
And we'll talk about that more
when we come to prosecution.

577
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,491
Uh,

578
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:15,240
what sentence is to seek both through
trials and through plea negotiations,

579
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:20,241
tremendous amount of power vested in the
prosecutor with regard to how cases are

580
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:21,864
resolved.

581
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,150
Uh,

582
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,190
and the judge,

583
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,890
how much discretion does the judge have?

584
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:27,000
We'll talk about judges,

585
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:27,900
as I said earlier.

586
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,501
Uh,

587
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:31,860
and then we'll talk about juries
and how juries are selected.

588
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:32,491
Uh,

589
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:36,170
and have a go about their decision making.

590
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,310
But we realize that all this,

591
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,100
that the legislature may have one purpose,

592
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:41,680
uh,

593
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,920
in passing a sentencing law,

594
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:44,311
uh,

595
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:46,620
the prosecutor may have
a different purpose,

596
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,330
uh,

597
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,970
in deciding what punishment
to seek in a case.

598
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,661
Uh,

599
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:55,380
and then the judge may have or
the jury may have yet another.

600
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,410
And so if we have all
these competing things,

601
00:18:58,411 --> 00:18:58,981
for example,

602
00:18:58,981 --> 00:19:01,230
we have a judge who
believes in rehabilitation.

603
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,820
This judge is going to be a more lenient
sentence or perhaps where's the judge

604
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:06,900
in the next courtroom,

605
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,011
uh,

606
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:10,350
is a strong believer in retribution,

607
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,900
old strong believer in
protecting the community.

608
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:17,100
So that judge is going to be much more
likely to impose a prison sentence and a

609
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:18,330
severe prison sentence.

610
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,600
We're going to see the same
thing with regard to communities.

611
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:24,540
Some communities as we
will talk about later,

612
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,080
uh,

613
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,690
much more likely to impose
the death penalty than others.

614
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,560
Uh,

615
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:28,831
and,

616
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:33,450
and much of it has to do with how
the community and the culture there,

617
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:33,840
uh,

618
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,400
sees the purpose of sentencing,

619
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:35,880
uh,

620
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,590
and how it should be dealt with,

621
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,113
um,

622
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,320
factors to consider.

623
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:45,300
What do we take into account when
we're deciding how to sentence people?

624
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,260
Uh,

625
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,940
we obviously look at the crime,

626
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,570
uh,

627
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,321
the community.

628
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,660
I don't think there's much
question about these injuries,

629
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:52,231
uh,

630
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:52,621
that,

631
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:53,190
uh,

632
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,481
are,

633
00:19:53,481 --> 00:19:54,330
are the result,

634
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,220
a injury to the person,

635
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:57,001
to the community,

636
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:58,560
the heinousness of the crime,

637
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,513
the,

638
00:19:59,560 --> 00:19:59,820
uh,

639
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,050
and then the question,

640
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,440
how much do we look to the
desires of the victims,

641
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,340
uh,

642
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,530
with regard to deciding?

643
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:10,230
And then we look at some things
with regard to the defendant,

644
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:10,481
what,

645
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:11,940
what's the defendant's prior record?

646
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:13,860
Almost always going to be accounted for.

647
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:16,020
Maybe age is going to be accounted for,

648
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:19,800
but then do we get into things
like mental limitations is,

649
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,890
I was discussing earlier a
potential for rehabilitation,

650
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,940
adjustment to prison,

651
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:29,300
a lot of controversy about what kinds
of factors are to be considered.

652
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,111
And then of course,

653
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:32,790
also the question of does race,

654
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,380
class politics,

655
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,140
other extraneous factors,

656
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:37,974
non extrovert,

657
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,900
I guess I can call extra legal factors.

658
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:43,530
Not legal reasons for imposing
a particular punishment.

659
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,990
But do they come into play as well?

660
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,030
And we'll see very often,

661
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:48,600
uh,

662
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,140
they do.
