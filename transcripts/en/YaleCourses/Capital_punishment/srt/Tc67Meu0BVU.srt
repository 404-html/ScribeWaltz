1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,230
Plea bargaining is right at the central.

2
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:14,591
In fact,

3
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:18,280
it's most of what happens in
the criminal justice system.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,870
Prosecutors offer a plea either a
reduction in the charges most often,

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:23,410
uh,

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,280
which of course has an effect on what
the sentence will be in the death penalty

7
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:27,551
area.

8
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:31,660
It's particularly important because
most death penalty cases are solved is w

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,730
talked about before one or two stages.

10
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:38,731
Either the prosecution deciding to seek
the death penalty or quite often with a

11
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:39,881
plea bargain,

12
00:00:39,881 --> 00:00:43,420
whether or not the prosecution
agrees to drop the death penalty,

13
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:48,421
that is withdraw the notice to seek
the death plenty in exchange for the

14
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:52,720
defendant pleading guilty and agreeing
to a sentence of life imprisonment

15
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:54,700
without the possibility of parole.

16
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,390
Today I want to talk about
plea bargaining in general,

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,021
uh,

18
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:00,310
in capital cases,

19
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:00,941
uh,

20
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:02,890
and a related subject,

21
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:04,660
which is the use of plea bargaining,

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,560
uh,

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,540
to gain the testimony of people,

24
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,320
maybe other people involved in the crime
or people charged with other crimes.

25
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:11,921
Uh,

26
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:13,570
the Supreme Court has said that,

27
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,111
uh,

28
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:15,950
we have a system of please,

29
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:16,450
uh,

30
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,010
not a system of trials.

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,830
A vast majority of criminal cases.

32
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,620
As I mentioned in an earlier talk,

33
00:01:23,621 --> 00:01:28,621
our resolve with plea bargains a 94%
of all cases in the state courts,

34
00:01:29,681 --> 00:01:30,221
which of course,

35
00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:34,210
that's where the overwhelming
majority of cases are handled.

36
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,390
And 97% of all convictions in the
federal courts are the result of plea

37
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:40,090
bargains,

38
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:40,923
not trials.

39
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:41,370
Uh,

40
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,101
so trouser,

41
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:44,440
fairly rare plea bargains are very common.

42
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,011
Uh,

43
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:45,880
and that's how,

44
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:46,510
uh,

45
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,800
cases are resolved.

46
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,340
Uh,

47
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,810
when a person pleads guilty,

48
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,420
uh,

49
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,070
that's it.

50
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,120
That's a conviction.

51
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:56,320
Just like if the person had gone to
trial and been convicted by a jury,

52
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,010
uh,

53
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:57,730
so,

54
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:57,970
uh,

55
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:02,710
a person's understanding of what exactly
they're doing and what exactly they're

56
00:02:02,711 --> 00:02:05,170
giving up when they enter a plea,

57
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:05,711
uh,

58
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:06,970
is critically important.

59
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,403
Uh,

60
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,030
nothing better illustrates
the power of the prosecutor,

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,781
uh,

62
00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:15,250
in the plea bargaining process.

63
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,600
In the case of Paul Hayes,

64
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,120
a case that made its way
to the Supreme Court,

65
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:19,810
uh,

66
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,100
Paul Hayes was charged,

67
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:21,520
uh,

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,080
with forging a bad check,

69
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,590
uh,

70
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,350
for $88 and 30 cents,

71
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:28,240
not the crime of the century.

72
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,140
Uh,

73
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,320
but the possible punishment
under the statute and Kentucky,

74
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:32,801
uh,

75
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:35,170
for that crime he was
prosecuted in Kentucky,

76
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:35,800
uh,

77
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,360
was two to 10 years.

78
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:37,931
Uh,

79
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:40,540
the prosecutor made a
plea offer a five years.

80
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,320
Uh,

81
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,320
but that plea offer was accompanied by a
warning that if Paul Hayes rejected the

82
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:48,004
offer,

83
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,281
uh,

84
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:51,430
the prosecutor would file
habitual offender papers.

85
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:52,780
And if he did that,

86
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,900
Paul Hayes would be subject
to life imprisonment.

87
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:56,621
Well,

88
00:02:56,621 --> 00:03:00,460
what happened is Hayes
rejects the plea offer,

89
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,270
uh,

90
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,170
goes to trial,

91
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,860
is convicted and sentenced
to life imprisonment.

92
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:06,370
Uh,

93
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,880
as a result of turning down the
plea offer and going to trial,

94
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:12,640
this is what's often
referred to as the trial tax.

95
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,301
Uh,

96
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:17,170
this is what a person
pays for going to trial.

97
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,221
In this case,

98
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:20,980
it was a license as opposed
to a sentence of five years.

99
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,550
Uh,

100
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,690
in death penalty cases,

101
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:23,740
it's a death penalty,

102
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,281
uh,

103
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:29,281
as opposed to a sentence of maybe life
imprisonment or life imprisonment without

104
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:30,070
parole.

105
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,221
Well,

106
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:35,221
this seems what happens in haze
here going from a $88 check to life

107
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:36,551
imprisonment,

108
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:40,570
it seems a extraordinarily
harsh as is this permissible?

109
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:41,680
The prosecutors had this,

110
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:41,831
uh,

111
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:42,664
ability.

112
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:42,911
Uh,

113
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:44,380
the Supreme Court said yes,

114
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,130
uh,

115
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,970
in the board and coach of versus Hayes,

116
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,560
uh,

117
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,280
which was Paul Hayes case on appeal
to the United States Supreme Court.

118
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,040
Uh,

119
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,510
the,

120
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,370
the court said the prosecutor can't
retaliate against the defendant for

121
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,260
exercising his right to trial.

122
00:03:59,530 --> 00:03:59,800
Uh,

123
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,080
but this was part of the give and take.

124
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,820
The court set a plea bargaining.

125
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:08,560
It's Sorta hard to understand what
Paul Hayes had to give or take.

126
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,790
He basically had a choice between
five years and life imprisonment,

127
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,470
but he didn't have a whole lot of,

128
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:14,920
uh,

129
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,640
a bargaining power in that
process is very simple case,

130
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,320
a very small check.

131
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:20,741
Uh,

132
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:23,950
the prosecution was going to be able
to prove its case pretty easily.

133
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,670
Uh,

134
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,480
so,

135
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,020
uh,

136
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,480
the prosecutor gave fair warning.

137
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,860
Uh,

138
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:30,723
but then,

139
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,031
uh,

140
00:04:31,031 --> 00:04:32,230
this is what happened.

141
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:32,800
Uh,

142
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,521
the court says,

143
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:33,641
well,

144
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:38,320
there can be some deference employee
offered some selectivity as long as the

145
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:43,321
plea is not sought on the basis of
some impermissible ground like race or

146
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:45,280
religion or some other,

147
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:45,820
uh,

148
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,760
totally improper and arbitrary
consideration like that.

149
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,550
Uh,

150
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,830
there were the sense in this case,

151
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:51,700
Justice Brennan,

152
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,540
uh,

153
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,141
or excuse me,

154
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:54,070
justice Blackmun,

155
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:54,490
uh,

156
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,520
joined by Justice Brennan
and Justice Marshall.

157
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,680
So this was vindictive prosecution that
basically the prosecutor was vindictive

158
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,890
and punished haze for not
taking the plea offer.

159
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:06,490
Uh,

160
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,740
they pointed to a couple of earlier cases.

161
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,310
Uh,

162
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,900
the court had had decided a one
called North Carolina versus peers,

163
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:14,440
uh,

164
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,280
in which a fellow had been successful
in getting his case reversed on appeal.

165
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,660
When the case came back,

166
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:20,980
he got a harsher sentence.

167
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,761
The court said,

168
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:24,850
you can't punish someone for
exercising their right to appeal.

169
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,540
And they'd applied that same rationale
to prosecutors in a case called

170
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,950
Blackledge versus Perry,

171
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,121
in which they said,

172
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:31,451
again,

173
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:34,060
if a case is appealed and comes back,

174
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:39,270
the prosecution can't charge
a more serious crime or
more harsh crime to punish

175
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:44,740
the defendant for exercising
his right to appeal a justice.

176
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:45,574
Blackmun.

177
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,150
Uh,

178
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,631
excuse me,

179
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:47,650
just as Powell,

180
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,350
uh,

181
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,061
descend it here,

182
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:51,130
he said that prosecutor candidly admitted,

183
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:51,611
uh,

184
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:52,540
what he was doing.

185
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,410
And in his opinion,

186
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:54,430
the issue in the case,

187
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,061
uh,

188
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:59,510
is whether a prosecutor reasonably
might have charged Hayes as an abysmal

189
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:00,740
offender from the outset.

190
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,210
This is unusual in the way the prosecutor
threatened and then brought the

191
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:10,211
habitual offender charge against Hayes
or file the habitual offender papers.

192
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,910
Normally what happens is the prosecutor's
going to charge the most serious

193
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:15,710
charge at the start of the process.

194
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,490
That is he's going to charge
as an eventual offender
and then offered to plead

195
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:20,324
the case down.

196
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,430
And this is what we see
in death penalty cases.

197
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:26,650
The prosecution notices the death poem
puts the defendant on notice that this,

198
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,490
this case will be a capital case.

199
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:30,590
The prosecution is
seeking the death penalty,

200
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,660
but then at some point between
that notice and the trial,

201
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,570
it may be that the case will be
resolved with a plea bargain,

202
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,230
uh,

203
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,050
to a sentence less than less than death.

204
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,100
Uh,

205
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,750
the court has put some restriction on
some restrictions on the plea bargaining

206
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:48,584
process,

207
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,690
although it hasn't put any on prosecutors,

208
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,561
uh,

209
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:53,750
the person who's a pleading guilty,

210
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,350
uh,

211
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,161
has got to know,

212
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:55,760
uh,

213
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,430
the,

214
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:56,630
the,

215
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,040
the charges against them.

216
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,450
Uh,

217
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,970
what the maximum punishment is that
they face if they are found guilty,

218
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,080
uh,

219
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,000
and all of the constitutional rights,

220
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,520
uh,

221
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,040
that they're giving up as a result.

222
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,320
And in case called Boykin versus Alabama,

223
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,430
the Supreme Court said a judge before
taking a plea has to take the person and

224
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:15,410
go through all of these
constitutional rights,

225
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:16,460
the right to counsel,

226
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,230
the right to a jury trial,

227
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:23,060
the right to confront witnesses that
is the right to cross examine the

228
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:24,560
prosecution's witnesses,

229
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,101
uh,

230
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:30,101
the right to compulsory process that
is the right to subpoena witnesses and

231
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:32,540
bring them into court to testify for,

232
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,080
uh,

233
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,320
the,

234
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,153
the defendant,

235
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:34,610
uh,

236
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,060
the privilege against self incrimination
and also the right to testify.

237
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,260
The defendant has a right either to
testify or not to testify and that's

238
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,400
personal to the defendant.

239
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,031
Uh,

240
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:44,990
and so they have to,

241
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,440
uh,

242
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,340
realize that a waiver of these rights,

243
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,890
uh,

244
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,723
must be,

245
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,121
uh,

246
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:51,080
on the record,

247
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:51,831
uh,

248
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:53,120
and the defendant should be,

249
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:54,290
although not always,

250
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,920
is told of the collateral
consequences such as deportation,

251
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,083
uh,

252
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,880
inability to get a license
for certain kinds of jobs,

253
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,331
uh,

254
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:04,340
in a that live in public housing.

255
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,690
A number of other things that may
be the result of a guilty plea.

256
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:12,110
That person may plead guilty
and walk out on a minor crime,

257
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:12,560
uh,

258
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,810
without going to jail or going to prison.

259
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,470
But there may be all sorts of
other consequences to that plea.

260
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,180
The person may not realize.

261
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,660
So in the ideal situation,

262
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,100
the person's going to be warned,

263
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,540
uh,

264
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,840
of all of these rights.

265
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,650
Uh,

266
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,860
also the plea must be a freely made.

267
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:33,470
It may not be a induced by threats,

268
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,101
promises,

269
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:35,330
misrepresentations,

270
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:35,961
uh,

271
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:36,980
or you know,

272
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,210
things like bribes.

273
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:38,960
Uh,

274
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,550
but it can be based,

275
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,151
uh,

276
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:44,240
on the prosecution's decision
to reduce the charges,

277
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,130
agree to a less severe sentence,

278
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,840
a withdraw the death penalty,

279
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,440
uh,

280
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,850
whatever it may be.

281
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,350
A cited in the materials as the
public broadcasting systems,

282
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,020
uh,

283
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,250
frontline documentary,

284
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:57,084
the plea,

285
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,520
which is an excellent documentary,

286
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,151
uh,

287
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:03,600
on the plea bargaining process and the
pressures that are brought to bear,

288
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,141
uh,

289
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:06,930
when a person can get out
of jail by pleading guilty,

290
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,470
uh,

291
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,020
or avoid the risk of the
death pony by pleading guilty,

292
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:10,531
uh,

293
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:11,240
or,

294
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,430
uh,

295
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,910
a much more severe punishment.

296
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,940
The trial tax that I
talked about a moment ago.

297
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,343
Um,

298
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,580
the supreme court has said that you
can plead guilty even if you claim that

299
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:24,414
you're innocent.

300
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,640
And in a case called North
Carolina versus Alfred,

301
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:28,500
the court said that,

302
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,100
uh,

303
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,300
that was acceptable.

304
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:32,550
Normally a defendant,

305
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,420
uh,

306
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,170
must,

307
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:34,920
uh,

308
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,030
waive the right to trial and all those
rights that I just described a moment

309
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:39,864
ago.

310
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,710
Uh,

311
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,730
and also,

312
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,240
uh,

313
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,080
admit their guilt.

314
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,710
Uh,

315
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,900
but the supreme court said
that an admission of guilt,

316
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,380
uh,

317
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,430
is not required,

318
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:47,980
uh,

319
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,640
as long as the defendant
knows what the choices are.

320
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,530
Uh,

321
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:56,160
he or she may decide to
enter a plea under Alfred,

322
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,240
uh,

323
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,550
because they find the pleased
in their best interest,

324
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,940
not because they're admitting their guilt.

325
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,480
Then there's also the plea
of Nolo contendere way in
which the person is saying

326
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,370
they don't contest the charges.

327
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,210
Um,

328
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,200
we've seen this a few times after people
have been sentenced to death and their

329
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:15,330
cases come back for a retrial carry.

330
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:15,961
Max Cook,

331
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:18,240
one of the people featured
in the documentary,

332
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:21,000
the plea has his death sentence reversed.

333
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,050
He comes back to trial to
retrial and the prosecution says,

334
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:25,770
Mr. Cook,

335
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,730
we'll let you go home today
if you enter a guilty plea.

336
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,660
Cook has maintained his innocence
throughout the whole process.

337
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:34,320
Uh,

338
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,290
but he's very nervous about risking
a another death pony trials.

339
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,990
So he enters an Alford plea.

340
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:40,441
He says,

341
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:41,670
I'm maintaining my innocence,

342
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:44,910
but I'm pleading guilty in
exchange for being released here.

343
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,200
He was once on death row,

344
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,880
once condemned to die.

345
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,750
Now he's being released and has lived
in the community for some period of time

346
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,584
now since,

347
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:52,800
uh,

348
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,820
since his release.

349
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,340
Uh,

350
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,320
the same thing for a man named James
Fisher who spent 26 and a half years,

351
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:58,891
uh,

352
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,630
in the custody of Oklahoma.

353
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,291
Uh,

354
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:06,270
having had two very bad lawyers at
two different capital trials and the

355
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:07,530
prosecution tells him,

356
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,430
uh,

357
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:13,430
you can have a third trial and risk going
back to death row or we will let you

358
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:14,760
go home today,

359
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,250
but you have to plead guilty.

360
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,010
Uh,

361
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,430
this gives the prosecution
some protection,

362
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,270
uh,

363
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,103
for,

364
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,590
uh,

365
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:22,851
the,

366
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:23,061
the,

367
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:25,830
the previous prosecutions that
have resulted in convictions,

368
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,870
even though in these two cases,

369
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:32,280
particularly that people may very well
not have been guilty of the crime.

370
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,833
Um,

371
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,130
as we discussed when we were talking
about prosecutorial discretion,

372
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,520
a plea practices vary a
great deal among prosecutors.

373
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,161
Uh,

374
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,960
the state prosecutors are independent.

375
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:47,340
They're elected in most states,

376
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:47,731
not all,

377
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:50,130
but in most states and most
of the death police states,

378
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,740
the prosecutors elected
by judicial district.

379
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,580
So each one is independent of the other
and they can have different policies on

380
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,170
what pleased to make.

381
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,020
Starkest example would be in Houston,

382
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,610
which is executed more people than
any state except Texas itself.

383
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,091
Uh,

384
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:11,020
because of two very aggressive prosecutors
who over a long period of time sought

385
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,370
the death pony repeatedly.

386
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,061
Uh,

387
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:13,811
on the other hand,

388
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:17,680
Robert Morgenthau during the nine
years that New York had the death,

389
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,600
probably never sought the death Polly.

390
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,291
In fact,

391
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,100
he wrote an,

392
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,431
uh,

393
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:24,970
an op Ed in the New York Times saying
that the legislature shouldn't even adopt

394
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:25,804
the death poem.

395
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,660
So practices can differ a great deal,

396
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,111
uh,

397
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:30,400
from one prosecutor,

398
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:30,910
uh,

399
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,743
to another.

400
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,410
And what this results in of
course there's a geographical,

401
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,700
uh,

402
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,240
the depth point,

403
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,830
a geographical pattern in terms of
how the death penalty is imposed.

404
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,843
In 19,

405
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,943
uh,

406
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:44,681
95,

407
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,980
a study was done that looked at the death
pony from when it was first reinstated

408
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:50,350
in 1976 to 1995,

409
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,191
uh,

410
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:55,900
and found that more than half the death
sentences in the country were imposed by

411
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,080
2% of the counties in the country.

412
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,490
That is 66 counties imposed
over 2,500 death sentences.

413
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,150
And that was when there were a little
over 5,000 people sentenced to death,

414
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:07,690
uh,

415
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,523
in the country,

416
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,400
uh,

417
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,330
even in Texas,

418
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,930
which census more people to
death and executes more people.

419
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:14,471
Uh,

420
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:19,471
only 90 if the 254 counties in Texas
have sentenced people to death,

421
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,710
uh,

422
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,570
and in the country as a whole,

423
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,020
uh,

424
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,190
15 counties,

425
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:24,851
uh,

426
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:28,060
account for 30% of all
the people under death.

427
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,230
Since all this is reflecting the
different prosecutorial practices,

428
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:32,651
uh,

429
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:33,820
in seeking the death penalty.

430
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:37,810
And may also reflect to some extent the
demographics of the communities and the

431
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:39,670
willingness of juries to impose it.

432
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,200
But I would suggest that it's mostly
attributed over a prosecutor practices.

433
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:44,741
I mean,

434
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,670
one other example,

435
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:46,690
you can take Fairfax,

436
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:47,524
Virginia,

437
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,800
which has a population,

438
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,320
roughly 1 million people.

439
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:50,950
Uh,

440
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,210
during this time period,

441
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,940
a five death ponies were imposed there.

442
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:55,691
Uh,

443
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:56,351
on the other hand,

444
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,041
Hillsburg County,

445
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:57,461
Florida,

446
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,181
that's Tampa,

447
00:13:58,181 --> 00:13:59,014
Florida,

448
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,400
uh,

449
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,460
the same population,

450
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:04,510
roughly 37 death pony
cases imposed a 13 times,

451
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,050
uh,

452
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,440
as many death penalty cases as,

453
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,350
as imposed in,

454
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:09,340
in Fairfax County.

455
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,810
So we see places a great differences in
terms of whether it does some poster,

456
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:18,010
not most often it has to do
with plea bargaining very,

457
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,500
very closely related to plea bargaining.

458
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,401
Uh,

459
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:26,401
is the question of informants or the
prosecution making deals with people not

460
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:28,420
just for lesser sentences,

461
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,050
uh,

462
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,710
but,

463
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,070
uh,

464
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:30,890
for,

465
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,180
uh,

466
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,080
their testimony.

467
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,190
Uh,

468
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,190
there can be all kinds of bargains
fashioned a number of people that are

469
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,910
involved in a case,

470
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,721
uh,

471
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:41,890
and uh,

472
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,753
they,

473
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,653
uh,

474
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,270
one will testify against the other
perpetrators in exchange for sometimes

475
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,840
dismissal.

476
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,391
The charges,

477
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:51,650
sometimes for a reduced sentence.

478
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,680
Sometimes there's someone
in the jail who says,

479
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:58,370
I will testify that the
person accused in the crime.

480
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,121
Uh,

481
00:14:59,121 --> 00:14:59,900
we'll,

482
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,560
uh,

483
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,560
we'll said admitted to me
that he committed that crime
if my charges are reduced

484
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,970
or if my charges are dismissed.

485
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,540
Uh,

486
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,460
sometimes the government offers rewards,

487
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:11,510
financial rewards,

488
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,161
uh,

489
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,660
and actually pays money to
people to be informants.

490
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,261
Uh,

491
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:20,261
and so the question came up first in a
case called on Lee versus United States

492
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,340
in 1952 and there,

493
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:22,791
uh,

494
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:23,660
the Supreme Court,

495
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:24,530
very close case,

496
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:26,360
a five to four decision,

497
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,051
uh,

498
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,530
where the court talked
about the use of informants,

499
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:30,321
accessories,

500
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:31,610
accomplices faults,

501
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:32,121
friends,

502
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:33,320
people who betrayed,

503
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,070
uh,

504
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,820
their,

505
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,001
uh,

506
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:40,001
their friends and what Justice Jackson
called the dirty business of prosecution.

507
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,121
And they said,

508
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:44,090
this raises real questions of credibility.

509
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:44,720
Uh,

510
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,810
but the court decided there
again by a very close vote.

511
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,351
Uh,

512
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:49,340
the court said,

513
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,540
we don't see any reason why
the prosecution shouldn't
be allowed to use this

514
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,374
information,

515
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,560
even though it was
obtained by these methods.

516
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,071
Uh,

517
00:15:58,071 --> 00:15:59,630
Justice Frankfurter descended,

518
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,350
uh,

519
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,183
he said,

520
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,911
uh,

521
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:06,050
that criminal prosecution should
not be what he called a dirty game,

522
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:06,711
uh,

523
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:11,180
in which the dirty business of criminals
is matched by the dirty business of law

524
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:12,014
enforcement.

525
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,740
Uh,

526
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,600
his feeling was that the,

527
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:19,601
the contrast between the morality
professed by society and the immorality,

528
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:21,770
uh,

529
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:26,360
practice by a police and law
enforcement on its behalf,

530
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:26,990
uh,

531
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,730
creates contempt for the wall.

532
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,391
Well,

533
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:31,400
that was very controversial at that time.

534
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:31,980
Uh,

535
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,040
and at the time that case was decided,

536
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:34,760
uh,

537
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,630
but today,

538
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,170
uh,

539
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,600
no practice is more integrated,

540
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,440
uh,

541
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,750
into the criminal process.

542
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:42,140
Uh,

543
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,510
then people trading leniency,

544
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,260
money,

545
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,690
whatever it may be a for testimony.

546
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,801
Uh,

547
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:49,850
as one court said,

548
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:50,301
uh,

549
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,550
in the United States Court of Appeals,

550
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,131
the fifth circuit,

551
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:57,131
it's hard to imagine a greater
motivation for a person to lie,

552
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,530
uh,

553
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,460
then a reduced sentence,

554
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:01,971
uh,

555
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:02,804
and yet,

556
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,081
uh,

557
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:04,520
that happens all the time.

558
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,180
Uh,

559
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:05,871
in cases.

560
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:07,400
And some people get pretty good deals.

561
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,031
Uh,

562
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:08,960
in these cases.

563
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,530
One of the classics is Sammy the
Bull Gravano who was a part of the,

564
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,190
uh,

565
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,720
John Gotti mafia,

566
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,321
uh,

567
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:16,280
operation.

568
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:16,520
Uh,

569
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,620
he admitted to the murders of 19 people,

570
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,371
uh,

571
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:23,210
and yet he got a sentence of about
five years and was putting the witness

572
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:24,050
protection plan.

573
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:24,680
Uh,

574
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,680
he got that by testifying against 36
people who were involved in mafia crimes

575
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:31,034
and so forth.

576
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:31,670
Uh,

577
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:36,670
but it shows the tremendous power that
the prosecution has to encourage someone

578
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:41,510
to testify by being able to give a person
who committed this many murders you

579
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:44,270
would certainly think would be eligible
for the death penalty and certainly

580
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,040
would be put away for
the rest of their life.

581
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,090
In this case,

582
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,103
the person,

583
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,500
uh,

584
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,570
managed to get out after a fairly short
time and go into witness protection

585
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:51,841
plan.

586
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:52,540
Although,

587
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,220
uh,

588
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,710
Sandra bold later dropped out
of the witness protection plan.

589
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,083
Um,

590
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:57,760
what,

591
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,740
what the court was,

592
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,300
what was talking about,

593
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:00,901
uh,

594
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:01,950
in on Lee,

595
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,700
uh,

596
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,510
was,

597
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,343
uh,

598
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,010
the same question that we talked
about with future dangerousness.

599
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:13,370
Does the judge act as a
gateway or gatekeeper with
regard to whether or not this

600
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,000
testimony comes in or not,

601
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,960
uh,

602
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,793
or,

603
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,280
uh,

604
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,270
does the judge,

605
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:18,930
uh,

606
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:23,220
disclose this informer or require the
prosecution to disclose whatever the deal

607
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:26,670
is a and then let the
jury decide credibility.

608
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:27,963
Uh,

609
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,670
that's what the Supreme Court said.

610
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:30,480
Uh,

611
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,430
you tell the jury this person was paid
money or this person is getting a deal on

612
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:40,110
their sentence as persons having their
charges dismissed and the jury takes that

613
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:43,860
into account in assessing the
credibility of that person.

614
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,000
Well,

615
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,130
this is an enormous power,

616
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:47,770
uh,

617
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,610
that no other person in
the legal system has.

618
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:52,140
If I encouraged,

619
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:54,030
if a defense lawyer encouraged some,

620
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:54,900
uh,

621
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,700
witness to testify and offered money
or offered any other benefit to that

622
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:00,061
person,

623
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:01,440
that that would be called bribery.

624
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,191
Uh,

625
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:04,110
and the person will be prosecuted for it.

626
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:04,861
Uh,

627
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:05,611
but as we see,

628
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,670
the prosecution can
offer a number of things,

629
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,270
uh,

630
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,130
to require people to testify,

631
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,830
uh,

632
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,421
and to help.

633
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:13,254
The concern,

634
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:13,981
uh,

635
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:15,300
is wrongful convictions.

636
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:19,470
We know that in a number of the cases
in which innocent people were convicted,

637
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,020
uh,

638
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,450
they were convicted based on the
testimony of snitches or informants.

639
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,470
Uh,

640
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,200
even when the jury is
told what the deal is a,

641
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,600
even when all that information is put out,

642
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,560
uh,

643
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,970
it's still often impossible to know
whether this person's really telling the

644
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:40,971
truth or whether this person is saying
whatever he or she needs to say in order

645
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:45,540
to get their charges dismissed or reduced
or to get a more lenient sentence.

646
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,873
Um,

647
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,890
if the informant does not perform
as agreed to under the deal,

648
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,160
the prosecution can go after them.

649
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:56,820
Uh,

650
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,900
John Adamson,

651
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,370
uh,

652
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,760
cut a deal with prosecutors in Arizona
where they would not seek the death pony

653
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:06,540
for him if he would testify against the
other two people who were involved in

654
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:10,500
the murder of a radio
personality named and Don Bolles.

655
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,520
Uh,

656
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,400
he testified he did his part of the deal.

657
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:15,330
He testified,

658
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:15,720
uh,

659
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,080
the prosecution got convictions in those
two cases and got the death penalty,

660
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:19,710
uh,

661
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,910
in those two cases.

662
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,280
But the cases were reversed on appeal.

663
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,610
So the prosecution comes
back and says to Adam,

664
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,460
sinned for the retrial.

665
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,740
We need your testimony again.

666
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:29,401
And Adamson said,

667
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:29,821
wait a minute,

668
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:29,991
I,

669
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:34,991
I was only on board for one time
and I did what I was supposed to do.

670
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:35,911
Uh,

671
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:38,490
the prosecution appeal
that to the Arizona courts,

672
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:38,911
which said,

673
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:39,510
no,

674
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,730
you still have the responsibility.

675
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:42,210
Uh,

676
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,110
John Adamson,

677
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:43,710
uh,

678
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,660
to testify in the new trial right
after that Adamson changes is mine.

679
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:49,291
Writes a letter,

680
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:49,561
says,

681
00:20:49,561 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm ready to testify,

682
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,220
but the prosecution decides,

683
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:53,850
uh,

684
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:58,020
that it will prosecute Adamson now
for violating the plea agreement.

685
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:58,710
Uh,

686
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,950
instead of the other two people that
had previously got sentenced to death,

687
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,590
it no longer prosecutes
those people at all.

688
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,371
Uh,

689
00:21:05,371 --> 00:21:06,120
and,

690
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,391
uh,

691
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,640
results in a Adamson,

692
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,060
uh,

693
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,020
receiving the death.

694
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:12,960
Plenty Supreme Court says
no double jeopardy bar,

695
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:13,620
uh,

696
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,080
no reason that the prosecution,

697
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:18,210
even though he had pled guilty,

698
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:18,940
uh,

699
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,860
and he had been sentenced to
a fairly substantial sentence,

700
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,210
roughly 20 years.

701
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:24,841
Uh,

702
00:21:24,841 --> 00:21:26,580
and it started serving that sentence,

703
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,121
uh,

704
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:28,740
that because he reneged,

705
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:30,210
at least they thought he reneged.

706
00:21:30,211 --> 00:21:33,840
And majority of the Supreme Court and
this another five to four decision,

707
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:34,674
very close,

708
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:35,071
uh,

709
00:21:35,071 --> 00:21:38,490
they thought he reneged on the
deal so you could withdraw.

710
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,270
Uh,

711
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,591
the,

712
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:39,840
the,

713
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,550
the taking out of prison,

714
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,080
put him back where he started,

715
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,920
prosecute him.

716
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,753
And in fact,

717
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,210
uh,

718
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,660
the jury didn't impose that her,

719
00:21:46,661 --> 00:21:48,150
the judge impose the death pony,

720
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:48,661
uh,

721
00:21:48,661 --> 00:21:50,550
on Adamson as a result of that.

722
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,863
Um,

723
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,180
Justice Brennan a descended,

724
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:54,691
uh,

725
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:56,670
in that case saying there no,

726
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,660
uh,

727
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,690
it's not clear that there even
was a breach of the contract.

728
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,231
Uh,

729
00:22:01,231 --> 00:22:03,420
and even though he did
breach the contract,

730
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,190
even if you assume that he did,

731
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,910
he immediately agreed
to go back and testify.

732
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,511
But at any rate,

733
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:10,830
that was a majority of a,

734
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:11,370
excuse me,

735
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,203
a minority,

736
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:12,451
uh,

737
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:12,571
uh,

738
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:13,680
four justices that,

739
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:14,514
that said that,

740
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,390
uh,

741
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,980
what do we see out of this
is this is the great power,

742
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,820
uh,

743
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,820
that prosecutors have a investigative
powers in terms of what to investigate,

744
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,270
uh,

745
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,490
which things to focus on.

746
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,210
Uh,

747
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,270
but once he's k what the charge
once the case has come in,

748
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,220
but then how cases are resolved.

749
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,180
Well over 90% of cases are going
to be resolved by plea bargains.

750
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,800
And often whether or not,

751
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:41,850
uh,

752
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:45,800
somebody plea bargains is going to be
based upon whether another person accused

753
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:49,530
in that crime or someone else agrees
to testify for the prosecution.

754
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,251
And of course,

755
00:22:50,251 --> 00:22:52,950
very often cases are going
to go to trial as the bowls,

756
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:58,290
a murder case did with Adamson testifying
the first time and Adamson being the

757
00:22:58,291 --> 00:22:59,490
defendant the second time,

758
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,680
all apart of the,

759
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,490
uh,

760
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:06,450
Arsenal that the prosecutor
has a in prosecuting cases.
