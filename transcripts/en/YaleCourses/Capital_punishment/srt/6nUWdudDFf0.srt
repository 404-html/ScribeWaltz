1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,710
As we've discussed,

2
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:14,450
a person who has sentenced to death,

3
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:15,740
who is raised there,

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,120
uh,

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,010
appeal their case and lost in the state
courts has gone to the state courts in

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,970
post conviction proceedings lost.

7
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:27,971
They're the last hope for that person
is to file in the United States district

8
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:33,401
court for wherever they are from a appeal
to the United States Court of Appeals,

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,030
uh,

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,630
under Federal Habeas Corpus.

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,440
Uh,

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,330
and as we've talked about,

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,871
uh,

14
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:43,300
the courts have restricted
the availability of Habeas
Corpus Justice Brennan and

15
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:47,360
had a very wide view that habeas corpus
should be available as long as the

16
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:51,440
person didn't intentionally a
bypass the state procedures.

17
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,101
Uh,

18
00:00:52,101 --> 00:00:55,670
but soon after that justice Rehnquist
tighten that up a great deal and said,

19
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:59,690
unless the person complied
with every procedural rule,

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,320
uh,

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,630
raised the issue at the
right time at trial,

22
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:04,010
raised the issue on appeal,

23
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,940
gave the same constitutional arguments
there that are now being inserted in

24
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:08,774
federal court.

25
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,300
The federal court would not look at that.

26
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,040
I want to talk just a little while about
how the federal statute was amended in

27
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:21,041
1996 to restrict even further a review
of state death penalty cases by federal

28
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:23,300
courts.

29
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,170
And then talk just a little bit about the
standards of review and the burdens of

30
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:27,880
proof,

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,130
uh,

32
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,580
that courts utilize in
deciding these cases.

33
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,421
Uh,

34
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:33,410
in 1996,

35
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:37,580
the Habeas Corpus statute was a minute
and a number of ways and I'm only going

36
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:40,010
to talk about a couple that
are particularly important.

37
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:41,750
There are others in the materials that,

38
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:42,830
that you can look at,

39
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,070
but these are the ones that
really made a huge difference.

40
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:46,850
First of all,

41
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,800
a one year statute of limitations.

42
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,880
There had never been a statue
of limitations on Habeas
Corpus in the history of

43
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:53,714
the country.

44
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,510
So you had people who
might've been in prison,

45
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,910
let's say in a non
capital case like Rubin,

46
00:01:58,911 --> 00:01:59,810
Hurricane Carter.

47
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,340
If you've ever seen the movie,

48
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:02,174
the hurricane,

49
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:02,660
uh,

50
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,660
he didn't get Habeas Corpus relief
until 20 years into his sentence.

51
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,420
Uh,

52
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,010
many other people often,

53
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:10,520
uh,

54
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,540
later in the time that they had served
would find lawyers who had worked on

55
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:18,050
their cases or they'd finally figured
it out themselves in the law library.

56
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,550
Uh,

57
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,060
and they,

58
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,370
uh,

59
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,061
get relief.

60
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:21,380
Now one year,

61
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,161
uh,

62
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:24,740
once the case is final on direct appeal,

63
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,980
the person has one year
to file in federal court.

64
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,880
If they go into the state courts in
the state post conviction process,

65
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,230
the time will be held for the
time they're in the state court.

66
00:02:36,231 --> 00:02:37,040
In other words,

67
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,880
if they wait six months and then
file a state post conviction,

68
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,361
uh,

69
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,200
application,

70
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,960
and that's litigated through
the state courts for the next,

71
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:45,231
say,

72
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:45,590
two,

73
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,550
three years,

74
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:47,091
uh,

75
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:48,770
when that is final,

76
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,470
when the state Supreme Court
has finally ruled on that,

77
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:51,930
uh,

78
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,480
then the person has six months left.

79
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:54,321
Uh,

80
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:54,951
and of course,

81
00:02:54,951 --> 00:02:56,570
if you wait until the last minute,

82
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,261
uh,

83
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:58,880
you can be in big trouble there.

84
00:02:58,881 --> 00:03:01,210
And lawyers have missed
the statute of limitations.

85
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:01,601
In fact,

86
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,434
quite a few,

87
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,010
uh,

88
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,520
people have missed the statute of
limitations even in death penalty cases

89
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,050
costing their clients,

90
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,500
uh,

91
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,370
any review whatsoever of the
case by the federal courts.

92
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,960
The one thing important about the federal
courts is that the state court judges,

93
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,280
as we'll be discussing,

94
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:18,790
uh,

95
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,570
later,

96
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:19,871
uh,

97
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:20,704
our elected,

98
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,401
uh,

99
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,400
the capital cases are
very controversial cases.

100
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:29,170
It's often virtually impossible
for a state court judge to be able,

101
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,770
uh,

102
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,150
to stay in office if he or she grants
relief in a death penalty case.

103
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:35,110
The federal courts,

104
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,090
federal judges are appointed for life.

105
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:37,841
Uh,

106
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:39,550
and for a long time,

107
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,001
uh,

108
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:42,550
before 1996 in reviewing these cases,

109
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:47,410
a number of federal courts had granted
the writ of Habeas Corpus finding that

110
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:49,150
they were constitutional violations.

111
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:49,780
Uh,

112
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,990
Congress tried to change this and
did change this significantly.

113
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,531
Uh,

114
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:54,820
in 1966,

115
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,860
they amended 28,

116
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:01,861
United States code 2154 d that's the
paragraph that says what the court can do.

117
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,110
Uh,

118
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,920
when a Habeas Corpus petition
is filed in the court,

119
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:09,754
examines it,

120
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,910
the court can grant the writ if the
State Court decision was contrary to or

121
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:20,161
involved an unreasonable application of
clearly established law as determined by

122
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:25,210
the Supreme Court of the United States.

123
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,300
This is a huge change because before,

124
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,990
when a federal court
ruled on a habeas case,

125
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,621
uh,

126
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:37,621
it made its ruling based upon what it
viewed to be the correct determination of

127
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:39,820
constitutional law.

128
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,751
Uh,

129
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:41,584
if the,

130
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,041
uh,

131
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:42,331
and,

132
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:46,030
and it didn't necessarily have to depend
upon the United States Supreme Court

133
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:46,571
decision,

134
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:49,840
it may be that there was an issue that
hadn't been decided by the United States

135
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:50,674
Supreme Court.

136
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,311
Uh,

137
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:54,530
that those kinds of issues
can no longer be considered a,

138
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,960
because the state court,

139
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:56,830
uh,

140
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,210
has to have been unreasonable
in its application.

141
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,170
Uh,

142
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:02,780
so the,

143
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,950
the federal courts no longer decide
where they right or wrong on the

144
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:06,820
constitutional issue.

145
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:08,530
Just a pure question of law.

146
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,540
Did they correctly apply the law?

147
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,080
Uh,

148
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,120
but where they unreasonably wrong,

149
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,051
uh,

150
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:14,320
in,

151
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,670
in,

152
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,550
in applying the law,

153
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,803
um,

154
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,201
the,

155
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:18,010
the first con,

156
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,400
uh,

157
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,151
first clause here,

158
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:20,530
the contrary to clause,

159
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,740
the court set of Federal
Habeas Court may grant the red,

160
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,251
uh,

161
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:26,500
if the state court reached a conclusion,

162
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,520
uh,

163
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,340
that was the opposite of
a Supreme Court decision,

164
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,181
uh,

165
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:32,410
on a question of law.

166
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,161
Uh,

167
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:33,821
in other words,

168
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:36,370
the state court decided
a case differently.

169
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:36,971
Uh,

170
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:38,680
then the Supreme Court had ruled,

171
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,251
uh,

172
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:39,970
on,

173
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,750
uh,

174
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,600
really the same facts are
indistinguishable facts.

175
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,260
Uh,

176
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,430
the other clause,

177
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,360
uh,

178
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,380
the federal court,

179
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:47,860
uh,

180
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,730
grinding the red,

181
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,210
uh,

182
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,120
under the unreasonable application clause,

183
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:52,931
uh,

184
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:57,931
is the state court identifies the correct
legal principle of a United States

185
00:05:58,221 --> 00:05:59,300
Supreme Court decision,

186
00:05:59,780 --> 00:05:59,991
uh,

187
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:02,390
but unreasonably applies that principle,

188
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,110
uh,

189
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,780
to the facts of the petitioners case.

190
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,740
Uh,

191
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,341
in other words,

192
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:11,600
the State Court recognized that the
legal claim is governed by the example of

193
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:12,740
justice O'Connor gives.

194
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:13,200
And,

195
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,490
uh,

196
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,480
the Williams case,

197
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:15,314
Terry Williams,

198
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,690
uh,

199
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,080
uh,

200
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,913
out of Virginia,

201
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,430
uh,

202
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,480
gives the example of a state court
identifies that this is a claim of

203
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:25,100
ineffective assistance of counsel,

204
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,630
violation of the right to counsel.

205
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,320
It's governed under the supreme
court's decision in Strickland versus

206
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:31,154
Washington.

207
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,160
But the court might unreasonably,

208
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,090
the State Court,

209
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,570
uh,

210
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,570
might unreasonably apply Strickland
to the facts of that particular case.

211
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,420
This is probably where the federal courts
have more room in terms of examining a

212
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,501
federal issues.

213
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:48,530
Sometimes they'll say,

214
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,030
uh,

215
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,360
the United States Supreme Court case
required that all of the relevant factors

216
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:57,470
be considered and the state court didn't
consider some of the relevant factors

217
00:06:57,471 --> 00:07:02,390
and therefore it was an unreasonable
application of the federal law.

218
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,900
But the mere fact that the federal
court thinks that the state court got it

219
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:10,130
wrong is not a basis for
granting a habeas relief.

220
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,790
This is very deferential
to the state courts.

221
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:14,721
Uh,

222
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:15,620
and so,

223
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,191
uh,

224
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:17,120
what it means,

225
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,900
uh,

226
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,733
is that,

227
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,753
uh,

228
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,560
it's going to be much more difficult.

229
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:21,651
And,

230
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:22,730
and Habeas Corpus,

231
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:23,321
uh,

232
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:23,551
I,

233
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:24,231
I mentioned,

234
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:24,940
uh,

235
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,350
uh,

236
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,810
in a previous discussion,

237
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,520
a much harder to get,

238
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,760
almost impossible to get evidentiary
hearings now in federal court.

239
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,080
So the combination of the
federal courts not being able to,

240
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:36,920
uh,

241
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,270
have evidentiary hearings,

242
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,260
take evidence,

243
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,330
consider that,

244
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,193
make findings,

245
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,283
uh,

246
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,380
instead having to defer to the findings
of the state courts and even deferred to

247
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:51,050
the legal conclusions
reached by the state courts,

248
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,621
uh,

249
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,480
is greatly going to limit.

250
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,480
And it does limit a federal
habeas corpus review,

251
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,950
but we'll see this language in some
of the cases that we'll be looking at.

252
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,441
Uh,

253
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:02,660
in the rest of the course,

254
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,730
I want to turn the burdens of proof,

255
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,511
uh,

256
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:06,710
and talk about,

257
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,903
um,

258
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:09,471
uh,

259
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,304
the different,

260
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:10,970
uh,

261
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,230
burdens of proof that,

262
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:12,830
uh,

263
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,420
courts have adopted just because very
often in a case the court will decide,

264
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:18,254
first of all,

265
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,990
what does the person have to
prove to prevail on the client?

266
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,250
Uh,

267
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,480
and then secondly,

268
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,110
uh,

269
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,430
what is the burden of proof?

270
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,361
Uh,

271
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:27,290
and then thirdly,

272
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,300
who has the burden of proof,

273
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:29,960
uh,

274
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,790
because if the burden is very high,

275
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,950
the person who has the burden,

276
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:34,611
uh,

277
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:39,611
is going to lose unless they are
able to meet that burden of proof.

278
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,100
So how the courts define a,

279
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,150
these are not things that
are in the constitution.

280
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:48,180
These are things that the supreme
court decides a in decisions,

281
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:48,410
uh,

282
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,570
in cases that come before it.

283
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,081
Of course,

284
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:53,390
everyone is familiar with
beyond a reasonable doubt.

285
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,260
Uh,

286
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,220
in criminal cases,

287
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,400
you have to prove that the person
is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

288
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,620
If after hearing all the evidence,

289
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,230
you have some reservations,

290
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:09,231
some doubt about whether this person
is guilty or whether this fact is true,

291
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,530
then the government
has not met its burden.

292
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,810
The prosecution has the burden of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

293
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,450
And the requirement would be in that case,

294
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:19,680
to a inner,

295
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:21,360
a verdict of not guilty.

296
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,020
Uh,

297
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,501
so that's,

298
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:22,650
uh,

299
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,120
that's,

300
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,720
that's our highest standard of burden.

301
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,530
Uh,

302
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,730
in civil cases,

303
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,281
uh,

304
00:09:27,281 --> 00:09:30,840
the burden is preponderance of the
evidence just more likely than not.

305
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,350
If you put the evidence on
a scale and you weighed,

306
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:34,860
uh,

307
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,700
the scale,

308
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,130
uh,

309
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,740
if it's more likely than not,

310
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,510
uh,

311
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,230
it's by a preponderance of the evidence.

312
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:40,980
Again,

313
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,510
who has the burden of proof?

314
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,330
If the side would the burden of proof,

315
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:45,990
uh,

316
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,480
let's say the evidence is in equal poise,

317
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,231
a,

318
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:50,850
you can't say one way or the other.

319
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:51,490
Uh,

320
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,190
then the side of the
burden of proof loses.

321
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,870
So how you allocate the burden of
proof is going to be very important.

322
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,480
Now in between these two levels,

323
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,201
uh,

324
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,210
is clear and convincing evidence,

325
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,351
uh,

326
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:05,184
that,

327
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,910
uh,

328
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,790
means that the court a reasonable,

329
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,800
substantial and probable,

330
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:11,550
uh,

331
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,210
that,

332
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:12,421
uh,

333
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:14,460
the fact that you're
trying to prove occurred.

334
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,330
Uh,

335
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:19,440
so sometimes the courts will say you have
to prove something by a preponderance

336
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:20,274
of the evidence.

337
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,390
But in other areas they will say it has
to be proven by a little higher level,

338
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:24,840
uh,

339
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,590
by clearing,

340
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,430
convincing evidence.

341
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,481
And of course,

342
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:29,280
reasonable doubt for the most part,

343
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,880
a is limited to cases involving,

344
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:33,900
uh,

345
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,160
guilt or innocence and the,

346
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:36,720
and the prosecution's burden there.

347
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,420
Now there's another burden.

348
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:41,940
It's a little less than this
substantial probability.

349
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:47,630
Is there a substantial probability that
whatever happened affected the outcome

350
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,320
of the case?

351
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,280
Uh,

352
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,420
that means not enough to
be more likely than not,

353
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,410
but enough to undermine
confidence in the verdict.

354
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,011
Uh,

355
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:03,270
and we'll see that the court adopted
this substantial probability test and a

356
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:04,170
couple of areas,

357
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:04,621
uh,

358
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:08,520
as part of the question of whether
there's a constitutional violation or not.

359
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,420
Uh,

360
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,470
but again,

361
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:12,210
as we sort of look on the scale of the,

362
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:12,841
uh,

363
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:13,231
these,

364
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:16,590
these two have degree have to
do with a degree of certainty.

365
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,090
We were very certain,

366
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:19,530
when we say beyond a reasonable doubt,

367
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,960
we're pretty certain but
a little less certain.

368
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:23,550
When we say clear and convincing evidence,

369
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,670
we're more likely than not certain.

370
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:27,930
When we say preponderance,

371
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,120
when we say substantial probability,

372
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,690
we're talking about undermining
our confidence in the outcome,

373
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,070
feeling not totally
comfortable with the outcomes.

374
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,250
So that's a little lower standard.

375
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:40,230
And then finally probable cause,

376
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,960
which just means probably a,

377
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:43,711
in other words,

378
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:48,480
when a police officer goes to
get a warrant to search a house,

379
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:48,871
they'll say,

380
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:50,490
here's what we've been told,

381
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:52,110
here's what we think is in the house.

382
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,660
And the uh,

383
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,880
judge will say,

384
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,130
if it looks like it's probably there,

385
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,070
then the warrant will issue a
and the person can go out and,

386
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:01,421
and,

387
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,890
and sees the prior conduct,

388
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:03,341
the search.

389
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,870
And if there is anything there,

390
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:05,770
seize the property.

391
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:06,340
Uh,

392
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,510
the same thing for,

393
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,660
uh,

394
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,290
implement Arie hearings after
a person has been arrested.

395
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,011
Uh,

396
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:13,090
the standard is just,

397
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:16,030
is there evidence to say that
they probably committed the crime?

398
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:16,901
A,

399
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:18,160
it's a very low standard,

400
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:18,850
uh,

401
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,560
but it means that there is some evidence
indicating that the person committed

402
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:26,410
the crime or some basis
for conducting a search,

403
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,700
a of a house or of a person or some
basis for issuing an arrest warrant.

404
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,440
Uh,

405
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,550
but that's the lowest,

406
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:33,931
uh,

407
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:35,050
of these standards,

408
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,560
uh,

409
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,030
of proof of these burdens of proof
that the courts have adopted.

410
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:41,763
Um,

411
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,780
when we get to appeals,

412
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:46,900
which many of the cases we'll look
at are going to be cases on appeal.

413
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:47,710
Uh,

414
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,710
one of the questions to look for in these
cases is what exactly a is the court

415
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,333
reviewing.

416
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,241
Uh,

417
00:12:55,241 --> 00:13:00,040
and they fall into three basic areas
that I want to just discuss for a moment.

418
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:00,790
Uh,

419
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,050
questions of fact,

420
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:02,771
uh,

421
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:07,660
is the court reviewing factual
determinations made by the trial judge?

422
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,411
Uh,

423
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:09,244
in other words,

424
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,140
a credibility of witnesses,

425
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,220
um,

426
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,710
whether a juror can be fair and impartial.

427
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:15,760
Uh,

428
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,170
and the Ricky rector case,

429
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:17,891
uh,

430
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:22,420
the judge was looking at weather Ricky
rector was mentally competent or not.

431
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,810
And there were expert
testimonies on both sides.

432
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,910
Expert testimony on both sides.

433
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:28,661
Uh,

434
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:32,110
the Arkansas Supreme Court said the
evidence is hopelessly in conflict.

435
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,380
So we defer to the trial judge because
the trial judge saw the witnesses,

436
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,800
uh,

437
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,720
made determinations of credibility.

438
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,441
Uh,

439
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:45,400
and therefore we're going to
defer to the trial judge on that.

440
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:45,941
Uh,

441
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:47,140
and there's not much left,

442
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:47,620
uh,

443
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,460
for the appellate court to decide as
long as the trial judge applied the right

444
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:52,294
law.

445
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,160
That is the law of competency.

446
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,660
By the same token,

447
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,710
uh,

448
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,880
courts have looked at jury's determination
of whether a person can be fair and

449
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:01,714
impartial.

450
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,210
The parties are selecting a jury,

451
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,750
a person knows about the case
because of pretrial publicity,

452
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:08,411
uh,

453
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:09,560
knows a whole lot about the case.

454
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,420
As it turns out,

455
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:11,870
the more that person's question,

456
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:12,761
uh,

457
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:13,900
and at the end of the time,

458
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,500
uh,

459
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,960
the defense lawyer moves to
strike that juror and says,

460
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:19,210
this person can't be fair and impartial.

461
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:19,781
Uh,

462
00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:21,130
the Supreme Court has said,

463
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:21,790
uh,

464
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,130
that's a factual determination.

465
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:24,700
Uh,

466
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,500
so that will be,

467
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,311
we'll defer.

468
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:30,460
The appellate court will
defer to the trial judge,

469
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:30,911
uh,

470
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,490
unless it was clearly erroneous.

471
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,140
Uh,

472
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,383
and so,

473
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:36,731
uh,

474
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:38,650
that's going to be a higher standard,

475
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,190
uh,

476
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,023
for the,

477
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,530
the person challenging the juror
to overcome in order to win.

478
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,700
On the other hand,

479
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,860
we have just pure questions of law.

480
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:48,760
Uh,

481
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,910
is the death pony appropriate for
people who are intellectually disabled?

482
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,780
Uh,

483
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,280
that basically involves the question
of pure constitutional question,

484
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:58,881
uh,

485
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:02,450
of what the scope of the eighth
amendment is and whether it prevents.

486
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:05,900
So that's a case that the appellate
court or the Supreme Court of the United

487
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,260
States,

488
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:06,561
uh,

489
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:11,330
in this case is going to decide without
much deference to the trial judge or

490
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:14,840
without any deference to the trial judge
because it's a pure question of law.

491
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,500
Uh,

492
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,900
whether the due process clause requires,

493
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,261
say,

494
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:20,540
a hearing or requires notice,

495
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,051
uh,

496
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:22,670
in a particular situation,

497
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,190
this again is going to
be a legal question.

498
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:30,430
And so an appellate court will decide
that and be pretty much free to apply the,

499
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:33,890
to decide what the law is and
then apply it to the facts.

500
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:34,461
Uh,

501
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:37,880
and then what we often have our
mixed questions of law and fact,

502
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:38,810
uh,

503
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:43,810
the question of ineffective assistance
of counsel involves both the law with

504
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:49,220
regard to what the sixth amendment right
to counsel and guarantees a person.

505
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,900
But it's also intermeshed with the
facts of what did the lawyer do and that

506
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:54,890
particular case,

507
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,380
why did the lawyer do it and so forth,

508
00:15:57,381 --> 00:16:00,860
which we will talk about more when
we talk about the right to counsel.

509
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,150
But so depending upon which
of these general areas,

510
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:07,850
the question fits in the appellate court,

511
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,330
uh,

512
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,470
may or may not,

513
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,070
uh,

514
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:10,903
have a,

515
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,020
uh,

516
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,690
a more vigorous,

517
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:15,170
uh,

518
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,490
a role to play,

519
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,390
uh,

520
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,490
almost complete deference
to the trial judge.

521
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:19,881
If it's,

522
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:21,170
if it's a factual question,

523
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,960
court's going to be able
to do whatever it wants.

524
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:25,850
If it's a question of law,

525
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,400
it's going to try to determine
the constitutional law.

526
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:28,851
Uh,

527
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:29,601
and then finally,

528
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:30,590
if it's a mixed question,

529
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:33,560
the court is going to try to
distill out what are the facts,

530
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,840
which we still defer to the trial judge.

531
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,260
Uh,

532
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,670
but what are the legal questions,

533
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,150
uh,

534
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,983
which the court,

535
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,410
uh,

536
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,880
is going to decide

537
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,430
related to this?

538
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:44,960
Is that what standard,

539
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,450
uh,

540
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,940
does the court apply?

541
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:47,870
Uh,

542
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,650
in reviewing these various
questions that I have described,

543
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,510
a de Novo review,

544
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:54,051
uh,

545
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:57,320
the appellate court decides
examples I gave before,

546
00:16:57,321 --> 00:16:58,250
what the Constitution,

547
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,061
what the statutes,

548
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,470
what the rules are,

549
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,890
and then applies them to
the facts of the case.

550
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,213
Uh,

551
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,190
clearly erroneous.

552
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,300
As I just mentioned.

553
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:08,941
Uh,

554
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:12,920
the appellate court is going
to defer to the trial judge,

555
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,063
uh,

556
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,650
with regards say to whether a potential
juror could be fair and impartial.

557
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,483
If the juror,

558
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:19,920
uh,

559
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,620
it goes back and forth again,

560
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:22,940
we see this with a question of,

561
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,220
could the juror fairly considered
the death pony of Juror?

562
00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:26,411
May?

563
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:26,811
Well,

564
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:27,830
I don't know if I could do it.

565
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:28,131
Well,

566
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,090
I think I could do it.

567
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,650
There's a lot of going back and forth.

568
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,513
Ultimately,

569
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,150
uh,

570
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,860
the judge allows the jury to set
a appellate court looking at that,

571
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,180
if that's claimed to be era is going
to defer to the judgment of the,

572
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,201
uh,

573
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:45,440
the trial judge unless a,

574
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:46,940
it was clearly erroneous.

575
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,140
The court feels,

576
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:48,620
uh,

577
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,340
very and strongly,

578
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:50,821
uh,

579
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:51,421
that the,

580
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:51,750
uh,

581
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,583
trial judge,

582
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,400
uh,

583
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,233
made an error.

584
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:54,780
Uh,

585
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,410
finally,

586
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:55,651
uh,

587
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:57,360
abuse of discretion standard.

588
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,000
Uh,

589
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
this is for the one challenging,

590
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,540
uh,

591
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,091
the,

592
00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:01,570
the,

593
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,180
the appellant who's challenging,

594
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:03,601
uh,

595
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:04,411
what a judge said.

596
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:05,820
This is the hardest to overcome.

597
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,390
Uh,

598
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,360
judges have a great deal of
discretion for all sorts of things.

599
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,340
Like whether to grant
a continuance or not.

600
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,900
One party says,

601
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,440
uh,

602
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,280
we need,

603
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,061
we're not ready.

604
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,020
We need more time.

605
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:16,561
The judge says,

606
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,870
I'm setting the case for a certain date.

607
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:19,680
Uh,

608
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,910
almost always,

609
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,930
uh,

610
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,990
that is going to be upheld by,

611
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,950
by an appellate court.

612
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,840
All sorts of other,

613
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,330
uh,

614
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,560
administrative or rulings
that the judges make,

615
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,190
uh,

616
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,040
miscibility of certain evidence is,

617
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:34,311
is,

618
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:34,621
is,

619
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:35,580
is judged by,

620
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,090
uh,

621
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,140
an abusive discretion.

622
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:37,974
Not Always,

623
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,340
uh,

624
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,210
but sometimes,

625
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:43,580
but the take home story here is if you're
appealing and the standards abusive

626
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,423
discretion,

627
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,500
it's going to be very
difficult to prevail.

628
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,480
Uh,

629
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,313
it's going to be,

630
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,260
uh,

631
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,330
also difficult and clearly erroneous,

632
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,440
uh,

633
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,460
much less so,

634
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,001
uh,

635
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:55,320
on de Novo Review.

636
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,110
So a lot of times the
argument in a case will be,

637
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:58,651
uh,

638
00:18:58,651 --> 00:19:02,700
what is the standard of review
for this particular case?

639
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,360
Uh,

640
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,010
because if it's one or the other,

641
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,560
uh,

642
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,080
it may determine how
the outcome of the case.

643
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,760
But then when the question,

644
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,320
what if there is an error,

645
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,130
the court finds that the constitution
was violated in some way,

646
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,300
uh,

647
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,590
but doesn't make a difference.

648
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,580
Uh,

649
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,413
do we?

650
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,220
At one time the rule was that if
there was a constitutional violation,

651
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:27,420
the case was reversed.

652
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,580
A and the person had a new trial.

653
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,090
Uh,

654
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:35,090
but today the court's employ a harmless
error standards in order to often

655
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:38,080
confirm a,

656
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:38,551
excuse me,

657
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:42,210
a firm convictions and
affirm death sentences.

658
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:42,721
Uh,

659
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:44,130
even though there was era,

660
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,120
uh,

661
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,750
the,

662
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,040
uh,

663
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,100
highest standard,

664
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,761
again,

665
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:49,560
this is our highest
standard of proof here.

666
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:51,690
Harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

667
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,580
Chatmon versus California,

668
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:58,200
the Supreme Court held that
even a violation of the
constitution of the United

669
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,110
States could be harmless
if the court could say,

670
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,500
we are confident beyond a reasonable
doubt that this did not affect the outcome

671
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,303
of the trial.

672
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,061
Of course,

673
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:11,070
it's very difficult for judges to do this.

674
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,080
They didn't see the witnesses.

675
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:13,470
Uh,

676
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,910
they didn't sit in the jury box.

677
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:15,510
Uh,

678
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:19,340
so how well a court can
or can't do this is,

679
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:19,701
is a,

680
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:20,041
is a,

681
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,230
is a matter of debate.

682
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,423
Um,

683
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,180
another standard is the one
that I talked about earlier,

684
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:28,830
but it's used in a different context here,

685
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:31,200
whether there's a substantial probability.

686
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:34,470
I talked about the substantial
probability standard and what it was,

687
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,553
uh,

688
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,740
that the era effected the outcome.

689
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,960
Now hear what we're saying is,

690
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:40,860
uh,

691
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,280
this applies to violations
of the right to counsel.

692
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:45,450
Uh,

693
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,970
the lawyer did not perform,

694
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,070
uh,

695
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,720
the lawyer was deficient
and the performance,

696
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,860
but then the court as is there
a substantial probability
that the outcome would

697
00:20:57,861 --> 00:21:00,670
have been different even if the
lawyer had done all the right things.

698
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,420
And if the judges sitting there decide no,

699
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,730
then they'll affirm the case.

700
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,300
Uh,

701
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,620
even though the person,

702
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,161
uh,

703
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:12,150
as lawyer did not perform adequately,

704
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:12,580
uh,

705
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,510
in representing them,

706
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,530
the same thing is true for the discovery
or the withholding of exculpatory

707
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:18,364
evidence.

708
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,440
The prosecution has a responsibility
to turn over evidence that shows a

709
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:24,274
innocence.

710
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:24,821
Uh,

711
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:27,640
if the court finds that that's not done,

712
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,650
the question is going to ask is,

713
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,410
is there a substantial probability
that that evidence had,

714
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:35,710
had been presented to the jury,

715
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,150
would have affected the outcome?

716
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,520
And if the judges can shrug
their shoulders and say,

717
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:39,701
no,

718
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:40,750
we don't think it would,

719
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:41,740
uh,

720
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,310
then they're going to affirm that
conviction even though the prosecution

721
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,690
withheld evidence.

722
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,913
Um,

723
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,113
finally,

724
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:49,481
uh,

725
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:50,470
just to mention it,

726
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,131
uh,

727
00:21:51,131 --> 00:21:51,451
the,

728
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:51,811
the,

729
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:55,510
the other standards applies
to non constitutional error,

730
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:55,990
uh,

731
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,980
in the federal courts,

732
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,701
uh,

733
00:21:57,701 --> 00:21:58,690
which is weather,

734
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,530
uh,

735
00:21:59,530 --> 00:21:59,951
the,

736
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:00,521
the era,

737
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:01,331
whatever it was,

738
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:03,550
had substantial or injures effect,

739
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,330
uh,

740
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,163
on the verdict.

741
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,220
Uh,

742
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,610
this is also a,

743
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,630
the standard that the supreme
court adopted for Habeas Corpus,

744
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,330
uh,

745
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,190
violations that if there's
a habeas corpus violation,

746
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,741
we don't ask,

747
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:16,570
is it harmless beyond a reasonable doubt?

748
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,260
Uh,

749
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,093
but we ask,

750
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:18,641
uh,

751
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:19,570
whether it is a,

752
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,410
uh,

753
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,460
substantial,

754
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,030
uh,

755
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,260
or injurious,

756
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,310
uh,

757
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,010
impact on the verdict that was decided.

758
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,383
Uh,

759
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,950
one last thing on harmless error.

760
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,190
Some errors are never
harmless structural errors,

761
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,180
uh,

762
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,013
one,

763
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,591
uh,

764
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:37,660
is racial discrimination.

765
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:38,471
Uh,

766
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:43,471
if there's underrepresentation of
people of a race or ethnicity or gender,

767
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:44,711
uh,

768
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,150
in the jury pools,

769
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,110
the question's not going to be did it
make any difference than the trials?

770
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,190
We'll never be able to know that.

771
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:56,550
One reason why it's automatic reversal
never harmless when jurors are being

772
00:22:57,701 --> 00:22:59,260
struck when they're picking the jury.

773
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,011
Uh,

774
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:03,940
if it turns out that the
striking is on the basis of race,

775
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,410
then that's going to always
be deemed prejudicial.

776
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:10,210
And so there's no harmless error,

777
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:10,931
uh,

778
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:11,980
applied to that.

779
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:12,700
Uh,

780
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,730
any kind of a race
discrimination that takes place,

781
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,310
a complete denial of the right to counsel.

782
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:19,690
This doesn't happen very often,

783
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:24,010
but there have been cases where
judges have interfered with a lawyer,

784
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:24,671
uh,

785
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:27,130
as the ability to
communicate with a client.

786
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:27,821
Uh,

787
00:23:27,821 --> 00:23:29,230
and in those situations,

788
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,400
uh,

789
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,110
courts have held that that's a
violation of the right to counsel.

790
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:34,560
Uh,

791
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,810
there's no way to figure out
how much damage it did or not.

792
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,430
So it's never harmless.

793
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:44,431
It's automatically going to result
in reversal denial of a public trial.

794
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,030
Uh,

795
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,811
not too long ago,

796
00:23:45,811 --> 00:23:46,550
the court,

797
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:46,740
uh,

798
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,970
reversed a case called Presley versus
Georgia in which the judge during the jury

799
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,130
selection told the people in the audience,

800
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,570
you're going to have
to leave the courtroom,

801
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:55,501
uh,

802
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:56,334
while,

803
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,130
uh,

804
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,970
were picking the jury because there's
not enough room for everyone in here.

805
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:00,901
Uh,

806
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:02,010
the lawyer objected,

807
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,220
raised it on appeal to
the Georgia Supreme Court,

808
00:24:05,221 --> 00:24:07,140
and the United States Supreme Court said,

809
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,700
constitutional violation,

810
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,760
a defendant has a right to a public trial.

811
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,440
And if that right is violated,

812
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,200
the defendant gets a
new trial because again,

813
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,530
it's virtually impossible to
assess what difference it made.

814
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,101
A,

815
00:24:20,101 --> 00:24:22,440
but this is such a basic
and fundamental right,

816
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,200
uh,

817
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,010
that it's going to be
automatic a reversal,

818
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,000
um,

819
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,100
absence of the defendant from the trial.

820
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,240
Uh,

821
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,860
sometimes things go on.

822
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:32,371
Uh,

823
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:36,600
the defendant hasn't been brought over
from the jail or for whatever reason,

824
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,091
uh,

825
00:24:37,091 --> 00:24:39,660
if the defendant's absent
for the Tra from the trial,

826
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:40,231
uh,

827
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:42,000
that's going to be a,

828
00:24:42,001 --> 00:24:43,140
that's never going to be harmless,

829
00:24:43,141 --> 00:24:43,381
Sarah.

830
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:44,940
That's going to require a new trial.

831
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:45,420
Uh,

832
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,320
if that happened,

833
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,191
uh,

834
00:24:47,191 --> 00:24:47,880
and,

835
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,270
uh,

836
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:48,900
finally,

837
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,140
uh,

838
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,370
denial of,

839
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,200
uh,

840
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,470
an impartial judge,

841
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,121
uh,

842
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:53,954
again,

843
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,840
hard to know whether if a judge
is not fair and impartial,

844
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,480
uh,

845
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
the rulings were right or not.

846
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:00,990
Uh,

847
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,810
but the court had said
this is a basic right,

848
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,230
that,

849
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:04,740
uh,

850
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,420
that people have a,

851
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,300
and so if there's denial
of an impartial judge,

852
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:09,840
uh,

853
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,170
that's going to require
a reversal in cases.

854
00:25:13,171 --> 00:25:17,010
So you look first at these errors
to see are they structural areas,

855
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,360
those are going to be easy,

856
00:25:18,361 --> 00:25:19,440
assuming you can prove them,

857
00:25:19,441 --> 00:25:19,950
which,

858
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,720
which is often not easy,

859
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,590
uh,

860
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:26,580
or are the arrows which are subject
to a harmless Sarah Doctrine.

861
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,420
And if they are,

862
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,261
what's the harmless,

863
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:30,300
they're a doctrine that applies.

864
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:30,901
Well,

865
00:25:30,901 --> 00:25:33,450
I know this is a lot of
technical information,

866
00:25:33,451 --> 00:25:35,520
a lot of procedural information,

867
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:35,940
uh,

868
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,950
but it's critically
important in these cases,

869
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:38,490
uh,

870
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,430
because weather,

871
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,463
uh,

872
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,160
people,

873
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,610
uh,

874
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:46,610
are prevail on having their death sins
or their conviction set aside a is often

875
00:25:46,831 --> 00:25:51,831
going to depend on procedurally whether
it was properly presented to all the

876
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:52,771
courts,

877
00:25:52,771 --> 00:25:53,521
the state courts,

878
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:54,360
the federal courts.

879
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:55,330
Uh,

880
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:58,350
it's going to depend on who
has the burden of proof.

881
00:25:58,351 --> 00:26:02,160
Very often it's going to depend very
often on what the burden of proof was.

882
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:05,850
And even if a constitutional
violation is shown,

883
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,270
they're going to be a
harmless error standards,

884
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:09,880
uh,

885
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,713
applied,

886
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,640
uh,

887
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,790
that are going to
perhaps make it possible,

888
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,270
uh,

889
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,820
for the court to affirm a conviction.

890
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,300
A,

891
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,070
even though there's been
constitutional error,

892
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,990
we'll see all these things coming up,

893
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:22,710
uh,

894
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,600
in the materials that follow.
