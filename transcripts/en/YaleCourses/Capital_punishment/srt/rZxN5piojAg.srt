1
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,180
Death penalty cases if no court grants
relief for reverses the sentence into an

2
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:19,584
execution.

3
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:20,590
Uh,

4
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,990
the United States all,

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,501
most,

6
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:25,170
all of the states now have
gone to lethal injection.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:25,930
Uh,

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,930
there's been this procession of what's
the most humane way to execute people,

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,573
uh,

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,560
is that the firing squad he said,

11
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:35,394
hanging,

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:36,260
uh,

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,130
and the 1880s,

14
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:41,880
the governor of New York said that hanging
was barbaric and New York was going

15
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:42,840
to the electric chair.

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,950
Uh,

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,783
by,

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:45,540
uh,

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,021
you know,

20
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:46,370
the,

21
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:46,800
the,

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,200
the late part of the 20th century,

23
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:52,320
most people saw the electric
chair is being barbaric.

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,360
States also use the gas chamber,

25
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,320
uh,

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,460
to execute people.

27
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:57,420
But today,

28
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:57,930
uh,

29
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,340
the predominant way of executing
people in the United States is lethal

30
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:03,174
injection.

31
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,110
Uh,

32
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,280
it was seen as a,

33
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:05,950
you know,

34
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,781
more humane,

35
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:08,670
almost a medically type,

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,630
uh,

37
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,740
putting somebody to sleep,

38
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:12,630
like as if they were going
to have an operation.

39
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,290
But,

40
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:13,621
uh,

41
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:17,910
what we've seen in the last 40 years is
that lethal injection is not without its

42
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,744
problems.

43
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:19,561
Uh,

44
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:24,561
the case of a Ranell broom
a is a good case in point.

45
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:25,770
Uh,

46
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,170
he was set for execution by Ohio.

47
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,340
Uh,

48
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,780
they tried repeatedly to
inject him with a lethal drugs.

49
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:36,190
He even helped them by trying to find a,

50
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,760
a place to be injected.

51
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,210
Uh,

52
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,510
this went on for hours
before they finally gave up,

53
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,820
and he was not,

54
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,490
uh,

55
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,560
lethally injected.

56
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,790
Uh,

57
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,960
in 2014 there were executions
in which one person said,

58
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,450
I feel like my whole body's on fire.

59
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,110
Uh,

60
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,330
after the lethal drugs started
running into their body.

61
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:00,330
And another case,

62
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:00,901
uh,

63
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:05,901
the person made a lot of groaning and
guttural noises and twisted around for a

64
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:08,040
while before finally dying.

65
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:08,874
And so there's,

66
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,290
there's a controversy,

67
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,251
uh,

68
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:12,084
about,

69
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,510
uh,

70
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,420
what drugs should be used in this process.

71
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,140
Uh,

72
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,510
the availability of the drugs,

73
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,350
uh,

74
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,160
the qualifications of the people
who carry out the executions.

75
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:23,994
I mean,

76
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,710
a doctors will not carry out an execution
because of the hippocratic oath.

77
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,950
So the result is that often
a prison guards or maybe mts,

78
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,140
uh,

79
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,220
emergency medical technicians are the
ones who are inserting the needle into the

80
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:41,850
arm of the person.

81
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,021
Uh,

82
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:44,100
in Missouri,

83
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:47,550
it turned out that the person who was
in charge of lethal injections was

84
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:49,140
dyslexic dyslectic,

85
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:49,921
uh,

86
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,210
and was often,

87
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,440
uh,

88
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,410
operating in a little dark
room using a flashlight,

89
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,680
a telling other people how to
mix the drugs up and all that,

90
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:04,510
and was not being done with
any degree of precision at all.

91
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,231
Uh,

92
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:05,651
which,

93
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:10,390
which was alarming to the courts
as well as to to people in general.

94
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,470
Uh,

95
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,390
and the secrecy after,

96
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,141
uh,

97
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:18,850
the practices like that came to
light like the Missouri practices,

98
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,751
uh,

99
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:20,800
and after,

100
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:21,983
uh,

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,540
the suppliers and many of the drugs,

102
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,930
the suppliers and many of the drugs
pentobarbital and others in Europe,

103
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,800
uh,

104
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,730
increasingly,

105
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,660
uh,

106
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,300
would not make those drugs
available in the United States,

107
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:34,931
uh,

108
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:37,660
or wouldn't make them available if
they were going to be used for lethal

109
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:38,494
injection.

110
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,490
The result being that states
have had more and more trouble,

111
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,150
uh,

112
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,590
had more and more trouble finding
drugs to put people to death with,

113
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,460
uh,

114
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,540
some states,

115
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,590
notably Georgia,

116
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,341
uh,

117
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:52,031
important.

118
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,280
Some drugs from a somewhat fly by night.

119
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,270
A pharmacy that operated out
of a driving school in London,

120
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:58,960
uh,

121
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,960
was later a sees those drugs were
later sees by the Drug Enforcement

122
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,630
Administration,

123
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,021
uh,

124
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:08,620
which found that Georgia had illegally
imported the drugs and secondly had

125
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:10,270
illegally distributed the drugs,

126
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:10,840
uh,

127
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,130
to some other states.

128
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,413
Uh,

129
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:18,130
increasingly state started
using compounding pharmacies,

130
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:18,970
uh,

131
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,390
that is these local pharmacies
that put the drugs together.

132
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,523
Uh,

133
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,830
one judge by Judge Kermit by on the eight
circuit said some of these are about

134
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,150
equivalent of a high
school chemistry class.

135
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,570
And so there's been issues about whether
or not these compounding pharmacies can

136
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:41,200
actually provide drugs that
are effective for doing this.

137
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,370
Uh,

138
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,810
in response to that,

139
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:47,290
a lot of states have made
the whole process secret.

140
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,430
So you can't challenge it if
you don't know what's going on.

141
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:52,160
Uh,

142
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,980
if you don't know who's
carrying out the execution,

143
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:55,390
you don't know whether
they're qualified or not.

144
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,200
Uh,

145
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,100
some states have even gone so far
as to say the source of the drugs,

146
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,530
the compounding pharmacy is secret.

147
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,970
Everything is secret.

148
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,871
Uh,

149
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:05,704
and,

150
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,041
uh,

151
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,150
so the question is,

152
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:10,300
can you eliminate the legal issue,

153
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,810
uh,

154
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,050
just simply by cloaking the
whole process and secrecy?

155
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,740
Uh,

156
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,170
it doesn't really give one a
lot of confidence in the system.

157
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:19,990
The notion of a democracy is transparency,

158
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,890
uh,

159
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,120
but increasingly departments of
corrections are going to secrecy,

160
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:25,751
uh,

161
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:30,751
as a way to hide exactly what they're
doing in the lethal injection process.

162
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,250
A one stage justified this by saying,

163
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:33,530
well,

164
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,880
used to be a that the
hangman always wore a hood.

165
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:37,371
Uh,

166
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:39,100
so you didn't know who the hangman was.

167
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,850
Uh,

168
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,750
but it's a little bit different when
you're buying drugs from a pharmacy a than

169
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:47,200
when you're the person who
actually carries out the
execution and might not want

170
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:48,160
all your neighbors to,

171
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,053
to know about it.

172
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,423
Um,

173
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,400
Kentucky,

174
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,330
uh,

175
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,840
lawyers in Kentucky for a
person condemned to die.

176
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:57,920
Actually a couple of people
condemned to die raised,

177
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:58,910
uh,

178
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,860
the legality of lethal injection and a
case called Bayes versus Reese that went

179
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:06,530
before the supreme court in 2008,

180
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,023
uh,

181
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,980
the court rejected the argument looking
at a lot of its other cases and the

182
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:17,870
eighth amendment area in which
methods of execution had been upheld.

183
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:19,490
A firing squad had been upheld,

184
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,470
the electric chair had been upheld.

185
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,340
Uh,

186
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,070
and basically the court said,

187
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,350
and sort of a splintered court,

188
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,310
uh,

189
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,120
justice chief justice Roberts joined
by Justice Kennedy and Alito said,

190
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,330
the risk of pain is not so substantial
an eminent as to violate the eighth

191
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:38,504
amendment.

192
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,600
I should back up here and say the argument
that was being made on behalf of the

193
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:46,250
condemned men in this case,

194
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,941
uh,

195
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:48,470
was that they were,

196
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,250
uh,

197
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,080
being paralyzed.

198
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:51,841
Uh,

199
00:06:51,841 --> 00:06:56,150
and then these additional drugs
were being forced into their body.

200
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:56,910
Uh,

201
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,910
and if they were experiencing
excruciating pain a while these drugs,

202
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,210
we're acting upon them
until they finally stop,

203
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,470
stop the beating of the heart,

204
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,310
uh,

205
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,360
that would be cruel and unusual punishment
that would be unnecessary suffering

206
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:11,741
for,

207
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:12,351
it's very hard.

208
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:16,220
They were expert testimony saying that
it was very possible that this could

209
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:16,790
happen,

210
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,990
particularly if you had
people administering the
drugs that didn't know what

211
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:21,824
they were doing.

212
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,010
Because if you administered
the wrong dose,

213
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,450
the first drug would induce
sleep or put the person,

214
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,010
make the person unconscious.

215
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,701
Uh,

216
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:36,701
the second drug would paralyze the person
would eventually cause suffocation if

217
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:38,180
nothing else happened.

218
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,650
But then the final drug,

219
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,311
uh,

220
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:41,020
was,

221
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,270
uh,

222
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,770
to stop the beating of the heart.

223
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,580
Uh,

224
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,120
but the,

225
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,490
the question was whether when
that drug was administered,

226
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:47,271
the person could,

227
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:49,700
could feel what was going on or not.

228
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:50,923
Uh,

229
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,793
Roberts,

230
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,371
Kennedy,

231
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,210
Alito say,

232
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:53,991
uh,

233
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:54,440
that,

234
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:54,920
uh,

235
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,060
Kentucky is doing enough.

236
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:58,700
They're minimizing the chance that
anything is going to go wrong.

237
00:07:59,090 --> 00:07:59,661
Uh,

238
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:01,230
and they're not required.

239
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:01,371
The,

240
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:02,870
there may be a better way to do it,

241
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,810
but it states aren't required
to do it the best way.

242
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,431
Uh,

243
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:09,810
they're just required not to take a,

244
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,193
uh,

245
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,500
they certainly can involve the
gratuitous infliction of pain,

246
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,311
uh,

247
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:20,720
and they can't take a substantial
risk of that kind of thing happening.

248
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:21,471
Well,

249
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:22,610
justice Stevens,

250
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,450
uh,

251
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,600
said that under the court's
proceed under the prior cases,

252
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:28,040
he thought it was acceptable.

253
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,990
He also took the opportunity here to
say that based on his many years on the

254
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:33,381
court,

255
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:38,120
he had come to the conclusion that the
death pulling no longer a was serving

256
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,760
anything but negligible value.

257
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,000
That the purpose lists
taking of human life was,

258
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:44,660
uh,

259
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,710
making only the most marginal
contributions to society.

260
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:49,544
And therefore,

261
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:49,940
uh,

262
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,773
probably,

263
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,590
uh,

264
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,041
was,

265
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,920
was disproportionate unconstitutional.

266
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,470
Uh,

267
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,170
this was very late in his career on the,

268
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:58,530
on,

269
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,363
on the court,

270
00:08:59,610 --> 00:08:59,941
uh,

271
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:01,950
Justice Scalia and Thomas said,

272
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,010
unless it was deliberately cruel,

273
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,640
there was no problem.

274
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:09,000
So unless the state was trying to
inflict a punishment that was curl,

275
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,220
no constitutional problem.

276
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:11,970
Uh,

277
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,110
justice Bryer,

278
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:13,950
uh,

279
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,850
said that based on his reading and things,

280
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,853
Kentucky,

281
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,040
uh,

282
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,630
method did not result in an
unnecessary risk of suffering a,

283
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,720
so he concurred.

284
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,590
Uh,

285
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,000
but Justice Ginsburg,

286
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:27,601
uh,

287
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,890
joined by Justice Souter descended,

288
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,510
uh,

289
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,790
saying that in their view,

290
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,930
uh,

291
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,920
the Kentucky,

292
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,370
uh,

293
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,780
procedures were not adequate.

294
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:39,420
They were eighth amendment
grounds that were raised.

295
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,140
Uh,

296
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,240
but those were just
two out of seven votes.

297
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:42,870
Uh,

298
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,130
so it looked like at the time
that bass came down there,

299
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:50,280
this is pretty much the end of any
challenges to lethal injection.

300
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,720
This is in 2008,

301
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,370
but since that time,

302
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,360
uh,

303
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,100
there have continued to be and probably
will continue to be a number of

304
00:09:59,101 --> 00:09:59,934
challenges,

305
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,420
uh,

306
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,440
to lethal injection,

307
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,940
uh,

308
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,870
in Kentucky when this case went back
when bays versus Reese went back to

309
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:07,704
Kentucky,

310
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,460
it was pointed out that they had to
go through the Kentucky Administrative

311
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:12,390
Procedures Act,

312
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,200
uh,

313
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,240
to set up a new execution protocol.

314
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,600
And so all of the executions were put on
hold until such time as that was done.

315
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:22,890
That was also,

316
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,600
uh,

317
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,630
done in California,

318
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,231
uh,

319
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:26,470
ending sort of stop it.

320
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,720
There were already,

321
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:28,590
uh,

322
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,410
litigation about lethal
injection in California.

323
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,380
And this added one more element to that.

324
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,430
Uh,

325
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,450
there's also,

326
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,380
uh,

327
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,480
questions about the
compounding pharmacies,

328
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:41,010
questions about the secrecy,

329
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:41,581
uh,

330
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:43,350
all of those kinds of things.

331
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,184
So,

332
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:44,550
uh,

333
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,540
while lethal injection was seen as
a way to make the death penalty more

334
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,374
acceptable,

335
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,220
uh,

336
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,200
it hasn't quite turned out that way.

337
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,010
Uh,

338
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,710
some states have even thought about
going back to the firing squad.

339
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:56,760
Uh,

340
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,790
and of course if it's in,

341
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:03,690
it's really the only way to ensure
the death of a person that's quick,

342
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:04,524
painless,

343
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,130
uh,

344
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:05,963
and so forth.

345
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:06,991
Hard.

346
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:09,570
Imagine Utah still uses a firing squad.

347
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:11,700
Some other states are talking
about bringing it back.

348
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:12,421
Uh,

349
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,650
I suppose one other,

350
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,220
uh,

351
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,520
method of execution that might
be considered as the guillotine,

352
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,800
which also was very fast,

353
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,551
uh,

354
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:21,330
and,

355
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:21,730
uh,

356
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,290
didn't result in any lingering pain or
any of the risks involved with lethal

357
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,124
injection.

358
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,520
Uh,

359
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,750
but we're probably not going to go there
and probably not going to go to the

360
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:31,920
firing squad either.

361
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:36,921
Some states have also said they'll
fall back on electrocution if need be.

362
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,360
But other states like Georgia
have declared electrocution
unconstitutional under

363
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:43,710
its state constitution.

364
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,201
Uh,

365
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:45,360
so that's not an option.

366
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,643
So,

367
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,340
uh,

368
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:47,761
again,

369
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:51,480
lethal injection was supposed to make
capital punishment more acceptable,

370
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:52,620
more anesthetic.

371
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,780
Uh,

372
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,120
it,

373
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,500
it hasn't quite worked out that way.

374
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,070
Yeah.
