1
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,521
Professor Wireless.

2
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:17,521
Sandy's is a professor of criminal
justice at the Indiana University in

3
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:19,624
Bloomington,

4
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,210
Indiana for a number of years now.

5
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:26,230
She's worked as a part of the
capitol jury project and professors.

6
00:00:26,231 --> 00:00:28,060
Sandy's thank you so much for joining us.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,230
And could I ask you to start by just
telling us what the Capitol jury project

8
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:35,230
has been doing and how
long it's been doing it?

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,560
Sure.

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,210
Um,

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,590
thank you for inviting me.

12
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:39,424
I'm,

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,760
I've been a part of the capitol jury
project since it started in 1991.

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:45,730
Um,

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,960
it began with funding from the National
Science Foundation at that time,

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:50,800
um,

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,940
and it has continued to receive funding
from the National Science Foundation

18
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:57,880
over and three separate occasions.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:58,390
Uh,

20
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:03,390
the project began with 14 separate states
being involved in that first phase of

21
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:05,230
the project.

22
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,130
Um,

23
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:11,130
and it involved having professors of
both law and social science across the

24
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:16,411
countries working together with a core
set of questions that we interview,

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,320
uh,

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,490
face to face interviews
with capitol jurors and the,

27
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:30,150
the interviews chronicle the jurors entire
experience with they're having served

28
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,530
on a capital case.

29
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:37,830
So from the very first time that they
may have heard about the crime to when

30
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:39,580
they were selected for a jury,

31
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:43,390
how they were selected for
the jury to the guilt phase,

32
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:44,890
the guilt deliberations,

33
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:46,060
penalty phase,

34
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:47,590
penalty deliberations,

35
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,870
and even after the trial,

36
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,560
any,

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:50,861
you know,

38
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,690
experiences that they had.

39
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,970
And today in that phase,

40
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:59,971
we've now had interviews with
1,198 or across the country.

41
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,330
Um,

42
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,163
um,

43
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,250
these interviews,

44
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:03,941
as I said,

45
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:08,170
our face to face interviews and they
take on average about three and a half to

46
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:09,940
four hours to complete.

47
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,120
And do you interview jurors who have said
on both cases where the death penalty

48
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:19,020
was imposed as well as swim
life imprisonment was imposed?

49
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,323
Yes.

50
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,200
As part of our sampling protocol
in each one of the jurisdictions,

51
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:25,034
we,

52
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,611
uh,

53
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:29,140
selected samples specifically
trying to get equal numbers.

54
00:02:29,141 --> 00:02:32,900
Sometimes it's a little bit easier to
get one type of case versus the other,

55
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:37,901
but for the most part we ended up with
right around 55% who had served on death

56
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:41,900
penalty cases and 45% would
serve down life cases.

57
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,300
And you and your colleagues
who are academics throughout.

58
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:47,320
And as you said,

59
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:47,800
lawyers,

60
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,180
law professors throughout the country
have published a number of articles,

61
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:52,871
uh,

62
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:53,920
on what your findings,

63
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:54,970
so Ben from,

64
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,050
from these interviews,

65
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:56,884
is that correct?

66
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,010
That is correct.

67
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,000
I think there's,

68
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,241
you know,

69
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:01,100
some 50 odd articles,

70
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,180
uh,

71
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,180
probably close to a dozen
dissertations at this point.

72
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:08,720
So it's been an ongoing
program of research.

73
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,700
Yes.

74
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,540
Could you tell us,

75
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:10,841
I mean,

76
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:15,841
if you've done any research on when
jurors start making up their mind about

77
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,760
punishment and capital cases?

78
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,540
Okay,

79
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:19,781
sure.

80
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:22,990
That was one of the very first
articles that colleagues,

81
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:26,260
and I should know that the principal
investigator on the project is Professor

82
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:27,250
William Bowers.

83
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:29,860
And one of the first
articles that he and I,

84
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,600
and I believe it was Ben Steiner,

85
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,070
Larry Steiner road,

86
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:35,410
was looking at foreclosed and partiality.

87
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,470
And it really became evident to us,

88
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,610
um,

89
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,200
that the jurors were really making their
decisions very early on in the case.

90
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:44,550
And,

91
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,550
and what I mean by that is that we ask
that your ears at the end of the penalty

92
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:50,460
phase at the,

93
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,040
excuse me,

94
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,461
by the end,

95
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:52,510
at the end of the guilt phase,

96
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,340
before you started the penalty phase,

97
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,760
did you then think that the defendant
should be given a sentence of death?

98
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:00,730
Do you think they should be given a
sentence of life or were you uncertain?

99
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,920
And as you can see in the first slide,

100
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:07,921
what we found is that basically 50% of
the jurors remained undecided as to what

101
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,460
they believe the appropriate penalty
should be at that particular time.

102
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,510
And additional
approximately 30% said that,

103
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,200
um,

104
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,690
death was the appropriate
penalty at that time.

105
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,860
And an additional 20% said that they
believe that life was the appropriate

106
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,720
penalty at that time.

107
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,180
And so what that really said to us was
that even though we have this bifurcation

108
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:34,690
of proceedings where the
guild and penalty phases,

109
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,070
they're supposed to be separate,

110
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:36,910
um,

111
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,800
while they may be separate physically,

112
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:39,970
psychologically,

113
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:41,470
that's not always the case.

114
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:44,890
And that jurors are really
talking about thinking about,

115
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,490
um,

116
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,050
the penalty long before the
penalty phase of the trial

117
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,000
and of course contrary to the instructions
so that they receive from the judge,

118
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,350
which is not to make up their mind
about punishment until after the penalty

119
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:03,130
phase and even then not to make up their
mind until after the closing arguments

120
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,720
and the instruction of the court.

121
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,260
But you're finding that
much earlier in the process.

122
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:08,921
Jurists are,

123
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:12,520
are reaching tentative conclusions
about the sentence in the case.

124
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,391
Definitely.

125
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:19,250
And I think part of that comes in because
of the jury selection process as well.

126
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:19,910
Um,

127
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,410
jurors are being asked very early on
obviously about their views on the death

128
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:26,630
penalty and the extent to
which they could vote for it.

129
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:30,680
And so to all of a sudden come in and
start with issues related to the death

130
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:32,270
penalty and then stop and say,

131
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:32,481
okay,

132
00:05:32,481 --> 00:05:34,220
now you can't really consider it.

133
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,290
Um,

134
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:35,630
Eh,

135
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,660
during the guilt phase
is really difficult.

136
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,200
Um,

137
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,190
these are people obviously who for the
most part are not trained in the law.

138
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,730
Um,

139
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,240
they don't necessarily understand the,

140
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:46,840
you know,

141
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,990
the differences,

142
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:52,490
the slight little differences of what
may be required at different times of the

143
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:57,380
trial and to all of sudden ask for
where they stand on the death and their

144
00:05:57,381 --> 00:06:01,430
ability to vote or to ability to
consider the penalty and then say it's

145
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:03,710
irrelevant I think is a little difficult.

146
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:04,700
When you hear,

147
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,151
you know,

148
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:07,850
the evidence presented in the guilt phase,

149
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,640
have you found anything about people's
preferences for the duff going into death

150
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,580
penalty trials?

151
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,270
Um,

152
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,300
well one of the things that
we asked all of these jurors,

153
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:19,810
um,

154
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,310
was a specific question asking whether
they thought that the death penalty was

155
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:26,140
the only acceptable punishment,

156
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:26,771
uh,

157
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:30,490
whether they saw thought it was an
acceptable punishment or unacceptable as a

158
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:33,310
punishment for a variety of
different kinds of murders.

159
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,960
It might be death eligible.

160
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,700
And what you can see here
in the next slide is,

161
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,570
um,

162
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,520
we asked specifically,

163
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,000
um,

164
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,060
what percent of these jurors indicated
that they thought that death would be the

165
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,860
only acceptable punishment.

166
00:06:47,861 --> 00:06:52,360
And for the one question about murder by
someone previously convicted of murder,

167
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:55,600
you can see that it's almost
72% of these jurors said,

168
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,120
and these are jurors who had served.

169
00:06:57,121 --> 00:07:00,250
So they'd been found qualified
to serve on a death penalty case.

170
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,750
Almost 72% of them said that they thought
that death was the only acceptable

171
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:06,010
punishment for a person.

172
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:06,850
Um,

173
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,350
previously convicted of murder.

174
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,461
Similarly,

175
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:14,320
57% thought that death was the only
acceptable punishment for a planned

176
00:07:14,321 --> 00:07:16,360
premeditated murder and the like.

177
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,590
And so for many of these jurors,

178
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,000
um,

179
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,110
what you're seeing is that death is
seen as really the only acceptable

180
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:28,111
punishment for several of the kinds of
crimes that are death eligible and end up

181
00:07:28,871 --> 00:07:30,640
being these capital cases.

182
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,590
And these are jurors who said,

183
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:33,940
who actually served.

184
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:38,941
So the jury selection process did not
identify these people as being biased in

185
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:41,020
favor of the death pump,

186
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,420
even though they clearly were.

187
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:44,771
Yes.

188
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:45,370
I mean,

189
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,630
these were all jurors who had
actually served on capital cases.

190
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,510
They clearly had made it
through the death qualification,

191
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:54,250
life qualification process.

192
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,480
Um,

193
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,070
one of the things that we've done also
is to look a little bit more at some of

194
00:08:00,071 --> 00:08:00,904
the,

195
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:04,030
the questioning of
jurors in capital cases.

196
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:09,031
And this has been done more recently
focus primarily actually in Kentucky.

197
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,420
Um,

198
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,800
where we did a slight little variation
where we asked an additional question

199
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:18,040
trying to look at the Morgan type question
and whether somebody could consider a

200
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,690
sentence of life.

201
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,490
Let me just interrupt
you there for a second.

202
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,780
For the four,

203
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,200
are those watching and Morgan,

204
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:27,820
you mean Morgan Versus Illinois?

205
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,620
The case that said a person could be
disqualified if they felt so strongly in

206
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:37,480
favor of the death penalty
that they couldn't fairly
consider life imprisonment.

207
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,980
Correct.

208
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,910
That that's Morgan.

209
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:40,661
I was referring to.

210
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:41,230
Thank you.

211
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,063
Thank you.

212
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,680
And um,

213
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,700
when we asked the jurors that one of the
things that we did in Kentucky was to

214
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:52,210
look at their responses to
that kind of general question.

215
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:55,570
And then what we did was to
compare it to the actual,

216
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,120
they're descriptions of how
they made their decisions.

217
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,990
And what you find is that there's a
disconnect that you're sometimes believe

218
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:03,520
that they could be fair.

219
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,200
You know,

220
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,930
it could be fair,

221
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,070
they could be impartial,

222
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,540
they would not be,

223
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,350
you know,

224
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,710
they would not necessarily
just vote for death.

225
00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:13,720
At least that's how they
see it at the outset.

226
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:18,340
And yet part of it is once they are
exposed to some of the facts of the cases,

227
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:23,341
what you find is that they are incapable
of considering anything other than a

228
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:24,880
sentence of death.

229
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,270
And so we're looking at these
differences in terms of at the outset,

230
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:31,420
these traditional automatic
death penalty voters,

231
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,580
people who juring jury selection.

232
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,820
You could ask and somebody could consider
and they could think about it and be

233
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:39,640
very honest and sincere
in their responses.

234
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,680
But to the extent that attorneys are not
allowed to ask pretty expansive kinds

235
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:45,670
of questions,

236
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,860
jurors aren't necessarily don't know what
kinds of situations they may be faced

237
00:09:50,861 --> 00:09:51,041
with.

238
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,600
And so they can say very honestly,

239
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:53,620
during jury selection,

240
00:09:53,621 --> 00:09:56,950
of course I could consider a
variety of different penalties.

241
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,160
And yet when they are exposed to the
particulars of the facts of these capital

242
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:04,330
cases,

243
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,230
they realize that death might be the
only acceptable punishment that they can

244
00:10:08,231 --> 00:10:09,064
see.

245
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,430
Let me ask you this.

246
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:12,440
Have you looked into jury instructions?

247
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:14,810
Lawyers think jury
instructions are important,

248
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:18,920
but one sitting in a courtroom kind of
wonders if anybody understands the jury

249
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:19,760
instructions.

250
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:20,420
Uh,

251
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,380
have you looked into that?

252
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,880
That is one of the other areas that we've
addressed as part of the Capitol jury

253
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:26,541
project.

254
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:31,320
And one of the professors who was
involved in the initial phases of the jury

255
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,450
project was,

256
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,780
um,

257
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,420
and then by the name of
Professor James Logan Buell,

258
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,030
who had done some work in North Carolina,

259
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:38,870
um,

260
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,600
looking at instructions in capital cases.

261
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:46,370
And so we ended up adopting
some of his questions,

262
00:10:46,371 --> 00:10:50,660
which was really basically looking at how
jurors understand whether they have to

263
00:10:50,661 --> 00:10:53,690
be unanimous on mitigation and the like.

264
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,440
Um,

265
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,980
and as you can see in this next slide,

266
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,060
um,

267
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,830
what we have here is that,

268
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,550
uh,

269
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,130
almost,

270
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:02,390
you know,

271
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,320
45%,

272
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:08,321
44.6% of the jurors fail to understand
that they can consider anything in

273
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:09,711
mitigation.

274
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,650
And this is going to the
average across all states.

275
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,920
A 66.5% did not know that they did not
have to be unanimous on mitigation.

276
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,700
Um,

277
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,770
let me just back up there and just say,

278
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,000
the Supreme Court has held that
jurors do not have to be unanimous on

279
00:11:27,001 --> 00:11:27,691
mitigation,

280
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:29,640
that any juror can say,

281
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:34,020
I think it's a mitigating factor even
though the other 11 or two can say that.

282
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:34,890
And the other 10,

283
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,113
uh,

284
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,710
each juror makes an individual decision
and do not have to be unanimous on

285
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:41,311
mitigation.

286
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:43,590
You're telling me that
jurors don't understand that?

287
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,751
Definitely not.

288
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:48,020
We had almost two thirds of
the jurors indicated as much.

289
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:48,860
Um,

290
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,150
we also had almost a half,

291
00:11:50,151 --> 00:11:54,740
49% of the jurors said that they did not
know that mitigations did not need to

292
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:56,780
be found beyond reasonable doubt.

293
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,420
They come in and believe in
that that's the standard.

294
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,080
Um,

295
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,520
and less,

296
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:05,930
but still almost a third were unaware
of the fact that aggravators had to be

297
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:07,550
proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

298
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:12,440
And so there's a pretty consistent
pattern here of jurors not being able to

299
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:13,760
understand the instructions.

300
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:14,300
But there's,

301
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,040
there's also been a lot of additional
research outside of the Capitol Jury

302
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,650
Project that I think speaks
to this issue as well,

303
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:22,760
which is,

304
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,031
you know,

305
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:23,841
research done.

306
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:27,470
A lot of it has been done on college
campuses and looking at ways in which you

307
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:30,200
might be able to increase comprehension.

308
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:33,350
It's one thing to say that jurors
don't understand the instructions.

309
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,490
It's another thing to say,

310
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,060
well,

311
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,450
is it possible to improve the
comprehension of the instructions?

312
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,490
And there've been two sort of different
types of programs of research done in

313
00:12:43,491 --> 00:12:44,324
this area.

314
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,160
One is,

315
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:46,520
uh,

316
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,780
working with linguists,

317
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:51,140
so having lawyers and
judges and everybody,

318
00:12:51,141 --> 00:12:51,351
you know,

319
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:56,120
all parties involved work with a linguist
and other social scientists to try to

320
00:12:56,121 --> 00:13:01,121
rework the instructions in a way that
obviously is keeping to the legal

321
00:13:01,341 --> 00:13:01,971
requirements,

322
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:04,100
but also making them more understandable.

323
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,820
And what you can find under those
circumstances is you can't improve the

324
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:08,654
comprehension.

325
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,201
Um,

326
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:11,840
there are studies that have found
comprehension improved up to,

327
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,081
you know,

328
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:16,520
70 some I think there was one that
was over 90% of comprehension.

329
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,300
So,

330
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,130
so that is possible.

331
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,100
There's also been another
avenue of research.

332
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,700
Um,

333
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,190
that has done the same
thing in some respect,

334
00:13:25,191 --> 00:13:27,920
but instead of just asking
these kinds of questions,

335
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:31,940
which I think are really important
and indicative of comprehension,

336
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,420
this other avenue has
presented people with,

337
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,573
um,

338
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,970
these vignettes.

339
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,860
So instead of just saying,

340
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:43,640
can they sort of understand
the particular instruction,

341
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,320
are they applying it correctly?

342
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,670
So for example,

343
00:13:46,671 --> 00:13:48,800
you could give a vignette of,

344
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,100
you know,

345
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,530
two to three sentences of a jury.

346
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,461
Um,

347
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:53,490
is dis,

348
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:53,860
you know,

349
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,610
was discussing mitigation.

350
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,670
One of the jurors believes that the
person's history of child abuse was a

351
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:03,680
mitigator.

352
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,560
The 11 other jurors do
not agree with that.

353
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,320
They therefore do not discuss,

354
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,130
uh,

355
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,380
the defendant's child abuse has,

356
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,290
has the jury operated in
accordance with the law.

357
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,320
So it's a way to test
not just comprehension,

358
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:19,310
but the application,

359
00:14:19,311 --> 00:14:22,430
which really is what's
critical here as well.

360
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,500
So we may be putting a
little more trust in juries,

361
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,610
uh,

362
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,930
then perhaps we should,

363
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:30,730
in terms of how well they understand,

364
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,630
uh,

365
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,350
what's going on in terms of the
biases they bring into the process.

366
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,700
Um,

367
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,600
is that what you're finding?

368
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,150
You know,

369
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,340
I,

370
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,560
I'm a firm believer in,

371
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,350
I think that jurors do
the best that they can,

372
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,350
but I think there's a lot more that
the courts could do to help them.

373
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,311
Um,

374
00:14:49,311 --> 00:14:54,311
I think that by not explaining the
instructions or perhaps not writing the

375
00:14:56,301 --> 00:15:00,590
instructions in a way that's
really conducive to two jurors,

376
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:02,600
I think is really doing a disservice.

377
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,380
I think.

378
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,750
I think there are steps
that could be taken,

379
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,913
um,

380
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,810
that would help the process.

381
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:12,650
So I think jurors like anybody who's
going to come in with certain biases.

382
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,300
Um,

383
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,960
and I think the benefit or the potential
benefit is to be able to explain to

384
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:22,961
them how those biases operating to sort
of help them and be able to determine,

385
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:28,121
allow the attorneys to determine whether
there's such expansive kinds of biases

386
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:31,610
that this would really impact
the fairness of the trial.

387
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,560
Or is it through the process
of instructions where you
could try to guide the

388
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:41,561
jurors in ways that they can
really understand what is
being asked of them under

389
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:42,860
these circumstances.

390
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:47,440
And do you have any sense of the extent
to which courts are trying to do that?

391
00:15:47,441 --> 00:15:52,441
I mean our summon a state trying to do
it or other national efforts to try to

392
00:15:52,991 --> 00:15:57,991
make jury instructions easier to
understand and to apply or do you know,

393
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:00,301
you know,

394
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:03,900
you hear periodically of different
jurisdictions where they have really

395
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:06,840
attempted to improve the instructions.

396
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,470
Um,

397
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,190
I think,

398
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,023
um,

399
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,380
I I know that here in Indiana there,

400
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,070
you know,

401
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,930
have tried to improve instructions.

402
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,460
I know in other jurisdictions,

403
00:16:17,461 --> 00:16:18,840
I know more recently,

404
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,170
um,

405
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,640
I believe it's in Massachusetts,

406
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:22,680
they've really looked
at eyewitness testimony,

407
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,480
obviously not capital cases,

408
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:27,360
but the different
jurisdictions have really,

409
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:27,830
you know,

410
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,070
our,

411
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,920
our beginning,

412
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,990
they've done understood I
think for quite some time,

413
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:34,950
but there's some jurisdictions and some
judges I would say who are more likely

414
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:36,120
to take the lead.

415
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,540
Um,

416
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,470
there's the center for jury studies that
has been doing a little bit of work in

417
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:42,090
this area as well.

418
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,601
Um,

419
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:43,434
and I,

420
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,350
so I don't know of one state
where I could say to you,

421
00:16:46,351 --> 00:16:46,591
you know,

422
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:50,670
this is a state that has really done
a lot to improve their instructions.

423
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,780
Um,

424
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,440
I think where,

425
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,650
and I've heard of
instructions being changed.

426
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,580
Oftentimes,

427
00:16:56,581 --> 00:16:59,400
I don't know that there are these kinds
of studies that I'm talking about that

428
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:00,960
occur at the outset.

429
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:05,990
I think what ends up happening is that
they go in and the committees will revise

430
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:07,530
the instructions and you know,

431
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,180
they'll probably be improved.

432
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:09,900
Um,

433
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,080
but then you'll have a social scientists
going after and test it and say,

434
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:13,201
well,

435
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:14,010
wait a second.

436
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:14,251
You know,

437
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:18,150
your comprehension may have
improved from 40% to 60%.

438
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,020
Um,

439
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,980
is that enough?

440
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,530
Are there ways that we could
have improved it even more?

441
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,280
So?

442
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,750
I'm not familiar.

443
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,381
There may be,

444
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:29,520
but I'm not familiar with jurisdictions
that have really adopted that kind of

445
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:30,354
model.

446
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,210
So what do we know for sure is that this
is certainly something that needs to be

447
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:35,960
done.

448
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,960
If jurors are going to be able to do
their job the way they're supposed to.

449
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,410
I believe that.

450
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:42,244
Yes.

451
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:42,941
And you know,

452
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:43,960
one of the things that I,

453
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,190
I've looked at independent of these
kinds of studies that I've just talked

454
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:48,371
about,

455
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:49,204
is trying to,

456
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,940
why is it that the jurors do
not understand the instructions?

457
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,990
Um,

458
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,750
I can tell you that anytime
I've read an instruction,

459
00:17:57,751 --> 00:17:58,740
I'm confused.

460
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:00,660
I inevitably call a lawyer and say,

461
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:02,850
what exactly do they mean by this?

462
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,320
There are many different ways in which
the instructions could be misinterpreted.

463
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:12,590
And so one of the things that I did
just one day decided I would just run

464
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:14,700
through the instructions.

465
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:15,300
Um,

466
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,320
I was giving a talk in Kentucky and
decided that I would run the instructions

467
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:24,321
through word and see what word would tell
us was the comprehension level and the

468
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:26,160
level of understanding for that.

469
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:30,720
And if you've ever written an article or
you know any kind of paper and word you

470
00:18:30,721 --> 00:18:33,390
can ask it to just tell
you what the level is,

471
00:18:33,391 --> 00:18:35,400
the grade level of the,

472
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,630
the document.

473
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,110
Um,

474
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,880
as anybody on a university campus,

475
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:42,090
when you submit materials
for conducting research,

476
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:43,770
oftentimes when they're being reviewed,

477
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:44,480
they say you should,

478
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:44,731
you know,

479
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:47,220
be writing them at a certain grade level.

480
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:50,840
And so I decided to sort
of throw those through a,

481
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,230
read them through word.

482
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,070
Um,

483
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,570
and you can see on this next slide that
I just took the actual quotes from word.

484
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:58,404
When they say this,

485
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,490
these are the tests that they run
and they have the flesh reading ease,

486
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:03,181
which you know,

487
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:04,860
goes from zero to 100.

488
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:06,870
It's a hundred point scale and they,

489
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,131
their target,

490
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:10,140
there's from 60 to 70,

491
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,660
and then they have the grade level index,

492
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:14,430
which is just our standard grade level.

493
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:14,670
You know,

494
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:14,941
if you,

495
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:18,870
and they say we recommend that you should
be writing your document documents at

496
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:20,880
a seventh to eighth grade level.

497
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:25,800
And so when I ran some of
these instructions through
from Kentucky and all I did

498
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:27,810
was take their pattern instructions,

499
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,531
um,

500
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:29,364
and I,

501
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,100
I tried to make them
as simple as possible.

502
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,510
So I only had one,

503
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,520
let's say aggravating circumstance,

504
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:39,900
one mitigating circumstance and tried
to make them pretty straight forward.

505
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,380
Um,

506
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,640
whichever ones they were listed,

507
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:43,620
but just try to make it pretty direct.

508
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,340
Um,

509
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,200
and you'll see here the first,

510
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,220
um,

511
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,930
even so says instruction too,

512
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:52,320
but here's one that's looking
at mitigating circumstances.

513
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:53,400
And when I read,

514
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,120
you know,

515
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,510
conducted the head were run
the readability statistics.

516
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:01,590
You can see that the flesh reading e so
that's the one from the scale from you

517
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:01,740
know,

518
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,280
a hundred point scale that was
at 42 that's supposed to be,

519
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:09,990
they suggest words as it should be
between 60 and 70 and the grade level was

520
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:14,991
14.2 so you're talking about at least a
sophomore level of college that you're

521
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:18,510
expecting for your jurors.

522
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,090
When you look at
aggravating circumstances,

523
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:26,091
the ease level goes down a little 30.8
but the grade level also goes down a

524
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:26,730
little.

525
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,120
So it's more difficult to re to re.

526
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,930
Um,

527
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,450
but it's also a little
bit more understanding,

528
00:20:33,451 --> 00:20:35,280
greater understanding of the grade level.

529
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,560
Only need a high school education,

530
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:41,730
but it's that last one that gets me
in Kentucky where you'd look at your

531
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:43,590
authorized sentences.

532
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,520
Um,

533
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,120
and again,

534
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,340
this is just the pattern
and the test results.

535
00:20:49,341 --> 00:20:54,341
They're reading it ease is
15.7 on a hundred point scale.

536
00:20:54,891 --> 00:20:57,440
That's supposed to be between 60 and 70.

537
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,890
And the grade level is 23.8.

538
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,770
And so it's beyond college.

539
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:06,230
It's a beyond a phd.

540
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,060
It's a phd and a JD.

541
00:21:08,061 --> 00:21:08,630
I mean it's,

542
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,560
it's a really,

543
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,030
as you might imagine,

544
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:16,390
a really high threshold to expect jurors
to be able to understand what's being

545
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:17,330
asked of them.

546
00:21:17,331 --> 00:21:21,950
And so to me it's no great surprise that
they may revert back to what they think

547
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:22,671
is the right way,

548
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:26,690
but what they think oftentimes may not be,

549
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,660
especially when we are talking
about issues related to mitigation,

550
00:21:29,661 --> 00:21:33,770
because I think what happens is jurors
come into court with this understanding

551
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:34,604
of your,

552
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,140
you have 12 jurors.

553
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,070
It has to be proof beyond a reasonable
doubt and everybody has to agree,

554
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,580
well that may be true
for your standard case.

555
00:21:43,581 --> 00:21:44,990
It may be true for the guilt phase,

556
00:21:44,991 --> 00:21:47,180
it may be true for your aggravators,

557
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,760
but it's not true for your mitigators.

558
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:54,470
And so if jurors don't understand that
and they're not told that in a way that

559
00:21:54,471 --> 00:21:55,910
they can understand it,

560
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:01,070
they may be dismissing very compelling
mitigation because they think they cannot

561
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,210
really consider it.

562
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,840
Sandy,

563
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,430
this is a fascinating information.

564
00:22:09,431 --> 00:22:13,510
It gives us an awful lot to think
about and I am most grateful to you for

565
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,970
sharing your knowledge and
your time with us here.

566
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,890
It's been my pleasure.

567
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,120
Thank you very much.
