1
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,990
One of the most controversial areas
in this very controversial subject of

2
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:19,010
capital punishment has been the
admission of victim impact evidence,

3
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,210
a testimony and other evidence about
the impact of the crime on the victim,

4
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:29,000
the person who was killed as well
as on the survivors of the victim,

5
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:31,250
the family of the victim.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,380
And uh,

7
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,130
the impact on the community.

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:34,940
Uh,

9
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,330
this kind of evidence was
admissible and non capital cases,

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:38,931
uh,

11
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:39,770
for some time,

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:40,610
uh,

13
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,500
when the death penalty was reinstated,

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,603
uh,

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,010
are often precense reports
that would be prepared.

16
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:49,550
And part of the pre sentence report
would say what the impact had been.

17
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,270
Uh,

18
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,550
these are both in homicide cases,

19
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:54,110
but also non homicide cases.

20
00:00:54,111 --> 00:00:55,220
What the impact had been,

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:55,761
uh,

22
00:00:55,761 --> 00:00:56,511
on the victims,

23
00:00:56,511 --> 00:00:57,740
how much money they lost,

24
00:00:57,741 --> 00:00:59,120
whether they suffered any injuries,

25
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:00,920
what their hospital bills were.

26
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:01,371
Uh,

27
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:02,570
that kind of evidence.

28
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:03,200
Uh,

29
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,200
but the most states had not provided for
that kind of evidence in their capital

30
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:10,004
cases.

31
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,281
Uh,

32
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:13,100
but one of the exceptions
was was Maryland.

33
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,293
Uh,

34
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,300
the Supreme Court is going to say in 1987
that it's not admissible in a case out

35
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:19,821
of Maryland,

36
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:24,170
which was about the only or one of very
few states that was allowing a victim

37
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:27,110
impact evidence in the penalty
phase of capital cases.

38
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:27,740
Uh,

39
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,240
but then very shortly after that,

40
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,010
the court would reverse itself in,

41
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:32,990
in 1991.

42
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:35,060
So we'll look at both these decisions,

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:35,661
uh,

44
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:40,080
and some of the questions raised by the
admission a victim impact evidence that

45
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,540
the first case,

46
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,231
uh,

47
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:42,770
was,

48
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,040
uh,

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,040
John Booth case out of
Maryland booth versus Maryland.

50
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:46,551
Uh,

51
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:49,100
and a written victim impact statement was,

52
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:49,490
uh,

53
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,061
presented,

54
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:51,320
which had the,

55
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,720
uh,

56
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,080
outstanding personal characteristics,

57
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:54,441
uh,

58
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:59,120
of the victim was one of the things that
was presented that urban Bronstein 78

59
00:01:59,121 --> 00:01:59,721
and his wife,

60
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:00,554
rose,

61
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:00,921
uh,

62
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,890
were robbed and murdered in
their West Baltimore home.

63
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:04,641
Uh,

64
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:07,100
the statement was read by the prosecutor,

65
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:07,891
uh,

66
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:09,590
that talked about their qualities.

67
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,041
Uh,

68
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:14,900
also talked about the
emotional and personal problems
that family members had as

69
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,130
a result of the crime.

70
00:02:16,131 --> 00:02:17,000
For example,

71
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,140
their son,

72
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,860
uh,

73
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,950
suffered from depression
and had trouble sleeping.

74
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:22,880
Uh,

75
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,370
he was fearful for the
first time in his life.

76
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,121
Uh,

77
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:26,740
and he,

78
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,380
he characterized the crime by saying
that his parents were butchered,

79
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:31,220
like animals.

80
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,941
Uh,

81
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:32,774
the daughter,

82
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,190
uh,

83
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,460
suffered also from lack of
sleep and become withdrawn
and distrustful a and said

84
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:43,670
she could not forgive booth for
having committed this horrible crime.

85
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,361
Uh,

86
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:47,810
and then a granddaughter said that the
murderer had just completely ruined a

87
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:49,400
wedding in the family because,

88
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:49,941
uh,

89
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:50,780
it had happened,

90
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,291
uh,

91
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,490
right after,

92
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,120
uh,

93
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,180
the wedding had happened right
after this terrible crime.

94
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,800
Uh,

95
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,760
and she also said she received counseling
but gave up on it because she didn't

96
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,860
think anything would do her any good.

97
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:04,720
So very powerful evidence.

98
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:04,841
Now,

99
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:08,140
this was not presented through the
witnesses as it often is today.

100
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,620
Uh,

101
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,430
it was presented by the prosecutor reading
this statement that had been prepared

102
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,930
by a,

103
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,700
a pre sentence report writer,

104
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:16,541
uh,

105
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,530
the Supreme Court,

106
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,663
uh,

107
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,113
uh,

108
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,681
as I said,

109
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:25,030
the opinions and characterizations
by the family members as well,

110
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,511
uh,

111
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:26,590
was part of what the,

112
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,290
what was included in that statement.

113
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,341
Uh,

114
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:35,341
in the case Justice Powell rights for
a very close five to four majority,

115
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,310
uh,

116
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,400
in the opinion two types of victim
impact evidence that comes in.

117
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,150
Uh,

118
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,440
and the question is,

119
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,040
uh,

120
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,910
first of all,

121
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,270
uh,

122
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,270
relevance is the impact evidence relevant
to the decision that the jury makes

123
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,190
about imposing the license
life imprisonment without
possibility of parole or

124
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:55,024
the death tunneling.

125
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:55,931
Uh,

126
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,310
and Justice Powell,

127
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,050
uh,

128
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,740
expresses the concern,

129
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,251
uh,

130
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:04,020
that admitting ms kind of evidence
could result in imposing the death sins,

131
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,540
uh,

132
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,630
because of factors about which
the defendant did not know,

133
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,470
uh,

134
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,970
wasn't aware of things,

135
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:10,181
uh,

136
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:10,871
about the,

137
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:13,540
the victim of the case
if it was a stranger,

138
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,171
uh,

139
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:14,800
and,

140
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,220
uh,

141
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,053
this would,

142
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,660
uh,

143
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,020
bring irrelevant factors into
the sentencing decisions.

144
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:20,610
Uh,

145
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,680
and so he said this creates
an impermissible risk,

146
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,191
uh,

147
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,510
that capital punishment,

148
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,683
uh,

149
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,263
resulted,

150
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,690
uh,

151
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,690
was imposed in an arbitrary manner
and violated the eighth amendment.

152
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,690
Uh,

153
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,580
he also talked about the evidence being,

154
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,210
uh,

155
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,210
very hard to rebut a that you would end
up with a distracting the jury because

156
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:44,110
there would be a mini trial,

157
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:44,950
uh,

158
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,910
on the victim.

159
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,540
Uh,

160
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,940
and that should not be allowed as well.

161
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,541
Uh,

162
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,340
with regard to the
second type of evidence,

163
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:53,320
the characterizations of the crimes,

164
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:53,981
uh,

165
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:55,300
justice Powell holes,

166
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:55,930
uh,

167
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,950
that they can serve no other purpose
except to inflame the jury and divert it

168
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:04,300
from deciding the case based upon
the relevant aggravating mitigating

169
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:07,570
circumstances about the crime
and about the defendant.

170
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,770
Um,

171
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,510
this draws a strong,

172
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,613
uh,

173
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,513
descent,

174
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,060
uh,

175
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,270
and we'll look at that because this is
ultimately going to be the prevailing

176
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,680
view of the court.

177
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,030
Justice White,

178
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:19,420
uh,

179
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,110
joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and
justice O'Connor and Justice Scalia

180
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,723
dissent,

181
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,210
uh,

182
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,150
their first point point that
we see from time to time,

183
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:28,751
uh,

184
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:32,860
is the question of what's a
judicial question and what's
for the legislatures to

185
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:33,694
decide.

186
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,940
And they basically say there's nothing
in the eighth amendment to the United

187
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,920
States constitution that prohibits
Maryland's legislature from deciding that

188
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:45,280
juries can consider this kind of evidence,

189
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:45,850
uh,

190
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,800
that we hold a murder accountable
for the harm that was caused.

191
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:51,520
Uh,

192
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,310
of course gives,

193
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,250
justice has given a number of examples.

194
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:56,710
If a person shoots a and Mrs,

195
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,260
uh,

196
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,520
they're guilty of one crime.

197
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:02,510
If they have the same intent and
shoot and hit and kill a person,

198
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,080
uh,

199
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,600
there's a completely
different punishment for it.

200
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,200
Uh,

201
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,680
so the court says we do measure the
harm caused not just the intent of the

202
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:10,071
person,

203
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,540
not just the act of the person,

204
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,220
but what harm is caused.

205
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,330
Uh,

206
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,640
they also say that the
state has an interest in,

207
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,290
uh,

208
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,470
balancing out the mitigating
circumstances that they've now allowed the

209
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,500
defendant to put on
anything in mitigation.

210
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,420
And therefore the state should be able
to counter that with evidence about the

211
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:30,254
victims.

212
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:30,891
Uh,

213
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:31,940
and finally,

214
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,073
uh,

215
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,400
the difference,

216
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,130
one of the questions that
Justice Powell raises,

217
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:37,521
we'll,

218
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:40,940
some survivors are going
to be much more articulate,

219
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:45,740
much better able to describe their loss
and their loved one than other people.

220
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,460
Uh,

221
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,560
justice white's says for the dissenters,

222
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,920
uh,

223
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,010
this is true of all
kinds of evidence that,

224
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,933
that often,

225
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:52,431
uh,

226
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:53,264
witnesses,

227
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,040
some witnesses are better than
others and some prosecutions,

228
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,170
the prosecution witnesses are better
than they are in other prosecutions.

229
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:02,660
That's just the nature
of the court system.

230
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,740
Uh,

231
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,490
well,

232
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:04,731
uh,

233
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:06,680
the court is going to reverse itself a,

234
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,970
just a short time later,

235
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:08,804
they did affirm,

236
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:09,290
uh,

237
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:09,861
or excuse me,

238
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:11,180
reverse one other case,

239
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:11,440
gay.

240
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,070
There's versus South Carolina,

241
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:13,610
uh,

242
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,750
based upon booth.

243
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,261
Uh,

244
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:17,570
but now we see a change in
the members of the court.

245
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:18,530
Justice Powell,

246
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,830
who wrote booth retires from the court
and he's replaced by Justice Kennedy in

247
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:24,980
1987.

248
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,851
Uh,

249
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:30,851
the court reaffirms booth and gathers a
and justice white who descended in booth

250
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,840
joins the majority opinion,

251
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:33,770
just basically saying,

252
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:35,450
I'm bound by booth and therefore,

253
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,231
uh,

254
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:36,610
I'm,

255
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,150
I'm going to vote to reverse
in this particular case.

256
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:41,661
Uh,

257
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:46,661
but then Justice Brennan retires a and
he's replaced by Justice Souter in 1990.

258
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,080
Uh,

259
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,480
and no sooner had just as
sooner joined the court,

260
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,140
then the court grants search Harare,

261
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,661
uh,

262
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:55,220
in a case out of Tennessee,

263
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:55,820
uh,

264
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,400
purpose Tyrone pain versus
the state of Tennessee.

265
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,100
And now the court overrules booth,

266
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,580
uh,

267
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,080
six to three for basically
the same reasons,

268
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,420
uh,

269
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,240
that the dissenters expressed,

270
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:08,950
uh,

271
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,250
in booth versus Maryland.

272
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,270
Uh,

273
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,620
pain is a very,

274
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,640
uh,

275
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,570
terrible crime.

276
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:14,930
Uh,

277
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,450
the,

278
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,283
uh,

279
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,430
killed a mother and one of her children,

280
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,110
uh,

281
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,010
and the victim impact evidence was,

282
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,851
uh,

283
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:25,880
the mother of the victim
testifying about Nicholas,

284
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:26,930
the son of the victim,

285
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:31,430
how he has been affected by the loss
of his mother and by the loss of his

286
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:32,264
sister.

287
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:32,871
Uh,

288
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:37,580
and she testifies the grandmother of
Nicholas testifies that he cries for his

289
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:38,414
mother.

290
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,330
That he doesn't seem to understand
why she doesn't come home.

291
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,860
He's only three years old.

292
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,690
He cries for his sister,

293
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,261
Lacey.

294
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:47,620
He comes to her often and says,

295
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:48,530
where is lacy?

296
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,101
Uh,

297
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:50,270
I missed my lacy.

298
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,890
I'm worried about Lacey.

299
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,581
Uh,

300
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:55,440
and then the prosecutors
in the closing argument,

301
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,150
uh,

302
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,530
ask the jurors to do
something for Nicholas.

303
00:08:58,531 --> 00:08:58,771
I say,

304
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,521
one of these days,

305
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:01,170
Nicholas is going to be old enough.

306
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,360
He's going to understand
what happened to his mother.

307
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,820
He's going to understand
what happened to his sibling,

308
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,330
and he will want to know
that justice was done.

309
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,291
Uh,

310
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,124
and so,

311
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,060
uh,

312
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,250
basically bring home the
death penalty so that,

313
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,093
uh,

314
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:15,971
Nicholas where Mel,

315
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:16,680
that,

316
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,161
uh,

317
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:20,970
the Supreme Court at Tennessee upheld
this even though it appears to pretty

318
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:23,490
clearly violate a booth versus Maryland,

319
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,390
uh,

320
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,660
pain petitioned the Supreme
Court for review it granted it,

321
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,730
but not too rural for pain.

322
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,210
But to take this opportunity
to overrule a booth,

323
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:33,900
uh,

324
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,850
chief justice Rehnquist
rights for the court.

325
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,781
And as I said,

326
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:37,141
these,

327
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:39,330
this is going to be based
on the same reasons,

328
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:39,930
uh,

329
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,763
that the court,

330
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,740
the same reasons set out in the descents,

331
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,461
uh,

332
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:44,761
in,

333
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:45,121
in,

334
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:45,390
uh,

335
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,223
in booth.

336
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,540
Uh,

337
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,090
the states may decide
there's no restriction in the
constitution on the states

338
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:51,924
deciding,

339
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,590
uh,

340
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:57,510
what evidence can be admitted and the
states can decide to show the harm caused

341
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:58,344
by the defendant.

342
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,160
Uh,

343
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,160
and also the states can
counter the mitigating
circumstances by showing what the

344
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:06,990
harm was to the victim.

345
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,441
In other words,

346
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:11,880
almost exactly what justice white had
said in dissent and booth is now the

347
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:14,430
opinion of the majority
of the Supreme Court.

348
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,090
Meaning this evidence
is going to be admitted.

349
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,313
Um,

350
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,180
justice O'Connor,

351
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:21,660
uh,

352
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,310
because a lot of people,

353
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:25,500
including the dissenters in this case,

354
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:26,550
Justice Marshall and,

355
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,960
uh,

356
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,540
particularly in just a
Stevens and Blackman,

357
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,830
uh,

358
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,260
express so much concern rights to sort of,

359
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,220
uh,

360
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,240
deal with that.

361
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:36,930
Uh,

362
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,411
she says,

363
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:42,030
state may decide that a jury before
imposing the death pony can provide,

364
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,750
let the jury know the
full extent of the harm,

365
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,330
uh,

366
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,290
including its impact on the
victim and the victim's family.

367
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,041
Uh,

368
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:53,460
and also that the jury
can have a quick glimpse.

369
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:54,061
She says,

370
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:58,560
of the life the petitioner chose to
extinguished to remind the jury that the

371
00:10:58,561 --> 00:10:59,850
person whose life was taken,

372
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,280
uh,

373
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,230
was a human being.

374
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,250
Uh,

375
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,030
but you also says this
can't be too inflammatory.

376
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,590
If the,

377
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,190
if the evidence is too emotional,

378
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:09,450
if it's too inflammatory,

379
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:13,260
it could make the trial
a fundamentally unfair.

380
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:13,920
Uh,

381
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,390
there are other concurring opinions,

382
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:15,900
but,

383
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,230
uh,

384
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,210
basically the,

385
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:18,060
the six,

386
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:18,840
uh,

387
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,740
carry the day,

388
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,340
uh,

389
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,210
just as Marshall,

390
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:23,250
this was justice Marshall his last day,

391
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:23,940
uh,

392
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,650
sitting as a supreme court justice.

393
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,420
It was a very last setting of the term,

394
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:27,991
uh,

395
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:30,000
and he was not happy.

396
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,750
Uh,

397
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,620
he thundered,

398
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,160
uh,

399
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,930
in his,

400
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,180
uh,

401
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:37,110
descending opinion that power
not reason is the currency,

402
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,890
uh,

403
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,740
that underlies the
court's decision making.

404
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,170
He pointed out that since
booth had been decided,

405
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,080
nothing had changed
with regard to the law,

406
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,140
the only thing that had changed
was the composition of the court,

407
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,480
which I outlined just a few minutes ago.

408
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,201
Uh,

409
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:57,201
and that there was no reason that the
court should reverse itself and go back

410
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,220
and overrule a booth versus Maryland.

411
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:00,851
Uh,

412
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:03,580
justice Stevens also descendant
joined by Justice Blackmun.

413
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:04,660
Um,

414
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,040
and he said,

415
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:06,730
in our law,

416
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,620
the prosecutor has never been allowed,

417
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,380
uh,

418
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,360
to introduce,

419
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,100
uh,

420
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,100
evidence that went beyond the guilt in
the moral blame worthiness or culpability

421
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,720
of the person on trial.

422
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:25,360
He suggest that this victim
impact evidence serves no
other purpose except to,

423
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,330
um,

424
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,010
uh,

425
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,910
weigh in favor of the death penalty
without really being relevant,

426
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:34,240
without providing the jury with
anything about either the crime or the,

427
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:34,781
uh,

428
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:35,614
the defendant,

429
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:35,951
uh,

430
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:37,660
that can be taken into account,

431
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,381
uh,

432
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:43,381
and that it invites the courts to decide
or juries to decide these cases based

433
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:46,270
upon emotion rather than reason.

434
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,530
Uh,

435
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,363
so,

436
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:48,670
uh,

437
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,780
strong dissents,

438
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,440
uh,

439
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,220
strong divisions in the court from the
time booth has decided until the time

440
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:55,210
pain is decided.

441
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,920
But once pain is decided,

442
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,590
the court pretty much leaves
this to the lower courts,

443
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,161
uh,

444
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:04,120
to decide what evidence is
going to be admitted or not.

445
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:05,403
Uh,

446
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,180
justice Stevens also points out a
that it can't be applied consistently,

447
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:10,811
uh,

448
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:12,550
in different cases because,

449
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,391
uh,

450
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:13,840
of,

451
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,290
uh,

452
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,150
circumstances that are unforeseen,

453
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:16,650
uh,

454
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:16,980
by,

455
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,860
by the defendant.

456
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,120
Uh,

457
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,953
basically,

458
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,740
uh,

459
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,040
there are a number of questions that are
remaining that remain after pain that

460
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:28,360
are being sorted out by state supreme
courts and to some extent by federal

461
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:29,160
courts.

462
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,740
Uh,

463
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,550
what evidence is admissible the court,

464
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,110
some courts have said that if you look
at the decisions and in pain and in booth

465
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,260
that while the court said
that the impact evidence,

466
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:44,230
the impact on the survivors
and the community,

467
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,070
uh,

468
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,551
and,

469
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:45,910
uh,

470
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,400
some indication of who the
person was that was killed,

471
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:50,080
is it miscible that the,

472
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:50,740
uh,

473
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,170
characterizations of the crime by the,

474
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,710
uh,

475
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:57,280
victim's families should not be allowed
to or their opinions about what sentence

476
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,690
should be imposed.

477
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:02,650
We see that in one of the cases
in the readings from Oklahoma,

478
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,933
uh,

479
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,760
that's really the,

480
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:07,241
the,

481
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:07,480
uh,

482
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,600
most courts have said that
characterizations of the crime,

483
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,040
uh,

484
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,230
and opinions about the evidences
is not going to be admitted.

485
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,490
But on the other hand,

486
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:15,981
uh,

487
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,970
and a federal death penalty case
battle versus United States,

488
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:19,660
uh,

489
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,660
guards at a federal penitentiary
where battle had murdered a guard,

490
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,420
uh,

491
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,320
testified,

492
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:26,980
uh,

493
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,790
with regard to what the impact was and
what the impact would be if he did not

494
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,870
receive the death Polly,

495
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,880
that it would be bad for morale.

496
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:34,570
Uh,

497
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,403
at the prison,

498
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,130
a United States Court of Appeals for
the 11th circuit upheld that testimony.

499
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,353
Um,

500
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,320
uh,

501
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,130
other,

502
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,430
uh,

503
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,263
concerns,

504
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,600
uh,

505
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,400
different classes of victims,

506
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,061
uh,

507
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:49,120
Justice Robert Benjamin has
descending opinion in Livingston,

508
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:49,990
uh,

509
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,070
was concerned,

510
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:51,741
uh,

511
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:56,660
about the fact that race and class would
be taken into account because already,

512
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:57,200
uh,

513
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,010
these may be factors that come into play
when a prosecutor decides whether to

514
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:05,630
seek the death penalty or whether to plea
bargain a case and resolve a case with

515
00:15:05,631 --> 00:15:06,640
a plea bargain in a,

516
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:07,850
in a sentence less than death.

517
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:13,330
And now with the family
of the victim testifying,

518
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,833
uh,

519
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,930
justice been worries
that there's going to be,

520
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,920
uh,

521
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,341
again,

522
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:22,490
race and class factors
entering into this process.

523
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,820
Um,

524
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,260
when is the evidence too prejudicial,

525
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,830
uh,

526
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,420
when it's weighed against,

527
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:29,900
uh,

528
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,040
the probative value,

529
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:31,890
that is what it,

530
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,530
what it helps the jury understand
about the victim and about the impact.

531
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,070
Uh,

532
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,680
but when does this evidence
become prejudicial?

533
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:40,101
And of course,

534
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:42,380
this can be very emotional evidence.

535
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:42,951
Some courts,

536
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:46,610
like Georgia has said that
before this evidence is admitted,

537
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,121
uh,

538
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:48,260
there has to be hearing,

539
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,370
there has to be testimony and
some determination of how,

540
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,330
uh,

541
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,600
emotional and whether the
evidence might be prejudicial.

542
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,591
On the other hand,

543
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:58,424
in other states,

544
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:58,940
uh,

545
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,990
quite extensive,

546
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,510
uh,

547
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,040
evidence and characterizations
by family members.

548
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:07,520
And I'm a very emotional
testimony has been admitted,

549
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,051
uh,

550
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,280
and upheld by the courts there.

551
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,473
Um,

552
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,440
does the G,

553
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:12,770
how,

554
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,720
how does the jury consider,

555
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:15,350
uh,

556
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,850
the victim impact evidence?

557
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:17,990
Uh,

558
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,823
the jury,

559
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,853
uh,

560
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,800
it's told you way aggravating against
mitigating some of the jury instructions,

561
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:28,430
say the victim impact evidence
is not an aggravating factor.

562
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,091
Uh,

563
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:30,080
but then the question comes,

564
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,213
what is it?

565
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:31,740
Uh,

566
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,710
a lot of the jury instructions say that,

567
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,221
uh,

568
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:38,390
what it is is it tells you what the
harm done by the defendant was a,

569
00:16:38,391 --> 00:16:41,150
and it's to be considered
for that purpose only,

570
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,680
but pretty clearly,

571
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,100
uh,

572
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,030
victim impact evidence is going to weigh
on the aggravating side of the scale,

573
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:47,510
uh,

574
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:51,050
when a jury is deciding whether
or not to impose a life or death.

575
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,800
So two things we would,

576
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:57,440
I would just say in closing
about victim impact evidence,

577
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:58,274
first of all,

578
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,480
what the Supreme Court has said is
that it never has to be admitted.

579
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,400
It's up to the states to decide.

580
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,180
So in a state that didn't have a law
providing for victim impact evidence,

581
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:08,871
uh,

582
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:09,380
that,

583
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,760
that evidence would not be admitted.

584
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,863
However,

585
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,640
what the court says is if a state chooses
to have a law allowing victim impact

586
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:17,240
evidence,

587
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,230
there's nothing in the constitution of
the United States that would prevent that

588
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:23,230
evidence from being considered a.

589
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,870
And then the only question
is whether or not a,

590
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,560
it's too prejudicial.

591
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,060
Justice Stevens,

592
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:29,480
uh,

593
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,310
and Kelly versus California express
some concern that a videotape which was

594
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,120
narrated a description of the
young woman's life who was killed,

595
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:43,121
narrated by her mother with very evocative
background music might go over the

596
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:44,070
line,

597
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,370
uh,

598
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,400
in terms of victim impact evidence.

599
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,000
Uh,

600
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,600
but,

601
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:47,781
uh,

602
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:48,860
that kind of evidence is,

603
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,050
and a lot of cases in
California and another parts,

604
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,771
uh,

605
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:53,880
of the country,

606
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,270
some states still don't
have victim impact evidence.

607
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:58,710
But once booth was decided,

608
00:17:58,711 --> 00:17:59,880
as I said at the start,

609
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:00,570
uh,

610
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,550
before booth versus Maryland,

611
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:06,480
most states that had the death pony
did not admit victim impact evidence.

612
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,171
However,

613
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,820
after Payne versus Tennessee,

614
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,720
uh,

615
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,553
state's,

616
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:10,950
uh,

617
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,783
almost,

618
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,480
uh,

619
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,590
all the states that had the death penalty
pass laws allowing a victim impact

620
00:18:16,591 --> 00:18:16,981
evidence.

621
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:18,420
And in many jurisdictions,

622
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:21,900
now it's a part of the
capital sentencing process.

623
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,210
The jury hears about
aggravating circumstances.

624
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,190
Here's about mitigating circumstances.

625
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,203
And also,

626
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:27,570
uh,

627
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,051
here's,

628
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:31,890
and the prosecution's case about the
impact of the crime on the victim,

629
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:34,340
who the victim was and how the family,

630
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,250
the survivors,

631
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,700
uh,

632
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,230
and the community were affected by it.

633
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,540
So this is very powerful evidence.

634
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,320
Uh,

635
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,820
court first says it's not miserable,

636
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:42,654
but ultimately,

637
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,500
uh,

638
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,131
it is,

639
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:44,790
and,

640
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,080
uh,

641
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,680
these questions remain,

642
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,550
uh,

643
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,960
and are being decided by,

644
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,591
as I said,

645
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:51,660
state and federal courts as we go forward.
