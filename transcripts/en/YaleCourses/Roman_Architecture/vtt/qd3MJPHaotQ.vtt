1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.380
Welcome to Roman architecture.
I'm professor Kleiner.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.050
And what I'd like to do today is to,
uh,

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.130
give you a sense of some of the great buildings and some of the themes that we

4
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:15.420
will be studying together this semester.

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.810
I think it's important to note from the outset that Roman architecture is

6
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:24.690
primarily an architecture of cities.

7
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.350
The Romans structured a manmade worldwide empire out of architectural forms,

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.100
and those architectural forms revolutionize the ancient world and exerted a

9
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:42.591
lasting influence on the architecture and the architects of post-classical

10
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.763
times.

11
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.140
This semester we will be considered concerned primarily with urban communities,

12
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:53.550
with urban communities,
and we will in the first half of the semester,

13
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:57.800
we will focus on the city of Rome and in the second and,

14
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.090
and also central Italy,
including Pompei.
Uh,

15
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.920
and I wanted to show you at the outset and aerial view of Rome.

16
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:08.250
You see it over here on the left hand side of the screen,
uh,

17
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:11.850
that situates us in the very core of the ancient city.

18
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.080
You see the famous coliseum,
the very icon of Rome at the upper right.

19
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.220
You see the Roman forum as it looks today.
Uh,
and you see a,

20
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.090
a part of the capital line hill,
uh,

21
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:28.680
transformed by Michelangelo into the famous Compa Doleo as well as the

22
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.450
[inaudible] in periodically and with Salini built by Mussolini and the imperial

23
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:36.480
fora.
So the city of Rome,
again,

24
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:40.020
we'll be concentrating on at the beginning of the semester as well as the city

25
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:43.860
of palm pay,
an aerial view of Pompei.
As it looks today,

26
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:47.490
you can see many of the buildings of the city,
uh,

27
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.110
including the houses and the shops.
Uh,
and also the entertainment district.

28
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:56.160
This is the theater and the Music Hall of Ancient Tom Pay.

29
00:01:56.161 --> 00:02:00.180
The amphitheater is over here and you can see of course looming in the

30
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:03.120
background,
uh,
the Mount Vesuvius,

31
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.260
the mountain that caused all that trouble in 79 a d.

32
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.490
So that's the first half of the semester.
The second half of the semester,
uh,

33
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.640
we are going to be going out into the provinces and to the Roman provinces and

34
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:19.410
that is going to take us and we're going to look at the province is both in the

35
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:22.290
eastern and the western part of the empire.

36
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.510
And that will take us to Roman Greece.
Uh,

37
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.370
it will take us to Asia Minor,
uh,
Asia Minor,

38
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:33.330
which of course is modern Turkey.
It will take us to North Africa.

39
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.310
It will take us to the Middle East,
uh,
in what's now Jordan and Syria.

40
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.380
Uh,
and it will also take us to Europe,
to Western Europe,
uh,
two cities,

41
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.160
two cities in France and to cities in Spain.
Uh,

42
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.750
and let me just show you an example of some of the buildings that we'll look at

43
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:53.610
is we traveled to the provinces.

44
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.820
This is the library of Kelsey's in emphasis on the western coast of Turkey.

45
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.811
Uh,
this,

46
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:06.610
the theater a spectacularly well preserved theater at sub brotha.

47
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.840
Ah,

48
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.840
you see in the upper right hand side and down here a restored view of the

49
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.330
masterful of palace of Diocletian when they're the late Roman emperors in a

50
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:19.750
place called Split,

51
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.990
which is in Croatia along the fabulously gorgeous Dalmatian coast today.

52
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:29.860
So those are just a sampling of the kinds of buildings that will look at in the

53
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:33.490
provinces.
We're going to be,
uh,
seeing,

54
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.410
we'll be concentrating on the ways in which the Romans planned and built their

55
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:39.760
cities.
Uh,

56
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.850
and it's important to note from the very outset that Rome itself grew in a very

57
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.620
ad hoc way.
Uh,
and we can tell that here's a Google earth image,

58
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.330
uh,
showing,
uh,
that core of Rome with the Colosseum,
uh,

59
00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.360
with the famous Vic Modern Victor Emmanuel monument that looks either like a

60
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:02.170
wedding cake or a typewriter.

61
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.460
It's very white and it's called the wedding cake by a lot of the locals.

62
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:10.100
You see that here,
but it's a landmark in Rome.
Uh,
and uh,

63
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.900
the capital inhale comp Idalia over here,
the forum,

64
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:17.950
the Roman Forum of the imperial fora on this side,

65
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.540
but you can see from the relatively crooked,
uh,

66
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:27.160
and narrow streets of the city of Rome as they look from above today.
Uh,

67
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:31.720
you can see that again,
the city grew in a fairly ad hoc way.
As I mentioned,

68
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:35.110
it wasn't planned all at once.
It just grew up over time,

69
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:38.680
beginning in the eighth century BC.
Now,

70
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:42.430
this is interesting because what we know about the Romans is when they were left

71
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:46.750
to their own devices,
uh,
and they could build a city from scratch,

72
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.580
they didn't let it grow in an ad hoc way.
They,
they structured it in a,
in a very,

73
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.980
very methodical way that was basically based on military strategy,

74
00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:58.810
military planning,
the Romans,

75
00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:02.650
they couldn't have conquered the world without obviously having a masterful,
uh,

76
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.710
military enterprise.
Uh,
and they,
uh,

77
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.530
everywhere they went on their various campaigns,

78
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.420
there's various military campaigns they would build,
uh,
build camps.

79
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:18.150
And those camps were always laid out in a very geometric plan along the grid,
uh,

80
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.440
usually square or rectangular.

81
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.030
So when we begin to see the Romans building their ideal Roman city,

82
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.410
they turn to that so called costume or military camp design,

83
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.980
and they build their cities that way.
And I show you here one example.

84
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:34.720
We're using Google earthier again,

85
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.340
another example of an example of a city,

86
00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:43.870
a called Tim Gad,
t I,
m,
g,
a,
D,
which is in modern Algeria.

87
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.480
Uh,
and the ancient city is still survives a,

88
00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:51.670
and if we look at this Google earth image of it,

89
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:55.810
you can see there's no later accretions as we have in Rome.

90
00:05:55.811 --> 00:06:00.620
No later civilizations on top of it.
You can see the ideal Roman plan,

91
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:04.070
which is I said is usually either a square or a rectangle.

92
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.400
It has in the center of the two main streets of the city.

93
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.660
The North South Street is called the Cardo,
ca RDO.
Uh,

94
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.930
the East West street is called the Dec Humanitas,
d.

95
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.850
C u.
M.
A.
N.
U.
S.

96
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:19.460
We'll go back to all of this in the future so you don't have to worry about it

97
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:20.390
today.
Uh,

98
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:24.320
the carto and the deck [inaudible] and you can see that they cross exactly.

99
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:29.030
They intersect exactly at the center of the city.
Uh,

100
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.890
and then the rest of the city is arranged in blocks,
very regular blocks.

101
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:38.000
This grid plan that I mentioned before.
And then some of the major monuments,

102
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:40.370
whether it's the theater or the forum,
you know,

103
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:42.910
are arranged in different parts of the city.
Uh,

104
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.600
and then these blocks constitute essentially the housing and the shops and so on

105
00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:48.434
and so forth.

106
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.970
This is a city that was planned and around 100 and under the emperor Trajan.

107
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.840
Uh,
and again,
it gives us an inkling of what the Romans,

108
00:06:56.841 --> 00:07:01.640
when the Romans thought about ideal Roman town planning,
it was this grid plan,

109
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:05.720
not wrong,
but this grid plan that they had very much in mind.

110
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.080
Cities like Rome,
like Tim Gad,
uh,

111
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.850
and most of the others that we'll look at in the course of the semester.

112
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.720
We're surrounded by defensive walls as a mass,

113
00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:20.270
as a major military machine in its own right.

114
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:24.560
Rome was only too aware of the dangers of,
of attack from others.

115
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.050
And consequently they walled their cities.

116
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.080
And we will look at the two major walls in Rome as well as walls and other parts

117
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:36.000
of the Roman world.
I promise not to spend too much time on walls,
uh,

118
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.570
because they're essentially piles of stone,
but,
but they're,

119
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:42.410
they're important in their own right.
And I will speak to them on occasion,

120
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:44.900
and especially the two in Rome,
you see them here.

121
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.460
This is the first row wall in Rome,
the so called Serbian walls,

122
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:54.380
which was built in the republic and the Roman Republic to,
uh,
to,
uh,
to,

123
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.330
um,
to,
uh,
to,

124
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.000
to surround the city,
the Republican city,

125
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:03.320
and essentially the seven hills,

126
00:08:03.321 --> 00:08:07.410
the famous seven hills of Rome to surround the seven hills of Rome.
Uh,

127
00:08:07.411 --> 00:08:11.480
in the fourth century BC.
You see a section of it here,
uh,

128
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.340
this wall,
any of you who've come to Rome by train and the stops Yonei tear mini,

129
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.630
uh,
see a very extensive section of the Serbian walls as you get I,

130
00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:21.381
and if you've noticed it,

131
00:08:21.381 --> 00:08:25.670
but you should see an extensive section of the survey and walls right outside

132
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.610
the train station.
This is a different section than I,

133
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:33.380
a picture I took on the Aventine Hill,
uh,
showing a part of that wall.

134
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.730
And that was eventually replaced by later walls.
A city grew over time.

135
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:42.620
It needed a more extensive,
broader,
a wall system.

136
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:46.430
Uh,
and in the late third century Aidy under the emperor really religion,

137
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.870
the famous or really and walls were built,
uh,
the really in walls.
As you know,
I,

138
00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:53.240
there's no way you've missed those.
I'm sure if you've been in Rome,

139
00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:57.330
you've seen the really end walls.
They're are,
they're very much,
they're,
uh,

140
00:08:57.331 --> 00:08:58.440
at least if you've left the city,

141
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.260
maybe if you've just gone into the core of the city and having gone beyond that,

142
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:03.210
you might not have seen them.
But if you've left the city,

143
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.370
you've seen the are really in walls,
a very impressive,
uh,

144
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.140
set of walls that and circled the later city.

145
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.810
One thing that's apparent to you as you look at these,

146
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:14.730
even if you didn't have no knowledge whatsoever,

147
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:19.470
Roman architecture is these are made a very different kinds of materials.

148
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:24.390
So technical issues come to the fore right away is one analyzes this sort of

149
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:26.310
thing in the early period,

150
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:31.020
essentially blocks of stone piled one on top of the other for the wall here,

151
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:35.610
or a more sophisticated use later on in the empire of a new technology that

152
00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:38.490
we're going to talk about a lot this semester.
And that is concrete.

153
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.320
And what concrete did to revolutionize Roman architecture concrete in this

154
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:46.110
particular case?
Uh,
faced with brick,

155
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.230
we talked about regular town planning,
uh,
and,
uh,

156
00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:54.030
the location of the carto and the deck.

157
00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:57.240
You Montas I want to show you just an example of this.

158
00:09:57.241 --> 00:10:01.800
This is the city in Italy,
uh,
in this case,
the city of palm pay.

159
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.900
You see it here in plan.

160
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:09.080
This is a plan of Pompei as it looked just at the moment that Vesuvius erupted.

161
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:11.730
So in August of 79,

162
00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:16.390
a d this was the way palm pay was at that particular time.
Uh,

163
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.870
you can see it's not really a rectangle.

164
00:10:18.871 --> 00:10:23.490
It's a kind of Elongate it sort of an oval,
kind of an oval and irregular oval.

165
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.380
Uh,
but it has the sense,
you know,
I think it has the center,

166
00:10:26.381 --> 00:10:30.780
it shows you that again,
even for,
um,
for evil,

167
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.670
even though the Romans were thinking in with,
to,

168
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.610
to try to create their cities in a very regular way.
You know,

169
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:41.340
it didn't always work out exactly that way,

170
00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:44.700
depending on the terrain and so on and so forth.
But this is a rough,

171
00:10:44.701 --> 00:10:48.360
it's sort of an irregular,
a rectangle,
as you can see here.

172
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.460
But if you look very carefully,
you sort of say to yourself like,

173
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:51.850
where's the Cardo?
Where's the decades?

174
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.690
Just told us the card on the deck Montas Intersect in the center.

175
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:58.470
Like where are they?
Why aren't they intersecting the center?
Well,
surprise,

176
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:01.980
surprise,
maybe not such a surprise.
If you look over here at the bottom left,

177
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:07.190
you will actually see the original city upon pay in the fourth century BC,

178
00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:11.700
the third century BC,
the second century BC.
Pompei didn't look like this.

179
00:11:11.701 --> 00:11:14.370
Pump pay looked like,
like this.
Uh,

180
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:18.180
and if you look very carefully at just this section where we have the buildings

181
00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:22.730
and the various colors,
you will see that there is indeed a carto and a deck.

182
00:11:22.731 --> 00:11:26.730
You Montas that intersect exactly at the,
uh,

183
00:11:26.731 --> 00:11:30.000
at the center of this roughly square.

184
00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:32.310
So this was actually pretty regular originally.

185
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.030
This roughly square city of pay at three.

186
00:11:36.031 --> 00:11:39.990
We find the forum because the forum is always at the intersection.

187
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.460
The Romans try,
they're very careful about this sort of thing.
Tried to put uh,

188
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.450
their,
um,

189
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.170
their forum right at the intersection of the carto and the deck [inaudible].

190
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.910
You see that here.
Uh,

191
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.600
and then you see a lot of other buildings splayed off to either side,

192
00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:00.090
the law court or the basilica.
Another tip,
a temple here,
here,

193
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:05.100
the main temple of Jupiter Senate House or Korea and a series of other religious

194
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:09.550
and uh,
comparable structures on the right hand side.

195
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:13.040
So it began as a quite regular plan.
Hardo indeck,

196
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.930
you Montas intersecting at the SEC,
at the center,
a forum,
uh,

197
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:20.680
right at the intersection of those two.
And then over time it grew,

198
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:24.550
it grew and expanded and the streets the same street,
the car to,
you know,

199
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:28.390
expand it.
Although it was no longer exactly at the center of the city.

200
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.610
This is a view from Google earth that shows you just pretty much,

201
00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:37.560
I tried to angle it in such a way that it looks that it's exactly the same
angle,

202
00:12:37.561 --> 00:12:41.830
a close to exactly the same angle as the plan that we just looked at before.

203
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:47.200
And you can see over here the amphitheater,
uh,
you can see,
um,
uh,

204
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:50.980
many of the streets including the,
uh,
the shops and the houses.

205
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:55.780
And you can see over here the forum as it looks today,
uh,

206
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.230
from the air.
And again,
it shows you how helpful Google and of course,

207
00:12:59.231 --> 00:13:02.740
as you know,
using Google Earth yourselves,
uh,
for other purposes,

208
00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:06.790
you know that you can go way down and you can find the entire city and then you

209
00:13:06.791 --> 00:13:10.540
can go and explore,
uh,
each individual building,
uh,

210
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.110
on your own and in your own time.
In fact,
that's what I've done here.

211
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:19.180
Here you see a closer view of the forum in palm pay as it looks today,

212
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.450
uh,
from the air via Google earth here at the left.

213
00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:26.320
And I compare it to this plan that comes from your textbook,

214
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:31.150
one of your two textbooks that the book by J B Ward Perkins,
uh,

215
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:34.990
Wi,
which is the of the two,
the more,
well,
they're both important,

216
00:13:34.991 --> 00:13:36.580
but then they both do different things.

217
00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:40.510
But one of the two important books that we'll be using this semester,
uh,

218
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.190
here is the plan from that book.

219
00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:46.330
And you can see the way in which this forum and this forum is very important at

220
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.150
Pompei because it's very early in date.

221
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:53.230
And consequently we will talk about it a fair amount.

222
00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:58.570
We see this the way Roman forums were usually arranged was to have one general

223
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:03.550
open rectangular space open to the sky,
surrounded by columns.

224
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:08.320
Uh,
with a temple.
The key,
the most important temple,
the chief temple,

225
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:08.890
uh,

226
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:13.890
pushed up against one of the short back walls and dominating the space in front

227
00:14:14.081 --> 00:14:14.291
of it.

228
00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:18.160
This is a capital e and we'll talk about what a capital Liam is in a future

229
00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:21.790
lecture,
but it is a temple to Jupiter and others.
As we shall see,

230
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:26.660
temple of Apollo over here,
the basilica or law courts over here.
Uh,

231
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.510
and you can see interestingly enough,

232
00:14:28.511 --> 00:14:33.370
they have essentially the same shape as the central forum proper.
Uh,

233
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.430
a brick tank rectangular with a colonnade in the center.

234
00:14:36.431 --> 00:14:40.090
And then something on one side.
It's not another temple,

235
00:14:40.091 --> 00:14:42.400
but rather a tribunal,
uh,

236
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:47.430
a place from which the judge would try the cases in the law courts.

237
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:53.120
We see the Senate House over here and a series of other buildings including a

238
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:57.610
market place and some other buildings here on the right hand side.
Uh,

239
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:02.420
so a typical Roman forum at its earliest stage,
very early on,

240
00:15:02.421 --> 00:15:03.740
second century BC,

241
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.840
and is therefore an extremely important building for us just so that you get a

242
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:11.870
sense of what some of these look like.
In actuality,

243
00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:16.820
this is the basilica or the Law Court of the forum of pump or as part of it,

244
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:18.920
which is part of the forum of palm pay.

245
00:15:18.921 --> 00:15:23.921
And we see that tribunal that I mentioned before to story tribunal from which

246
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:28.470
the judge would try the cases.
The building isn't as well preserved as we'd like,

247
00:15:28.471 --> 00:15:32.420
although there's quite a bit there.
And what is their,
allows us to,
uh,

248
00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:37.100
to create this kind of reconstruction drawing where we can get a very good sense

249
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.920
of what this building actually looked like in antiquity.

250
00:15:39.921 --> 00:15:41.990
You see the tribunal over there,
uh,

251
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.570
you see that there are a double stories with columns on either side.
I,

252
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.180
you see these colossal columns along the aisle,
but most importantly,

253
00:15:50.181 --> 00:15:52.550
unlike the forum which was open to the sky,

254
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:56.720
this is roofed and it had a flat roof with what's called a coffered ceiling.

255
00:15:56.721 --> 00:15:58.280
We'll talk about that later in the term.

256
00:15:58.281 --> 00:16:03.020
But then a sloping roof from the outside and Basilic,
those were always roofed.

257
00:16:03.021 --> 00:16:06.710
And that's what distinguishes them from a lot of other Roman buildings.

258
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.810
Roman temple architecture,

259
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:12.800
the temple of the temples of Jupiter and Apollo at palm pay,

260
00:16:12.801 --> 00:16:17.570
or not that WellPreserved,
but some Roman temples are magnificently preserved.

261
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.350
I mean,
look at this one.
It's pristine.
It's like it was,

262
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:25.130
was created yesterday as a,
as a,
as a duplicate of what a Roman temple,

263
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:29.270
uh,
or a restoration of what Roman temple might've looked like.
You could,

264
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.070
you could put this in Memphis or somewhere like that and think that you had a

265
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:37.370
nice replica of a Roman temple.
That's how well preserved it is.

266
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.900
It's an amazing temple.

267
00:16:38.901 --> 00:16:42.680
It's just happens to be WellPreserved in part because it was reused over time.

268
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.590
Most recently as a small archeological museum,

269
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:50.360
this is the famous Meson cafe or a square house for obvious reasons,

270
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:50.811
uh,

271
00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:55.811
that is in the beautiful French town of Neem,

272
00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:01.010
south of France.
Uh,
and you see it here in all its glory.

273
00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:03.230
And think as you look about this,
look at this.

274
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:06.340
How many banks were based on this planet?

275
00:17:06.341 --> 00:17:10.310
I mean you can go to almost any small city in America and see a bank that looks

276
00:17:10.311 --> 00:17:12.890
something like this,
which just gives you some sense of,
again,

277
00:17:12.891 --> 00:17:16.850
how influential Roman architecture has been over time.

278
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.620
It's a quite traditional temple.

279
00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:23.120
We'll talk about the difference between traditional temple architecture and more

280
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.840
innovative temple architecture in the course of the semester.

281
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:31.880
And as innovative as it gets is what is one of the key buildings of Roman

282
00:17:31.881 --> 00:17:34.790
architecture,
which is of course the famous Pantheon in Rome.

283
00:17:34.791 --> 00:17:38.300
I'm sure there's none of you who's been in Rome who hasn't been inside the

284
00:17:38.301 --> 00:17:41.780
Pantheon.
It is an incredible building.
This is a Google map.

285
00:17:41.781 --> 00:17:43.310
It was done during the,
um,

286
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.970
the building was put up during the reign of the very important from the

287
00:17:46.971 --> 00:17:51.540
architectural standpoint and many other but very important emperor Hadrian.

288
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.720
Uh,
and we see,
this is again,
one of the,
um,

289
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.590
one of the wonderful things about Google earth because you're seeing here the

290
00:17:58.591 --> 00:18:03.400
modern city.
Uh,
but you're also seeing in three d,
uh,
the,

291
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.150
the building still stands and it's an incredible condition,

292
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.810
but you're also seeing the building almost as it would have been in ancient

293
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.830
times,
surrounded by its modern environment.

294
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:19.290
It's a temple is a very distinctive and innovative temple because when you look

295
00:18:19.291 --> 00:18:20.041
at it from the front,

296
00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:24.480
you see it as a kind of traditional porch that is not unlike the one in the

297
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:28.020
Meson Keray with columns that support a pediment looks like earlier Greek or

298
00:18:28.021 --> 00:18:29.790
trust and architecture.
Uh,

299
00:18:29.791 --> 00:18:34.080
but what's very innovative about it is that once you go into the building,

300
00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:37.250
you see that this is not about this,

301
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.030
this is all about an interior space and extraordinary interior space that is

302
00:18:42.031 --> 00:18:43.860
shaped by light,

303
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.300
that is shaped by a genius essentially.
And this,

304
00:18:48.301 --> 00:18:51.990
this image is actually one of those that gives you a sense of,
of,

305
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.040
of the kind of thing that I've been able to incorporate into this course that I

306
00:18:56.041 --> 00:19:00.600
didn't always use before,
which includes,
uh,
many,
many,
many of my own images.

307
00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:05.460
And this one I'm particularly proud of.
It's a very atmospheric view of the,
uh,

308
00:19:05.461 --> 00:19:09.270
of the Dome of the Pantheon and I think really gives you almost more than

309
00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:12.810
anything else cause you a sense almost more than anything else that I can show

310
00:19:12.811 --> 00:19:14.880
you today of,
of Roman.

311
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.880
It's best of the power and glory of Rome and the Roman architecture.

312
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.290
I'm very biased,
but as far as I'm concerned,

313
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:27.240
this is the greatest building ever conceived.
Bye by man.
So there you are.

314
00:19:27.241 --> 00:19:30.210
We'll see by the end of the semester whether you agree with me or you think I'm

315
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.560
absolutely wrong about that.
Uh,
this is,
uh,

316
00:19:34.561 --> 00:19:39.561
another extraordinary structure and one that enables me to say something that

317
00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:42.240
you'll hear me say more than once.
And I know I'm biased,

318
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:45.690
but say more than once in the course of the semester,
is that,

319
00:19:45.691 --> 00:19:48.780
is that there isn't much that the Romans didn't discover,

320
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.480
didn't create a and not just in architecture and all kinds of ways.
Uh,

321
00:19:53.481 --> 00:19:55.110
and this is a good example of that.

322
00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:58.590
This is the so called the famous markets of Trajan in Rome,

323
00:19:58.591 --> 00:20:01.980
part of the great forum of the Emperor Trajan in Rome.

324
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.520
And you can see that what the Romans have done is taken a hill,

325
00:20:05.521 --> 00:20:08.910
one of the famous seven hills,
the queer,
and it'll hell taking that hill,

326
00:20:08.911 --> 00:20:11.520
cut it back,
poured concrete on it,

327
00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:16.560
and created this incredible shopping center on the side of the hill.

328
00:20:16.561 --> 00:20:21.090
If this isn't the beginning of mall architecture,
I don't know what it is.

329
00:20:21.091 --> 00:20:24.540
Shopping Mall architecture,
it's right here already.

330
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:29.010
You can shop there over 150 shops.
You can shop on a variety of levels.

331
00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:32.880
You can shop in the heavy cycle.
You can shop along the via Bieber,
Radhika.
Uh,

332
00:20:32.881 --> 00:20:36.510
you can shop,
you know,
shop til you drop a in this,
in this,

333
00:20:36.511 --> 00:20:41.340
in this incredible mall.
Uh,
and as one looks at it in detail,
wasn't,

334
00:20:41.341 --> 00:20:45.510
sees amazing things.
Uh,
this is a view of one of the shopping streets.

335
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:50.740
You can see the typical masonry that is so characteristic of Roman street design

336
00:20:51.281 --> 00:20:52.630
here along.
It's,

337
00:20:52.631 --> 00:20:55.360
some of the individual shops need to think that a way at the top.

338
00:20:55.361 --> 00:20:56.680
That was added later.
Uh,

339
00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:00.180
but you see some of the individual shops here and look how,

340
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:04.240
how ingenious the Romans have been to provide not only a ramp,

341
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:08.680
but also a series of upstairs,
flat area,

342
00:21:08.681 --> 00:21:11.020
stairs and so on.
And this has all been very,

343
00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:16.021
very carefully orchestrated by the designers in a way that is not only

344
00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:20.920
utilitarian but also very attractive.
And then there's this,

345
00:21:20.921 --> 00:21:23.560
this is the Great Hall of the,
uh,

346
00:21:23.561 --> 00:21:28.030
of the markets of Trajan in Rome.
A kind of bizarre,

347
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:33.480
which also has a series of shops and also attic windows as you can see above a,

348
00:21:35.171 --> 00:21:39.460
but then the goal,
the,
the particular marvel of this space is,

349
00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.960
look what they've done above.
They have taken,
they are using concrete once again,

350
00:21:43.961 --> 00:21:48.220
and this gives you some sense of the miracle of Roman concrete using concrete.

351
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:53.150
They have created a new kind of bolt,
which we call the groin vault,
uh,
which is,

352
00:21:53.151 --> 00:21:56.740
uh,
which is a rib default.
And you can see the ribs very clearly here.

353
00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.570
And they have lifted that ribbed bald on top of peers that are,

354
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:06.500
that have been attenuated and narrowed to the point,
to a very,

355
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.900
in a very sophisticated way,
much more than was true up to this moment.

356
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.680
So that they have been able to lift those groin bolts in a way that always

357
00:22:14.681 --> 00:22:19.060
reminds me.
It's as if you went and opened a series of umbrellas over a space,

358
00:22:19.061 --> 00:22:23.020
you know,
lifted the space up and a truly miraculous way.

359
00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:26.740
And as an example,
again of the fact that the Romans is nothing,

360
00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:28.900
the Romans didn't do,
it,
didn't invent a,

361
00:22:28.901 --> 00:22:32.700
here you see the well known marketplace in San Francisco,
uh,

362
00:22:32.701 --> 00:22:36.640
where you see essentially the same idea,
a series of shops down below,

363
00:22:36.641 --> 00:22:41.620
and then this,
this magnificently lifted a ceiling above.

364
00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.830
So Roman architecture,
as I said in the very beginning,

365
00:22:44.831 --> 00:22:48.490
really had a huge impact on later architecture.
The Bat,

366
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.500
the markets of Trajan.
We're part of the forum complex,
the forum of Trajan,

367
00:22:53.501 --> 00:22:56.270
which you see a part of here.
Uh,

368
00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.630
the forum itself was really quite conventional.

369
00:22:58.631 --> 00:23:01.810
This is an interesting building because we have a fairly can rent traditional,

370
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:02.250
uh,

371
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:07.150
approach to the forum itself and then an innovative approach to the markets.

372
00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:12.130
This is a restored view of the basilica or law court of the forum of Trajan.

373
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:16.810
Uh,
you see that it's very traditional with columns and marble,
uh,

374
00:23:16.811 --> 00:23:20.460
and as flat ceiling with coffers.
Uh,
and,
uh,

375
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:24.730
that's what most of the,
uh,
temp most of the forum looks like.

376
00:23:24.731 --> 00:23:28.180
The market's are done in a very different style as we saw.

377
00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.210
And this particular forum,
uh,

378
00:23:31.211 --> 00:23:34.590
was not only a meeting in a marketplace or a place where,
uh,

379
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:39.040
cases could be tried,
uh,
but was also a,
uh,

380
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:42.700
a monument in stone to the military.
Victories of Trajan.

381
00:23:42.701 --> 00:23:47.701
Trajan was the emperor who extended the borders of the Empire to their furthest

382
00:23:48.351 --> 00:23:51.770
reaches.
And,
uh,
the monument is a,

383
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:57.070
is a testament to what is accomplished is w accomplishments were militarily and

384
00:23:57.501 --> 00:23:59.120
the famous column of Trajan,

385
00:23:59.121 --> 00:24:03.730
which still stands and is in magnificent condition as you can see here,
uh,

386
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:08.390
is a monument that is wrapped with a spiral freeze that,

387
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.560
uh,
that purports to describe,
uh,

388
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.290
from bottom to top all of the exploits,

389
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:20.390
all of the military exploits of Trajan is to military campaigns in Dacia.

390
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.000
It also served as the emperor's tomb.

391
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:28.060
It was a burial chamber down below a four urns of Trajan and his wife Platina.

392
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.160
Uh,
so it served not only as a,

393
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.280
as a commemoration of his military victory over Dacia,

394
00:24:34.281 --> 00:24:36.880
which by the ways modern Romania today,
uh,

395
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.970
but also to victory over death for the emperor.

396
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:44.360
Every Roman city has had his bath buildings.

397
00:24:44.361 --> 00:24:46.850
Most of the houses did not have running water.

398
00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:50.240
So bats were extremely important,
obviously.

399
00:24:50.241 --> 00:24:54.050
So most cities had more than one.
In fact,
most cities Pompei for example,

400
00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.960
seems to have had about three a bath buildings.

401
00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:01.730
They're very important both in terms of their social,
their need,

402
00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:06.740
their practical needs,
and also as a place for social interaction.
Uh,

403
00:25:06.741 --> 00:25:10.520
but also because there are some very interesting architectural experiments that

404
00:25:10.521 --> 00:25:13.940
took place in them.
I'm going to show you in the course of the semester,

405
00:25:13.941 --> 00:25:18.941
the development from the simplest bath buildings such as the ones in palm pay to

406
00:25:19.041 --> 00:25:22.670
the most elaborate,
those of you who visited the baths of Caracalla in Rome,

407
00:25:22.671 --> 00:25:27.260
that's an example of one of the huge and most elaborate a bath buildings.

408
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.890
I show you here on the left hand side of the screen.
Just as an example,

409
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:32.550
a view of,
uh,

410
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:37.430
one of the rooms of the forum bouts and Pompei the caldarium or warm room.

411
00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:41.480
All of these bands had multiple spaces within them.

412
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:46.610
One of the distinctions of the earlier baths,
uh,
was that,
um,

413
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:52.490
that the men sections and the women's sections,
we're separate from one another,

414
00:25:52.491 --> 00:25:55.780
and I hate to say it,
but the men had all the great rooms.
Uh,

415
00:25:55.850 --> 00:26:00.850
they were bigger and they were more ornately decorated as this one is the warm

416
00:26:00.921 --> 00:26:03.710
room of the men's baths,
uh,
at pom pay.

417
00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.220
But you can see here even in much smaller scale than a building like the

418
00:26:07.221 --> 00:26:09.920
Pantheon and much earlier than the Pantheon,
uh,

419
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:14.750
they're beginning to explore the curvatures of the wall,
the,
the,

420
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:16.460
um,
send me down there.

421
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:21.200
And the way in which you can create light effects by putting holes are what are

422
00:26:21.201 --> 00:26:25.160
what's called an oculus around whole,
uh,
in the,

423
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:27.640
in part of the ceiling,
uh,
and other,
uh,

424
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:31.970
rectangular holes in the ceiling to create fantastic light effects.

425
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.790
So they're already exploring that here in palm pay.

426
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.270
When we look at some of the larger bathing establishments,

427
00:26:38.271 --> 00:26:41.760
the baths of Caracalla still look while they're there,
a Hoka,

428
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:46.380
they're essentially a pile huff concrete based with brick today is any of you

429
00:26:46.381 --> 00:26:47.940
who've seen it?
No,

430
00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:52.320
but the scale is truly colossal and one is very impressed when one wanders

431
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:55.290
around the baths of Caracalla.
But some of the others,
for example,

432
00:26:55.291 --> 00:26:58.590
the baths of Diocletian have been reused in modern times.

433
00:26:58.591 --> 00:27:02.130
And it's one of the reasons it's so many Roman buildings survive is because of

434
00:27:02.131 --> 00:27:05.460
this kind of reuse over the centuries.
Uh,
this,

435
00:27:05.461 --> 00:27:07.560
the baths of Diocletian,

436
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.680
part of which was transformed into a church at first by a decorated at one point

437
00:27:13.201 --> 00:27:16.320
in part by Michelangelo.
And what we're looking at here,

438
00:27:16.321 --> 00:27:19.860
the Church of Santa Maria,
daily on jellies,
Saint Mary of the angels.

439
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:25.300
And what we're looking at here is a view into what was the cold room where the

440
00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:30.010
frig Doriam of the baths of Diocletian,
uh,

441
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.490
but transformed into a church,

442
00:27:32.491 --> 00:27:35.940
used as the nave of the Church of Saint Mary,
of the angels.

443
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.260
But if you look very closely,
you'll see those same cross or groin vaults,
uh,

444
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:43.440
that we saw in the markets of Trajan,
uh,

445
00:27:43.441 --> 00:27:47.490
that are also used here to lift the ceiling and a very effective way.

446
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:51.780
And then all these multicolored columns that you see are actually the columns

447
00:27:51.781 --> 00:27:56.300
from the ancient building.
So even in this interior of Santa Maria de Leon,

448
00:27:56.301 --> 00:27:58.890
Jillian,
we can get a sense of how ornate,
uh,

449
00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.980
some of the decorations of some of these bath buildings work.

450
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:05.720
We're going to look at Roman theaters,
uh,
this semester.
Uh,

451
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:10.680
this is an example of one the spectacular Roman theater at all wrong in the

452
00:28:10.681 --> 00:28:15.210
south of France.
You see it here.
I'm not going to go into the parts of a,

453
00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.410
of a,
of a theater or its relationship to earlier Greek theatrical architecture.

454
00:28:19.411 --> 00:28:22.310
But you can see the stair,
you can see the seats.
Uh,

455
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.340
you can see the orchestra,
you can see the stage buildings,

456
00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.300
stage building that initially was decorated with a forest of columns,

457
00:28:30.301 --> 00:28:34.620
only a couple of which your vibe as well as a lot of sculptural decoration.

458
00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:38.160
Again,
most of which does not survive.
But one of the,

459
00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:42.090
one of the points I want to make today is that the Greeks tended to build,

460
00:28:42.091 --> 00:28:44.940
the Greeks always built their theaters on hillsides.

461
00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:48.750
They use the natural hill to support the seats.

462
00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:51.150
And that's true at all wrong as well.

463
00:28:51.151 --> 00:28:55.830
But the Romans were not content to build their,
to build their,
um,

464
00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.560
their theaters only on hillsides.

465
00:28:58.561 --> 00:29:01.230
They wanted to build their theaters where they wanted to build their theaters.

466
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.720
And if they wanted to build a theater in downtown Rome,

467
00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:05.610
they wanted to build a theater in downtown Rome.

468
00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:09.820
So what they did was that they used concrete again,
uh,

469
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:14.870
to build a hill to build a hill upon which they could support those same seats.

470
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.270
And that's again,
an innovation that we'll talk about.
Uh,

471
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:21.570
this is the theater of Marcellus and Rome,

472
00:29:21.571 --> 00:29:25.830
the earliest surviving stone theater in Rome in the eight that dates to the age

473
00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:26.461
of Augustus.

474
00:29:26.461 --> 00:29:29.520
But I show it to you again just to show you the wonders of Google Earth.

475
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:34.500
I've looked at this building a zillion times.
I've wandered around it.
Uh,
it is,

476
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:38.310
most of the ancient part is over on this side and I'll show that to you in

477
00:29:38.311 --> 00:29:40.440
another lecture.
Uh,
but over time,

478
00:29:40.441 --> 00:29:44.350
this is one of those buildings that was transformed into all sorts of things,

479
00:29:44.351 --> 00:29:47.500
most recently into a fabulous condominium.
Uh,

480
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.870
but as you wander around it today,
you can't,

481
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:54.400
you get a sense of some of the high rise apartments that have been added to the

482
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:58.360
original theater,
but you can't get a full sense of it unless you go up above it.

483
00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:59.560
And so here's where,
again,

484
00:29:59.561 --> 00:30:03.790
Google earth is so helpful because we can look down on the entire complex,

485
00:30:03.791 --> 00:30:05.710
see the garden seed,
some of the apartments,

486
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.530
see the circular driveway and so on and so forth,

487
00:30:08.531 --> 00:30:13.090
which gives us information that it would be Haas possible to glean anywhere
else.

488
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.190
And here is,
if you let that,
that,
that,

489
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:20.280
that transformation from modern Rome to ancient Rome take place on Google Earth,

490
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:23.650
this is what you're going to get for that same theater of Marcellus.

491
00:30:23.651 --> 00:30:26.350
We just saw it and it's what it looks like today.
And Google Earth.

492
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.770
Here's what it looks like when you let it transform completely,
uh,

493
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:33.730
into the theater of Marcellus from ancient times.

494
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:38.140
The Coliseum,
the very icon of Rome,
Roman.
No,
no.

495
00:30:38.141 --> 00:30:42.370
Roman city was without it's amphitheater.
It's place for gladiatorial,

496
00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:46.790
an animal combat.
Uh,
and Rome was no exception.
The most famous,
uh,

497
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.140
surviving Roman amphitheater is the coliseum.

498
00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:54.730
I show it to you here from the inside rather than the outside initially because

499
00:30:54.731 --> 00:30:55.151
I can,

500
00:30:55.151 --> 00:30:59.890
it allows me to illustrate the places where the animals were kept down below.

501
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:00.610
Uh,

502
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:05.610
but also to show you that that building has been used as a quarry.

503
00:31:05.741 --> 00:31:09.670
It was used by the pope's in the princess of later Italy as a,

504
00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:11.020
as a stone quarry.

505
00:31:11.021 --> 00:31:16.000
They would take essentially stripped it of all its interior marble to use that

506
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.520
in a variety of buildings of Rome in Rome and up.

507
00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:21.670
Some of those we know their identification even today.

508
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.820
Here's a view of one of the Carter's where you can see once again,

509
00:31:24.821 --> 00:31:28.030
those are those groin vaults or ribbed vaults,
uh,

510
00:31:28.031 --> 00:31:33.031
that the Romans popularized connecting all these cities with one another where

511
00:31:33.131 --> 00:31:36.670
the streets of the city will look at streets,
especially in palm pay,

512
00:31:36.671 --> 00:31:40.720
where they are extremely well preserved.
And these streets look very modern.

513
00:31:40.721 --> 00:31:44.740
You see the polygonal stones,
but very modern and the use of the sidewalks,

514
00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:47.830
the sidewalks there drains as well along the sidewalks.

515
00:31:47.831 --> 00:31:51.730
And then you can see these very deep red marks where the,
uh,

516
00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:56.710
where the wheels of the carts used to use it.
They,
they,
they,

517
00:31:56.711 --> 00:32:01.690
over time,
obviously they made these ruts in the pavement.

518
00:32:01.691 --> 00:32:05.290
And then over here,
a small fountain,
a fountain.

519
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.620
I'm blessed by Hermes or mercury.

520
00:32:08.621 --> 00:32:13.310
You can see him there with his wings and his caduceus,
uh,
a small,
uh,
uh,

521
00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.870
small fountain important obviously again,

522
00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.080
because most of the houses did not have running water and there had to be a

523
00:32:20.081 --> 00:32:24.970
place that you could go to collect water for household use.
Uh,

524
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.170
one of the great things about palm pay of course is it gives us a sense of,
um,

525
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:33.970
of what life was like in ancient Roman times.
Daily life was like,

526
00:32:33.971 --> 00:32:37.080
and we'll look at millstones or bake and,

527
00:32:37.081 --> 00:32:41.600
and for bay that are part of bakeries as well as ovens that look and the Romans

528
00:32:41.601 --> 00:32:44.930
invented everything look very much like a modern pizza oven.
You go over to bar,

529
00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:48.740
you'll see you have one of those.
Uh,
over here when I'm shops,

530
00:32:48.741 --> 00:32:51.860
we've lots of wine shops in these Roman cities and they're particularly

531
00:32:51.861 --> 00:32:55.100
WellPreserved and Herculaneum and,
and in Pompei,
uh,

532
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:59.780
with these clay amphorae that we're used to hold wines that were brought to

533
00:32:59.781 --> 00:33:03.620
Italy and also sometimes oils that were brought to Italy from different parts of

534
00:33:03.621 --> 00:33:04.940
the world.
Uh,

535
00:33:04.941 --> 00:33:09.710
every Roman city had it's Mcdonald's or it's Wendy's sorts burger king.
Uh,

536
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.920
and I show one of those to you here.
It's called a Thermop oleum.

537
00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:17.810
As you can see down below Thermop oleum a Thermop oleum was essentially,

538
00:33:17.811 --> 00:33:21.800
I mean,
what it was made up of is a,
um,
uh,

539
00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.930
is a series of a counter,

540
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:30.590
a counter with a series of recesses and each day,
uh,
those who,

541
00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:34.580
those who ran this,
they're Napoleon put different food in there.

542
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.460
And so when you got hungry again,
the whole sort of fast food idea,

543
00:33:37.461 --> 00:33:41.150
you're just walked,
walked by,
like in the cafeteria,
point out what you wanted,

544
00:33:41.151 --> 00:33:45.360
they'd serve it to you and you'd be on your way.
So very much a fast food.

545
00:33:45.361 --> 00:33:49.460
So we see lots of them in Pompeii and Herculaneum.
We'll look at Roman houses.

546
00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.630
This is one example.

547
00:33:50.631 --> 00:33:55.110
The house of the Betty in Pompei spectacularly preserved house,
uh,

548
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:58.940
where we can see a pool that was actually used for collecting water hole in the

549
00:33:58.941 --> 00:34:02.390
ceiling,
but a view from the atrium of the house into the garden,

550
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:07.130
the garden over here,
you get a sense of it,
the greenery,
the Marble furniture,

551
00:34:07.131 --> 00:34:11.060
the fountains,
and then the paintings on the walls.

552
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.210
I mentioned at the beginning we'll spend a fair amount of time,

553
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:18.350
we'll spend a few lectures on Roman painting.
And the reason that I do that is,

554
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:21.730
is big.
It's absolutely gorgeous and it's fascinating,
uh,

555
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:26.770
but it also allows us to get a better understanding of interior decoration among

556
00:34:27.021 --> 00:34:29.480
the Romans,
how they decorated their walls.

557
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:33.950
But also because as you can see from this one example from Boscoreale and now in

558
00:34:33.951 --> 00:34:37.110
the Metropolitan Museum,
the famous met Qubica alum,
uh,

559
00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.650
which is decorated with second style Roman wall painting,

560
00:34:39.651 --> 00:34:42.350
that these paintings often depict buildings.
They,

561
00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:46.460
they are architectural paintings and they are very important in that regard

562
00:34:46.461 --> 00:34:49.310
because we see,
we often see,
uh,

563
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:53.370
experimentation in painting before we see it in architecture there.

564
00:34:53.371 --> 00:34:55.040
So they're going to be some things,
for example,

565
00:34:55.041 --> 00:34:58.790
this broken triangular pediment that we're going to see first and painting.

566
00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:03.230
And then in build architecture.
So painting extremely important for us.

567
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.620
We'll also go to the city of Ostia,
the port of Rome,

568
00:35:06.621 --> 00:35:11.180
which is a city very different from a Pompei because it is essentially a second

569
00:35:11.181 --> 00:35:15.110
century Roman city rather than a first century Roman city.
Uh,
the,

570
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:19.790
the construction technique is a concrete faced with brick.

571
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:21.500
I show you one example of that,

572
00:35:21.501 --> 00:35:26.150
but what's most interesting about the houses and in Ostia has to do with the

573
00:35:26.151 --> 00:35:30.170
kind of city it was,
again,
the port of Rome,
a commercial city.
Uh,

574
00:35:30.171 --> 00:35:31.670
it was very congested.

575
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:35.660
People were not as wealthy as those in the resort town of palm pay.
Uh,

576
00:35:35.661 --> 00:35:36.980
and consequently they,

577
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:41.760
people didn't have single story houses like the one in palm pay that I just

578
00:35:41.761 --> 00:35:45.690
showed me before,
but rather apartment houses with multistory stories,

579
00:35:45.691 --> 00:35:48.520
a kind of condominium idea.
Uh,

580
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:52.800
and these are fascinating in their difference from those in palm pay.

581
00:35:52.801 --> 00:35:57.750
And that's a difference that we will surely explore the very well to do lived in

582
00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.370
very well to do had villas.

583
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:04.200
The emperors had villas all along what is now the Amalfi Coast coppery the

584
00:36:04.201 --> 00:36:05.250
Ireland of coppery.

585
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:10.380
The Emperor Augustus in Siberia is had 12 villas on the island of Coppery,

586
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.680
the most extraordinary villa Hadrian's villa at Tivoli,

587
00:36:13.681 --> 00:36:16.110
which I show you here from the air.
Uh,

588
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:21.150
a kind of microcosm of the empire at that particular time with extraordinary

589
00:36:21.631 --> 00:36:23.510
buildings,
with pools,
uh,

590
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:27.900
decorated with sculpture that show the eclectic taste of the emperor who liked

591
00:36:27.901 --> 00:36:32.310
things Roman like things Greek,
like things that Gypson,
uh,
and uh,

592
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:37.320
it statues of he,
he was married,
but he also had a beloved young boy,

593
00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:41.100
uh,
whom he met him Athenia and tenuous.
The famous antenna was,
uh,

594
00:36:41.101 --> 00:36:43.890
that he met in Mathenia and who became the love of his life.

595
00:36:43.891 --> 00:36:45.210
And when antenna was died,
he,

596
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:49.070
he created all kinds of shrines where antinatalism is very important

597
00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:51.840
architecturally because of all these infesting shrines.

598
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:55.740
But in each of those shrines he created statues of antenna was,

599
00:36:55.741 --> 00:36:59.490
and this is one showing ingenuous as an Egyptian Pharaoh,

600
00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:02.580
which was perfect for this particular locale,
uh,

601
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:05.880
because it was meant to conjure up a canal in Egypt.

602
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.120
We're going to look at to market texture.
I want to show you this very quickly,

603
00:37:09.121 --> 00:37:12.590
but we're going to look at a lot of to market texture because to market texture

604
00:37:12.591 --> 00:37:16.470
is particularly interesting because the only practical consideration for a tomb,

605
00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:20.070
it had to house the remains of the deceased.
That's it.
So you could,

606
00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:22.470
you could be very whimsical and personal,

607
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:25.020
personal about the kind of tomb you want it to be buried.

608
00:37:25.021 --> 00:37:27.290
And this is a series at palm pay,
uh,

609
00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:31.410
but we're going to look at those of the emperor Augustus who was buried in a

610
00:37:31.411 --> 00:37:35.460
mausoleum that went back to those of the earlier trust skins.

611
00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:39.960
Kings who ruled ruled Rome before.
Uh,

612
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:44.340
the emperors did a and he built a round tube with an earthen mound,

613
00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:48.180
very similar to that of the Atrust skins.
Hadrian.

614
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:52.770
The famous emperor Hadrian was also buried and around tomb in the well known

615
00:37:52.771 --> 00:37:54.300
causal San Angelo and Rome.

616
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:58.440
Today with its beautiful Bernini Bridge at the angels,

617
00:37:58.441 --> 00:38:00.180
the Bernini's angels on the bridge,

618
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:04.680
also around tomb in its current form transformed into a fortress.

619
00:38:04.681 --> 00:38:09.120
It was used by the pope's when they need to,
to hide out during times of trouble,

620
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:13.660
very whimsical tombs,
including,
uh,
this pyramid of,
uh,

621
00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.230
a man by the name of Cassius.
Uh,

622
00:38:16.231 --> 00:38:20.640
and he built this tomb during a time of,
um,

623
00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:25.770
when a wave of things Egyptian came into Rome at the time that,

624
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:29.820
um,
Cleopatra Augustus defeated Cleopatra and Antony.

625
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.790
And then even these communal tombs,

626
00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:37.970
communal burial places for the less to do a where their remains were pret placed

627
00:38:38.411 --> 00:38:39.244
in earns.

628
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:43.600
We'll also look at tombs and other parts of the Roman world.

629
00:38:43.601 --> 00:38:46.300
This is a famous tomb,
a rock cut tomb,

630
00:38:46.301 --> 00:38:49.720
and Peatra in what is now a Jordan,
uh,
where,

631
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:53.860
and you can see that the,
um,
that the tomb is essentially the rock.
In fact,

632
00:38:53.861 --> 00:38:57.670
the burial chamber is inside the Rock and the facade has been carved out of the

633
00:38:57.671 --> 00:39:00.000
rock.
We're going to talk about,
uh,
uh,

634
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.530
about aqueducts in the course of the semester.

635
00:39:02.531 --> 00:39:07.300
Just fleetingly show you to a way the ways in which the Romans brought for those

636
00:39:07.301 --> 00:39:07.961
they conquered,

637
00:39:07.961 --> 00:39:12.190
they provided amenities including water that was brought from a great distance.

638
00:39:12.191 --> 00:39:15.880
This is the famous poem to gardening and this the one I showed you before on

639
00:39:15.881 --> 00:39:18.220
Google Earth,
the fabulous,
uh,

640
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:22.030
aqueduct at Segovia that marches its way through the city.

641
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:27.820
I have just a couple of minutes and I basically wanted to close just making two

642
00:39:27.821 --> 00:39:32.821
very quick points about the difference between traditional Roman architecture

643
00:39:32.921 --> 00:39:35.290
and innovative Roman architecture.

644
00:39:35.291 --> 00:39:37.390
I'm not going to go into that in any detail here.

645
00:39:37.391 --> 00:39:40.930
It's going to be the topic of one of our lectures very soon.

646
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:45.010
But this transformation from temples that are based on Greek and a trust can

647
00:39:45.011 --> 00:39:48.550
prototypes like that one here to something like the Pantheon.

648
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:52.690
I also want to mention from the start that unlike other courses and architecture

649
00:39:52.691 --> 00:39:57.691
where you may have been studying Frank Lloyd Wright or Barmini Francesco

650
00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.070
Borromini or Frank Gehry,
uh,

651
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.680
we have very few names of architects preserved from Roman Times.
Uh,

652
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:06.460
because it was a patron who was all not the architect.

653
00:40:06.461 --> 00:40:09.430
And I'll explain that in a future lecture.
Uh,

654
00:40:09.431 --> 00:40:13.210
but we have sub and we'll talk about them when we do.
Uh,

655
00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:16.600
we will also see,
and I've just want to end up where I began,

656
00:40:16.601 --> 00:40:17.800
which is to say again,

657
00:40:17.801 --> 00:40:22.801
that Roman architecture had a huge impact on architecture of post-classical

658
00:40:22.811 --> 00:40:26.350
times.
The Roman basilica became the Christian Church.

659
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.840
The round tomb of Rome became the round church,
uh,

660
00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:34.150
in the early medieval in Byzantine periods.
Uh,

661
00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.810
tombs like the one in Jordan that I showed you just before,

662
00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:42.580
which form what I call a kind of baroque phase of Roman architecture where the

663
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:47.530
models for a 17th century baroque architecture in Rome,
for example,

664
00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:51.580
Borromini Son Carlino,
uh,
the Pantheon,
uh,

665
00:40:51.581 --> 00:40:55.630
had you all know what this is,
Uva,
the Pantheon had a huge impact.

666
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:58.270
There are many pantheons everywhere,
including in this country,

667
00:40:58.271 --> 00:40:59.230
banks and the like.

668
00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:04.210
Thomas Jefferson looked to the Pantheon to design his Rotunda at the University

669
00:41:04.211 --> 00:41:08.050
of Virginia and the lawn that lay beyond,
uh,
but from,

670
00:41:08.051 --> 00:41:10.600
for us in this classroom at this particular time,

671
00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:15.601
the most important impact as far as I'm concerned of Roman architecture on more

672
00:41:15.701 --> 00:41:17.280
modern architecture,
uh,

673
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:20.500
has to do with the amphitheater at Pompei which you see here,

674
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:24.980
my favorite amphitheater,
the Rome,
the coliseum is more famous.
The,

675
00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:28.300
the amphitheater at palm pay is earlier in date.

676
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:33.440
And what's significant for us in this classroom at this particular time is the

677
00:41:33.441 --> 00:41:34.980
amphitheater at palm pay.

678
00:41:34.981 --> 00:41:39.981
And I kid you not is the model for our own amphitheater and that is the Yale

679
00:41:41.601 --> 00:41:45.980
bowl and it is the model.
This is the building and you see it here from the air,

680
00:41:45.981 --> 00:41:50.450
the amphitheater in Pompei on which the Yale Bowl,
uh,
was based.

681
00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.770
So again,

682
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:56.750
the Romans have clearly had a huge impact on architecture worldwide,

683
00:41:56.751 --> 00:41:59.540
on our own architecture.
And we think we live on a gothic campus.

684
00:41:59.541 --> 00:42:02.750
But I'll show you in the course of the semester how much Roman,

685
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:05.390
how many Roman buildings there are.
In fact,
we had a post,

686
00:42:05.391 --> 00:42:10.300
and just to get you inspired,
we had a post in an earlier year in which,
uh,

687
00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:10.820
people,

688
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:15.820
when people went around the campus to take pictures and then post them online of

689
00:42:16.011 --> 00:42:19.680
buildings that they thought were influenced by those of the Roman passing.

690
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:24.230
At any rate,
that's it for today.
Great to see you meet you all.

691
00:42:24.231 --> 00:42:27.140
If any of you have any questions at all,
I'm happy to answer them.

692
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:29.930
As are the teaching fellows.
