1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.530
Last time we talked about a number of monuments that were connected to one

2
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:12.651
another geographically and also chronologically and we're also made out of the

3
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:17.190
same material concrete faced with opus and Keratin.

4
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.730
I remind you of three of those today of the sanctuary of Jupiter anchor at terra

5
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:27.360
cina of the sanctuary of Hercules,

6
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:31.020
victor at Tivoli in the center and then on the right,

7
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.280
the sanctuary of Fortuna Prima Jania at Palestrina.

8
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.970
We're going to do something entirely different today.

9
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.590
We're going to look at a single city,
one city in all its aspects.

10
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.850
It's public and private architecture.
It's civic,
commercial,

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.100
and religious buildings.

12
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.900
We can't do this sort of thing very often,
uh,

13
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.970
because too few Roman cities are either WellPreserved enough or well execute

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.840
well excavated enough to allow such an overview,

15
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.250
but this is no ordinary city.
This is a very special city.

16
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.240
The city we will be concentrating on today is Pompei.

17
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.290
Pompei was located in an area of Italy called Campania.

18
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.760
It was located near Naples.
It was located near the Mediterranean Sea.

19
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.090
It was a small resort town in the late first century BC and into the early and

20
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.930
into the first century,
a d.

21
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.090
And you can see it on this map here and it's,
it's uh,

22
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.450
it's right here.
Uh,

23
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.600
you can see that this area of campaign is obviously south of Rome.

24
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.900
It is a long,
again the Mediterranean Sea.

25
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.780
And you can see palm pay here also with its sister,

26
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:56.781
city of Herculaneum and some of the other well known cities from this area,

27
00:01:56.821 --> 00:02:01.470
bus gory,
all lay a plant.
This for example at Naples itself,

28
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.410
ancient Neapolis.
Uh,

29
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.860
and you can see this cluster of these cities that make up Campania.

30
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.500
This was an area,
I mean this,
the town itself again was a small resort town.

31
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.580
It was a town that obviously had its own population of people who made their

32
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:21.810
money largely from commerce because they were located so close to the sea.

33
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.670
But it was also a spot that was highly favored by the Glitterati of Rome who

34
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:31.140
used to come down to this area of Rome,
not only to,
to go to palm pay itself,

35
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:35.670
but to establish bill is to build villas in the vicinity of palm pay.

36
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:40.410
And we have imperial villas at places like a plumpness and in a place called bus

37
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:43.740
go,
Trey Causey that is located here as well.
Uh,

38
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.760
and along what is now the Amalfi coast and on the island of Capri,

39
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.110
uh,
so this was a town again,
that was,

40
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.200
was noticed and was visited even by the most elite in the city of Rome,

41
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.740
in Rome itself,
and the city in the center and the capital city of Rome itself.

42
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.610
But what's very important for us from the outset is to recognize that although

43
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.700
Pompei as we know it today,
was essentially a Roman city,

44
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.540
it had a history that was much longer than that,

45
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:18.340
that went back much further than that.

46
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.560
And I'd like to go over some of the major highlights of the history of palm pay

47
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:27.520
because they will situate us and will help us to understand the city's

48
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:30.850
architecture.
The history of punk pay,
as I noted,

49
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:35.350
is much longer then the history of Roman palm pay.

50
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:37.960
It goes back as far as Rome itself.

51
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.570
It goes back to the eighth century BC,

52
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:44.110
the same iron age period when Romulus was founding,

53
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:47.590
the city of Rome Pompei goes back that far as well.

54
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.810
It was first overseen by an Italian tribe called the Oskins,

55
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.110
but the Oskins were soon taken over by an even more powerful tribe called the

56
00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.711
Sam Nights.

57
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:04.510
And the some nights are in fact extremely important for the city of palm pay and

58
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:07.480
for the architecture that we'll review today,

59
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.870
the seven night period and Pompei lasted from the fourth through the third and

60
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:16.360
even into the second centuries BC,
uh,

61
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:21.361
up to 80 BC because it was in a 89 that pump pay fell to Rome.

62
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.660
We've talked about Rome colonizing,
uh,
this particular part of Italy,

63
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.580
not only the area right around it,
but the area south of it.
Uh,

64
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.650
and Pompei fell to Rome in an important military campaign in 89 BC.

65
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.410
And in 80 BC,

66
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.010
Sola made Pompei a Roman colony.

67
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.230
What happened thereafter was the Sam Knights who had built homes for themselves

68
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:54.820
in public buildings that will study here.
Uh,
the Sam nights were essentially,

69
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.990
uh,
thrown out of their homes.
Their property was confiscated,

70
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.680
and that property was given instead to the Roman veterans.

71
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:05.860
We've talked about the fact that that was the way the Romans operated.

72
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:10.450
They paid back their veterans for loyal service by giving them land,

73
00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:13.630
and they usually gave them land of those that they had conquered.

74
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:17.110
So that happens here as well.
So I'm not property confiscated.

75
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:21.280
And the Roman veteran settle in their homes and begin to Redo them,

76
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.710
settle into using their public buildings,

77
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:27.490
but begin to remake them in the Roman image.

78
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
The next century and a half saw the construction of palm pays most famous

79
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:38.140
buildings.
But we should not forget,
and we'll concentrate in part on that today,

80
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.320
that some of these buildings had their genesis under the sem nights during this

81
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:48.710
period,
there was a very high civilization in palm pay.
Uh,

82
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.110
there was trade with Greek cities and especially with the Greek city of Naiop

83
00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:58.111
opolous Neapolis being the ancient name for Naples or Naples.

84
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.630
The next very important year in the history of Pompei was the year a d 62 when

85
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:11.630
the city was literally the city of palm pay was literally shaken to its

86
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:16.310
foundations by a very significant earthquake,

87
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.950
a very significant earthquake.
Indeed.

88
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.810
And to give you some sense of that earthquake,
I show you,
uh,

89
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.670
a freeze that,
that in circles,
a shrine,

90
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.210
a that was located in the house or that was commissioned for the house,
uh,

91
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.370
as decoration and as a place to place the household gods that the owner and his

92
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:44.000
family worshipped.
The shrine had a freeze around.
The man himself,
by the way,

93
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:48.620
was named Lucius [inaudible] and we're very lucky to remember his name.

94
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:51.950
But Lucius [inaudible] you couldn't and you couldn't as,
uh,

95
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.100
fortunately we have a portrait preserved of you couldn't just so we can get a

96
00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:57.290
good sense of what he looked like,

97
00:06:57.291 --> 00:07:01.760
literally warts and all because you can see that he had a huge ward on the lower

98
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.710
left side of his face and he was willing to have himself a memorialize.

99
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:10.250
And here we are sitting and looking at him today and this classroom in new haven

100
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:15.240
as he really was with this large ward on the lower left side of his face.
Uh,

101
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.890
but a wonderful portrait of you couldn't as,
uh,

102
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.310
the owner of this particular house who was obviously so struck and probably so

103
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:27.260
affected in his own life by the earthquake,
uh,
that he decided to,

104
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.240
uh,
to have a relief commissioned that would depict the event,

105
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.680
uh,
of 60 to 80.
And you see exactly,
you see what is happening here.

106
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:41.090
You can see in fact the great temple of Jupiter,
the Capitol Liam upon pay,

107
00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:45.650
which we'll talk about today,
literally a collapsing.

108
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.360
And you can see that in front of that temple were too tall basis with equestrian

109
00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:53.210
statues honoring important people of the city.

110
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.250
Those look also like they are shaking in their boots so to speak and about to

111
00:07:58.251 --> 00:08:02.780
fall over.
Uh,
if you look down here,
you see the city wall add note,

112
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.510
you're a Ashleigh masonry,
uh,

113
00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:10.160
your opus quadro bottom and the use of headers and stretchers in this wall,

114
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.120
the wall of the city of palm pay.
But you can see the gate is not doing too well.

115
00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:15.960
It is also,
uh,

116
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:20.190
seems to be tottering at about to fall down.
So,
uh,

117
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:25.270
this is a graphic depiction of what happened then and you can,

118
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.800
it gives you some sense of,

119
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.990
of the significance of this for the people of palm pay.
Now at the end of this,

120
00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:35.000
like in so many natural disasters,

121
00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:38.660
obviously these people love living where they did beautiful part of the world

122
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.100
and they essentially stood up and dusted themselves off and began to remake

123
00:08:43.101 --> 00:08:47.430
their city to restore their city,
uh,
to what it was.
And we have a,

124
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.340
from this point on,
from 62,

125
00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:54.341
on almost immediately 17 years of frenzied building activity in which palm

126
00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.450
patients try to bring their city back from the dead,
so to speak.
Uh,

127
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:04.890
to bring it back to what it had once been.
But you know,
the punchline near,

128
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:07.890
you know,
the end of the story,
you know,
that all of this work,

129
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:12.891
all of this 17 years of hard work was all for not because on that fateful day of

130
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.880
August 24th,
uh,
in 79,

131
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:22.881
a d a the long dormant volcano of Vesuvius,

132
00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:28.251
which you see looming up behind the temple of Jupiter in Pompei today,

133
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.220
uh,

134
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:34.220
the long dormant volcano of Vesuvius erupted covering the city of palm pay and

135
00:09:35.671 --> 00:09:40.671
all of its sister cities in a mass of or in a blanket of,

136
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:46.440
uh,
of,
uh,
ash and lava covering it forever.
Well,

137
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:50.160
not quite forever,
almost forever because as you also know,

138
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:55.161
the city was rediscovered in the 18th century and when it was rediscovered a,

139
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:01.540
what happened there first was a period of a treasure hunting a well to do

140
00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:04.200
individuals primarily from Europe,
uh,

141
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:09.090
made a beeline for Pompei once it was rediscovered and began to,

142
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.980
uh,
to build their own personal collections of art.
Uh,
from what lay around,

143
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.160
they took jewelry,
they took metal items,

144
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:19.740
precious metal items they even did,

145
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.770
did the unspeakable by cutting portrait paintings and other paintings out of the

146
00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:30.651
walls and taking them back to decorate their own palaces and villas in other

147
00:10:31.141 --> 00:10:35.640
parts of the world.
That went on for a while,
but fortunately not too long,

148
00:10:35.641 --> 00:10:40.470
the archeologists gained the upper hand.
And we begin to see not long after that,

149
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.140
uh,
a period of scientific excavation.

150
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.850
And I show you two images here which show that scientific excavation,
which,

151
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:52.851
so some of the houses of pom pay being revealed by archeologists.

152
00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.120
Uh,
and of course it was all the good work that they have done.

153
00:10:57.121 --> 00:10:58.020
And work continues.

154
00:10:58.021 --> 00:11:02.460
A pace at Pompei excavation still goes on in parts of the city that have allowed

155
00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:07.170
most of the city as far as we can tell to be revealed to us,

156
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:08.370
to us today.

157
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:13.820
Now this tragedy that befell Pompei in in August of 79 was indeed a tragedy for

158
00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:18.120
them,
for the people who live there.

159
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.720
Obviously it was also a tragedy for the reigning emperor,

160
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:26.160
a man by the name of Titus t I t u s who ha,
who was the,
uh,

161
00:11:26.161 --> 00:11:28.680
honored and the famous arch of Titus in Rome.

162
00:11:28.681 --> 00:11:33.400
We'll talk about him and his architecture and Rome later in the semester.
Uh,

163
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:37.650
but it was a disaster for him and he had to contend with a plague in a fire in

164
00:11:37.651 --> 00:11:40.190
Rome also at the same time.
Uh,

165
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.430
it was very difficult for him and poor man,
even though he was quite young,

166
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.490
died of natural causes after only three years in office.

167
00:11:47.491 --> 00:11:49.350
And I think it was in part this,
this,

168
00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:53.700
this catastrophe that had happened in the Bay of Naples area.
Uh,

169
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.230
that led in part to his,

170
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.680
two of the stress of it led in part to his demise.

171
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.570
So this was a great tragedy for him,
a great tragedy for the people upon pay,

172
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.520
great tragedy for Rome.
But it,

173
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:11.200
it was a stroke of good luck for archaeologists and in a sense for us as well.

174
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:11.770
Uh,

175
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.670
because of course what happened to two palm pay is something very different than

176
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:20.470
what,
than what happened to Rome.
What happened to palm pay is that it was,

177
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.940
his life was snuffed out all at once.
It came to an end all at once.

178
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:30.160
Compare this to Rome,
which has been inhabited over millennia in Rome.

179
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.100
Buildings have been redone,
rethought,
remade,
uh,

180
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.860
over time that never happened in palm pay because palm pay again,

181
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.700
died essentially on,
in August of [inaudible] 79.

182
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:46.900
And everything that was there,
uh,
was preserved just as it was.

183
00:12:46.901 --> 00:12:49.180
And that's how it was discovered when it was re,

184
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.950
when it was excavated in the mid 18th century as it had been exactly how,

185
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:58.090
how it has,
how it had been on that day in August in [inaudible] 79.

186
00:12:58.091 --> 00:12:59.710
This is extremely important.

187
00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:04.711
It's one of our only really fixed chronological dates and it provides us with an

188
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:09.670
incredible laboratory of material because again,
everything,

189
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.590
nothing is changed,
you know,

190
00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:15.250
from the time that it was left there except for what the treasure hunters

191
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:19.780
removed.
But for the most part,
nothing has changed and we can study it as it was.

192
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.530
The other thing that you must remember from the outset that although what was

193
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:27.160
revealed by excavators,
uh,
in the 18th century,

194
00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:31.540
19th century and beyond,
even today,
uh,
was not just the Po.

195
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.070
I mean it was the palm pay of eight of August 79,

196
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.480
but the buildings that stood there were not just the buildings that had been

197
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:45.690
renovated between the earthquake of 62 and the eruption of Vesuvius of 79,

198
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.440
but some of the very earliest buildings,
including the sem night structures,
uh,

199
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.080
still stood.
And so when we look back,

200
00:13:53.081 --> 00:13:56.140
we will be able to trace in a sense,
uh,

201
00:13:56.141 --> 00:14:00.400
the city of palm pay and it's architecture from this time of the stem nights up

202
00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:03.610
until the time of the emperor Titus.

203
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:08.830
I want to begin with a plan of the city of palm pay and you see it here.

204
00:14:08.831 --> 00:14:13.831
And the plan that I show you is a plan of the city as it was in a d 79.

205
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.590
We see all of the buildings at that juncture.

206
00:14:17.591 --> 00:14:22.591
We see that the shape of the city is essentially an irregular rectangle.

207
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.131
Uh,

208
00:14:24.131 --> 00:14:29.110
and we also can see very well that the city is surrounded by a wall,

209
00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.000
a protective wall,
as were.

210
00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.510
So it was walled like all the other cities that we've talked about thus far.

211
00:14:34.511 --> 00:14:35.600
This term,
uh,

212
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:40.690
you can see some of the major buildings very clearly the amphitheater that we'll

213
00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:43.720
talk about today,
the theater and the music hall.

214
00:14:43.721 --> 00:14:46.540
Over here you can see the streets of the city,

215
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:51.160
the carto or north South Street and the deck you Montas or east,

216
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.760
West Street of the city,

217
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.680
as well as the fairly regular blocks where the houses and the shops were

218
00:14:57.681 --> 00:15:01.010
located.
What is important to note,
however,

219
00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:06.011
is that the Sam Knight's city was obviously much smaller than the city of 79.

220
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.350
And to recapture a sense of the Sab Knight City,

221
00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:14.351
we have to look at the bottom left side of this plan where we see the original

222
00:15:14.421 --> 00:15:18.740
Sam Knight City,
which seems to have been roughly a fairly regular square.

223
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:24.070
And in that Sam night city,
uh,
the Romans and they followed Roman surveying,
uh,

224
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.680
method methodology here.
Uh,
they,

225
00:15:27.681 --> 00:15:32.681
they looked to what was exactly the center of the city and they placed the

226
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.930
Cardo,
uh,
the north South Street and the deck,

227
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:40.280
you Maness the east West street at that exact midpoint of the city.

228
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.360
And then they located as they like to do the forum of the city,

229
00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:49.361
the great meeting and marketplace right at the intersection of the carto and of

230
00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:50.331
the deck,
your Montas.

231
00:15:50.331 --> 00:15:55.010
And that is exactly where we see the forum that was begun in the Sam night

232
00:15:55.011 --> 00:15:59.690
period right at the intersection of those two original streets.
Then over time,

233
00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:02.660
obviously as they expanded the city,
the Carto,

234
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:05.720
the carto grew and the deck you Montas grew,

235
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.980
and it didn't end up exactly at the center of the larger city,

236
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.250
but it was at the center of the original city.

237
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:20.990
The left's begin in fact with the forum because the forum was begun itself

238
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.180
during the time of the Sam Nights.

239
00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:27.350
You'll see from your monument list that I've given you a date of the second half

240
00:16:27.351 --> 00:16:32.000
of the second century BC,
uh,
for the forum at palm pay.

241
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.470
And again,
that indicates to us because of the chronology of the city,

242
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:40.620
of the history of the city,
that it was begun in some night times.
Uh,

243
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.650
you see here on the screen a,

244
00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:46.100
an excellent plan of the forum as it was.

245
00:16:46.101 --> 00:16:49.400
And as it grew over time,
as buildings were added over time,

246
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:53.690
this plan is from the text,
one of your textbooks from Ward Perkins.

247
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:58.460
And I think it,
uh,
it deserves a,
you know,
careful study.

248
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.550
Uh,
were we,
let's describe it together today.

249
00:17:01.551 --> 00:17:05.150
We see that the central part of the forum,

250
00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:09.860
which was again the essentially the main meeting and marketplace of the forum is

251
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.450
a very low,

252
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:15.800
a long gated rectangle with the temple at capital a,

253
00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:20.600
capital Liam at temple to Jupiter located on one of the short ends and you

254
00:17:20.601 --> 00:17:21.920
should be immediately,

255
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:26.450
your mind's eye should go immediately to the,
uh,

256
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.510
the sanctuary designs that we saw last time.

257
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.800
Think for example of the sanctuary of Hercules victor at Tivoli,
uh,

258
00:17:33.801 --> 00:17:38.480
where we saw that the temple was pushed up against one of the back walls and

259
00:17:38.481 --> 00:17:42.470
that's case the long wall and dominated the space in front of it.

260
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:47.620
We see the same kind of scheme here where we see this rectangular space with the

261
00:17:47.811 --> 00:17:49.320
temple pushed up.
In this case,

262
00:17:49.321 --> 00:17:53.850
I'm one of the short walls pushed up against the back wall and then dominating

263
00:17:53.851 --> 00:17:55.170
the space in front of it.

264
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.190
The forum itself is surrounded by Co Collin Columns,

265
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:02.610
a colonnade as you can see here.
And uh,

266
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:06.090
and it is open to the sky,
open to the sky,

267
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.730
then deployed around it all.

268
00:18:08.731 --> 00:18:12.920
The other important buildings that needed to be in a forum,
the,
uh,

269
00:18:12.921 --> 00:18:15.360
Korea or senate house over here,

270
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:20.570
the basilica or law court over here and another temple in this case,

271
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:21.840
the temple of Apollo.

272
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.860
And then a series of buildings that were added later on the right side,

273
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.460
a wonderful building of a woman that we're not going to be talking about this

274
00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:31.640
semester called you Makia,
uh,
who,

275
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.880
and it gives you some sense that women could wield power.
Uh,
it wasn't easy,

276
00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:37.920
they couldn't vote,
they couldn't hold public office,

277
00:18:37.921 --> 00:18:41.850
but they could sometimes wield power.
And this particular woman did in palm pay,

278
00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:46.590
a very large building that was for her and for her trade guilt,

279
00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:51.810
uh,
a lararium or a place,
a shrine,
a market or McCullum up there.

280
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.370
Some of these added later.
Uh,
and,

281
00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:58.380
but the ones that are particularly critical to our understanding of the Sam

282
00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.850
Knight City are the Capitol Liam and are the basilica which both date to the

283
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:07.830
second century BC.
Here's the view of,
Oh,
I'm sorry.

284
00:19:07.831 --> 00:19:12.050
I did want to say something about the Google Earth image on the,
um,

285
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.300
on the left.
Uh,
this is a Google earth earth image,

286
00:19:15.301 --> 00:19:18.420
which I tried to take in such a way that one could,

287
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.230
can see it almost exactly the same vantage point as the plan.

288
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.290
And you can see everything here that I've already pointed out.

289
00:19:25.291 --> 00:19:27.690
The open rectangular space,
the colonnade,

290
00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.990
the temple pushed up against the back wall of the temple of Jupiter.

291
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.640
The basilica over here,
the temple of Apollo,
you kias building here,

292
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.390
the,
uh,
Senate house over here and so on.

293
00:19:39.391 --> 00:19:42.710
And this again underscores the value of Google Earth,
uh,

294
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:47.780
as one can can look down on these buildings and compare what one sees to the

295
00:19:49.141 --> 00:19:53.100
master plan.
This is a view of the colonnade.
Uh,

296
00:19:53.101 --> 00:19:56.520
it's a two story colonnade at the forum of Pompei.

297
00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.420
And you can see the same thing that we saw happening in the theater,

298
00:20:00.421 --> 00:20:03.690
Marcellus in Rome,
that the columns that they have used,

299
00:20:03.691 --> 00:20:08.400
they have looked at the Greek,
the Greek orders,
the Doric,
ionic and Corinthian.

300
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.400
And they have selected here to use the Doric for the first story and the ionic

301
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:18.510
for the second story.
This colonnade does not date to the Sam night period.

302
00:20:18.511 --> 00:20:22.420
We believe,
uh,
that it was put up later.
Uh,
but it,

303
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:24.810
it's made out of white limestone.
Uh,

304
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.940
and it probably again does belong to a,
uh,

305
00:20:27.941 --> 00:20:32.440
a renovation of the forum of a somewhat later date.
Look also,
uh,

306
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.570
near the columns.
And you will see a series of basis,

307
00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:40.320
a large base over here,
a smaller base over here.

308
00:20:40.321 --> 00:20:44.550
You see a lot of these still in the forum today and what these bases were for.

309
00:20:44.551 --> 00:20:47.770
Of course we're to support statues,
statues,

310
00:20:47.771 --> 00:20:51.550
and then there would have been inscription on the base identifying who that was.

311
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:56.700
Sometimes they were statues of the reigning dynastic Rome age of Augustus that

312
00:20:57.371 --> 00:21:02.290
might be Augustus or his wife Livia.
Uh,
but they also honored the,
uh,

313
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.170
the most important people of the city of palm pay,

314
00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:07.540
magistrates great benefactors.

315
00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:11.500
You Makia we know how to portrait inside her own building,

316
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:15.580
honoring her standing next to the Empress Livia.
Uh,
so that's,

317
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:20.470
you have to imagine that while the forum is quite empty today than an antiquity,

318
00:21:20.471 --> 00:21:23.260
that would have been all of these bases with a question.

319
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:28.020
Ian Statues and full length statues vying with one another for attention.

320
00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:32.350
The individual's honored their sort of jostling with one another to uh,

321
00:21:32.351 --> 00:21:36.580
to underscore their,
their fame,
at least within their own city.

322
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:42.300
This is a view of the temple of Jupiter or the capital Liam in the forum of palm

323
00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:45.600
pay,
an extremely important building.
Uh,

324
00:21:45.601 --> 00:21:47.560
and one that you can see from the monument.

325
00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:52.561
Lee's list also began what began to be put up quite early in 150 BC,

326
00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:59.350
but it's triple Sela honoring the Capitol on Triad Jupiter,
Juno,

327
00:21:59.351 --> 00:22:00.940
and Minerva was,

328
00:22:00.941 --> 00:22:05.941
it won't surprise you to hear put up only after the Romans made Pompei a colony.

329
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.820
And that happened in ADBC.

330
00:22:09.821 --> 00:22:13.330
So you'll see that I've given you a date of one 54 the temple,

331
00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:18.331
but ADBC for the renovation of the Cella to incorporate these three spaces for a

332
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:25.270
statues of the Capitol on triad.
Let's look at the plan first.

333
00:22:25.271 --> 00:22:30.190
You see it down here at the bottom.
Let me
move that Arrow way.

334
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:31.990
You see it down here at the bottom,

335
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:37.090
and you can see that the plan of the temple corresponds a to plans that we've

336
00:22:37.091 --> 00:22:40.600
seen for other temples that we've studied thus far.

337
00:22:40.601 --> 00:22:42.910
This term temple of [inaudible] for example,

338
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:48.150
where we see this combination of and a trust can plan and a Greek elevation.

339
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.960
You can see here the facade emphasis,

340
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.790
single staircase,
deep porch,
freestanding columns in that porch.

341
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:03.100
The flat back wall as was characteristic of a trust in temple design.
Uh,

342
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.440
the plane sidewalls over here.
Uh,

343
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.820
we can see all of that in this plan.
Uh,

344
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:13.270
and we also know that the building was made out of Stone Tufa in this case,

345
00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.620
Tufa not from Rome,

346
00:23:14.621 --> 00:23:19.621
but too far from this part of Italy from the campaigning and region two for

347
00:23:19.811 --> 00:23:24.710
their,
for the both the columns and also the capital.
So a stone building.

348
00:23:24.711 --> 00:23:29.500
So this same combination of a trust can plan and Greek elevation that we saw in

349
00:23:29.501 --> 00:23:34.000
Rome.
This view of the temple also shows you that it had a tall podium as was

350
00:23:34.001 --> 00:23:36.310
characteristic of these other early temples.

351
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:41.020
Here you can see the remains of the stone columns a and of the building itself.

352
00:23:41.021 --> 00:23:43.210
It's not as well preserved as we wish it were,

353
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.280
but enough is there to give us very good sense of what the capital Liam looked

354
00:23:48.281 --> 00:23:51.380
like in ancient Roman times.

355
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:56.300
I mentioned that the other early structure added to the forum complex was the

356
00:23:56.301 --> 00:24:00.140
basilica of palm pay and I'd like to turn to that now.

357
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:04.370
The basilica palm pay dates to around 120 BC.

358
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.900
You see its plan here again in the bottom left and you'll remember it's splayed

359
00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:13.520
off from the forum to the left bottom side.
As you face the temple of Jupiter,

360
00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.000
you can see that the plan of the basilica is very interesting because it

361
00:24:17.001 --> 00:24:20.540
actually is quite similar to the plan of the forum itself.

362
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:24.560
It is a rectangular space,
not as large and not as elongated,

363
00:24:24.561 --> 00:24:27.020
but nonetheless a rectangular space.

364
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.900
It's entranceway is over here from the forum.

365
00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:35.460
You can see that there are columns inside a colonnade justice we saw in the form

366
00:24:36.261 --> 00:24:39.410
itself and the building is org is,
is,

367
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:44.470
is organized as is the forum itself axially so that there is a focus,

368
00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:47.150
something at the end that serves as the focus.

369
00:24:47.151 --> 00:24:52.010
And then the axiology comes from that.
Uh,
we see the focus over here at the end.

370
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:55.190
It's not another temple.
It is a tribunal,

371
00:24:55.370 --> 00:25:00.370
a tribunal on which the judge would sit to try the law cases that came here.

372
00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:05.060
The main difference between the basilica and the forum itself is that the

373
00:25:05.061 --> 00:25:07.100
basilica was roofed in antiquity.

374
00:25:07.101 --> 00:25:09.860
The roof is no longer there as you saw on the Google Earth view,

375
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.590
but it was roofed in antiquity.
Whereas again,

376
00:25:12.591 --> 00:25:15.590
the forum was open to the sky.

377
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.860
The view that you see of the basilica as it looks today is also very

378
00:25:21.861 --> 00:25:24.980
illuminating.
We are looking toward the tribunal.

379
00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:28.070
You can see the tribunal is actually extremely well preserved.

380
00:25:28.071 --> 00:25:31.190
We get a very good sense of what it looked like in antiquity.

381
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:36.170
It itself has a tall podium.
We can imagine the Magistrate Holding Court,

382
00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:36.510
uh,

383
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:41.510
up here on the top of that tall podium beneath between the Corinthian columns.

384
00:25:42.051 --> 00:25:46.160
In this case,
we're not absolutely sure,
but we believe the second story,

385
00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:50.510
which has smaller columns,
they diminish in size.
On the second story,
uh,

386
00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:55.530
also were a Corinthian columns because you can see at least one of them,

387
00:25:55.641 --> 00:25:59.420
one of them is restored at the top right,
but that one is a Corinthian capital.

388
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:02.870
So we believe Corinthian order on the lower story,

389
00:26:02.871 --> 00:26:06.410
Corinthian order on the second story as well,

390
00:26:06.411 --> 00:26:11.000
beginning to show this Roman pension for the Corinthian order,

391
00:26:11.001 --> 00:26:13.130
which we've already discussed.
Uh,

392
00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.820
and you can also see here a some of the,

393
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:21.500
the lower parts of the columns that would have been in circling the center of

394
00:26:21.501 --> 00:26:25.820
the structure and dividing,
uh,
the central space from two aisles,

395
00:26:25.821 --> 00:26:29.540
one on either side.
Uh,
it looks like they're made out of brick,

396
00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:32.600
but they're actually made out of a tile that looks like brick.

397
00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.760
A brick wasn't being used quite this early,

398
00:26:34.761 --> 00:26:37.660
but a tile resembling brick was used in palm bay.

399
00:26:37.661 --> 00:26:40.790
And we can see that served as the core of the columns.

400
00:26:40.791 --> 00:26:45.220
They would've been stuccoed over though and looked more like white marble,
uh,

401
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.740
indicating to us again,

402
00:26:46.741 --> 00:26:51.480
this desire of the Romans to make things look a at least or the Saturday nights

403
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:52.081
at this point.

404
00:26:52.081 --> 00:26:56.310
And ultimately the Romans when they renovated this structure to make it look as

405
00:26:56.311 --> 00:26:57.420
Greek as possible.
Yeah.

406
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:03.990
Why are the columns chopped off?
You mean almost all in the same,
same place?

407
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:08.460
You know,
these,
these things were often pieced and so sometimes they can,

408
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:12.600
that can happen.
And it's actually one of the new raise,
a very interesting issue,

409
00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.860
uh,
because one of the things that,
uh,

410
00:27:14.861 --> 00:27:18.030
that archeologists are beginning to speculate only recently about,

411
00:27:18.031 --> 00:27:21.540
and you see this in some of the most recent literature is,
you know,

412
00:27:21.541 --> 00:27:23.880
we think we here,
here we say,
and I said it today,

413
00:27:23.881 --> 00:27:27.480
that this city was preserved exactly as it was in 79.

414
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.780
And yet when you look at what it looks like,
it's actually pretty,

415
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.100
pretty ruinous state.
Uh,
so that could mean two things.
One,

416
00:27:35.101 --> 00:27:36.900
that they didn't make all that much progress.

417
00:27:36.901 --> 00:27:39.450
And that's 17 years that they worked very hard,

418
00:27:39.451 --> 00:27:44.451
but the damage had been so significant that they were not able to,

419
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.970
uh,
to bring these things back,
you know,
as much as they had hoped to.

420
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.430
But it also may be just the destruction.
I mean,

421
00:27:50.431 --> 00:27:54.750
while while the ash and lava covered the city and protected it,

422
00:27:54.751 --> 00:27:59.040
it obviously brought some damage as well so that some of these things,
you know,

423
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:04.250
obviously came down and over time the material got washed away or taken away or

424
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.600
whatever.
But it is curious that they sort of broke and exactly the same place,

425
00:28:09.601 --> 00:28:12.980
but it's because because of the construction technique and the way in which they

426
00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:16.830
were pieced together.
Yeah,
exactly.

427
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:24.560
Let me show you another view of the right side wall of the basilica.

428
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.570
You see these columns here again,
very regular.

429
00:28:27.571 --> 00:28:31.080
There's a young woman standing right here,
so that gives you a sense of scale.

430
00:28:31.081 --> 00:28:35.530
She's about only up to the,
this,
this point of the column.

431
00:28:35.531 --> 00:28:39.420
So you can see how large and scale these all these were in ancient Roman times.

432
00:28:39.421 --> 00:28:41.940
But if you look at the two that are closest to the tribunal,

433
00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:44.280
you will see that they have ionic capitals.

434
00:28:44.281 --> 00:28:49.281
So that gives us enough to go on to speculate that the first story of columns,

435
00:28:49.921 --> 00:28:53.640
and there were two stories on the walls,
uh,
two stories of columns,

436
00:28:53.641 --> 00:28:57.450
the lower ones where ionic and you can see that they are attached or engaged

437
00:28:57.451 --> 00:28:59.640
into the walls.
Uh,
those were ionic.

438
00:28:59.641 --> 00:29:02.670
And then we believe that there was a second story,
uh,

439
00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:06.990
that we know there was a second story,
but that the SEC,
second story of columns,

440
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:11.160
uh,
would have been Corinthian capitals,
uh,
up there.

441
00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:16.080
This is a restored view of what the basilica would have looked like,
uh,
in,
uh,

442
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:20.130
the,
in one 20 after it was built,
when 20 BC after it was built.

443
00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.860
And you can see here the tribunal,
we're looking toward the tribunals.

444
00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:28.110
It's two storied Corinthian order on both stories.
Tall podium.

445
00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.000
We see here in black,
uh,
the,
um,

446
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:35.730
the columns of the central space that divide the center from the two side
aisles.

447
00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.810
And here you can see very well the way in which they created two stories,

448
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:44.800
a bottom story and upper story.
You could,
you could walk on that upper story,
uh,

449
00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:49.820
and using the ionic capitals in the first story and smaller Corinthian columns

450
00:29:50.771 --> 00:29:51.820
in the second story,

451
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.300
and it's important for me to note in terms of the development,

452
00:29:55.301 --> 00:29:59.770
the later development of Basilican architecture that this basilica in palm pay

453
00:29:59.771 --> 00:30:03.220
of this early date did not have what's called a clear story.

454
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:07.510
C L E R e s t o r y c e R e.

455
00:30:07.511 --> 00:30:10.630
S.
T.
O.
R.
Y.
A clear story.
What is a clear story?

456
00:30:10.631 --> 00:30:15.631
A clear story is a series of windows open to the outside that allow views out

457
00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:20.080
and light in this building does not have a clear story.

458
00:30:20.081 --> 00:30:25.030
So it probably in its heyday in the stem night period was probably on the dark

459
00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.520
side.
But we will see that clear story.

460
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:32.470
The clear story is incorporated into later Roman basilican architecture,

461
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.790
one of the greatest buildings without any question at palm pay and one that

462
00:30:36.791 --> 00:30:39.550
everyone flocks to see.
And if you've never been to palm pay,

463
00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:43.870
let me just note that it is a little bit further out than some of the other

464
00:30:43.871 --> 00:30:44.471
structures,

465
00:30:44.471 --> 00:30:48.880
but it is a to not be missed monument.

466
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:49.743
And in fact,

467
00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:53.500
I know at least one of you is already spoken to me about an upcoming trip to

468
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.760
Rome and Pompei.
And um,

469
00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.740
consequently I just say that you absolutely need,

470
00:30:59.741 --> 00:31:03.550
I mean you could spend days at pom pay,
but you must have a full day,

471
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.060
full day for palm pay because in order to get to the,

472
00:31:07.061 --> 00:31:10.180
and not just to see the forum and what's in the center and a few of the houses

473
00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:12.790
to get out,
it doesn't take that lemon.
It's a nice walk.
It's not a big,

474
00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:17.710
not a huge distance,
but,
uh,
people forget to do it because it's on the outskirts.

475
00:31:17.711 --> 00:31:18.400
But you,

476
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:23.400
you really must get to the two end points are the amphitheater and the bill of

477
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.300
the mysteries,
both of them,

478
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:29.320
absolutely incredible to see him too often missed by tourists.
Uh,

479
00:31:29.321 --> 00:31:33.400
but two of the greatest sites at the city of Palm Bay,
this is the amphitheater.

480
00:31:33.401 --> 00:31:35.560
As it looks today from the air.

481
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:40.950
The amphitheater is one of several buildings that were begun immediately upon

482
00:31:41.201 --> 00:31:45.550
the Romans Making Pompei a Roman colony in ADBC.

483
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:50.530
You can only imagine those veterans as army veterans of war who had just been

484
00:31:50.531 --> 00:31:55.510
settled in their new homes clamoring,
uh,
from day one for the amphitheater,

485
00:31:55.511 --> 00:31:58.720
a place where they could go for gladiatorial and animal combat.

486
00:31:58.721 --> 00:32:01.750
This is what they wanted to see.
Uh,
and consequently,

487
00:32:01.751 --> 00:32:06.460
no local magistrate or emperor worth their salt would allow the city to uh,

488
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:10.820
continue without,
uh,
there were no we've no emperor and ADBC,
but uh,
would,

489
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:14.770
would allow the um,
the city to be,
uh,
to,

490
00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:17.200
to go on without an amphitheater.

491
00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:21.520
So that was one of the first orders of business.
This amphitheater at palm pay,

492
00:32:21.521 --> 00:32:26.521
which dates we believe to 80 to 70 BC is one is an incredibly important

493
00:32:27.641 --> 00:32:28.061
building.

494
00:32:28.061 --> 00:32:33.061
But the history of Roman architecture because it is our first preserved stone

495
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:36.670
amphitheater and all the empathy interviews that come later,

496
00:32:36.671 --> 00:32:41.671
including the great Colosseum in Rome are based on buildings like this one.

497
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.960
This was a great experiment in amphitheater design already in 80 to 70 BC.

498
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.290
How do they go about building this amphitheater?
Uh,

499
00:32:52.291 --> 00:32:54.950
what they seem to have done is to,
uh,

500
00:32:55.130 --> 00:33:00.130
to excavate the central area of the earth of the central area to create a space

501
00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:04.610
for the oval arena,
which you see here.
And I put the terms on,

502
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:08.210
the monument was for you,
the arena,
which you see here.

503
00:33:08.211 --> 00:33:11.780
So they've excavated that central space,
place the arena there.

504
00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.030
Then they have piled up earth.

505
00:33:14.031 --> 00:33:17.150
It's essentially an earthen bowl is what they've created here.

506
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:21.560
And earthen bowl with the excavated space for the arena and then piled up the

507
00:33:21.561 --> 00:33:25.310
earth on the outside to support the seats,

508
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.730
to support the seats,
to serve as a support for the seats.

509
00:33:28.731 --> 00:33:32.610
There was no natural hill here,
so they had to do this on their own.
Uh,

510
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:35.060
so they build up the earth,
they place the seats,

511
00:33:35.061 --> 00:33:39.450
they line that earthen bowl with seats,
stone seats,
uh,

512
00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:44.460
and they create the cabiya of the amphitheater because we use the same term for

513
00:33:44.571 --> 00:33:49.370
the seats of an amphitheater.
As for the seats of a theater,
the Kava,
or see a VA,

514
00:33:49.371 --> 00:33:52.280
the Kavya or the seats of the amphitheater.

515
00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.890
And you can also see here light in in indicated,
uh,

516
00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:01.700
the wedge shaped sections of the seats,
just as in the theater.

517
00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:06.770
They are called the same thing.
The KUNAE Scu and eus,
or in the plural Kunae,
he,

518
00:34:06.771 --> 00:34:11.450
c,
u,
N,
e,
I a.
So these wedge-shaped individual sections,
a Coonass,

519
00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.500
all of them together.

520
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:17.530
Kunae he the KUNAE or wedge shape sections of the seeds apparent here,

521
00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:20.510
the exits and entrances.

522
00:34:20.511 --> 00:34:23.390
And there are a couple of major ones on either side.

523
00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:28.310
Those have a colorful and unforgettable name.
I guarantee you,

524
00:34:28.311 --> 00:34:31.240
you will remember this name for the rest of your lives.
Uh,

525
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:35.330
those exits and entrances are called vomitorium,
uh,

526
00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:39.860
which means they literally spit forth spectators,
vomitorium,

527
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:44.900
uh,
these exits,
these entrances and exits to the amphitheater.

528
00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.910
Let me also note that the outer ring and the outer ring is extremely important

529
00:34:49.911 --> 00:34:53.450
because it buttresses,
uh,
the,
uh,
earthen bowl.

530
00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:58.660
That outer ring is made of concrete concrete that we'll see is faced with opus

531
00:34:59.121 --> 00:35:00.970
and Keratome work.
Uh,

532
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:05.330
and the entire structure is encircled by a,

533
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:08.990
an annular volt,
one of these ring volts that in circles,

534
00:35:08.991 --> 00:35:12.500
the entire structure that is made out of concrete.

535
00:35:12.501 --> 00:35:16.190
So another early example of the,
uh,
of the,

536
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:21.430
of the masterful use of concrete faced with opus and keratome work in this case,

537
00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:27.230
in the amphitheater in Pompei,
I show you a Google earth image of this,
uh,

538
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:32.290
which gives you a very good sense of the oval shape of the original structure.

539
00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:38.380
I think it's important to compare the exterior of amphitheater upon pay,

540
00:35:38.671 --> 00:35:42.160
which is extremely well preserved as you can see here,
uh,

541
00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:47.180
with the experiment at the much earlier a sanctuary of 14 for tuna premed Jania

542
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:55.190
at Palestrina where we also saw this use of concrete faced with opus and Keratin

543
00:35:55.910 --> 00:36:00.860
work.
If we look at the facade of the amphitheater at Pompei,

544
00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:05.400
we'll see first of all,
how exceedingly well preserved it was.
Uh,

545
00:36:05.401 --> 00:36:09.450
we also see,
uh,
the,
this,
this,
uh,

546
00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:13.620
unique staircase here,
uh,
with,
uh,
stairs.

547
00:36:13.621 --> 00:36:16.350
And I'll show you a side view in a moment where you can see those stairs,

548
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:19.010
stairs leading up on both sides.
Uh,

549
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:24.050
to the apex and then a series of arches in diminishing size,

550
00:36:24.901 --> 00:36:28.650
larger in the center and diminishing in size as they go down the ramp to

551
00:36:28.651 --> 00:36:31.230
correspond to the shape of the ramp.
Uh,

552
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.750
and then additional arcades over here,

553
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:38.000
these are what are called blind arcades because you'll see that they have wall a

554
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:38.850
wall in the back.

555
00:36:38.851 --> 00:36:43.230
You can't walk in these arcades and get into the amphitheater.

556
00:36:43.231 --> 00:36:48.000
There are only two barrel vaulted corridors and you saw them in the general view

557
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:51.810
on one on either long side of the oval,
uh,

558
00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:56.730
that you can actually walk in and out of the,
of the amphitheater from them.

559
00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:01.770
But you can go up the staircase and enter the amphitheater as well from the

560
00:37:01.771 --> 00:37:06.180
Kavya go up to the top and then just go at the upper most top part of the steps

561
00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.930
and walk down to your seats that way.

562
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.620
So the blind arcades,
we can see here,
we can see that once again,

563
00:37:13.621 --> 00:37:16.470
just as we saw on some of the other buildings we looked at last time,

564
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.680
the way in which they've used opus and carried them for most of the wall,

565
00:37:19.681 --> 00:37:23.790
the facing for the concrete for most of the wall.
But they have used stone,
uh,

566
00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:28.570
both,
uh,
blocks of stone and these Bu's war blocks,
wedge shape blocks to uh,

567
00:37:28.571 --> 00:37:31.080
articulate the arcades,
uh,

568
00:37:31.081 --> 00:37:35.880
to make them more prominent and also to give the building,
uh,
additional,

569
00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.560
uh,
stability.

570
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:41.340
What's interesting here and one of the reasons I also bring back the sanctuary

571
00:37:41.341 --> 00:37:44.610
or Fortuna Prima Jania is the fact that the Romans,
again,

572
00:37:44.611 --> 00:37:48.000
or giving you some options in terms of how you get into this building,

573
00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:52.020
you can get in through the barrel vaulted carters,
uh,
or uh,
or,

574
00:37:52.021 --> 00:37:55.800
or you can climb up this distinctive staircase.
And by the way,
we have no other,

575
00:37:55.801 --> 00:37:57.630
this is truly is a unique staircase.

576
00:37:57.631 --> 00:38:01.320
We have no other one like it in the history of Roman architecture.

577
00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.840
So you have those options.
But again,

578
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.200
they are still predetermining the way in which you go.

579
00:38:07.201 --> 00:38:09.130
I mean they give you a few options but uh,

580
00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:13.010
within that scheme it is clearly a predetermined path.
Uh,

581
00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:18.360
up the staircase over here and then through only those two barrel vaulted

582
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:23.790
Carter's and we talked about that at the Fortuna premed Jania sanctuary,
uh,

583
00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:26.370
up the ramps and then up the staircase in the center.

584
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:31.320
A very similar way of thinking about getting people from one place to another in

585
00:38:31.321 --> 00:38:35.000
an orderly way.
The staircase.

586
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:40.060
So distinctive that and here I show you a side view of it where you can actually

587
00:38:40.061 --> 00:38:43.630
see the steps leading up.
And if you don't,
if you go visit there,

588
00:38:43.631 --> 00:38:46.060
you should try both options.
I'm in go down the corridor.

589
00:38:46.061 --> 00:38:49.590
But also it's a lot of fun to go up the steps and into the caveat.
Uh,

590
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:54.280
but it's so distinctive and,
and never to be repeated,
uh,
that when we look,

591
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:57.580
there's a painting that survives from a palm pay in house.

592
00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.010
We'll look at it in more detail later in the semester,

593
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:04.510
but I wanted to just show it to you now because it is so apparent that it is a

594
00:39:04.511 --> 00:39:08.380
representation of the amphitheater at palm pay,

595
00:39:08.381 --> 00:39:10.810
which is not surprising since this is a house in palm pay.

596
00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:14.530
But you see that distinctive staircase here with the steps,
uh,

597
00:39:14.531 --> 00:39:17.740
the way in which you can enter into the copy or you get a sense of the coffee

598
00:39:17.741 --> 00:39:19.780
and the kind of goings on that one that,

599
00:39:19.781 --> 00:39:23.200
that happened in this Pompei amphitheater.
Uh,

600
00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:26.970
but you can also see this is a very important detail that,
uh,

601
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:31.600
that is then this is the only place where we actually have a representation of

602
00:39:31.601 --> 00:39:32.020
it.

603
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:36.370
You can see that at the upper most part of the caveat there is an awning called

604
00:39:36.371 --> 00:39:40.300
the velarium and I've put that word on the monument lists for you and awning

605
00:39:40.301 --> 00:39:45.070
that was supported by polls that were located on brackets at the upper most part

606
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:48.070
of the amphitheater.
And that awning,

607
00:39:48.071 --> 00:39:51.760
the purpose of that owning the palm Payan seemed to have a thing for protecting

608
00:39:51.761 --> 00:39:55.410
the Romans in general for protecting people in inclement weather.
Uh,

609
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:58.390
so they put these awnings up when it rained,

610
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:03.900
they put these awnings up to protect those who were there to see a gladiatorial

611
00:40:04.451 --> 00:40:07.880
combat to protect them from that rain.

612
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:14.400
One last view of the amphitheater Pompei we are looking at it at its bowl shaped

613
00:40:15.071 --> 00:40:19.960
arena as you can see here and the seats that do survive at to get a sense of the

614
00:40:19.961 --> 00:40:24.961
interior here you can see very well the two a barrel vaulted entrances and exits

615
00:40:25.571 --> 00:40:28.150
of one on either side and that's the only way.
Again,

616
00:40:28.151 --> 00:40:31.510
those blind arcades you can't get in that way and you can see that very well

617
00:40:31.511 --> 00:40:31.721
here.

618
00:40:31.721 --> 00:40:36.721
Those are the only entrance or exits into the theater besides the staircase.

619
00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:40.330
And in the introductory lecture I made the point and I'll just bring it back

620
00:40:40.331 --> 00:40:41.164
home again,

621
00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:46.520
that the Yale Bowl here in new haven is based on the amphitheater and palm pay.

622
00:40:46.991 --> 00:40:48.640
There's no question about that.
In fact,

623
00:40:48.641 --> 00:40:52.420
if one goes back in the literature on the bowl and its original construction,

624
00:40:52.421 --> 00:40:56.440
it is even mentioned in original articles that the architects were looking back.

625
00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:57.670
I mean,
I'm not making this up.

626
00:40:57.671 --> 00:41:01.450
The architects were actually looking back at the palm pay amphitheater as a

627
00:41:01.451 --> 00:41:05.050
model and you can see the relationship when you look at the bowl from the air,

628
00:41:05.051 --> 00:41:06.240
you can see it as a bowl.

629
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:11.080
It's kind of a bowl shape almost exactly like the shape of the Pompei

630
00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.000
amphitheater.
This aerial view by the way,

631
00:41:13.001 --> 00:41:16.630
was taken at the time of the hundredth game between,
you know,

632
00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:19.780
and Harvard and you can see the stands were packed.
Uh,

633
00:41:19.781 --> 00:41:22.840
the major difference between these two amphitheaters,
uh,

634
00:41:22.841 --> 00:41:27.010
is the fact that the one in palm pay was made to hold 20,000 people.

635
00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:31.810
The one and Yale can hold up to as many as 78,000 people.

636
00:41:31.811 --> 00:41:35.500
So we have a larger,
uh,
amphitheater,
so to speak here,
uh,

637
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.330
than they did and do in the theater in the city.

638
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:43.690
Pompei I want to move from the amphitheater to the other great entertainment

639
00:41:43.881 --> 00:41:46.010
district of palm pay.

640
00:41:46.011 --> 00:41:50.150
And that was the theater and the music hall,

641
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:54.440
the theater and the music hall.
And I want to show those two fairly quickly.
Uh,

642
00:41:54.441 --> 00:41:59.441
we see them here in plan the theater in red and the music hall here in a kind

643
00:42:00.261 --> 00:42:03.410
of,
I dunno,
chartreuse,
uh,

644
00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:06.740
as you can see it dates to a 80 to 70 BC.

645
00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:10.690
So another example of a building that was added when the Romans,
uh,

646
00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:15.040
gained descendants of this part of the world.
Uh,
and uh,

647
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:18.590
a couple of terms,
again,
we can see if we look at the theater,

648
00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:20.750
we can see the uh,

649
00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:25.130
the fact that the theater is semi circular in shape or the copy is semi circular

650
00:42:25.131 --> 00:42:28.930
and shape.
We can see the wedge shaped who ne up there.
Uh,

651
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:32.600
we can also see that the orchestra is semi circular in shape,

652
00:42:32.601 --> 00:42:36.780
not round and that there's a scanner as CNA or a scan.

653
00:42:36.781 --> 00:42:41.060
I frons is,
I called it last time a stage building at the front.

654
00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:45.700
There is also a space over here which we call the porticas.
And again,

655
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:48.950
I put that on the monument list for you.
The portico is what was the port,

656
00:42:48.951 --> 00:42:49.541
it goes to the port.

657
00:42:49.541 --> 00:42:54.541
It as was an open rectangular space with covered colonnades on either side.

658
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.940
The purpose of the porticas was to have a place where people could go during

659
00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:01.430
intermission,
uh,
to,
uh,

660
00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:05.540
to stretch their legs during the intermission of the comedy or tragedy that they

661
00:43:05.541 --> 00:43:09.020
were there to see.
A,
and there were little shops along the way,

662
00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:13.640
a little spaces along the way.
Some of them served as shops for playbills and uh,

663
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:17.480
other souvenirs from the evenings experience.
Uh,

664
00:43:17.481 --> 00:43:22.481
but also that served as spaces where props and scenery and costumes and all

665
00:43:24.501 --> 00:43:28.370
sorts of things that were needed in the theatrical theatrical performances could

666
00:43:28.371 --> 00:43:30.590
be kept.
So that's the port it goes.

667
00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:35.660
Then over here we see the music hall.
It's a smaller version of the theater,

668
00:43:35.661 --> 00:43:39.740
but it's designed in exactly the same way with a semicircular orchestral,

669
00:43:39.741 --> 00:43:43.910
the semicircular copy of the division and to Kunae.
As you can see here,

670
00:43:43.911 --> 00:43:47.720
a small inlet,
much less elaborate scanner in the front.

671
00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:51.650
The major difference between the two and we see this not just in Palm Bay but

672
00:43:51.651 --> 00:43:56.120
throughout Roman architecture is not just the scale that the theater is always

673
00:43:56.121 --> 00:43:58.310
much bigger than the music hall,

674
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:03.460
but that the theater was open to the sky and the music hall was had a roof,

675
00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.870
uh,
and that roof,
that roof,

676
00:44:05.871 --> 00:44:08.570
the reason for the roof and the smaller music hall and the reason for the

677
00:44:08.571 --> 00:44:13.571
smaller size was to be to make the acoustics as good as they could possibly be.

678
00:44:14.181 --> 00:44:18.800
And that was easier to do in a roof building and an a building of smaller scale,

679
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:22.730
a Google earth view of the theater and music hall.

680
00:44:22.731 --> 00:44:25.040
As they look today and you can see they're quite well preserved.

681
00:44:25.041 --> 00:44:29.630
You can see the exact shapes that we looked at in plan over and over there.

682
00:44:29.631 --> 00:44:31.230
Here's our porticas for example.

683
00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:35.580
You get a sense of how pleasant that might be able to be during intermission

684
00:44:35.581 --> 00:44:39.000
time.
Uh,
what this view also gives you a sense of however,

685
00:44:39.001 --> 00:44:42.780
is the way in which these two buildings are embedded in the rest of the city

686
00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:46.830
that they are.
They do make up an entertainment district,
but at the same time,

687
00:44:46.831 --> 00:44:50.390
they are very close to the city streets that have,
uh,

688
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:54.300
on along them houses and shops and so on and so forth.

689
00:44:54.301 --> 00:44:57.000
So very closely embedded into the life,

690
00:44:57.001 --> 00:45:00.270
into the commercial life and the residential life of the city.

691
00:45:00.271 --> 00:45:02.070
Even though this was intended,
again,

692
00:45:02.071 --> 00:45:05.280
as a great entertainment area for those who live there.

693
00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.640
And I made this point before,
but I'll make it quickly again,

694
00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:13.410
that while Roman theaters like the theater Pompei are based on Greek prototypes.

695
00:45:13.411 --> 00:45:16.500
There are some differences.
Uh,
they,
the two theaters,

696
00:45:16.501 --> 00:45:19.980
this is the Greek theater at Epidaurus of the mid fourth century BC.

697
00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:24.360
They both have the stone seats.
They both have,
which is called the Kavya.

698
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:27.030
They both have these wedge shapes,
sections of seats.

699
00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:31.470
They both have a stage building,
although the Greek one is much simpler.
Uh,

700
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.730
and uh,
they all,

701
00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:36.750
but the major differences between the two is that the Greek theater has a

702
00:45:36.751 --> 00:45:40.620
circular or Kestra,
whereas the Roman theater,
it has a,

703
00:45:40.621 --> 00:45:44.310
and this is the theater of Pompei has a semicircular orchestra.

704
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:46.350
And the other major difference,

705
00:45:46.351 --> 00:45:50.190
the most significant one is the Greeks built their theaters on hillsides.

706
00:45:50.191 --> 00:45:53.490
As you can see it up adores the Romans,
built their theaters.

707
00:45:53.491 --> 00:45:57.870
And this is the case in palm pay on a hill made out of concrete.

708
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:05.260
I want to turn to an extremely important building and one that I am going to,
uh,

709
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.230
come back to on a number of occasions during the semester.

710
00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:13.240
So put an asterisk next to this one as a particularly important building in one

711
00:46:14.161 --> 00:46:18.740
that it's almost certain I'll find some way of incorporating into the mid term,

712
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.770
mid term,
uh,
because I think it's so significant and it will,

713
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:26.130
it will turn up again and again and again in the course of the term,

714
00:46:26.131 --> 00:46:28.470
especially when we talk about later bath architecture.

715
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:31.020
It is a stogie and bas of Pompei.

716
00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:36.350
It dates to the second half of the second century BC and it was remodeled in the

717
00:46:36.781 --> 00:46:39.240
first half of the first century BC.

718
00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:43.860
This dobby and bas are one of several bath buildings at palm pay.

719
00:46:43.861 --> 00:46:47.310
I mentioned in the introductory lecture that uh,
the,

720
00:46:47.311 --> 00:46:50.070
these houses in palm pay did not have running water.

721
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:55.340
And so access to bathing and to water for daily use was obviously critical and

722
00:46:56.071 --> 00:46:59.250
the bath serve that purpose,
the place where one could go and bathe,

723
00:46:59.251 --> 00:47:02.190
but they were also,
they also became great social centers,

724
00:47:02.191 --> 00:47:05.730
great places where you really wanted to go and hang out with your friends while

725
00:47:05.731 --> 00:47:09.720
you were sitting in the sauna.
And uh,
and so they take on a very,

726
00:47:09.721 --> 00:47:13.680
they are a very important piece of life in cities like palm pay,

727
00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:18.330
the stobby and Baz is there date indicate or very early there begun already

728
00:47:18.331 --> 00:47:21.780
under the Sam Nights.
And they have some extremely interesting features.

729
00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:26.340
And once again,
I'm going to have to go over some of the bath terminology.

730
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:29.500
You can see here that if you walk along street,

731
00:47:29.501 --> 00:47:32.980
you just see a series of cubicles which served the shop.
So,
you know,

732
00:47:32.981 --> 00:47:35.110
fairly unprepossessing,
uh,

733
00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:39.730
but there is an entrance way through those shops into a very large open space

734
00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:44.530
surrounded by columns on three sides that is called the [inaudible] of the
baths.

735
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:49.240
The polestar was the exercise courts where you jogged and,
and uh,
you know,

736
00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:53.380
and ran around and so on.
And after you exerted yourself and got all sweaty,

737
00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:56.800
you could jump into the pool that was located over here.

738
00:47:56.801 --> 00:47:58.600
This was not a place to do laps.

739
00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:02.970
It was pretty much a soaking pool or pool where you can cool off.
Uh,

740
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:06.430
but the technical term for that is either a PC now,

741
00:48:06.431 --> 00:48:08.290
which is what's on the monument list for you,

742
00:48:08.291 --> 00:48:13.291
or a natal ito and a t eight t I o a little pool where you could splash yourself

743
00:48:13.751 --> 00:48:17.230
after exerting yourself by exercising in the Polestar,

744
00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:20.080
the build up the bath block itself,

745
00:48:20.081 --> 00:48:25.081
the bathing rooms themselves are located on the other side of the plan on the

746
00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:30.510
right side as you see it here,
the northern side actually of the plan.
Uh,

747
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:35.320
and we see two sets of spaces.
This set of four down here,
this one,

748
00:48:35.321 --> 00:48:36.610
this one,
this one and this one.

749
00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:40.210
And then a set of a comparable number of rooms up there,

750
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:41.950
these early Roman baths.

751
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:46.480
There was a separation between the men section of the Bas and the women's

752
00:48:46.481 --> 00:48:50.800
section of the Bas.
And I'm sorry ladies,
but um,

753
00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:54.400
we'll have to accept the fact that at least an ancient Pompei,
uh,

754
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:58.930
the women's section was quite nondescript.
It was much smaller than the men's.

755
00:48:58.931 --> 00:49:00.790
At least they had one thank goodness.
Uh,

756
00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:05.200
but it was smaller than the men's and the rooms had no architectural distinction

757
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:09.620
whatsoever.
All of the designers effort went into creating,
uh,

758
00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:12.250
a wonderful set of room for the men.

759
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:14.710
And we see the men's rooms again over here,

760
00:49:14.711 --> 00:49:17.620
these four and the women's at the top.
Consequently,

761
00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:21.880
the only ones that have any merit architecturally in my share showing you today

762
00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:26.980
are the ones for the men's baths down here.
Uh,
the four rooms,

763
00:49:26.981 --> 00:49:31.750
the four key rooms to both the men's and women's sections were the Apo d

764
00:49:31.751 --> 00:49:34.450
Terrian.
And again,
these words that are on the monument list for you,

765
00:49:34.451 --> 00:49:37.330
the [inaudible],
which was the dressing room.

766
00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:40.960
It's a fairly,
again,
it's large,

767
00:49:40.961 --> 00:49:45.190
but a fairly nondescript rectangular room here.
You can see it right down here.

768
00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:49.720
And the way it was designed was that you went in and there were no lockers,

769
00:49:49.721 --> 00:49:53.080
no private lockers,
but uh,
there were benches where you could,

770
00:49:53.081 --> 00:49:53.980
when you got undressed,

771
00:49:53.981 --> 00:49:57.760
you could just take your clothes and put them in a little pile on that bench.
Uh,

772
00:49:57.761 --> 00:50:01.000
you have to just take on faith that no one was going to steal any of your

773
00:50:01.001 --> 00:50:05.080
belongings.
And if you were very well to do some of the very well to do Romans,

774
00:50:05.081 --> 00:50:07.660
men and women brought slaves with them,
their slave,

775
00:50:07.661 --> 00:50:12.661
their private slave to watch their stuff while they were in the sauna with their

776
00:50:12.911 --> 00:50:15.610
friends from the auditorium.

777
00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:18.340
You go into the so called a Doriam of the Baz.

778
00:50:18.341 --> 00:50:21.790
Also usually a plain rectangular room,
even in the men's section,

779
00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:25.330
which served as the warm room,
where you started to warm yourself up.

780
00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.840
You went from the tip of Doriam into the call Darian of the bath,

781
00:50:29.841 --> 00:50:34.010
which was the a hot room,
uh,
the where you really,
where it was,

782
00:50:34.011 --> 00:50:38.600
the sauna essentially of the bath.
And consequently there was a,
um,

783
00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:42.620
a basin over here with cold waters.
If you've got too hot,

784
00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:45.920
you could go and splash yourself,
uh,
with that cold water.

785
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:49.250
So Apple d tarian tepid,
Darian called Rem.

786
00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:53.360
By then you're really heated up and you can make your way back into this room

787
00:50:53.361 --> 00:50:57.700
over here,
which is called the [inaudible] or the cold room.
The frigate.

788
00:50:57.701 --> 00:51:00.470
Darian was a place that you could really cool off.

789
00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:04.100
And I think you can see by looking at these,
the two most important rooms,

790
00:51:04.101 --> 00:51:07.340
architecturally,
you can see this even in plan are the caldarium,

791
00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:11.960
which has an apps are curved element at the end.
Uh,

792
00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:14.970
and this room in particular,
the frigate Darian,
uh,

793
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:19.280
because it is a round structure with radiating alcoves and we're going to see

794
00:51:19.281 --> 00:51:24.140
that it's domed.
This is a particularly again,
Star Star Star Star,

795
00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:26.360
one of the most important rooms that I've shown you,

796
00:51:26.361 --> 00:51:30.890
probably the most important room I've shown you thus far this semester in that

797
00:51:30.891 --> 00:51:32.780
it is going to have a very long future.

798
00:51:32.781 --> 00:51:37.040
Architecturally what you see here basically ends up as the Pantheon a someday,

799
00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:37.490
uh,

800
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:41.900
this round space round structure with radiating alcoves and as we'll see a dome

801
00:51:41.901 --> 00:51:45.130
and not only a dome but a hole in the ceiling and Oculus,

802
00:51:45.131 --> 00:51:47.990
it allows light into the structure.
Uh,

803
00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.150
how were these baths a heated?

804
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:53.720
How were the hot rooms he did through a system called a hypo cost.
Again,

805
00:51:53.721 --> 00:51:58.660
I put them on the word on the monument list for you.
A hypo cost,
h.
Y p.
H.
Y.
P.
O.

806
00:51:58.661 --> 00:52:01.370
C.
U.
S.
T.
What was a hypo cost system?

807
00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:05.240
A hypo cost system was a system by which they put terracotta

808
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:08.120
terracotta,
um,

809
00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:13.240
tubes in the floor and behind the walls they blew hot air into those and they

810
00:52:14.061 --> 00:52:19.061
also raised up the pavement of the floor on a series of stacked tiles.

811
00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:23.840
And you can see that extremely well was a very well preserved hypo costs from

812
00:52:23.841 --> 00:52:28.841
the stop being Baz place these tiles on stack stacks of tiles let leaving space

813
00:52:29.421 --> 00:52:34.190
in between them and put Braziers,
uh,
between those tin,
tin,
metal,

814
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:38.450
Braziers,
uh,
metal bowls that held hot coals and so on.

815
00:52:38.451 --> 00:52:41.560
And that from those hot coals,
obviously it's slaves who had to,
you know,

816
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:43.100
keep those,
slept,
those coals hot,

817
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:48.400
but calls that were placed in these pans that,

818
00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:50.310
uh,
that,
uh,

819
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:55.510
helped also to heat the pavement that was located above the,

820
00:52:56.181 --> 00:52:59.750
this very important room,
the [inaudible] of the stubby and Baz,

821
00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:04.430
you see it here as it looks today,
a small round space.

822
00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:05.830
Uh,
it has a,
it would,

823
00:53:05.831 --> 00:53:10.740
it would have had a pool in the center around pool radiating alcoves,
uh,

824
00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:15.800
a dome,
a dome that is open to the sky with an Oculus and allows light into it.

825
00:53:15.801 --> 00:53:20.450
You can see the remains of paint stucco and then paint blue and red paint.

826
00:53:20.451 --> 00:53:24.500
Probably some kind of marine seen,
uh,
included here.
But this,

827
00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:29.501
I can't underscore enough the importance of this particular room and the future

828
00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:34.920
that this design has for Roman architecture.
I'd like to show you,

829
00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:39.090
um,
another bath at Pompei,
the so called foreign bows.

830
00:53:39.091 --> 00:53:42.600
The Forum bounds are interesting because they're later.
They date two,

831
00:53:42.601 --> 00:53:44.940
as you can see from your monument list of ADBC.

832
00:53:44.941 --> 00:53:49.410
So this is what the Romans did when they came in and took over palm pay and

833
00:53:49.411 --> 00:53:53.550
we're making it into one of those mini Rome's those cities and the in the,

834
00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:58.050
in the,
um,
and the model of Rome.
And you can see it as very,

835
00:53:58.051 --> 00:54:03.051
very similar to what was going on in the Stogie and bows and the earlier Sam

836
00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.590
night baths,
uh,

837
00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:09.620
with the same polestar we see a polestar up at to the exercise court.

838
00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:14.220
We don't seem to have a Natacha.
And this particular plan,
uh,

839
00:54:14.221 --> 00:54:17.370
we see the men's section over here at three,
four,

840
00:54:17.371 --> 00:54:21.690
five and six and the women's section over here,
seven,
eight,
nine,
10.
Again,

841
00:54:21.691 --> 00:54:24.390
the women's section off to the side of,
no,

842
00:54:24.391 --> 00:54:27.480
our architectural distinction whatsoever.
Uh,

843
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:31.110
the men's over here and you can enter the men's either through the Polestar or

844
00:54:31.111 --> 00:54:32.940
permit opening over here at one,

845
00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:36.900
we see the same set of rooms that we saw at the stop and baths.

846
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.050
We see the [inaudible] or dressing,

847
00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:44.280
undressing and dressing room over here at three,
the tepid Arrium at five.

848
00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:49.320
The caldarium at six in the caldarium at six is of the same shape as the

849
00:54:49.321 --> 00:54:51.120
caldarium and the stobby and Baz,

850
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:55.360
a rectangular room with an apse at the end and a um,

851
00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:58.020
a basin for cold water splashes.

852
00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:01.470
And then you go back again to the frigate Dorian and you can see the frigging

853
00:55:01.471 --> 00:55:04.800
Darian in the bads,
a forum baths upon pay,

854
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:09.210
the same shape as that in the stobby and Basit Pompei,
a round,

855
00:55:09.211 --> 00:55:12.390
a small round room with radiating alcoves.

856
00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:17.840
I can show you views both of the [inaudible] of the forum,

857
00:55:18.331 --> 00:55:21.420
Baz extremely well preserved.
As you can see here,

858
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:25.380
you can also see they've used a great barrel vault for this room.

859
00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.060
It isn't as large as it looks here,

860
00:55:27.061 --> 00:55:32.061
but it's a sizable room and this is a very good place to show you by the way,

861
00:55:32.281 --> 00:55:34.620
to give you a sentence of how these things were decorated,

862
00:55:34.621 --> 00:55:37.200
how so many rooms to Roman rooms today.

863
00:55:37.201 --> 00:55:40.950
Roman buildings today are stripped of their original decoration.
Uh,

864
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:44.520
but that decoration was often quite beautiful and ostentatious.

865
00:55:44.521 --> 00:55:47.550
And we can see here a,
we can get here a sense of that.

866
00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:51.240
You can see the wall has been stuccoed over.
And then also in Stucco,

867
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:54.360
these great flowering of campus plants and uh,

868
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:57.090
creatures flying above animals,

869
00:55:57.091 --> 00:56:01.740
human feature of Gods and goddesses flying above paint was up.
You know,
you,

870
00:56:01.741 --> 00:56:05.040
they use paint as well,
red and blue and white and other colors,
uh,

871
00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.600
to accentuate the design.

872
00:56:06.601 --> 00:56:10.180
This could you some sense of the flavor of these and then this wonderful detail

873
00:56:10.181 --> 00:56:15.120
below of these atlas figures who are shown holding up the vault of this

874
00:56:15.121 --> 00:56:19.190
particular room.
It gives you some sense of why Romans flocked to these places,

875
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:22.170
not only because it was the only place they can bathe themselves,

876
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:26.320
but also because it was just a wonderful space to be in and to enjoy.
Again,

877
00:56:26.321 --> 00:56:29.740
the company of friends.
This is a view of what room

878
00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:36.020
and the forum baths,
the caldarium excellent Neil,
the caldarium,

879
00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:36.440
uh,

880
00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:41.290
over here with it's a rectangular shape and then it's apps and it's cold water,

881
00:56:41.291 --> 00:56:44.980
Bay basin for cold water splashes.
And then look at the ceiling.

882
00:56:44.981 --> 00:56:49.440
How wonderful in that,
in that,
uh,
apps,
you see a semi dome,
a,

883
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:53.950
a round hole or an oculus in that semi dome to allow light into it.

884
00:56:53.951 --> 00:56:58.150
So here we see them exploring occupy in semi domes as well as in domes.

885
00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:02.590
And then the square and rectangular,
uh,
uh,
spaces,

886
00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:04.850
holes in the ceiling,
uh,

887
00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:08.740
openings in the ceiling that had been placed there also to allow light into the

888
00:57:08.741 --> 00:57:10.720
system so that you could use the room,

889
00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:14.710
but also to create the kind of wonderful light effects that it does when you

890
00:57:14.711 --> 00:57:19.711
have rays of sunshine coming in on you while you are in your sauna.

891
00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:22.540
This is a couple of more views.

892
00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:26.620
This is a couple of views of the frigging Doriam of the forum baths.

893
00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:31.480
You can see the dome up above the Oculus in that dome.

894
00:57:31.570 --> 00:57:34.600
You can see some of the stucco decorations still preserved.

895
00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.710
You can see the alcoves here,

896
00:57:35.711 --> 00:57:38.840
the radiating alcoves and some of the stucco decoration.

897
00:57:38.841 --> 00:57:41.230
He or sea creatures against a red background.

898
00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:45.340
And this is a restored view of what the Frig Darian would've looked like with

899
00:57:45.341 --> 00:57:49.590
the pool in the center and nice place to relax.
The radiating,
uh,

900
00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:50.980
apps is over here.

901
00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:55.960
And then the dome with the Oculus and with the light streaming in.

902
00:57:56.110 --> 00:58:00.420
Again,
I can't underscore enough the importance of both of these for Galleria,
uh,

903
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:03.670
for the future of Roman architecture.
Uh,

904
00:58:03.671 --> 00:58:06.040
the other importance of the Foreign Baz is the forum.

905
00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:09.790
Baz is today where you can eat and if you're there for the full day as I

906
00:58:09.791 --> 00:58:12.400
recommend you be,
you're going to want to eat at some point.
Uh,

907
00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:15.160
and there is a cafeteria which doesn't look like much,

908
00:58:15.161 --> 00:58:16.630
but actually the food is not bad though.

909
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:20.560
Italians have a very hard time making bad pasta so you can always get some good

910
00:58:20.561 --> 00:58:23.650
pasta at the snack bar and you will don't want to make your way.

911
00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:26.620
There's a few views of it make your way to the forum.
Baz,

912
00:58:26.621 --> 00:58:30.670
if you're there for any length of time,
very quickly,
I just want to remind you,

913
00:58:30.671 --> 00:58:34.630
we talked about this in the introductory lecture that one of the main reasons

914
00:58:34.631 --> 00:58:38.650
that Pompei so interesting to us today is because it tells us so much about the

915
00:58:38.651 --> 00:58:42.250
daily life,
not only of the palm pans,
but if the Romans in general,

916
00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:46.280
because we have all these wonderful shops still preserved at palm pay.

917
00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:47.830
This was a bakery.

918
00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:51.380
We see the millstones that were actually used for the grinding of the grains

919
00:58:51.381 --> 00:58:52.240
still preserved.

920
00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:57.100
We see the oven over here looking wonderfully like a modern pizza oven.

921
00:58:57.101 --> 00:58:57.881
As you can see.

922
00:58:57.881 --> 00:59:02.881
And we also believe it or not have from Pompei a petrified bread that's still is

923
00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:08.170
preserved.
Uh,
that gives you a sense of what Pompei and bread looked like.

924
00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:12.160
And it looks,
it looks strikingly like our pizzas with the segments,

925
00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:14.030
segments of the breads.

926
00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.480
So if you want to have a sense of where pizza came from here,

927
00:59:16.481 --> 00:59:19.540
I told you the Romans,
again,
there's nothing the Romans didn't invent bread,

928
00:59:19.541 --> 00:59:21.980
pizza,
whatever.
Uh,
but you see that,
that divide,

929
00:59:21.981 --> 00:59:24.290
Brad giving you a very good sense of the,
of the,

930
00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:26.990
of what was produced in this particular bakery.

931
00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:30.770
I also mentioned in the introductory lecture,
the fast food stands of Pompei,

932
00:59:30.771 --> 00:59:35.090
the Thermop oleum in the singular and the thermal polio in the plural.

933
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:38.540
These fast food stands where you could get a bite real,
real quickly.

934
00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:43.460
The way they were designed was to have a great counter in them with recesses,
uh,

935
00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:47.560
uh,
fresh,
hot and cold food was put out obviously every day.
Uh,

936
00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:49.520
and if you are hungry,
you just went up to the counter.

937
00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:50.690
You took a peek at what was there,

938
00:59:50.691 --> 00:59:54.290
you pointed out what you wanted and you could eat on the run.
Uh,

939
00:59:54.291 --> 00:59:56.420
the Romans were never far to have,
you know,

940
00:59:56.421 --> 00:59:59.980
their state religion and their family religion far from them.
Uh,

941
00:59:59.981 --> 01:00:03.470
and you can also see a nod to the gods over here.
There's a shrine,

942
01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:06.140
a with some of the representations of the household gods.

943
01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:08.690
Even in this fast food emporium,

944
01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.600
we have wine shops from palm pay as well.

945
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:15.860
I show you actually a scene of one of the storage rooms had Pompei I that you

946
01:00:15.861 --> 01:00:17.570
can see actually as you walk along.

947
01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:22.560
So wonderful ruffling of turning to the next page.
Uh,
the,
um,

948
01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:27.920
these wine,
these average,
these great clay amphoras,
that held line,
uh,

949
01:00:27.921 --> 01:00:31.760
that are located in one of these storage areas that one can see is one walks

950
01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:34.820
along the forum on the left side in palm pay today.

951
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:37.280
But you can imagine these on shelves,
uh,

952
01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:41.190
in a wine shop of ancient Pompei,
uh,

953
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:46.380
offering wines are gathered from all over the world,
uh,
for discerning,
uh,

954
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:50.450
uh,
files.
Is that the word?
Oenophiles uh,

955
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:54.320
connecting all of these,
um,
shops to one another.

956
01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.150
We're of course the streets of the city,

957
01:00:56.151 --> 01:00:58.770
the streets of the city are extremely well preserved.

958
01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:03.140
I show you here a couple of views of the crossing of the carto and the deck.

959
01:01:03.141 --> 01:01:07.220
Your Montas in palm pay a and you can see exactly what the streets look like.

960
01:01:07.221 --> 01:01:12.050
You can see the,
uh,
multi-sided paving stones of the streets.

961
01:01:12.051 --> 01:01:17.030
You can see the sidewalks looking uncannily modern.
Uh,
you can see,

962
01:01:17.031 --> 01:01:18.560
I don't,
you can't see exactly here,

963
01:01:18.561 --> 01:01:23.561
but their drains along the way to allow rain water to filter off the streets.

964
01:01:24.090 --> 01:01:26.660
Uh,
and all of this,
again,

965
01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:31.730
an extremely modern look and the streets of Pompei give us the best sense of any

966
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.540
of any streets of any preserved ancient city of what a,

967
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:39.380
what the streets look like in any given Roman town.

968
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:43.250
These streets had a long them again because of needs for water,

969
01:01:43.251 --> 01:01:44.480
had a long fountains.

970
01:01:44.481 --> 01:01:48.950
He was a very modest fountain where we see a representation of the goddess

971
01:01:48.951 --> 01:01:49.784
series,

972
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.830
a cers series with her Cornucopia and the fountain spout coming out of her

973
01:01:54.831 --> 01:01:56.690
mouth.
Uh,
and uh,

974
01:01:56.691 --> 01:01:59.750
you can see this is the sort of thing when the Romans just needed a little bit

975
01:01:59.751 --> 01:02:02.730
of water for household use,
they would go out to the local fountain.

976
01:02:02.731 --> 01:02:04.460
So as you walk along the streets upon pay,

977
01:02:04.461 --> 01:02:07.640
you see a lot of these small fountains.
You also see graffiti.

978
01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:10.160
What would a city be without some graffiti on its buildings?

979
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:13.430
Any of you have been in Rome recently?
No,
there is too much graffiti.

980
01:02:13.431 --> 01:02:15.770
There's like a graffiti,
uh,
craze.

981
01:02:15.771 --> 01:02:19.360
I mean the Romans have always had a lot of graffiti but it's gotten so bad it's,

982
01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:21.720
it's almost unimaginable now.

983
01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:26.430
But the graffiti tradition was alive and well in palm pay a and you see it here

984
01:02:26.431 --> 01:02:28.590
covered with glass,
but you see it here.

985
01:02:28.591 --> 01:02:32.160
You see it here and there and the city as you wander by.

986
01:02:32.161 --> 01:02:35.730
And it gives you a sense that people did right,
right on their buildings.
These,

987
01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:39.840
what they wrote on these buildings tended to be political for the most part.

988
01:02:39.841 --> 01:02:40.021
You know,

989
01:02:40.021 --> 01:02:45.021
you'd see graffiti that would say things like a vote for vote for Barbata us,

990
01:02:46.231 --> 01:02:49.800
the bearded one.
Uh,
he's will be the best guy for the office.

991
01:02:49.801 --> 01:02:51.030
And he's pretty handsome too.

992
01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:54.180
That's the kind of graffiti that you'll see as you walk along.

993
01:02:54.181 --> 01:02:58.330
If you're Latin has good that you'll see as you walk along the streets of palm

994
01:02:58.331 --> 01:02:59.164
pay,

995
01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:03.900
you'll also see these big blocks of stone.

996
01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.380
And there are people who look at these and they think,
oh,

997
01:03:07.381 --> 01:03:11.910
how impressing that's debris from Vesuvius.
It's not debris from Vesuvius.

998
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.050
Clearly these are,
they are deliberately,
these are stepping stones.

999
01:03:16.051 --> 01:03:18.480
The Romans were so ingenious and so again,

1000
01:03:18.481 --> 01:03:22.830
concerned about how to protect people in inclement weather,
uh,
that they created.

1001
01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:25.350
They put these stepping stones all around the city,

1002
01:03:25.351 --> 01:03:27.420
usually at the cross sections of two streets,

1003
01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:31.980
so that if there was torrential rain and if the water piled up and if the drains

1004
01:03:31.981 --> 01:03:35.330
couldn't quite handle it,
uh,
you could get across the street,
uh,

1005
01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:38.880
without stepping in the water.
And we had this and the slushing this,

1006
01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:42.360
that was new haven in the last week.
I can't tell you how many times I think,

1007
01:03:42.361 --> 01:03:45.720
why doesn't yell have stepping stones?
Uh,
we really could use them,

1008
01:03:45.721 --> 01:03:46.650
but here they are.

1009
01:03:46.651 --> 01:03:51.651
And you can see very clearly the ruts that come from the carts that have been,

1010
01:03:51.691 --> 01:03:56.070
that were made between the stepping stones by those carts constantly riding

1011
01:03:56.071 --> 01:03:56.670
through them.

1012
01:03:56.670 --> 01:04:00.420
And it shows you that they had to orchestrate the wheels of the carts in such a

1013
01:04:00.421 --> 01:04:05.070
way that they would span,
uh,
the stepping stones.
But it's a very ingenious thing.

1014
01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:09.090
They're fun to look at,
a fun to walk on,
Fun,
really fun to take pictures.

1015
01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:12.570
I have tons of them.
I didn't decided not to bring a personal picture this time,

1016
01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:15.870
me or anyone else in my family on stepping stones or other Yalies.

1017
01:04:15.871 --> 01:04:18.480
I've got lots of those too.
I didn't bring those today,

1018
01:04:18.481 --> 01:04:22.140
but I did bring something I'm really proud of because in all the years I've

1019
01:04:22.141 --> 01:04:24.960
taught this monument,
this city,
excuse me,

1020
01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:28.840
I've always wanted to actually show what it looked like when rain,
uh,

1021
01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:33.060
when w when it had rained and since I've been to palm pay so,

1022
01:04:33.061 --> 01:04:35.280
so many times over the years.
Uh,

1023
01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:39.590
but it doesn't tend to rain when I go there.
You know,
June,
July,
August,

1024
01:04:39.591 --> 01:04:42.840
it doesn't rain.
So I've never been able to do that.
I was there this past June,

1025
01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:44.160
and Lo and behold,

1026
01:04:44.161 --> 01:04:47.340
I was very upset because who wants to wander around the city of palm pay in the

1027
01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:51.630
rain?
But I had one day to go there and I was there and I said,
wow,
it's raining.

1028
01:04:51.631 --> 01:04:55.680
He was my chance.
So I finally was able to get some views of what happens.

1029
01:04:55.681 --> 01:04:58.440
And this was right at,
we had a torrential rain for about a half an hour.

1030
01:04:58.790 --> 01:05:02.220
Then the sun came out.
And this is what you see as you wander the streets.

1031
01:05:02.221 --> 01:05:05.700
You see that the water has accumulated.
But again,
Lo and behold,

1032
01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:10.130
you can easily make your way across that street,
across those stepping stones.
Uh,

1033
01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:11.013
nonetheless,

1034
01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:16.460
just a very few words on what happens to the streets of the city of palm or any

1035
01:05:16.741 --> 01:05:18.070
Roman city for that matter.

1036
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.580
When you leave the gates and you go out on the Inter city roads,

1037
01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:24.370
many of those intercity roads become cemeteries.

1038
01:05:24.371 --> 01:05:28.900
The Romans used these roads as their cemeteries.
The Romans had,
uh,

1039
01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:31.480
a,
uh,
a religious belief that you,

1040
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:34.870
that there was a separation between the city of the living and the city of the

1041
01:05:34.871 --> 01:05:39.450
dead.
So all of the tombs are outside the walls of the city.
Uh,

1042
01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:43.630
so you see at palm pay to extremely WellPreserved tomb streets,

1043
01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:46.720
the treat and the street of the tombs and the BIA new Chera,

1044
01:05:46.721 --> 01:05:51.721
which is the one you see here and new cra with tombs of all sorts of shapes and

1045
01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:55.570
sizes.
I'm not going to go into these in any detail in this course.

1046
01:05:55.660 --> 01:06:00.130
There is a paper topic for any of you who get interested in to market texture on

1047
01:06:00.131 --> 01:06:04.270
the tombs of Pompei.
We will look at some tombs and Rome in great detail,

1048
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:06.520
but I'm just going to give you a glimpse of them here.

1049
01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:09.760
They come in all sizes and shapes.
They're very,
very interesting.

1050
01:06:09.761 --> 01:06:12.160
They honor the people who were buried there,

1051
01:06:12.161 --> 01:06:14.560
including there's an a bench to him for example,

1052
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:18.510
where you can sit and think on the,
uh,
the life and times of,

1053
01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:23.530
of the individual who was buried there.
Uh,
so an absolutely fascinating,

1054
01:06:23.531 --> 01:06:24.364
fascinating.

1055
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:28.720
A street with a lot of different tumor types that show the variety of two

1056
01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:31.090
marketecture under the Romans.

1057
01:06:32.590 --> 01:06:33.940
I'd like to end today,

1058
01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:40.380
I'd like to end today by by making at least a passing reference to a matter

1059
01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:48.360
which is of huge concern to archeologists and huge concern to all of us as human

1060
01:06:48.461 --> 01:06:49.294
beings.

1061
01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:54.360
And that is what happened to the people upon pay in those very last moments of

1062
01:06:54.671 --> 01:06:55.504
life.

1063
01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:00.520
And archeologists have been able to reconstruct exactly what happened to,
uh,

1064
01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:04.260
or not exactly,
but as close as possible in this day,
you know,
in,

1065
01:07:04.261 --> 01:07:09.261
in the time from which Pompei was excavated to now to reconstruct again what

1066
01:07:09.731 --> 01:07:10.810
happened to these,

1067
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:15.870
these human beings at the time of the eruption of the [inaudible],

1068
01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.430
they've been able to,
again,

1069
01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:21.910
to reconstruct a very moving picture of their last moments of life.

1070
01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:27.100
What we know is that the,
uh,
ash and lava from Vesuvius and you see a,

1071
01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:32.200
a restored view here of what that would have been,
would have looked like.

1072
01:07:32.201 --> 01:07:33.600
And you can see,
but vs,

1073
01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:37.540
and you can see the forum over here with the Temple of Jupiter and the temple of

1074
01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:42.340
Apollo and the throngs of people inside the forum at this particular juncture is

1075
01:07:42.341 --> 01:07:45.640
they look up and see what is happening.
And on the right hand side,

1076
01:07:45.641 --> 01:07:48.340
this is actually a view of Mount Saint Helen's,
which is,
you know,

1077
01:07:48.550 --> 01:07:53.550
erupted in 1980 and the eruptions not so different as you can as you gaze upon

1078
01:07:53.951 --> 01:07:57.790
them and look at them in comparison today.
But we know that the,

1079
01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:01.120
that the eruption of the Suviet [inaudible] did not happen all at once.

1080
01:08:01.121 --> 01:08:04.000
It didn't just happen and covered the city.
It was gradual.

1081
01:08:04.001 --> 01:08:07.050
There was actually quite a bit of time.
There was time to escape the Ra,

1082
01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:11.590
the Pompey and saw what was happening.
And those who were smart did escape.

1083
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:15.130
But like any other natural disaster,
there were of course,

1084
01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:17.090
a group of hardy souls,

1085
01:08:17.091 --> 01:08:21.680
or perhaps we would call them foolhardy souls who thought that they could ride

1086
01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:25.880
it out and they thought they could ride it out by hiding in their own houses or

1087
01:08:25.881 --> 01:08:29.810
buy some of the smarter ones that the foolhardy type,
uh,

1088
01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:34.910
decided that they could ride it out in some of the very strong walled buildings,

1089
01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:37.850
public buildings of the city.
For example,
the bath buildings,

1090
01:08:37.851 --> 01:08:41.210
the stobby and bounds of the foreign bats that we looked at today,

1091
01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:46.160
they were gravely mistaken,
gravely mistaken.
We don't know how many stayed.

1092
01:08:46.161 --> 01:08:49.520
We think it was actually a fairly small number.
Some have said about a thousand.

1093
01:08:49.521 --> 01:08:52.070
We don't know.
Uh,
but whatever,

1094
01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:57.140
those who did stay had made a grave error because they were not actually killed

1095
01:08:58.221 --> 01:09:00.740
by the ash and lava,
the multinational lava,

1096
01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:02.720
despite the fact that it was extremely hot.

1097
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:08.110
But what killed them was the noxious gases that came into the city after the

1098
01:09:08.271 --> 01:09:10.610
eruption that followed that ash and lava.
They were,

1099
01:09:10.611 --> 01:09:15.380
it's fixated by those gases before you,

1100
01:09:15.381 --> 01:09:18.770
after they had died,
but before their bodies decomposed.

1101
01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:24.160
The ash and lava formed a protective shell around their bodies,

1102
01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:26.270
uh,
protecting them.

1103
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:30.980
And what the archeologists were clever enough to do is when the modern

1104
01:09:30.981 --> 01:09:31.641
archaeologists,

1105
01:09:31.641 --> 01:09:36.260
when they're working with their pickaxes and when that pickax hit a hollow in

1106
01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:38.750
the,
uh,
in the ash and lava,

1107
01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:43.640
they poured plaster into that hollow sometimes that produce nothing,

1108
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:46.070
but sometimes it produced bodies,

1109
01:09:46.071 --> 01:09:50.390
the actual shape of the bodies of those whose bodies had decomposed there.

1110
01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:53.450
And we can look at those bodies still today.

1111
01:09:53.451 --> 01:09:58.451
And I show you a scene of a number of the victims of Pompei huddled together for

1112
01:09:58.581 --> 01:10:02.360
mutual and indeed,
ultimately futile protection.

1113
01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.050
I can show you the body of an individual who is lying on the ground,

1114
01:10:06.051 --> 01:10:08.930
his face in his hands,
trying to protect himself,

1115
01:10:08.931 --> 01:10:12.980
obviously from those noxious gases that have come into the city.

1116
01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.540
I can show you the,
uh,

1117
01:10:14.541 --> 01:10:19.541
the body of the plaster cast obviously of the body of another Pompei and who was

1118
01:10:19.941 --> 01:10:23.810
sitting with his knees up and his hands in front of his face trying to protect

1119
01:10:23.811 --> 01:10:28.520
himself once again from those fumes that are about to overtake him any second.

1120
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:32.090
The body of an individual who's essentially given up at this point.

1121
01:10:32.091 --> 01:10:36.860
He is expired,
he's lying on his back.
There is no hope any longer for him.

1122
01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:41.690
Uh,
a poor fellow who died on that day.
And then this,
this fellow,

1123
01:10:41.691 --> 01:10:46.490
this heroic fellow who is lifting himself and his last moment of life lifting

1124
01:10:46.491 --> 01:10:48.190
himself either to gasp,

1125
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:53.270
last breath or perhaps to whisper something to an endeared to a dear family

1126
01:10:54.021 --> 01:10:58.880
member who is by his side.
And we even have,

1127
01:10:58.930 --> 01:11:02.990
uh,
the body of a dog.
This story is particularly sad because this dog,

1128
01:11:02.991 --> 01:11:07.280
this plaster cast of this dog was found with a chain around his neck.

1129
01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:12.170
So probably what happened here is the owner of this particular dog had the dog

1130
01:11:12.171 --> 01:11:13.004
chained up,

1131
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:17.110
didn't have time either to take the dog or to release the dog from his chains so

1132
01:11:17.111 --> 01:11:19.470
that he could try himself to escape.

1133
01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:22.230
And that poor dog perished on that day.

1134
01:11:22.231 --> 01:11:25.200
And we have the plaster cast of his body still today.

1135
01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:30.440
All of these bodies can still be seen on the site of Pompei and make a visit.

1136
01:11:30.541 --> 01:11:32.880
They're all the more poignant I know of,

1137
01:11:32.881 --> 01:11:36.840
no more moving human document from the ancient world.

1138
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:39.420
Then these bodies of these Pompei Ans,
uh,

1139
01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:44.870
kept in perpetuity and for us to commiserate with and to understand even today.

1140
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:46.800
Thank you.
