1
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.790
Good morning everybody.

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.590
In the 100 years between a d 98 and Adj 192 Rome had five emperors,

3
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.473
Trajan,

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.810
Hadrian and tonight as pious Marcus Aurelius and comedies six if we count Lucius

5
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:27.651
verus who was co emperor with Marcus Aurelius for several years in the 50 years

6
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:32.980
following the death of the last of the Severin emperors,

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
a young man by the name of Alexandra saveras who died in 235 a de Rome had 20

8
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.250
acknowledged emperors and many more pretenders to imperial power.

9
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.370
Rarely did anyone hold on to power for more than a few years and some of them

10
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:56.010
lasted only a matter of months.

11
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.080
I like to think of the emperors as changing as quickly as the seasons in the

12
00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:01.980
third century,

13
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:06.981
a d any wrong move led to assassination and replacement,

14
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.430
not by the Senate,
but by the provincial armies,

15
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.930
by the provincial armies.

16
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.130
Civil wars were extremely commonplace in the third century,

17
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:22.131
a d and it was a very bad time for the Roman emperors who could literally be

18
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:27.450
stabbed in the back at any moment.
And many of them were,

19
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.300
the Roman frontiers were in danger.

20
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:35.301
The economy was in shambles and the vast bureaucracy was also a suffering

21
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.940
significantly in the third century,

22
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:43.941
a d largely because of a lack of central control in view of this chaotic

23
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:50.190
situation.
There was very little time to build buildings,

24
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:55.191
which is obviously what's significant to us in the context of this course in in

25
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:59.910
many ways.
I think one can describe Visa v Architecture,

26
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.940
the third century D as essentially a wasteland and architectural wasteland.

27
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.220
There were no forums in the third century and there were no basilicas and there

28
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:16.000
were no baths.
We will see that the major project,
uh,

29
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.270
in the third century,
a d was not,

30
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.120
not unexpectedly given this situation,

31
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.420
a major defensive wall that was the main architectural commission in the third

32
00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:31.230
century,
a d and it's with that wall that I want to begin today.

33
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.100
The so called a really and walls.
Uh,
before I do,

34
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:39.690
I just want to give you a glimpse of two of those 20 acknowledged emperors who

35
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:41.580
made their way through the third century,

36
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.610
had the boy Emperor Gordian the third on the lefthand side of the screen and the

37
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:52.290
more mature Emperor poopy anus who was co emperor with a man by the name of

38
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:55.440
Belle binus for a very short time.
And in fact,

39
00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:58.950
just to give you a sense of the flavor of the third century,
uh,

40
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.790
both of them were dragged from the palace not too long after they had a ascended

41
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:08.560
to imperial power murdered and their bodies tossed in the Tiber river.

42
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.480
If you look at these two portraits,

43
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:14.140
one of the boy ampere and one of the more mature emperor,
even though many,

44
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:17.350
many years separate them in chronological age,

45
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.460
I think you will see if you look at the way in which these portraitists

46
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:25.900
represented their eyes in the likenesses of these two individuals and these

47
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:29.920
official portraits of Gordian and if poopy anus,
I think you'll see,

48
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:33.160
if you look at those eyes,
those eyes reveal,
uh,

49
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:37.750
the concern that these emperors had for the state of the empire,
uh,

50
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:42.640
during the third century had a concern that was extremely warranted,

51
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.130
obviously.
So again,

52
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:50.131
I want to begin with the only significant architectural project in the third

53
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:52.780
century Aidy in Rome.

54
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.990
And that is this great defensive wall system called the [inaudible] walls.

55
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.560
Uh,
the really in walls were built for two main reasons.
One,

56
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.830
because the earlier walls,
the so called Serbian walls,

57
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:08.500
which we studied at the very beginning of the semester,

58
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:13.480
which date to the republic,
378 BC is when they were dedicated.

59
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:14.470
So way,

60
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:19.471
way back in the beginning of our discussion of Roman architecture,

61
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.400
you'll remember that those Serbian walls,
and I can show it to you with this,
uh,

62
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:28.780
this plan here of the walls.
Uh,
during ancient Roman times,

63
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.160
the Serbian walls encircled just the seven hills of Rome.

64
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:37.660
So the central area here where we see the Palatine,
the capital line,

65
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:39.880
the Caelian,
uh,
the queer and it'll hill,

66
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.500
that was the location of that original Serbian wall.

67
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.320
As the city grew,
as the population grew,

68
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:50.880
as more people were brought back to roam through,
uh,

69
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.060
the various wars and through the enslavement of large numbers of people,

70
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:58.580
the city grew significantly in size.
Uh,

71
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.840
and so by this time,
by the third century,
the,

72
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.520
the Serbian wall was essentially useless to protect roam from those barbarians

73
00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:10.390
that we're literally at the gates at this particular point in Roman history.

74
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.770
So they needed to build that wall to protect the city.
Uh,

75
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:17.800
and uh,
but the other reason was because of those,

76
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.030
because of what was going on on the frontiers because Roman was more in danger

77
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.320
than it had ever been before because of the kind of political and economic

78
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:28.450
situation in Rome that I've just described.

79
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.250
There was a need for further stability and the need to build this second set of

80
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:33.971
walls.
Again,

81
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:38.200
the so called a real gun walls and this plan shows you how much further out they

82
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:41.570
went.
Then the Serbian walls all the way to the Tiber river.

83
00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:46.540
It didn't encompass the area across the Tiber where Hadrian's tomb Hadrian's and

84
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.800
mausoleum the castle son Angelo is located.
But for the most part,
uh,

85
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:52.690
it did cover the main of the city.

86
00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:57.220
And you can see it went far enough out that it even encompass some of the major

87
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.320
city roads or the beginnings of some of those major city roads.

88
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.890
A view of the reunion walled itself very well preserved here on the right hand

89
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:09.630
side of the screen and a comparison of them,
uh,

90
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.240
with the Serbian walls on the left with regard to the real Ian walls,

91
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.390
they are named for the emperor or religion who was emperor of Rome between 270

92
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:21.800
and 275.

93
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:26.801
And we believe that a really and began the walls either in two 70 or 271 they

94
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:30.080
were not finished by his death.

95
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.010
And two 75 a and they were completed by his successor,

96
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:35.720
a man by the name of Probus,

97
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:40.721
p r o B u s probus completed the really in walls and dedicated them.

98
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.450
Uh,
right after,
uh,
uh,

99
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.370
right after really Ann's death in a row in 275,

100
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.670
the really in walls had a 12 mile circuit around the city of Rome.

101
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:58.150
They were originally 25 and one half feet tall and there were 18 major gateways

102
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.370
in the real Ian walls,
18 major gateways.

103
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.050
I think you can see from this view on the right hand side of the screen that
the,

104
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.160
uh,
that the,
uh,

105
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.690
the building materials were concrete faced with brick,

106
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:19.190
brick faced concrete.
You see that very clearly here and of course it's,

107
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.050
it's important to keep in mind that that is different than what the original,

108
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.390
uh,
Republican walls were made out of.

109
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.350
Those were made out of cut stone ashler blocks.
Uh,

110
00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:34.160
you see them here in this section of the survey and walls that I show you once

111
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:35.890
again,
uh,
uh,
uh,

112
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.310
blocks that are laid in the scheme of headers and stretchers that we talked

113
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:44.840
about at the very beginning of the semester when we discussed early Roman wall

114
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:48.620
building both in Rome and in the early colonies.
And here again,

115
00:07:48.621 --> 00:07:50.840
the religion walls with their,
uh,

116
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.930
uptodate concrete faced with brick.

117
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:59.110
But it's a sign of the Times that scholars who have examined these bricks have

118
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:01.850
determined that they were not all new bricks,

119
00:08:01.851 --> 00:08:06.240
that many of them were reused bricks from earlier periods,
uh,
from the,

120
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.650
from the previous,
uh,
century in particular.

121
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.460
And the reason for that probably has to do with the fact that again,

122
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:17.300
because there was so little architectural activity during this period,

123
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:21.080
there was simply no need to make bricks in,
in large numbers.

124
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.810
And when they needed them for this particular project,

125
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:28.460
they reached back and use some that had been lying around from ur of earlier

126
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:33.360
manufacturer.
So I think again,
that underscores uh,
the,
the um,
the uh,

127
00:08:33.361 --> 00:08:37.760
uncertain,
uncertain,
uncertain of this particular period of time.

128
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:42.800
Here's another very good view of the real end walls as they look today.
Uh,

129
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.100
brick face,
concrete construction once again.
Uh,

130
00:08:46.101 --> 00:08:50.960
and what's impressive about the religion walls is how much of them are
preserved.

131
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:52.460
When I showed you the Serbian walls,

132
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:56.430
we could only look at bits and pieces of those walls preserved in different

133
00:08:56.431 --> 00:09:00.240
parts of Rome,
especially near the Ma,
the room,
a train station.

134
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.130
But in the case of the really in walls,

135
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:06.150
we have a very large extent of those walls still preserve today,

136
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.770
which is a tribute to how,
how well they were built a,

137
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.650
that they have stood the test of time.
And in fact,
when one visits Rome,

138
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:17.310
when you come into Rome from Leonardo Da Vinci Airport,
uh,

139
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.120
the first thing that you see a of the city are the walls.

140
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:25.350
You go through those walls and it announces to you of course that you are in

141
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:29.040
fact about to enter,
uh,
the city of Rome.

142
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:34.050
I mentioned that the walls had 18 gateways.
Uh,

143
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.680
some of them are still preserved and I sh I want to show you one of them here

144
00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:40.290
just to give you a sense of what these gateways we're like,

145
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.690
this is the so called Puerto Apia.

146
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.510
It also dates to the same time as the walls 275 a d,

147
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:48.210
uh,

148
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:53.210
called the Puerto Apia because it is at the exact location of the via Apia or

149
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:57.600
the [inaudible] way in Rome.
The Ah,

150
00:09:57.601 --> 00:09:59.020
the gate.
Ah,

151
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:04.580
I'm going to show you how the gate looked in the tie into hundred and 75 and

152
00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:06.900
then how it was altered somewhat later.

153
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.680
You can see from the monument list that although it was built originally in two

154
00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:11.580
75,

155
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:16.970
it was restored by two Byzantine emperors by the name of a Norris and Arcadia.

156
00:10:17.641 --> 00:10:21.650
So this is in the post,
uh,
Roman period,
uh,
of Aad.

157
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:26.370
And they did that in [inaudible] 84 or one to 402.
And the gate,

158
00:10:26.371 --> 00:10:27.630
as you see it today,

159
00:10:27.631 --> 00:10:32.631
extremely well preserved is the gate of the restoration of the fifth century a,

160
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.770
whereas this view,

161
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.520
this restored view from Ward Perkins shows you what the gate would have looked

162
00:10:38.521 --> 00:10:43.521
like in two 75 in two 75 it had to RQ weighted entrance ways.

163
00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:47.400
As you can see,
well here it had rounded towers,

164
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.350
rounded towers,
uh,
it had small windows with uh,

165
00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:56.820
occupations at the top.
As you can also see curve curvature at the top.

166
00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.810
And then ward Perkins believes there's some controversy about this,

167
00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:05.460
but he believes it was already crenelated.
Yeah,
in the third century,

168
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:10.461
a d if you compare that to the gate as restored by are notorious and Arcadia's,

169
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.660
uh,
you can see that they have removed one of the entrance ways.

170
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:20.280
There's a single RQ weighted entranceway now in the center of the gate.

171
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.750
And they have also in case the rounded towers in these square blocks,

172
00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:27.360
as you can see here.

173
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:31.050
Or they've left the upper most part rounded but not the bottom part.

174
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:35.880
So they have changed it somewhat,
but I think it still gives you,
again,

175
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.650
a very good sense of what this gate and many of the other gates that were part

176
00:11:40.651 --> 00:11:45.270
of this very important defensive wall system built in the third century,

177
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.373
looked like.

178
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.380
What we see happening toward the end of the third century.

179
00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:57.381
Aad is the return of a centralized of a strong centralized government to Rome

180
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:04.030
and to the Roman Empire after the bloody third century.
Aad.
And it's,

181
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.620
uh,
it's,
uh,
numerous fly by night emperors as I call them here.

182
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.890
And the vehicle of this return of a stable government was the foundation of what

183
00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:17.590
we call the tetrarchy,
the tetrarchy,

184
00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:20.800
which means literally four man rule.

185
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.420
The tetrarchy was the brainchild of a man by the name of Diocletian.

186
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.960
Diocletian was a Dalmatian,
not a dog,
a,

187
00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:31.630
but somebody who came from ancient Dalmatia.

188
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.350
Now Croatia from Dalmatia,

189
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:39.340
he was an imperial bodyguard who rose to great heights,
uh,

190
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.830
and eventually became emperor of Rome.

191
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:46.150
He began his own rise to power and 283,

192
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:48.400
a 283 had,

193
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.140
but it was in two 93 after 10 years into trying to go it alone,

194
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.440
that he realized that the Roman Empire had become must much too vast a for one

195
00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:01.270
man to be able to govern it alone.

196
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.770
And he came up with this extraordinary idea,
uh,
to have four men rule.

197
00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:08.620
We've seen co emperors before.
We've seen two man rule.

198
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:12.970
There was two man rule initially with Marcus really is and Lucius of areas for

199
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:16.990
example.
Uh,
but we have never before seen a four man rule,

200
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.730
but he felt that the empire was sprawling enough that it really needed emperors

201
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:23.890
in four different locations,
uh,

202
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.920
to enable the empire to be governed and to enable stability to be returned.

203
00:13:29.411 --> 00:13:32.410
And that was the concept of the tetrarchy,
which again,

204
00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:36.910
he founded in 293 by founding the tetrarchy,

205
00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:41.020
he made himself the main emperor,
the Augustus,

206
00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:43.690
but the Augustus in the eastern part of the empire.

207
00:13:43.691 --> 00:13:48.290
And I'm sure he chose that because of his own,
uh,
his own roots in,
uh,

208
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.730
in,
in Dalmatia,
in again what is now Croatia.

209
00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:57.040
He shows a man by the name of Gillary us,
uh,
to be his Caesar,

210
00:13:57.041 --> 00:14:01.090
to be his second in command in the eastern part of the empire.

211
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:06.250
He's selected Maximilian Maximilian to be Augustus in the west.

212
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.840
And then Constancia is Cloris to be the Caesar in the West.

213
00:14:10.841 --> 00:14:15.841
Can Stanzas Cloris more well known as the father of Constantine,

214
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:19.390
the great then he is as a tetrarch.
Uh,
but he again,

215
00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:24.391
Constancia scores was the designated Caesar in the West order was restored

216
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.120
through the vehicle of the tetrarchy.

217
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.110
And what that means for us in this course enrollment architecture is that

218
00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:33.940
stability,
returns,
stability,

219
00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:38.941
that enabled major architectural commissions to once again be done both in Rome

220
00:14:41.141 --> 00:14:45.330
and also around the provinces.
And particularly in the provinces,
uh,

221
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:50.020
that these individuals made their,
their capitals in a sense and where they,

222
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:54.470
where they lived and where we'll see they built their own palaces.

223
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.070
So when we speak of,
but when we speak of Ted target architecture,

224
00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:02.030
I think we have to keep in mind that we are talking not just about the

225
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:05.660
renovation of Rome.
I mean Rome itself,
the renascence,

226
00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:09.800
let's call it that instead of renovation the renascence of Rome,
Rome's rebirth,

227
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.100
uh,
under the tetrarchy and under Diocletian.
Uh,

228
00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:17.330
but we are also talking about architecture as we'll see that was put up in the

229
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:20.780
provinces also under the,
uh,

230
00:15:20.781 --> 00:15:23.270
under the aegis of the Tetra Arcs.

231
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:28.580
I want to just show you what the tetrarchy looked like and their portraiture is

232
00:15:28.581 --> 00:15:33.581
also illustrative of what their major architectural agenda was.

233
00:15:33.591 --> 00:15:38.570
We see a coin portrait on the lefthand side of the screen of Diocletian.
Uh,

234
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:42.230
that meant that that gives his title Augustus.
As you can see here,

235
00:15:42.231 --> 00:15:44.780
a typical Roman coin profile,

236
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:49.670
a portrait that shows him with a closely crop,
military hairstyle and beard,

237
00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.080
but the much more,
and he,
he has represented this way in his coins,
you know,

238
00:15:54.081 --> 00:15:58.610
from two 83 the first decade from two 83 to about two 93.

239
00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.351
But the,

240
00:15:59.351 --> 00:16:03.920
the image that becomes the image of the Ted talks as a whole is the sort of

241
00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:05.150
thing that you see here.

242
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.950
We begin to see with the formation of the tetrarchy representations of them as a

243
00:16:09.951 --> 00:16:14.840
group.
Uh,
it's,
it's sort of one,
one for all and all for one concept,

244
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:19.900
uh,
that they are shown a in mutual support,
uh,
holding each other,

245
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.860
embracing each other and mutual support as they tried to restabilize the

246
00:16:24.861 --> 00:16:26.740
government.
Uh,
this is a very,

247
00:16:26.741 --> 00:16:29.720
this is a wonderful group portrait of the four tetrarchy.

248
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.490
It's done in this reddish,

249
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:36.491
purplish tone that comes from Egypt called Porphyry Por p h y r y and a stone

250
00:16:37.701 --> 00:16:40.550
that we'll see used extensively in this period.

251
00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.820
This portrait is carved out of that.
Uh,
we don't,

252
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.120
we have thoughts about where it might have come from,

253
00:16:47.121 --> 00:16:50.750
perhaps even Constantinople,
but it ended up in Venice.

254
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.580
And any of you who make your way to San Marco in Venice a,

255
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.020
it's not immediately obvious where it is,

256
00:16:57.021 --> 00:17:01.370
but if you stand in front of San Marco facing it and go off a bit to the right,

257
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:05.820
uh,
you will see this incredible,
uh,
poor for regroup,
uh,

258
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.270
hugging a one corner of the building over here.
Uh,

259
00:17:11.271 --> 00:17:14.870
and again,
uh,
you can see them.
It's done.
What's interesting to us,

260
00:17:14.871 --> 00:17:19.310
I think is the fact that it's done in a very geometric abstract style.
Uh,

261
00:17:19.311 --> 00:17:24.200
it doesn't look realistic.
They are done.
They're,
their proportions are,
uh,

262
00:17:24.201 --> 00:17:27.230
are,
are stumpy and uh,
they,
their bodies,

263
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.850
their military costumes and their faces,
uh,

264
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.470
seem almost more like in their bats that they were,

265
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:38.090
these Pannonian cap seem almost more like geometric shapes than they seem like

266
00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:42.890
real clothing and the like.
And that is part and parcel of a certain aesthetic,

267
00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:43.281
uh,

268
00:17:43.281 --> 00:17:47.750
that we see developing this interest in geometric and abstract forms that we see

269
00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:50.940
in portraiture.
But we also see,
which is important for us today.

270
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:55.050
We see that in architecture as well,
that interest.
And I think,
you know,

271
00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:59.320
perhaps it's going too far,
but I don't think so.
I think that the,

272
00:17:59.321 --> 00:18:04.230
the taste for that particular formulation I has to do in part with this,

273
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.680
the fact that they believe they have returned or they're trying to return

274
00:18:07.681 --> 00:18:09.030
stability to the government.

275
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:14.031
So they choose these very solid geometric abstract forms to represent their

276
00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:18.480
images,
be they a portraiture or be they as we'll see,

277
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.660
monumental works of architecture.
Perhaps.

278
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:26.400
It's not surprising to see that when Diocletian begins to put up monumental

279
00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:30.720
architecture in Rome,
he chooses first public monuments,

280
00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:34.230
public monuments that are going to be seen and that are going to speak to this

281
00:18:34.231 --> 00:18:36.620
return of stability to Rome,
uh,

282
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:41.580
and he chooses to put them in as visible place as he possibly can.

283
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.050
And what's the most visible place in the city of Rome?
But the Roman forum,

284
00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:50.940
the Great Forum Romana them.
So we see a Diocletian commissioning,

285
00:18:50.941 --> 00:18:54.360
a monument to put up in the Roman forum.

286
00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:00.210
That monument is referred to by a variety of names.
We usually call it,

287
00:19:00.211 --> 00:19:02.850
and I indicated this for you on the monument lists,

288
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:07.260
we usually call it the preferred name forward is the descent monument,

289
00:19:07.261 --> 00:19:08.670
the decennial monument,

290
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:13.110
but it is also sometimes called the five column monument and it is sometimes

291
00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:14.820
called the tetrarch monument.

292
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.660
It's called the tetrarch monument because it honors the four tetrarchy.

293
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.500
It's called the five column monument because it's made up is we'll see a five

294
00:19:22.501 --> 00:19:26.440
columns and it's called the Desenia monument because it,

295
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.800
it honors the destination area,

296
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:33.120
the 10 year rule of the tetrarchy,

297
00:19:33.121 --> 00:19:38.121
the tetrarchy founded in two 93 the monument is put up in 303 so 10 years of

298
00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:42.780
rule,
and it also honored the 20th anniversary,

299
00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:46.650
the Visalia Bic,
e n,
n a,
l,
I a,

300
00:19:46.651 --> 00:19:51.651
the vice Analia of Diocletian because Diocletian had become emperor into 83 so

301
00:19:52.411 --> 00:19:54.000
he's,
he's lasted 20 years,

302
00:19:54.001 --> 00:19:58.050
which is extraordinary considering some members of the third century only lasted

303
00:19:58.051 --> 00:19:59.010
a matter of months.

304
00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:04.190
He's lasted 20 years and his tetrarchy has lasted 10 years and it's time for

305
00:20:04.201 --> 00:20:09.201
celebration and he puts up a major monument in the Roman forum.

306
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.420
Let me show you by it.
This map,
first of this plan of the Roman forum,

307
00:20:15.421 --> 00:20:20.310
as it would've looked between the third century in the seventh century a d we

308
00:20:20.311 --> 00:20:23.580
see a number of buildings that we have looked at together before.

309
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:28.200
We can see in the upper most part,
the top,
you Laurium the temple of Vespasian.

310
00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.400
Uh,
we see the arch of Septum.

311
00:20:31.401 --> 00:20:35.940
You severity's up here we see some buildings.
We did not talk about,
for example,

312
00:20:35.941 --> 00:20:40.170
the Temple of the Divine Julius Caesar and a couple of facilities that were put

313
00:20:40.171 --> 00:20:44.970
up here in the late republic and into the Augusta and finished and the Augustan

314
00:20:44.971 --> 00:20:45.780
period.

315
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.910
The two buildings that we're going to look at today are the Senate house or the

316
00:20:48.911 --> 00:20:50.360
Cory a Giulia,
uh,

317
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:53.920
but also at the raw stra or what's behind the roster.

318
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.630
If you see the roster there,
right in the center,
that's the,

319
00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.040
the day is from which a major speeches were made.

320
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.020
If you look right behind the roster,

321
00:21:02.021 --> 00:21:07.021
you will see four columns on a curve and then another column right behind them.

322
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:12.020
That is the so called four f of the so called.
Um,

323
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:17.320
if I've called a monument,
excuse me,
of,
uh,
of the tetrarchy,
uh,

324
00:21:17.321 --> 00:21:19.840
that we see they're right behind the rostrum.

325
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.640
Now here we're looking at a Google earth image from the same vantage point that

326
00:21:24.641 --> 00:21:29.150
shows us again,
uh,
the coliseum,
the Victor Emmanuel monument,
the Co,

327
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:33.700
the capital line hill,
the Palatine Hill,
the circus maximus right here,

328
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.320
the forum in the center.

329
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:40.590
And we can locate the five column monument by,

330
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.440
uh,
let me see here.
We have here,
we have the Korea.

331
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.810
Here we have the arches Septum,
you severities.

332
00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:51.820
And then right to right next to the arch of symptom you severe as essentially to

333
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:57.061
the left of it was the location of the five column monument right behind the raw

334
00:21:57.581 --> 00:22:02.080
stroke.
Now the problem is that all we have left of this,

335
00:22:02.081 --> 00:22:05.410
so called five column monument,
is a single base,

336
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.200
one base of one of the columns.

337
00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:13.930
And you can see that base it on display right in front of,
on a pet,

338
00:22:13.931 --> 00:22:18.360
on a,
on a base,
right down a base and a different phase of base made out of,
um,

339
00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.160
of uh,
a brick.
As you see here,

340
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:26.100
the base of that one column right in front of the arch of sip to me is severity

341
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.410
dwarfed by the arch of symptom.
You saveras.
In fact,
I'm always,

342
00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.700
always on the lookout when I'm in that part of the forum to see if anybody looks

343
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:38.200
at the column I said nobody ever does.
They're so taken both with the,

344
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.670
with the [inaudible],
with the Baroque church that lies behind them with the,

345
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.500
with the,
uh,
Korea or Senate House that we're all going to look at today,
uh,

346
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.290
that they don't happen to notice this.
But that is all that survives.

347
00:22:50.291 --> 00:22:51.550
So you might ask yourself,
well,

348
00:22:51.551 --> 00:22:55.210
then how in the world do we know there was a five column monument behind the

349
00:22:55.211 --> 00:22:55.901
roster on that?

350
00:22:55.901 --> 00:23:00.901
This is one of those columns because we have a depiction of it on the arch of

351
00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:04.150
Constantine,
which we'll be looking at on Tuesday,

352
00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:07.760
the early fourth century Aidy arch.
One of the scenes,
uh,

353
00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.440
that shows Constantine himself is located in the Roman forum.

354
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:14.290
And we see Constantine now headless,
uh,

355
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:18.470
with some of his attendance and other individuals standing on the roster.

356
00:23:18.471 --> 00:23:22.180
Rostrum making a,
an address to the people he surrounded.

357
00:23:22.181 --> 00:23:24.340
This is very interesting.
We'll talk about why next time,

358
00:23:24.341 --> 00:23:29.341
surrounded by seated portraits of Hadrian and Marcus really is identifiable by

359
00:23:29.531 --> 00:23:33.400
their portraits and he's making an address.
And if you look very carefully,

360
00:23:33.401 --> 00:23:36.130
you will see behind him are five columns,

361
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.060
five columns that have a statues on top of them.

362
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:44.140
That is the five column monument that stood behind the roster.

363
00:23:44.141 --> 00:23:49.141
So that combined with that preserve base gives us a very good sense of what that

364
00:23:49.731 --> 00:23:51.770
monument might've looked like.
Then you may be asking yourself,

365
00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.740
what is she talking about?
Five columns.
I mean,
there are only four tet drugs.

366
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:59.150
Is She misspeaking here?
Now I'm speaking correctly,
there were five columns.
Uh,

367
00:23:59.151 --> 00:24:03.650
but one of those columns was put up to Jupiter,
Jupiter,
the head,

368
00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:07.840
God Jupiter,
who was the patron God of Diocletian.
Uh,

369
00:24:07.841 --> 00:24:12.841
so we see Jupiter in one column on his own back behind the others,

370
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:16.280
uh,
and then the other four columns of the tetrarchy,

371
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:21.340
each with a base with a fee with a sculptural figural decoration down below the

372
00:24:22.371 --> 00:24:24.040
shaft was playing,
uh,

373
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:28.940
then then a statue of each of the four tet rocks and the statue of Jupiter on

374
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.930
the top.
And we think that the statue of the column and Statute Jupiter,

375
00:24:32.931 --> 00:24:35.960
we're probably a little bit taller as is indicated here,

376
00:24:35.961 --> 00:24:39.610
because he was after all a god a then the others.
Uh,

377
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:43.820
and you can see the way it is located behind the raw stra.
So that again,

378
00:24:43.821 --> 00:24:45.800
if someone were speaking from the roster,

379
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.560
that this is exactly what you'd be seeing behind.

380
00:24:48.561 --> 00:24:51.950
Just as we see in the arch of Constantine,
uh,

381
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.210
you also see its location as it faces the Temple of Divine Julius Caesar,

382
00:24:56.211 --> 00:24:58.610
which is probably not a coincidence.

383
00:24:58.611 --> 00:25:02.300
We do see that Diocletian tried to link himself to Caesar and others,

384
00:25:02.301 --> 00:25:04.520
great leaders of the Roman past.

385
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.320
And then this basilica completed by Augustus.

386
00:25:07.321 --> 00:25:10.460
This was very carefully chosen location,
uh,

387
00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:13.490
by Diocletian to link himself after this,

388
00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:17.230
after this bloody third century as I mentioned,
to link himself,
uh,

389
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.940
with the great leaders of the Roman past.
I can,

390
00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:24.200
I want to show you quickly because this is again of course in architecture,

391
00:25:24.201 --> 00:25:24.981
not in sculpture,

392
00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:29.480
but I do want to show you just quickly the scenes on the base because I think

393
00:25:29.481 --> 00:25:31.360
one of the interesting,
uh,

394
00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.240
interesting detective work one can do is to try to figure out,

395
00:25:35.241 --> 00:25:37.430
since we have only one base who's based,
was it,

396
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.780
which of the four tet trucks or was it Jupiter's base?
Uh,
and I've tried that,

397
00:25:41.781 --> 00:25:45.050
played that game myself and I'll give you my idea and you'll see whether you

398
00:25:45.051 --> 00:25:49.280
think it's a good one or not.
Uh,
we look at the scene at the top,

399
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:52.430
upper most part.
We're looking at the four sides of that sculptured base.

400
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:56.360
At the top you see two victories,
a with a shield.

401
00:25:56.361 --> 00:25:59.990
And that shield has the word in the center destined Eylea doesn't Nalia.

402
00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:04.160
That's how we know it's dedicated to the descending of the sending of

403
00:26:04.161 --> 00:26:06.680
anniversary,
10 year rule of the tetrarchy.

404
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.190
You can also see barbarians down below.
So a reference to uh,

405
00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:14.270
those who have been conquered.
And if you look very carefully,

406
00:26:14.271 --> 00:26:18.310
you'll see that the figures are outlined in the way that we saw them at all

407
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.810
raunch and also at Santa me.

408
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:26.030
And then some of the items including the arms and armor are actually inscribed

409
00:26:26.031 --> 00:26:28.940
carved on the stone directly on the stone.

410
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.850
So this very interesting use of outlining here,
here.

411
00:26:31.851 --> 00:26:34.130
I don't think the reason for it is the same.

412
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:39.050
I don't think they're looking at at copybooks,
but rather a that there has been,

413
00:26:39.051 --> 00:26:39.360
there is,

414
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:44.360
there is now an interest in this kind of outlining for effect up here we see a

415
00:26:45.031 --> 00:26:49.440
sacrifice of three animals being brought in for sacrifice and the men with their

416
00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:51.570
axes who are going to slit their throats.

417
00:26:51.571 --> 00:26:56.250
Ultimately the sacrifice obviously in honor of this descent,
Neil Celebration,

418
00:26:56.251 --> 00:26:59.260
this anniversary celebration,
uh,
Ma,
uh,

419
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:03.570
making reference to 10 year rule of the tetrarchy.
Here's the scene down here.

420
00:27:03.571 --> 00:27:06.340
Unfortunately in all of these scenes where we seem to have,
uh,

421
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.900
the emperor or emperors,
the heads are no longer preserved.

422
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.820
So here we have a sacrifice seen also a sacrifice being made in honor of this

423
00:27:14.821 --> 00:27:19.620
descending IOL anniversary.
But the emperor represented here who was sacrificing,

424
00:27:19.621 --> 00:27:22.650
who's based,
this probably was his face is gone,

425
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:27.690
but you can see he's accompanied by Roma,
by the,
the uh,
the Senate,

426
00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.450
the personification of the Senate by Mars,

427
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:34.500
by victory who crowns him with the wreath.
As you can see here,

428
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.490
and this looks like a figure of Saul,
Helios with the raid crown.

429
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.550
So a whole panoply of divinities with whom?

430
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.730
By whom he is being honored and with whom he wants to associate himself.

431
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:48.020
This is the most important relief,
I believe,
in terms of,

432
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:51.390
of speculating about whose base this might've been.

433
00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:56.720
We see a four figures for adult males in the foreground with togas.

434
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:02.130
All of them had lists,
unfortunately.
Uh,
but four of them,
that's no coincidence.

435
00:28:02.131 --> 00:28:06.420
All four standing there.
So while we see one of them,
this is his base,

436
00:28:06.421 --> 00:28:08.490
one of them,
uh,
sacrificing here.

437
00:28:08.491 --> 00:28:11.370
I guess one could argue it's Diocletian is the head of the tetrarchy.

438
00:28:11.371 --> 00:28:15.180
That would be another possibility,
but the four of them represented here.

439
00:28:15.181 --> 00:28:18.840
But if you look very closely,
one of them is accompanied by a child.

440
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:24.330
So my speculation would be since one of them is accompanied by a child and
since,

441
00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:27.720
uh,
it is Constantine who was most well thought,

442
00:28:27.721 --> 00:28:32.721
most likely to be the one to eventually succeed the Ted talks or become a

443
00:28:33.181 --> 00:28:37.470
tetrarch himself,
I would speculate and it's pure speculation,
uh,

444
00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:40.410
that this may have been the base of Gullah of a constant,

445
00:28:40.411 --> 00:28:44.100
just Cloris of his father can stand just Cloris,
uh,
and that we,

446
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:46.950
the clue there is constant team.

447
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:53.750
Another building that Diocletian was interested in in the Roman forum in terms

448
00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:58.620
of associating himself with Caesar and also with Augustus was the Senate House,

449
00:28:58.621 --> 00:29:00.930
the,
uh,
Korea,
Julia.

450
00:29:00.931 --> 00:29:04.710
It is called the Chorea Julia because it was actually not built in the

451
00:29:04.711 --> 00:29:06.150
Diocletian Anik period.

452
00:29:06.151 --> 00:29:11.151
But built initially begun by Caesar Gut begun by Julius Caesar to provide Rome

453
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.960
with the Senate house in the Roman Forum begun by Cesar,
uh,

454
00:29:15.961 --> 00:29:18.960
and completed by Augustus after Caesar's death.

455
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:23.850
But the building was in and that's why it's named Corey Julia after the Julian

456
00:29:23.851 --> 00:29:26.160
family,
uh,
that,
uh,
that uh,

457
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:29.220
Cesar and also Augustus were a part of a,

458
00:29:29.221 --> 00:29:32.030
but that building the chorea Julia was destroyed,

459
00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:37.050
very seriously destroyed in a fire in Rome in 283 a d.

460
00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:42.010
And so what Diocletian does is he restores it between two 84.

461
00:29:42.011 --> 00:29:46.230
He begins already into 84.
Well before the formation of the Tetrarchy,
uh,

462
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.620
anti completes it in 305,
a d this restoration,

463
00:29:50.621 --> 00:29:53.530
it continues to be called the Chorea Julia.
Uh,

464
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:56.230
but it is at this point to directly sciatic building,

465
00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:59.070
but one that clearly where he,

466
00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:04.240
he instructed his designers to try to keep it as close to the original as

467
00:30:05.261 --> 00:30:05.831
possible.

468
00:30:05.831 --> 00:30:10.420
Now what you're looking at here on the right hand side of the screen is a coin,

469
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.870
uh,
that comes from the period of the emperor Augustus.

470
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.760
And it purports to represent,

471
00:30:15.761 --> 00:30:19.300
I don't think there's any question that it represents a given it's inscription

472
00:30:19.301 --> 00:30:21.730
and so on.
The Senate House in Rome,

473
00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.670
as it would've looked as completed by Augustus,

474
00:30:24.671 --> 00:30:29.200
and he's in fact celebrating the completion of this monument and associating

475
00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:33.550
himself through this coin with his divine adoptive father,
Julius Caesar.

476
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:37.840
If we look at the form where if we look at the exterior of this monument,

477
00:30:37.841 --> 00:30:42.680
as it is depicted on the coin,
you will see that it is a regular square.
The,

478
00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.310
the front of the building is,

479
00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:48.100
it looks like a square with a very large pediment at the top,

480
00:30:48.101 --> 00:30:50.960
although I think that was accentuated here at size.
Uh,

481
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:55.930
in order to allow the dye cutter to include the sculpture in the pediment and

482
00:30:55.931 --> 00:31:00.370
also the sculpture decorating the eaves.
We see the doorway right here.

483
00:31:00.371 --> 00:31:03.700
We see there seem to be a triple window up above the doorway.

484
00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.320
And if you look very carefully,

485
00:31:05.321 --> 00:31:09.940
you will see that there seems to be a portico as series of columns that are

486
00:31:09.941 --> 00:31:14.620
there to relieve the severity of the otherwise very geometrically ordered

487
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.290
facade.
Uh,
so that's what we,

488
00:31:17.291 --> 00:31:21.400
that's what we think it looked like in the time of Caesar.

489
00:31:21.401 --> 00:31:25.660
Based on that coin.
You see it over here in plan.
This is a plan of,

490
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:29.990
of the forum in Rome in the Augustan period,
a 10 [inaudible].
Uh,

491
00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:32.410
we see the buildings that were there at that time.

492
00:31:32.411 --> 00:31:35.260
The basilica is the Temple of Divine Julius Caesar,
the roster.

493
00:31:35.261 --> 00:31:39.290
But of course without the five column monument,
no arches symptom use veress.
Uh,

494
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:44.110
but we do see the Cory and you see it here in plan as a very plain open

495
00:31:44.111 --> 00:31:48.860
rectangular box in a sense.
So even in its [inaudible] and Augustan,
uh,

496
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.730
beginnings,
it seems to have been a very straightforward,
uh,
straight forward,
uh,

497
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:55.690
matter of fact kind of a building,

498
00:31:56.230 --> 00:32:00.880
this is a restored view of what we believe it looked like after the restoration

499
00:32:00.881 --> 00:32:05.650
by Diocletian.
You won't be surprised to hear that the materials were different,

500
00:32:05.651 --> 00:32:09.490
that it's a building when in it's restored version.
It was made out of concrete,

501
00:32:09.491 --> 00:32:14.290
faced with brick exposed brick,
uh,
so very much a building of its own time.

502
00:32:14.291 --> 00:32:18.640
It would not have looked like that,
uh,
in the time of Caesar and Augustus,

503
00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:20.560
but they have in every other way.

504
00:32:20.561 --> 00:32:25.561
They have kept to the underlying geometry of the form to the use of the triple

505
00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:30.880
window with a car,
a curved top.
As you can see here,
an RQ weighted top,

506
00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.070
a pediment above.

507
00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.790
We don't know whether the second version had pedimento sculpture in it or other

508
00:32:36.791 --> 00:32:39.650
decorative sculpture,
the doorway down below,

509
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:44.860
but the severity of the brick faced the exposed brick facade has been alleviated

510
00:32:45.921 --> 00:32:50.360
somewhat by the placement of marble revetment at the bottom part of the wall

511
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:54.950
behind,
uh,
a series of columns.
So they have kept that portico,

512
00:32:54.951 --> 00:32:57.350
that set of columns to relieve the severity,

513
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:01.250
but also to make this building look as much as they could.

514
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:05.390
Like the original says,
Arion and Augustan structure,

515
00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:10.250
this is what the Cory,
it looks like today.
It is extremely well preserved,

516
00:33:10.251 --> 00:33:14.300
as you can see.
Yes,
it's lacking.
It's,
uh,
it's lacking.

517
00:33:14.301 --> 00:33:17.480
It's marble revetment and it's lacking.
It's portico,

518
00:33:17.481 --> 00:33:21.100
but in every other way you can see very well,
uh,

519
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:26.200
exactly what this building looked like in the time of Diocletian concrete faced

520
00:33:26.361 --> 00:33:27.380
with brick,
uh,

521
00:33:27.381 --> 00:33:31.430
with the very simple windows and this very geometric abstract,

522
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:35.540
uh,
ordering,
which again,
I believe,
you know,

523
00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:37.510
I think the explanation for that is twofold.

524
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.950
One that they are trying to maintain the look of the original,
uh,

525
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:45.260
Julian building,
but also because this is again,

526
00:33:45.261 --> 00:33:49.700
the aesthetic of the time on this decision to make buildings in a very

527
00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.670
geometrically ordered abstract way.
I believe,
again,

528
00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.580
to reflect the stability of their new government.

529
00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:01.160
This building the Korea,
uh,
Julia owes its excellent,

530
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.500
excellent condition to the fact that it likes so many buildings we've talked

531
00:34:06.501 --> 00:34:09.980
about this semester was reused over time.
Uh,

532
00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:14.900
we know that it was turned into a church already in the seventh century BC,
uh,

533
00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.830
that it was restored in the 12th and in the 16th century.

534
00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:21.980
And I did I say seventh century BC.
If I did,

535
00:34:21.981 --> 00:34:25.340
I met a d seventh century Aidy 12th and 16th centuries,

536
00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:30.560
and then again in the 17th century and it was in the 17th century that it like

537
00:34:30.561 --> 00:34:35.120
so many other Roman structures was transformed into a Baroque church,

538
00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:39.440
uh,
by an architect by the name of Martino Long.
The younger,

539
00:34:39.441 --> 00:34:43.520
I put his name on the monument list for you Martino Long,
the,
the younger,

540
00:34:43.521 --> 00:34:48.521
and it was a re consecrated as Sohn Adriano St Hadrian all four.

541
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.250
Oh,
Romano.
It's on Adrianna.
All foreal Romano.

542
00:34:52.251 --> 00:34:56.060
St Hadrian in the Roman forum was the church.

543
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:59.090
And when I say Baroque church,
I mean a baroque church.

544
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:02.690
It was d consecrated by muscle [inaudible] in the 1930s.

545
00:35:02.691 --> 00:35:06.620
Miss Illini returning it to its original ancient form,

546
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:09.910
as you can see over here.
But this photograph,
uh,

547
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.960
shows the work that was being done in the 30s to dismiss,

548
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:18.410
dismantle this Baroque church into which the Corey I'd become,
I mean,

549
00:35:18.411 --> 00:35:22.460
it's really hard to believe that this was the chorea in the 17th century,

550
00:35:22.461 --> 00:35:25.520
but that's exactly what it looked like as well as in the early 20th century.

551
00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.100
And you can see a bell tower had been added,

552
00:35:28.101 --> 00:35:32.010
buttresses had been added to the structure completely and casing,
uh,

553
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:35.510
the Korea in a baroque church.
Uh,

554
00:35:35.511 --> 00:35:38.940
and we see that being dismantled in this view over here.

555
00:35:38.941 --> 00:35:41.640
And I have a view I can show you also have the interior.

556
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:46.260
This was the interior in the 17th century.
Impossible to,

557
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.690
to see,
uh,
that original box,

558
00:35:48.691 --> 00:35:53.100
simple box like interior that was there in the time of Diocletian and probably

559
00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:54.840
there in the time of Caesar Augustus.

560
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:59.940
So filled is it with the usual baroque paraphernalia,
uh,
of,
uh,
you know,

561
00:35:59.941 --> 00:36:04.920
elaborate stucco work and angels flying to the skies and uh,
these,
these,

562
00:36:04.921 --> 00:36:07.980
you know,
not that we haven't seen this kind of thing.
And Roman architecture,

563
00:36:07.981 --> 00:36:09.420
we of course have a,

564
00:36:09.421 --> 00:36:12.690
but you can see that the original shape of this particular building has been

565
00:36:12.691 --> 00:36:17.280
completely disguised by Martino longing.
The younger,
as he read does,
uh,

566
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:20.000
the Korea as a baroque church.
This is when,

567
00:36:20.001 --> 00:36:23.010
when they took all of that a baroque accretion off,

568
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:26.700
this is what they ended up with.
This is what the Corey looked like.

569
00:36:26.701 --> 00:36:30.100
Probably very similar to this.
And the time of Caesar Augustus,
uh,

570
00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:33.450
what it looked like under Diocletian.
And what it again looks like today,

571
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:37.860
you can see from this,
from this view,
this very simple box,

572
00:36:37.861 --> 00:36:42.720
like a shape for the interior of this structure.
Uh,
plain walls,

573
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.650
a coffered,
a flat coffered ceiling.
The only a,

574
00:36:46.651 --> 00:36:51.210
the only light brought in by a series of very simple windows with RQ weighted

575
00:36:51.211 --> 00:36:52.044
tops,

576
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:56.400
allowing light into the system and then down below and the brick facing the

577
00:36:56.401 --> 00:37:00.330
concrete and brick facing exposed.
Uh,
but with the down below,

578
00:37:00.331 --> 00:37:05.280
probably some marble revetment on the wall down here.
Very simple niches,

579
00:37:05.281 --> 00:37:08.520
RQ,
waited and rectangular niches,
but very,
very simple ones.

580
00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:13.040
And then here you see the benches,
the stone benches on which,
uh,

581
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.000
the senators would have sat,
uh,

582
00:37:15.001 --> 00:37:18.090
when they were deliberating or stood in front of cause they got up a lot in

583
00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:22.530
oriented,
uh,
but stood in front of when they delivered their speeches or,
or,

584
00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:25.740
or sat.
And then down below the original,
uh,

585
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:29.940
the original marble prevented floor,
uh,
is still preserved.

586
00:37:29.941 --> 00:37:34.550
And I can show you two views here and color of that floor,
uh,

587
00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.230
to give you a sense of to all done in marbles,

588
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.900
marbles dot brought from different parts of the world,

589
00:37:39.901 --> 00:37:44.010
but the usual colors that the Romans liked for most of their marble pavements,

590
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.960
a white or off white and Maroon Green and black,

591
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:54.240
but very nicely done for this.
Um,
very simple,
very geometrically ordered,
uh,

592
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:58.890
but very beautiful interior with regard to public architecture.

593
00:37:58.891 --> 00:38:02.620
Diocletian also built a major bath in Rome,
uh,

594
00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:07.470
following the lead of Caracalla and many emperors before him to provide for the

595
00:38:07.471 --> 00:38:12.471
Roman people a place where they could go and enjoy themselves as well as learn.

596
00:38:12.481 --> 00:38:17.310
Because you'll remember that by this time,
these major imperial bass structures,

597
00:38:17.311 --> 00:38:19.080
and this is one of those,
uh,

598
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:24.110
place the bathing block inside a much larger precinct that included rooms around

599
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:26.860
it that served as lecture halls and,
uh,

600
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:32.030
meeting halls and seminar rooms and places for a Greek and Latin libraries and

601
00:38:33.211 --> 00:38:36.880
the like.
And we see that scape scheme being used here.

602
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:42.210
The baths were built between a d 298 and 306 by Diocletian in Rome.

603
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.410
They're located near the train station today.

604
00:38:47.411 --> 00:38:52.030
So very close to those remaining fragments of the survey and walls.
Uh,

605
00:38:52.031 --> 00:38:57.031
and you see again that plan here and you see that the outer precinct has one of

606
00:38:57.371 --> 00:38:59.560
these large hemi cycles,
uh,

607
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:03.520
that what may have been used for performances as you can see,
uh,

608
00:39:03.521 --> 00:39:06.310
and that it is like the other,
other,
uh,

609
00:39:06.311 --> 00:39:10.810
imperial Bas that we've looked at with the central bathing rooms in the center,

610
00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:15.280
in axial relationship to one another and in the usual sequence.

611
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:20.050
And then with other rooms disposed around them on either side in a symmetrical

612
00:39:20.051 --> 00:39:24.820
way.
We see it number four,
the Nataka Eto or swimming pool we see,

613
00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:29.200
which has a scallop to the bottom side as you see it here is scalloped or the

614
00:39:29.201 --> 00:39:33.730
wall is the number three is the frigging Darian,

615
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:38.260
the cold room of the Bas,
which had a triple groin vaulted ceiling.
Uh,

616
00:39:38.261 --> 00:39:41.800
from there we go into the tip of Darian.
You see it here,

617
00:39:41.801 --> 00:39:46.300
a small circular structure with radiating arms that give it a cross shape and

618
00:39:46.301 --> 00:39:49.080
then down below a very interesting call,
Darian,

619
00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:54.090
because we see that Diocletian and his architects have rejected the round called

620
00:39:54.641 --> 00:39:55.420
Rem,
uh,

621
00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:59.480
with the radiating alcove looking so much like the Pantheon is we discuss and

622
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.170
almost as large,
uh,
from the baths of Caracalla,

623
00:40:02.171 --> 00:40:06.520
they've rejected that in favor of a more rectangular shape.
Uh,

624
00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.600
that's more similar to the shape of the frigate Darian,
uh,

625
00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:14.640
but with radiating apps is that have a series of columns that allow the views

626
00:40:16.481 --> 00:40:17.800
and vistas from one to the other.

627
00:40:17.801 --> 00:40:21.460
This is another version of the same plan from Ward Perkins.

628
00:40:21.461 --> 00:40:25.720
In this particular case,
uh,
that shows again the Natacha,
the free Kadarian.

629
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.080
Here you can see better the way in which the circle becomes a cross shape for

630
00:40:29.081 --> 00:40:31.690
the tip of Darian.
And then here,
uh,

631
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:35.530
the call and below where you can also see better,
I believe,
uh,

632
00:40:35.531 --> 00:40:40.531
the columns on those alcoves that allow views of both from inside out and

633
00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:46.090
outside in.
And here is still another one.

634
00:40:46.091 --> 00:40:49.750
This is the one that you have on your monument list that shows you those spaces

635
00:40:49.751 --> 00:40:52.420
once again from the other direction than Natacha,

636
00:40:52.421 --> 00:40:55.500
where you can see very well the scallop wall,
the figure Darian,

637
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:57.460
where you can see the triple groin vault,

638
00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:01.630
the tip Darian with its round shape and radiating arms.

639
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:03.130
And then most importantly,

640
00:41:03.131 --> 00:41:06.100
the call Darren with probably also triple growing vaulted,

641
00:41:06.101 --> 00:41:10.200
just like the free Kadarian,
but with radiating alcoves,
uh,

642
00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.990
and then all of these other rooms disposed around them symmetrically.

643
00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:19.500
Now what's very interesting also in terms of more architecture in later times is

644
00:41:19.751 --> 00:41:22.870
the,
uh,
is the baths of Diocletian.

645
00:41:22.871 --> 00:41:27.460
We're also a reused in,
but in this case,

646
00:41:27.461 --> 00:41:30.400
not for a single building,
but for a variety of buildings,

647
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:35.560
including a major museum of a planetarium,
uh,

648
00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:36.920
and also a church,

649
00:41:36.921 --> 00:41:41.510
the famous Church of Santa Maria Daily Anjalee Saint Mary of the angels.

650
00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.120
Now,
while this plan is still on the screen,

651
00:41:44.121 --> 00:41:48.380
I want to show you when the Church of some,
some Santa Maria daily,

652
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:52.070
Anjali was redesigned.
And one of the redesign is,
by the way,

653
00:41:52.071 --> 00:41:55.400
was Michelangelo.
When it was redesigned.

654
00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:59.600
What they did was they took the alcove,
the from where we're standing,

655
00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:02.330
the bottom alcove of the call,
Darian,

656
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:07.130
they use that as the curved facade of their church.
Uh,

657
00:42:07.131 --> 00:42:10.190
they used the tepid Doriam as the vestibule.

658
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:15.170
They use the frigging Doriam as the main space of the church,
uh,

659
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:20.030
and also,
and they,
and,
and,
and so that becomes the church that made that,

660
00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:22.140
that bottom part of the call Darren,

661
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.010
the tepid Dharm and the freakatorium become the church.

662
00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:28.850
And then some of these other spaces are used again for other kinds of buildings,

663
00:42:28.851 --> 00:42:31.220
including the planetarium,
I call your attention,

664
00:42:31.221 --> 00:42:34.530
especially to the ones at the upper right and the upper left,
uh,

665
00:42:34.531 --> 00:42:37.670
both of which are an octagonal spaces,
as you can see,

666
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:42.500
comparable to earlier octagonal spaces under Nero or under demission,

667
00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:46.010
uh,
and one of those rooms,
this one at the Ra to our right,

668
00:42:46.011 --> 00:42:50.780
but to the left when you're facing the entrance to the church today,
uh,
is,

669
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:53.630
uh,
is still a very well preserved.
And I'm going to show you,

670
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:57.170
show you that in a moment.
First,
here's a view into the church,

671
00:42:57.171 --> 00:43:01.700
into the nave of Santa Maria Daily Anjulie,
uh,
which again,

672
00:43:01.701 --> 00:43:02.534
what you're looking at,

673
00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:07.610
the original frigate Darian of the baths of Diocletian.
Uh,

674
00:43:07.611 --> 00:43:10.570
you can see all the things one usually sees in a Doriam.

675
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:13.970
And I show you a restored view of what we think the Frigidaire him of the baths

676
00:43:13.971 --> 00:43:16.010
of Caracalla looked like in antiquity.

677
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.280
And you can see there's a close resemblance between the,
the two.

678
00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:23.480
The groin vaults are still preserved.
Uh,
we see original columns here,

679
00:43:23.481 --> 00:43:26.660
granite columns with capital.
Some of the capitals are ancient,

680
00:43:26.661 --> 00:43:29.870
some of them are not.
And we see a lot of color,

681
00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:35.080
a justice we would've seen in the original baths of Caracalla of Diocletian.

682
00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:40.850
One one difference is that we see the groin vaults in the Santa Maria daily

683
00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:44.390
Anjalee are white.
And that is the work of Michelangelo.

684
00:43:44.391 --> 00:43:47.770
Michelangelo decided that he wanted something much plainer,
uh,

685
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:50.690
for the vaulting of Santa Maria daily on Jelly.

686
00:43:50.691 --> 00:43:54.770
And it was he who stuck oded over and no one ever dared to change,
uh,

687
00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:59.680
Michelangelo's work.
But another architect by the name of Luigi,
Vaughn v,

688
00:43:59.681 --> 00:44:02.570
Tele Van v.
I.
T.
L.
L.
I love the name.

689
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:07.750
Luigi von Vitelli was at work in the Santa Maria daily Anjalee interior in the

690
00:44:08.901 --> 00:44:12.730
18th century.
Precisely in 1749.
Uh,

691
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:14.600
he came in to,
uh,

692
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:19.630
to spruce up the decoration and it was bond be tele who added to the original

693
00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.880
Roman granted,
uh,
columns,
uh,
who added these models.

694
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:28.250
You see these models pilasters I'll show you a detail of them in a moment with

695
00:44:28.251 --> 00:44:32.700
their capitals,
some new capitals to match the ancient Roman capitals.

696
00:44:32.701 --> 00:44:36.330
He added all lot of the stucco decoration that you see it here now.

697
00:44:36.331 --> 00:44:39.450
And a lot of the altar pieces where we're put in a,

698
00:44:39.451 --> 00:44:41.680
in the 17th and 18th century,
um,

699
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.700
to make it the church that it needed to become a,

700
00:44:44.701 --> 00:44:48.240
but if I show you a detail of von be teles work,
you can see,
you know,

701
00:44:48.241 --> 00:44:50.290
as you stand in Santa Maria de Leon Jelly,

702
00:44:50.291 --> 00:44:53.550
one tries to figure out what's ancient and what is,
what is modern.

703
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:57.930
But you can see here what seems to be a granite shaft from an ancient column

704
00:44:57.931 --> 00:45:02.880
with a new,
a Corinthian capital designed by von be telly that imitates those,

705
00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.500
uh,
of the Roman ones that are there.

706
00:45:04.501 --> 00:45:09.501
But all of this mottled work and all of the stucco decoration that you see over

707
00:45:09.511 --> 00:45:12.930
here added by Vaughn v Telly in the 18th century.
But we,

708
00:45:12.931 --> 00:45:15.330
you've seen enough Roman ancient Roman architecture,

709
00:45:15.331 --> 00:45:17.340
especially if the baroque kind,
uh,

710
00:45:17.341 --> 00:45:20.430
to know that this sort of thing did exist in Roman times.

711
00:45:20.431 --> 00:45:24.900
And I think bond Vitelli has actually done a pretty good job of giving us a

712
00:45:24.901 --> 00:45:28.530
sense of what the Frigidaire Doriam of these paths would have looked like in the

713
00:45:28.531 --> 00:45:31.560
time of Diocletian.
Now here's the facade.

714
00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:35.330
And so you see exactly what I described before.
This is one of the alcoves.

715
00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:39.960
You can see the concrete brick faced a alco that they have.
I mean,

716
00:45:39.961 --> 00:45:43.950
this is the simplest facade of any in Rome.
There's nothing quite like this,

717
00:45:43.951 --> 00:45:47.220
but it's so typical of the Italians to make wonderful,

718
00:45:47.221 --> 00:45:50.640
to take wonderful advantage of what there is.
And so in this case,

719
00:45:50.641 --> 00:45:53.580
they decided best to leave it as it is.
It speaks for itself.

720
00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:58.260
They just use that Alco,
they added a couple of doors,
uh,
created a niche,

721
00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.740
slap the name Basilica,
Santa Maria daily.
Angelie on the front.

722
00:46:01.741 --> 00:46:05.610
Very simply put a cross at the top.
And this became the facade,
uh,

723
00:46:05.611 --> 00:46:09.090
into the church.
And it has remained this,
uh,
to this day.

724
00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:14.730
Here's another view of the bads of Karch,
uh,
of Diocletian as they look today,

725
00:46:14.731 --> 00:46:19.731
we're looking at the outside where we can see the outside of the [inaudible]

726
00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:25.520
with its windows and it's growing,
bolting exposed on the outside.
Uh,

727
00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:29.400
this is the tip,
Darian and the roofing of the tepid Darian.

728
00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.040
And over here you can see the curved facade.

729
00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:36.870
That's the part of the caldarium that survives,
uses the facade of the church.

730
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.300
And then as you stand here,
if you go to the right,

731
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:44.750
you can go and look at what one of those octagonal rooms it looks like today and

732
00:46:44.971 --> 00:46:48.570
what they've done,
they've taken advantage.
This is a spectacular space.

733
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:49.560
This was just,

734
00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:53.840
we don't know exactly what purpose is served in the bath originally.
Uh,

735
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:55.260
but it's actually a space,

736
00:46:55.261 --> 00:47:00.030
it's more similar to the caldarium of car call his boss and it is to anything

737
00:47:00.031 --> 00:47:01.740
else in the baths of Diocletian.

738
00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:06.000
But you can see that they have taken advantage of this extraordinary octagonal

739
00:47:06.001 --> 00:47:09.420
shape with radiating alcoves going back to uh,

740
00:47:09.421 --> 00:47:11.330
to Nero's Domus transitory,

741
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:15.660
don't miss our area to use as a place to display some of the greatest works of

742
00:47:15.661 --> 00:47:20.460
sculpture in the part of this,
these baths that now serves as a museum.

743
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:23.340
One very interesting feature though that I want to point out too,

744
00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:26.370
that will become important for something later we talk about today and for

745
00:47:26.371 --> 00:47:31.000
Tuesday's lecture is the fact that you do see using here windows,

746
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:33.610
uh,
in,
in the lower part of the Dome,

747
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:37.990
a windows RQ weighted windows to allow light into the system.

748
00:47:37.991 --> 00:47:42.040
We see this at development in late antiquity where they moved from providing

749
00:47:42.041 --> 00:47:45.580
light through the Oculus to providing light through a series of windows.

750
00:47:45.581 --> 00:47:45.881
And again,

751
00:47:45.881 --> 00:47:49.810
they're sophisticated enough and their use of concrete to be able to do that.

752
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:55.110
And we see that the trend Diocletian was as interested in,

753
00:47:55.450 --> 00:48:00.220
um,
private architecture as he was in public architecture.

754
00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.060
He was a man,
or you can tell a lot about him just from what I've told you.

755
00:48:04.061 --> 00:48:06.820
It was very organized,
a any planned ahead,
uh,

756
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:10.630
for his own abdication eventually,
uh,
in his own retirement.

757
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:14.020
And he wanted to live ultimately back in his,

758
00:48:14.021 --> 00:48:18.190
where his roots were on the Croatian,
on the Dalmatian coast.
Uh,

759
00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.940
and he built for himself a palace,
uh,

760
00:48:21.941 --> 00:48:25.540
in a place called split in what is now Croatia.

761
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:30.630
And I show you again the map of this part of the world.
If you look at,
uh,

762
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:33.160
Pola that we,
I can't reach it from where I am,

763
00:48:33.161 --> 00:48:37.030
but if you look at Pola where that is and down the Dalmatian coast,

764
00:48:37.031 --> 00:48:40.540
you'll see split right below that Dubrovnik is at the base.

765
00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:44.920
This is actually a view I took of Dubrovnik just to give you a sense of this

766
00:48:44.921 --> 00:48:49.910
part of the world.
It's magnificently beautiful there.
Uh,
and one can imagine,
um,

767
00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:50.660
how,

768
00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:55.650
why Diocletian was drawn to return to his homeland,

769
00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:56.860
uh,
for his palace.

770
00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:00.130
So we are looking here at the plan of the Palace of Diocletian,

771
00:49:00.131 --> 00:49:01.460
which is extremely WellPreserved.

772
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:06.010
This is from Ward Perkins and you should be immediately struck,
uh,
by,

773
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:09.380
uh,
this palace because it,
uh,

774
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.870
which dates by the way to 300 to 305 a d.
Uh,

775
00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:15.740
we see here,
uh,

776
00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:19.210
something that I'm sure you've all noticed already and that is that he has built

777
00:49:19.211 --> 00:49:22.630
this palace in the form of a Roman costume.

778
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:27.490
It's a Roman military camp.
It is a little city.
It's a city in its own right,

779
00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:32.200
uh,
in the form of a Roman military camp.
Why did he do that?
That's interesting.

780
00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:32.531
Well,

781
00:49:32.531 --> 00:49:36.790
I think it had something to do with the fact that the structure was located on

782
00:49:36.791 --> 00:49:41.760
the sea,
uh,
right off,
you know,
right out on a promontory on the sea.
Uh,
and uh,

783
00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:45.460
could easily have been attacked and times were still,
he was still,

784
00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:47.290
he had brought stability back.
Yes.

785
00:49:47.291 --> 00:49:52.291
But he was very aware of what he had had proceeded him in the third century and

786
00:49:52.781 --> 00:49:57.781
desirous of protecting himself and his possessions in his palace on,

787
00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:02.980
on the Dalmatian coast.
And so he builds it in the form of a costume.

788
00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:07.820
You can see all the elements of a typical Roman military camp.
Uh,

789
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:11.080
just as we saw in a city,
our city building,

790
00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:16.090
urban planning from the republic on,
it's a rectangular in shape.
It has walls.

791
00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:17.950
Uh,
it has watched towers.

792
00:50:17.951 --> 00:50:22.720
You can see they are alternately rectangular and octagonal watchtowers.

793
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.810
It has entrances and exits.
It has a carto and a deck.

794
00:50:25.811 --> 00:50:29.930
You Montas that at the intersection of the palace.
Uh,

795
00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:34.340
you can see there are the main gateway is on the northern side.

796
00:50:34.341 --> 00:50:38.810
The southern side faces the sea.
As you walk from the northern entrance,

797
00:50:38.811 --> 00:50:43.130
way along the carto in the deck,
you Montas so to speak,
of this palace,

798
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:47.330
you will see that they are colonated just as they usually are in the eastern

799
00:50:47.331 --> 00:50:50.270
part of the empire,
but not in the western part of the empire.

800
00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:55.490
As you walk along from the entrance way,
you enter into a public court over here,

801
00:50:55.491 --> 00:50:59.090
very elaborate.
That's still preserved with,
uh,
an RQ weighted Lyndell.

802
00:50:59.091 --> 00:51:00.970
I'm going to show you that in a moment,
uh,

803
00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:04.940
then into this domed area here with alcoves.
Uh,

804
00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.480
but note that on either side of this,
uh,
this,

805
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:11.600
this open space with the RQ weighted lintel,

806
00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:14.400
which is called the Paris style of the villa.
Uh,

807
00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:18.590
you can see on one side a small temple,
which is a temple of Jupiter,

808
00:51:18.591 --> 00:51:23.330
the patron God of Diocletian,
and on the other side,
uh,
a mausoleum,

809
00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.860
an octagonal tomb.

810
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.950
Now that should strike you as very interesting and very unusual.

811
00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:32.951
We have not seen a tomb as part of palace architecture before.

812
00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:37.880
This is new to late antiquity.
This probably has to do in part with,
again,

813
00:51:37.881 --> 00:51:40.610
Diocletian planning this as his place of retirement.

814
00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:43.130
He knew he was gonna retire there.
He knew he was going to die there,

815
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:46.450
and he wanted to make sure that he supplied for himself a to me,

816
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:49.700
it was not going to be buried in one of these major Masalia in Rome.

817
00:51:49.701 --> 00:51:54.650
He wanted it to be buried at home.
Uh,
and so he plans for this by building a,
uh,

818
00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:57.440
an octagonal,
not around like Augustus in Hadrian,

819
00:51:57.441 --> 00:52:01.730
but an octagonal tomb with a porch,
uh,
here in the villa.

820
00:52:01.731 --> 00:52:05.640
And note that it is right across from the temple of Jupiter.
No,
uh,

821
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:07.340
no coincidence there.

822
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:11.840
Go through the domed room dome space into the private wing of the house.

823
00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:14.930
You see a room here with a basilican shape.

824
00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:16.760
We're not exactly sure what it was useful,

825
00:52:16.761 --> 00:52:19.630
but probably some kind of reception hall.
Uh,

826
00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.870
and then hear a series of interestingly shaped rooms.
Uh,

827
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:27.200
that was where the emperors a private quarters we're located.

828
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:33.000
This is a restored view of what this fortress Palace would have looked like a

829
00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:36.740
when it was built in the fourth century.
We see it here.

830
00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:41.360
All of the things I've already described,
the outer walls,
the watch towers,
uh,

831
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:44.810
the,
uh,
entrance way on the north,
the colonated streets.

832
00:52:44.811 --> 00:52:48.590
You can see the octagonal tomb rising up over there,

833
00:52:48.591 --> 00:52:52.610
across from the temple of Jupiter.
And then down here,

834
00:52:52.611 --> 00:52:54.620
the private area or the private wing.

835
00:52:54.621 --> 00:52:56.990
And you can see how the southern side faces the sea.

836
00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:00.950
And there seems to have been an RQ weighted lintel on that side.

837
00:53:00.951 --> 00:53:04.820
We've seen that that's grown in influence and importance since it was first used

838
00:53:04.821 --> 00:53:07.010
in the time of Hadrian.
Uh,

839
00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:12.040
this is the poor to our area or the northern gate of the palace.

840
00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:15.170
Uh,
you see it in a restored view from Ward Perkins,

841
00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:20.120
a rectangular entranceway lintel window,
like with greats above,
uh,

842
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:23.210
niches on either side with arcuate and pediments,

843
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:27.570
but most interestingly is the upper tier where you see a series of columns on

844
00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:32.490
brackets that support arcades.
Uh,
this whole idea of arcades on columns,

845
00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:37.100
uh,
you know,
began as we know later in antiquity and,
uh,

846
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:41.180
continues to be important into the late third and early fourth century.

847
00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:44.850
We saw it at the forum,
Eh,
uh,

848
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:48.870
for the seven forum at leftist Magdna where you can see again,

849
00:53:48.871 --> 00:53:53.850
columns as arcaded colonnade here.
We saw it in residential architecture,

850
00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:56.010
Ostia late residential architecture.

851
00:53:56.011 --> 00:54:00.510
Think of the house of Fortuna on an area where we have those,
uh,

852
00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:05.550
that those columns with arches above them that separate the fountain court from

853
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:06.661
the trickling ium.

854
00:54:06.661 --> 00:54:09.600
So I just wanted to make the point that we see it not only at Diocletian's

855
00:54:09.601 --> 00:54:12.920
palace,
but it's very common in late Roman,
uh,

856
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:15.810
residential and civic architecture as well.

857
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:20.640
This is a view of the Paris style as it looks today.
Uh,
we have,
we are walking,

858
00:54:20.641 --> 00:54:24.180
we've come from the North Gate,
we're walking along,
we're hitting the peristyle.

859
00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:27.870
We're going to be going from the peristyle into that domed area here.

860
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:30.900
Imagine views through the columns of the Paris style,

861
00:54:30.901 --> 00:54:34.470
and some of those columns are still preserved as you can see them.

862
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:39.500
The original columns views clearly of the temple of Jupiter and of the mausoleum

863
00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.360
of Diocletian on the other side,

864
00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:46.500
arcuate and lintel here inside a complete pediment.

865
00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:51.620
So that scheme also used as the major decoration of the Paris style in the

866
00:54:52.231 --> 00:54:53.730
palace of Diocletian.

867
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:57.600
Here's the view of what the small temple of Jupiter looks like.

868
00:54:57.601 --> 00:55:00.030
We're looking at it originally had a statute of Jupiter.

869
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:05.130
Now it has a statue of Saint John the baptist,
but you can see the shape,

870
00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:09.300
uh,
very much like the Korea,
uh,
a boxlike shape.

871
00:55:09.301 --> 00:55:12.720
Very simple in this case,
not with a flat coffered ceiling,

872
00:55:12.721 --> 00:55:17.070
but with a barrel vaulted coffered ceiling.
But again,
very simple,
very geometric.

873
00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:20.490
And we can see that that barrel vault is exposed on the exterior.

874
00:55:20.491 --> 00:55:23.520
We can see the shape of the barrel vault from the outside,

875
00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:25.710
as well as from the inside here.

876
00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:29.250
A view of the octagonal tomb,

877
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:33.120
the plan of that tomb,
and octagon with colonnade around it.

878
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:38.220
Columns on the inside radiating rectangular and curve niches,
but a porch.

879
00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:40.770
The whole idea of the porch,
not unlike the Pantheon,

880
00:55:40.771 --> 00:55:45.030
except that it's octagonal instead of round porch on the front.
Deep Porch,

881
00:55:45.031 --> 00:55:49.030
freestanding columns,
facade orientation,
single staircase.
Uh,

882
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:53.160
so this is this,
this very similar to things that we've seen earlier.

883
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:58.290
And two quick views at one,
uh,
engraving of what the,
um,

884
00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:01.110
the,
uh,
Moza Liam,
the octagonal muscle,

885
00:56:01.111 --> 00:56:05.280
Liam would have looked like a with its,
you can see it's faced with stone,

886
00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:08.850
with its entrance way facade and staircase.

887
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:13.080
And here you can see it as very well preserved still today in,
um,

888
00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:17.640
in Split where you see the surrounding columns,
you can see,
uh,

889
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:22.390
the octagonal shape and the stonework all still very well preserved as,

890
00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.220
as the interior,

891
00:56:24.221 --> 00:56:29.221
very ornate with columns projecting from the wall supporting these projecting

892
00:56:30.311 --> 00:56:34.870
and tablatures deeply drilled,
d materialized in the baroque manner,
uh,

893
00:56:34.871 --> 00:56:36.700
with lots of sculptural decoration,

894
00:56:36.701 --> 00:56:41.701
representations of victory and death and a victory over in hunting and uh,

895
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:46.840
and uh,
victory in war.
And consequently,
you know,
this close association is,

896
00:56:46.841 --> 00:56:51.841
we've seen among all of those and then scenes of both with a portrait of

897
00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:57.640
Diocletian and a portrait of his wife Prisca.
Uh,
both of those being carried in.

898
00:56:57.641 --> 00:57:01.630
These reads up to the heavens by flying cupid's.

899
00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:02.981
Here's another view,

900
00:57:02.981 --> 00:57:05.740
perhaps a better one that just gives you some of the sense of the,

901
00:57:05.741 --> 00:57:08.320
of the over decoration over ornamentation,

902
00:57:08.321 --> 00:57:12.160
the baroque effects of the interior of the tomb.
So very,

903
00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:15.280
very different feel to the temple of Jupiter.

904
00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:17.980
A then to the tomb of Diocletian himself.
Here,

905
00:57:17.981 --> 00:57:22.630
he has gone all out and commissioned the most ornate possible,
uh,

906
00:57:22.631 --> 00:57:23.800
decoration.
Uh,

907
00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:28.570
with all the baroque effects that we've described in two tiers for the interior

908
00:57:28.571 --> 00:57:29.770
of his mausoleum.

909
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:36.130
I want to show you a succession of other palaces each fairly quickly.

910
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:40.180
Uh,
other palaces that were built during this period that may have been,
well,

911
00:57:40.181 --> 00:57:41.860
we in some cases we know for sure,

912
00:57:41.861 --> 00:57:46.150
but in other cases we're not sure whether they were in fact palaces for the

913
00:57:46.151 --> 00:57:49.240
tetrarch cause this is the one that's the least certain,
uh,

914
00:57:49.241 --> 00:57:53.770
it's a palace in the western part of the empire that we believe may have been

915
00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:59.020
the palace of Maximilian Augustus in the West.
And in fact,
I should,
I should.

916
00:57:59.080 --> 00:57:59.440
Yeah.

917
00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:02.920
So let's look at that first and that dates as you can see from your monument

918
00:58:02.921 --> 00:58:05.830
list to sometime in the early fourth century.
Aidy.

919
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:10.990
Now if you look at the plan of this quickly,
uh,
you will see that it is very,

920
00:58:10.991 --> 00:58:15.991
very different and feel from an implant from the palace of Diocletian at split.

921
00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:20.770
This may have something to do with the personality of Maximilian or whoever the

922
00:58:20.771 --> 00:58:22.180
commissioner was a,

923
00:58:22.181 --> 00:58:25.000
but it may also have to do with the fact that this is not on the sea,

924
00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:28.150
but in a remote town in south central Sicily,

925
00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:32.770
which was much less likely to be under attack.
Uh,
then the,
uh,

926
00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:37.120
the palace,
uh,
at a split,
uh,
in fact,
as you look at this,

927
00:58:37.121 --> 00:58:40.520
you must be reminded,
I'm sure,
uh,
of the,
uh,

928
00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:42.370
villa of Hadrian actively.

929
00:58:42.371 --> 00:58:47.371
It is very similar to that with a series of sprawling villa with a series of

930
00:58:47.921 --> 00:58:51.160
very interestingly shaped room spread across the terrain,

931
00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:56.110
interacting with nature adjust as they did at Hadrian's villa at Tivoli,

932
00:58:56.350 --> 00:58:59.230
very much a countryside villa.
And I think Hadrian's villa,

933
00:58:59.231 --> 00:59:03.910
clearly the main model as we walk through this accident metric view,
you see,

934
00:59:03.911 --> 00:59:06.730
we enter on the western end.
At one,

935
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.920
we see a horse shoe shaped,

936
00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:12.190
a vestibule with columns all around this villa,

937
00:59:12.191 --> 00:59:16.300
just like Hadrian's villa activity does have a lot of columns.
Uh,

938
00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:17.440
we see those here.

939
00:59:17.441 --> 00:59:22.220
Then you make an abrupt right into this passage way here at uh,

940
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:27.110
two,
a then into the peristyle court with columns all the way around a,

941
00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:31.070
a,
a pool in the center and interestingly shaped pool in the center and then a

942
00:59:31.071 --> 00:59:34.430
series of living spaces,
uh,
to either side.

943
00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:39.500
On the A to c we see a,
uh,
a transverse,
uh,

944
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.860
Carter,
uh,

945
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:44.780
which is very important because it links of various parts of the villa to one

946
00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:47.570
another,
but it is always also very decorated with mosaics,

947
00:59:47.571 --> 00:59:51.430
many of which you are preserved.
And I'll show you those in a moment.
Two D,
uh,

948
00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:55.340
with its niche at the end,
probably a kind of audience hall,
uh,

949
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:59.810
three is where the private compartment is for the emperor and you can see that

950
00:59:59.811 --> 01:00:04.070
that too is fronted by a small horseshoe shaped area.

951
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:08.000
Then over here at four we see a try lobe dining room,

952
01:00:08.001 --> 01:00:12.560
the main dining room of the house with the triple lobes and then down below a

953
01:00:12.561 --> 01:00:14.990
four court for that that is oval in shape.

954
01:00:14.991 --> 01:00:19.030
So it's a very interestingly shaped rooms,
uh,
and uh,

955
01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:23.600
where we see a combination of the interest in curvilinear shapes just as in

956
01:00:23.601 --> 01:00:28.250
Hadrian's villa and in the use of columnar architecture references to classical

957
01:00:28.251 --> 01:00:28.880
Greece.

958
01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:33.740
Over here at five we see several rooms very interestingly shaped again,

959
01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:36.950
uh,
that make up the bath is a private baths,
uh,

960
01:00:36.951 --> 01:00:41.420
of this particular place when can visit.
It's still today.

961
01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.130
Parts of it are very well preserved.

962
01:00:43.131 --> 01:00:48.110
We're clearly looking at the peristyle court with the pool in the center of it

963
01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:52.490
right here.
Uh,
and again,
it is particularly well known for its mosaics.

964
01:00:52.491 --> 01:00:55.610
We see a long card are here with those mosaics.

965
01:00:55.611 --> 01:00:57.920
They depict primarily scenes of hunting.

966
01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:00.610
And I show you a couple of those scenes here.
Uh,

967
01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.190
and there's been some speculation if this was not Maximilian's that it may have

968
01:01:04.191 --> 01:01:05.870
belonged to somebody who,

969
01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:09.970
like those individuals who had the hunting bears that left us Modna were,
uh,

970
01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:12.440
were whose work it was to collect,

971
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:17.090
to collect wild animals from Africa.
Africa is very close to Sicily,

972
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:21.440
collect them from Africa and send them to supply them to amphitheaters around

973
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.550
the world.
Uh,
but,
uh,
the,

974
01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:30.140
even though most of these scenes are hunting scenes,
the most famous mosaics,
uh,

975
01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:32.530
from the palace,
uh,

976
01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.170
of Maximilian so-called at Piatsa,

977
01:01:36.171 --> 01:01:39.590
our marina in Sicily are the so called Bikini girls.

978
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:42.140
And I show you the bikini girls right here.

979
01:01:42.141 --> 01:01:45.980
And there's nothing like this mosaic anywhere else in Roman art,

980
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:48.140
but you can see why they're called the bikini girls.

981
01:01:48.141 --> 01:01:52.370
And they are involved in all kinds of,
of athletic activities.
Uh,

982
01:01:52.371 --> 01:01:55.770
one of them has received a,
a crown and a,
uh,

983
01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:00.740
a palm branch for her,
for her excellence.
Uh,
this one is twirling.

984
01:02:00.741 --> 01:02:05.000
Who knows what a,
here these two are playing,
uh,
passing,
uh,

985
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:06.223
playing ball.

986
01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:10.310
And over here we see a woman on the left with her five pound weights,
uh,

987
01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:14.750
working out.
So I mean,
this is,
this is probably the closest we get to.
I mean,

988
01:02:14.751 --> 01:02:15.420
when does it,

989
01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:19.010
this is very hard to interpret exactly what this means and what it's all about,

990
01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:23.790
why it's here.
But perhaps we can see it as a kind of women's version,
uh,

991
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.000
to the mosaic that we saw in the baths of Caracalla with the famous athletes of

992
01:02:29.641 --> 01:02:34.240
the day.
I mean,
perhaps these were famous women athletes of the day,
uh,

993
01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:39.040
some of whom were good enough even to be awarded prizes.
But the,
the,
the,
the,

994
01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:42.450
the jury is out on exactly what these were and why they're there,

995
01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:46.170
but they're memorable.
These inimitable bikini girls and very,

996
01:02:46.171 --> 01:02:48.420
very famous along with the Alexander Mosaic,

997
01:02:48.421 --> 01:02:52.860
probably the most famous mosaic surviving from Roman antiquity.

998
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.941
Again,

999
01:02:53.941 --> 01:02:58.470
I want to show you just very briefly to give you an inkling of a couple of more

1000
01:02:58.471 --> 01:02:59.660
palaces.
Uh,

1001
01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:04.350
one of these we know for sure is the palace of Glarus,
uh,

1002
01:03:04.351 --> 01:03:07.680
in,
uh,
the northern and the northern part of Greece.

1003
01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:13.020
The Palace of Glorious,
glorious,
as you'll recall,
uh,
was the,

1004
01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.253
um,

1005
01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:19.370
hilarious was a Caesar in the eastern part of the empire to Diocletian.

1006
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:21.870
And I should mention,

1007
01:03:21.871 --> 01:03:25.620
I think I neglected to mention that Diocletian did by the way,
abdicate,
uh,

1008
01:03:25.621 --> 01:03:30.600
on the 1st of May in 305 had he voluntarily stepped down.

1009
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:35.190
And when he voluntarily stepped down to new,
uh,
to the,
the,

1010
01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:40.220
the Caesars were elevated to Al Gousty and two new Caesars were chosen to new

1011
01:03:41.341 --> 01:03:44.330
Caesars were chosen,
uh,
and uh,
uh,

1012
01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:48.720
Gillary this became an Augustus and he built for himself this extraordinary

1013
01:03:48.721 --> 01:03:53.700
palace in northern Greece at Salonica.
And,
uh,

1014
01:03:53.701 --> 01:03:58.701
we can see from this plan and we have given you the data of it to two 97 to 305,

1015
01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:03.360
and I've given you a plan of it and you should be even the only part of it

1016
01:04:03.361 --> 01:04:03.991
survives.

1017
01:04:03.991 --> 01:04:08.190
You should be immediately reminded of palaces that we've already looked at,

1018
01:04:08.191 --> 01:04:09.720
not just today,
but in the past.

1019
01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.870
Think of diet of admissions palace on the Palatine Hill.

1020
01:04:12.871 --> 01:04:16.110
There's a hippodrome here just as dimensions palace had,

1021
01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:19.590
although dimensions palace,
it was used as you'll recall,
is a sunken garden.

1022
01:04:19.591 --> 01:04:21.570
We're not sure how it was used here,

1023
01:04:21.571 --> 01:04:25.650
but we think may have actually been used as a circus here.
Uh,
other rooms,

1024
01:04:25.651 --> 01:04:30.150
including an octagonal one with alcoves looking sort of like what rubbery is

1025
01:04:30.151 --> 01:04:34.890
designed again for dimensions palace on the Palatine Hill.
But up above,

1026
01:04:34.891 --> 01:04:37.590
we see just as Diocletian's palace and split,

1027
01:04:37.591 --> 01:04:42.300
it includes a tomb goal areas is also provided for himself and his afterlife,

1028
01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:46.890
uh,
by creating a round to a museum very much at the upper most part in this plan

1029
01:04:46.891 --> 01:04:51.240
from Ward Perkins.
And then very interestingly,
just like Diocletian's palace,

1030
01:04:51.241 --> 01:04:56.220
it's split.
You can see two major what looked like major roads,
colonated roads,

1031
01:04:56.221 --> 01:05:00.210
colonated streets that intersect in the second in the center,

1032
01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:04.380
just like Diocletian's palace.
And then in the center of that,

1033
01:05:04.381 --> 01:05:05.370
where they intersect,

1034
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:09.210
there's a foresighted arch that I'm going to show you in a moment that's still

1035
01:05:09.211 --> 01:05:13.290
preserved.
Here's the plan of,
uh,
the,
uh,

1036
01:05:13.291 --> 01:05:17.740
of the tomb of delirious at his villa in this case round,
uh,

1037
01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:22.060
with radiating rectangular alcoves.
Uh,
you see it here.

1038
01:05:22.061 --> 01:05:25.930
It's actually very well preserved.
You as the interior,
uh,
showing again,

1039
01:05:25.931 --> 01:05:29.640
just as we saw at,
uh,
at the,

1040
01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:34.650
in the bowels of the octagonal room and the bads of Diocletian use of windows in

1041
01:05:35.021 --> 01:05:39.670
the second tier,
right at the base of the Dome,
uh,
rather than a,
an oculus.

1042
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:42.160
Uh,
and we see that also very well in planned,

1043
01:05:42.161 --> 01:05:44.950
but there were two sets of them as you can see here.
Uh,

1044
01:05:44.951 --> 01:05:49.900
so they've abandoned the oculus in favor of these windows at the base of the

1045
01:05:49.901 --> 01:05:50.500
dome.

1046
01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:54.430
And then from the outside you can see that here they have used concrete faced

1047
01:05:54.431 --> 01:05:59.290
with brick bore the exterior of the structure which was turned into a church.
Uh,

1048
01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.690
and uh,
you can see,
uh,
some,
uh,
some,
uh,

1049
01:06:02.890 --> 01:06:06.100
mosaics when it from when it was turned into a church and a minaret was also

1050
01:06:06.101 --> 01:06:08.890
added at one other point in time.

1051
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:14.040
Here's a spectacular view of the tomb as it looks today in Salonica.

1052
01:06:14.830 --> 01:06:16.360
Uh,
you can see it here,

1053
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:20.290
the exterior as well as its relationship along what would have been one of those

1054
01:06:20.291 --> 01:06:23.980
colonated streets with the arch,
which is in part preserve the arch,

1055
01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:25.420
the so called arch of hilarious.

1056
01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:30.550
You can also see from this view how similar modern Salonica is to modern Athens.

1057
01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:35.080
Same country,
same world war post,
World War II construction,

1058
01:06:35.290 --> 01:06:37.810
mostly residential houses of spot six,

1059
01:06:37.811 --> 01:06:41.950
seven stories with white and color with balconies.
As you can see,

1060
01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:45.100
here's a view of the art of the,
uh,

1061
01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:48.040
of the relationship of the tomb to the arch.

1062
01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:52.840
These two colonated streets,
uh,
that intersect.
And at that intersection,

1063
01:06:52.841 --> 01:06:54.370
the placement of the arch,

1064
01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:58.420
the arch was four sided so the streets could go underneath it.
Uh,

1065
01:06:58.450 --> 01:07:00.880
but it was also triple bade as you can see here,

1066
01:07:00.881 --> 01:07:05.730
a single central large bay to smaller bays on either side.
And then the peers,

1067
01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:06.090
uh,

1068
01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:11.090
decorated with sculpture that give us a report on the exploits,

1069
01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:15.550
the military exploits of Glarus in the eastern part of the empire.

1070
01:07:15.551 --> 01:07:19.660
These were delirious,
this wars hilarious.
His victories that are depicted here.

1071
01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:24.100
But we do believe that since it was one for all and all for one,
uh,

1072
01:07:24.101 --> 01:07:26.620
that it honored the tetrarchy as a whole as well.

1073
01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:31.330
And that there were niches that were placed somewhere on this arch that would

1074
01:07:31.331 --> 01:07:36.331
have had in them representations portraits of each of the four Tetra marks,

1075
01:07:37.570 --> 01:07:41.500
another view of the arch of delirious at Salonica where you can see it's

1076
01:07:41.501 --> 01:07:46.310
relationship even today to what was once the tomb of [inaudible],
uh,

1077
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:49.280
here.
And,
uh,

1078
01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:54.340
a more detailed view of some of the scenes and how crowded they are with one

1079
01:07:55.390 --> 01:08:00.010
rectangular panel piled one on top of another and decorative motifs in between

1080
01:08:00.011 --> 01:08:01.720
them.
And if we look at a detail,

1081
01:08:01.721 --> 01:08:04.420
we see the usual things that we see on things like this,

1082
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:09.430
the emperor sacrificing the emperor on horseback trampling,
Barbarian Enemies,

1083
01:08:09.570 --> 01:08:09.730
uh,

1084
01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:14.230
the emperor seeded with the other Tetra marks down here and with a host of gods

1085
01:08:14.231 --> 01:08:18.250
and goddesses.
And so again,
an honoring of Hilarious,

1086
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.480
his own personal victories,
a Bot,

1087
01:08:20.481 --> 01:08:25.481
an expansion of those to include a reference also to the tetrarchy as a whole.

1088
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:30.770
We're going to be talking next time about,
uh,
two men in particular,

1089
01:08:30.771 --> 01:08:35.540
a man by the name of Maxentius and Constantine,
the great concentrating,

1090
01:08:35.541 --> 01:08:38.990
the greatest I've already mentioned was the son of Constantia is Cloris.

1091
01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:41.410
Max Sanchez was the son of Maximilian.

1092
01:08:41.540 --> 01:08:46.010
So we see the generations continue and the sons of the tetrarchy also want to be

1093
01:08:46.011 --> 01:08:48.740
ted trucks themselves,
if not so ruler.

1094
01:08:48.741 --> 01:08:53.000
And we'll see Maxentius and Constantine do battle against one another in

1095
01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:56.270
Tuesday's lecture.
Uh,
but I just want to mention it.

1096
01:08:56.271 --> 01:08:58.970
We'll talk about Max inches in some detail next time,

1097
01:08:58.971 --> 01:09:01.460
especially his construction or hitting the beginning,

1098
01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:05.540
his beginning construction on a great basilica in Rome that Constantine

1099
01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:10.340
eventually finish the so called basilica of Maxentius Constantine or the

1100
01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:13.160
Basilica Nova.
But I want to mention just in passing today,

1101
01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:18.140
a villa about a villa that Max sent just built in Rome on the,
via Apia in Rome.

1102
01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:18.620
Uh,

1103
01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:22.250
just the round the circle and to show you that some of these palaces were still

1104
01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:25.340
there,
were being built in these,
in these capitals elsewhere in the world.

1105
01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.230
But we're still being built in Rome.

1106
01:09:27.231 --> 01:09:31.320
And we know that [inaudible] has built a villa in the early fourth century idea.

1107
01:09:31.321 --> 01:09:35.210
As I said on the VOP and rum,
there are some remains of it today.

1108
01:09:35.211 --> 01:09:39.530
I show you a general view of those here and a view from the air from word

1109
01:09:39.531 --> 01:09:42.980
Perkins,
I believe,
uh,
that shows you that part of that villa,

1110
01:09:42.981 --> 01:09:46.400
which is still preserved,
was another one of these hippodromes,
this circus.

1111
01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:47.331
And in this case,

1112
01:09:47.331 --> 01:09:51.830
we know that this circus was used as a circus that horse races took place here

1113
01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:55.520
and that was built to hold 15,000 spectators,

1114
01:09:55.521 --> 01:09:59.070
15,000 spectators to come out onto the Bia Apia,
uh,

1115
01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:02.720
to see horse races at Max [inaudible] villa.

1116
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:07.400
We also know that this villa had a tomb that Max just provided for himself and

1117
01:10:07.401 --> 01:10:10.550
perhaps for his family as well,
uh,
inside his villa.

1118
01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:14.420
So we see this same idea that we've seen in the province is being used at Rome

1119
01:10:14.690 --> 01:10:17.300
in Rome concurrently,
a,
uh,

1120
01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:20.480
a tomb that is not all that well preserved,

1121
01:10:20.481 --> 01:10:24.890
but there is enough where we do believe it was a kind of mini Pantheon.

1122
01:10:24.891 --> 01:10:29.891
And I show it to you here in two restored views that give you a sense of what it

1123
01:10:30.051 --> 01:10:32.600
would've looked like.
That it was indeed a mini Pantheon,

1124
01:10:32.601 --> 01:10:36.740
that it was round that had had a traditional porch and the front with columns

1125
01:10:36.741 --> 01:10:38.990
and pediments,
deep porch,
freestanding columns,

1126
01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:43.460
single staircase facade orientation,
a dome does.
You can see here,

1127
01:10:43.461 --> 01:10:45.560
this one looks like it reconstructs and Oculus,

1128
01:10:45.561 --> 01:10:49.760
although I don't think we're absolutely sure that this structure had an Oculus,

1129
01:10:49.761 --> 01:10:53.180
which seems an unlikely thing to do with a too many way to have a opening in the

1130
01:10:53.181 --> 01:10:57.830
ceiling and rain coming of water coming into that tomb,
but numb.

1131
01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.350
But leaving that particular detail aside,

1132
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:03.920
we believe it was in the form of the Pantheon,

1133
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:07.490
a better preserve to him that I can show you that seems to have been quite like

1134
01:11:07.491 --> 01:11:10.460
it.
Uh,
is this last monument that I'm showing you today.

1135
01:11:10.461 --> 01:11:15.460
The tour day scabby or restored view that from Ward Perkins that,
uh,

1136
01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:20.570
was a tomb that was put up and around a d 300 on one of Rome's other major

1137
01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:25.220
streets.
The via Prajna Stena as I've indicated on the monument list.
Uh,

1138
01:11:25.221 --> 01:11:26.160
and once again,

1139
01:11:26.161 --> 01:11:30.480
we see this whole idea of the mini pantheon bid being used not as a temple to

1140
01:11:30.481 --> 01:11:32.460
all the gods,
but as a tomb,

1141
01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:36.480
as a tomb around structure with a traditional porch on the front,

1142
01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:41.370
rectangular pediment,
uh,
deep porch freestanding columns in that porch,

1143
01:11:41.371 --> 01:11:44.940
single staircase facade emphasis here.
Uh,

1144
01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:49.770
you also see interestingly enough that this one we know did not have an oculus

1145
01:11:49.771 --> 01:11:53.580
and you can see that they have put windows at the base to provide light.

1146
01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:57.180
These are not the usual windows that we've seen that we're RQ waited at the top,

1147
01:11:57.181 --> 01:12:01.590
but rather round windows sort of portholes,
uh,
into,
uh,
the,

1148
01:12:01.591 --> 01:12:03.720
this particular tomb up above.

1149
01:12:03.721 --> 01:12:08.721
You see the plan as in ward Perkins round with radiating alternating curved and

1150
01:12:09.181 --> 01:12:13.230
rectangular alcoves.
There is some controversy about the porch,

1151
01:12:13.231 --> 01:12:14.460
whether it had a regular,

1152
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:19.020
complete rectangular triangular pediment or whether it had an RQ weighted

1153
01:12:19.021 --> 01:12:20.550
Lindell.
We're not sure,
uh,

1154
01:12:20.551 --> 01:12:23.820
various scholars have put forward a one view or the other.

1155
01:12:23.821 --> 01:12:27.990
But the last thought that I want to leave you with is that it's very interesting

1156
01:12:27.991 --> 01:12:32.991
to see these mini pantheons being used as tombs in late antiquity by the

1157
01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:38.220
tetrarchy and by others and if not many pantheons octo octagonal structures that

1158
01:12:38.581 --> 01:12:41.790
also look back to the past.
And I think that's important.

1159
01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:46.590
And it's a nice note to end on because it reminds us that when Diocletian and

1160
01:12:46.591 --> 01:12:51.591
the other tetrarchy come into Rome after the chaos of the third century Aad and

1161
01:12:52.231 --> 01:12:56.610
want to establish stability,
once again,
reestablish stability.
What did they do?

1162
01:12:56.611 --> 01:12:59.460
They look to the past,
they build buildings in the Roman forum,

1163
01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:03.930
but they also look to the great architecture of their earlier counterparts of

1164
01:13:03.931 --> 01:13:04.531
Caesar,

1165
01:13:04.531 --> 01:13:09.270
of the great leaders of the Roman past Caesar Augustus Hadrian.

1166
01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:10.590
They look to them,

1167
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:15.790
they look to their buildings and they use their buildings as models to indicate

1168
01:13:15.901 --> 01:13:17.850
that they are in a line of,

1169
01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:21.180
they are in a line from those earlier emperors,

1170
01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:22.890
that they're just as much in control,

1171
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:26.150
that they have brought stability back to Rome.
Uh,

1172
01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:28.800
and also to the empire as a whole,

1173
01:13:28.801 --> 01:13:30.990
which is why we see them building not just in Rome,

1174
01:13:31.230 --> 01:13:36.230
but also around the empire as they govern from the fringes as well as they

1175
01:13:36.241 --> 01:13:40.560
govern,
govern from the city of Rome.
Thank you all.
Have a good day.
