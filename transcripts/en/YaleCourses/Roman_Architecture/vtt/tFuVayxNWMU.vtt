1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.060
Good morning everyone.
We are on the cusp of Valentine's Day.

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.600
So I thought it was appropriate for us all to tell Rome how much we love Roma

3
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.620
Roma,
how much we love her.
Uh,
and so I've done that here.

4
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:21.360
I've loved Rome for as long as you know,
for,
for a long time,

5
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:24.330
certainly from the age that you are now.
Uh,

6
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:27.570
and I know that there are many of you in this class who feel the same way and I

7
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:30.930
hope that those of you who entered this class without having those strong

8
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.140
feelings for Rome have come to love the city and its civilization as much as I

9
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:41.250
do.
So this is the kind of Valentine lecture for Rome.

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.190
And I think that the particular topic that it is,

11
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:49.191
is appropriate in the sense that we are going to be looking at a number of quite

12
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.460
eclectic monuments today.
Very different monuments,

13
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:56.550
one from the next,
and they're full of surprises.

14
00:00:56.551 --> 00:01:00.450
And Rome is always full of surprises.
Roma city of course,

15
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:05.451
that you see layers upon layer of civilization that when peels back to get us

16
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:06.990
back to antiquity.

17
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:10.650
But along the way experiences some amazing things.

18
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.800
So I think that this particular lecture,
which we'll talk about,

19
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:16.200
the varied nature of Roman architecture,

20
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:21.201
especially architecture commissioned by individual patrons to preserve their

21
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:25.350
memory for posterity again,
is particularly appropriate.

22
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.740
I've called today's lecture accessing afterlife tombs of Roman aristocrats,

23
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.680
Freedman and slaves.

24
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.210
We spoke on Tuesday about a public architecture commissioned by the Emperor

25
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:47.571
Augustus public architecture that we noted was made primarily out of marble out

26
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.610
of Luna or Carrara marble that was quarried on the northwest coast of Italy

27
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:56.664
itself.

28
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.790
And the objective of it being a to try to conjure up a,

29
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.040
the relationship between the new golden age of Augustus and the Golden Age fifth

30
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:11.830
century BC of Pericles and Athens.
Uh,

31
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.910
just as Julius Caesar had tried to create a kind of Alexandria on the Tiber,

32
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.580
we see Augustus trying to recreate a,

33
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.770
an Athens on the Tiber.

34
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.010
And Augustus was of course very much in his objectives,

35
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:30.090
was very much in keeping with other objectives that we've been studying for some

36
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:33.720
time.
This Hellenization of Roman architecture,
uh,

37
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.780
that we have addressed on a number of occasions.

38
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.700
We spoke last time about the forum of Augustus in Rome,
uh,

39
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.190
featuring the temple of Marzel tour.

40
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.660
That temple that Augustus vowed he would bill he would build if he could be

41
00:02:48.661 --> 00:02:52.230
victorious over the assassination of Julius Caesar.

42
00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:56.400
That is Cassius and Brutus.
He was so,
uh,
at the battle of Philippi.

43
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.660
And he built this forum and he built temple again as it's centerpiece.

44
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.430
And you'll recall again that it was made for the most part out of Carrara

45
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:10.580
marble.
Uh,
we see the columns of Corolla here,
a wall,
uh,

46
00:03:10.581 --> 00:03:13.690
the 17 Carrara marble steps and so on.

47
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.440
We also talked about the Arra pockets.
Our goose die,

48
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.710
the altar of Augustan peace put up to the diplomatic of the diplomatic,

49
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.520
uh,

50
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.520
agreements are treaties that Augustus made a with those in Spain and gall,

51
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.050
uh,
a monument that was put up,
uh,
near his earlier mausoleum,

52
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.670
a monument that was also made out of Carrara marble.
And in fact,
uh,

53
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.730
solid Carrara marble and this monument to had a precedence in the Greek period.

54
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:47.890
It looked back to a number of sources,

55
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.810
but one of those is we noted on Tuesday was the altar of the 12 gods or the

56
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:56.110
altar of pity,
uh,
a fifth century BC,

57
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.360
a monument that was located in the marketplace of ancient Greece.

58
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:02.320
So again,

59
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.000
both of these buildings looking back to Greek prototypes in their general format

60
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.100
and also of course in the material out of which they were made,
namely marble.

61
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.520
When we talked about the Arra Pacas,
uh,

62
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:20.110
we talked about the fact that it eventually ended up being part of a kind of

63
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:25.111
architectural complex that while this architectural complex may have not been

64
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:26.590
planned from the start,

65
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.750
it grew up over time into something where all of the buildings related to one

66
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:33.430
another in interesting ways,

67
00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:38.200
both in terms of their content and also in terms of their architectural design.

68
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.390
The complex,
uh,
included the mausoleum of Augustus,

69
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:45.040
the tomb of the emperor Augustus,

70
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:49.960
which was the first monument built on this site.
And eventually the Arra pockets,

71
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:54.250
which you'll recall,
was actually not located originally where it is now.

72
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:57.610
It was located in an area a bit here to the upper right.

73
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.910
Originally on the via Flaminia that Augustus took when he returned to Rome from

74
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:04.460
Spain and gall.
Uh,

75
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.370
but that it was moved or the remains of it were moved over to this location next

76
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:13.510
to the Tiber by Mussolini because as we noted last time,

77
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.800
in the meantime,

78
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.010
a palace had been built on top of the original location of the our pockets and

79
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:24.700
that area was no longer available for use,
but again,

80
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.110
the mausoleum of Augustus,

81
00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:31.111
the first building of this complex you see in this aerial view from Google

82
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.190
Earth,
uh,
that the,
uh,

83
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.220
mausoleum ended up becoming the centerpiece of the Piatsa Boosto imperatore that

84
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:44.221
Piatsa that Mussolini's architects designed to commemorate Augustus and also to

85
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:50.170
commemorate a Mussolini because that inscription I showed you last time is

86
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.990
inserted into the building over here.

87
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.890
If we look at this aerial view of the mausoleum of Augustus,
uh,

88
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:02.030
which you'll see from your monument list was begun in 28 BC.
And in fact,

89
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:05.210
that should ring some bells for you.
And we should say something about,

90
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:10.211
it's about its genesis in 28 BC because you'll recall that important date of 31

91
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:16.331
31 the battle of Actium when Augustus was a victorious over Antony and Cleopatra

92
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:22.301
and became sole emperor or began his march to becoming sole emperor of the Roman

93
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:23.900
world.

94
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.670
It's interesting to see him building this massive mausoleum only three years

95
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.350
after the battle of APP APP Actium.
That's really quite striking.

96
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.810
Why did he do that?
Uh,
well,

97
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:39.260
the reason that he seems to have done that is despite the fact that he lived

98
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:40.910
until 76 years old,

99
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:45.911
which was very old and ancient Roman times as I mentioned last time,

100
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.190
uh,
despite the fact that he lived to that ripe old age,

101
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:52.310
he was not in terribly good health even as a young man.

102
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.350
And he was very concerned about his own longevity.
How long was he going to live?

103
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.240
He knew he had accomplished a lot already by this victory over Antony and

104
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:04.820
Cleopatra and by some of his other military victories.

105
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.370
But he wasn't actually sure how long he was going to last.

106
00:07:07.371 --> 00:07:11.270
And so he begins to build this gigantic,
a tomb,

107
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.350
a eventually to hold his own remains,

108
00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.940
and he completes that tomb in five years.

109
00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:20.570
It's built between 28 BC and 23 BC.

110
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.990
And you'll recall the date of the Yarra Park.
This is considerably later,

111
00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:26.740
13 to nine BC.
So the are apoc.

112
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.410
This was only added to this complex later.
And at that point,

113
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:33.530
the whole thing was orchestrated with the addition of the obelisk.

114
00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:37.430
And we talked about the obelisk cast a shadow on,
uh,
on the Arra,

115
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.910
Pakistan Augustus,
his birthday,
and so on and so forth.

116
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.340
With regard to the tomb itself,

117
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:45.590
we're going to see something quite striking today,

118
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:50.591
and that is that the tomb is architecturally very different from the Arra pocket

119
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:55.790
sell,
goose die,
and indeed from the forum of Augustus.

120
00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:01.030
And it's a good example of the eccentricity as will characterize today of Roman

121
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:03.050
to marketecture in general.

122
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.910
Keep in mind that Roman to market texture is the most personal of any form of

123
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:08.900
Roman architecture,

124
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:13.430
which makes it particularly interesting to study because the only practical

125
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:17.120
requirement for a tomb was that it be able to hold,
uh,

126
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.910
the remains of the deceased.
That's all it needed to do.

127
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:23.420
Whereas other buildings not to do all kinds of other things have running water

128
00:08:23.421 --> 00:08:27.630
through them and so on and so forth.
But that was not the case here so that the,

129
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:32.630
the patron and the architects could come together to create buildings that were

130
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.430
unique to that individual.
And again,
uh,
we're,

131
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:41.210
we're eccentric to a certain degree and that is indeed what we will see.

132
00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:45.140
And that is the case also in the mausoleum of Augustus.

133
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.400
As we look down on the mausoleum of Augustus in this aerial view,

134
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.580
we see,
uh,
the general plan of it.

135
00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:57.420
We see that there was a central burial chamber,
that there was a hollow drum.

136
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.560
And around that hollow drum in all of this is made of concrete construction

137
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.880
around that hollowed drum,
a series of concentric rings,

138
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.170
a series of concentric rings as you can see them here,
again,

139
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.760
made out of concrete.
And then the outer wall,

140
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.070
which you can also see in this view,

141
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.240
the outer wall was faced with travertine,
which is also interesting,

142
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:24.630
not Luna marble travertine blocks.

143
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.990
And let me show you a,
another,
uh,

144
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:32.910
somewhat closer view also from Google Earth,
uh,
to show you the structure.

145
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.090
So again,
the central burial chamber,
the Hollow Drum,

146
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.400
the concentric rings around that,

147
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.180
the travertine wall around that.
Uh,

148
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.460
but of course you're looking essentially at the core.

149
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:48.510
This is not what the original,
uh,
entire monument looked like.

150
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.170
And what it was was in fact there was a,

151
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:57.171
an earthen tumultuous or an earthen mound that was placed on top of these

152
00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:00.160
concentric rings.
Uh,

153
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:05.190
and then at the very apex of that earthen mound was a gleaming bronze statue of

154
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.410
the emperor Augustus himself.
I think I can make this clearer,

155
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.240
but from sh by showing you a plan of the mausoleum of Augustus.

156
00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:17.910
And we see all the features I've already described,

157
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.340
the central burial chamber,

158
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.470
the hollow drum get all made out of concrete construction and the concentric

159
00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:26.820
rings around that.

160
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.660
And then the cross section at the top is particularly helpful I think,

161
00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:35.280
because you can see the way in which the concrete has been built up by means

162
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:40.310
obviously of annular volts of the annular volts and ultimately support the

163
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.100
gleaming bronze statue of Augustus at the apex.

164
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.230
And you can also see in this cross section,
the earth and mound,

165
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.240
the way in which the earthen mound is piled up on top of that substructure,

166
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:57.800
that concrete substructure to create the,
um,
the,

167
00:10:57.801 --> 00:11:02.660
the dome like shape of the mausoleum,
uh,

168
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:06.870
on its own.
Now,
scholars who believe,

169
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:10.140
and we all believe in fact that the,
uh,

170
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.540
that again Augustus was a Phil Helaine,

171
00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:15.270
that he had a particular pension for things Greek.

172
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.330
So you look at something like this and you ask yourselves,
well,

173
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:21.240
what's Greek about this?
I mean,
why didn't he,
when he came,

174
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:25.020
when he came to make the decision about,
uh,
his last resting place,

175
00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:29.970
why did he not want to be,
be,
be,
be laid to rest in the manner of the Greeks?

176
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:33.030
Why doesn't this,
why wasn't this to made in the form,
for example,

177
00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:37.680
of a Greek temple or something like that?
Why did he choose this particular form?

178
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:42.630
So scholars have debated for quite some time whether there are any tombs like

179
00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:47.010
this in Greece,
weather,
a weather or an Asia minor,

180
00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:51.480
whether Alexandra,
what kind of tune was Alexander the great buried in,

181
00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:54.760
for example?
Well,
we don't know exactly for sure.
Uh,

182
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:59.080
but that's one possibility that it might have something to do with Alexander's

183
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:03.490
tomb.
Others because,
uh,
I had a niece came from burning Troy,

184
00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:08.020
others have suggested perhaps,
and that's an Asia minor.
Uh,
perhaps,
uh,
the,

185
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.520
the way the Trojans were buried might have something to do with this selection.

186
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.410
But I think the model is much closer at hand.
I think the model myself,

187
00:12:17.411 --> 00:12:22.411
I believe that the model comes from Italy and it's a very interesting choice on

188
00:12:22.961 --> 00:12:27.580
the part of Augustus because I think what it tells us is that Augustus may have

189
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:32.200
wanted to build public buildings in Rome,
uh,
that conjured up ancient Athens.

190
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.190
But when it came to deciding about he will,
how he wanted to be buried,

191
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:41.050
he wanted to be buried in the manner of his Italian ancestors.

192
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.440
Let me show you what I think is a really important comparison.

193
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:48.580
We're looking on the lefthand side of the screen once again at the mausoleum of

194
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:52.160
Augustus.
As it looks today,
here you see the central entrance way.

195
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.680
You see what remains of the concentric concrete rings.

196
00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.340
You see some of the,
uh,

197
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:05.820
travertine facing for the outer ring of the structure and do see of course that

198
00:13:06.341 --> 00:13:10.180
the upper most part,
namely the earth and mount is no longer there.

199
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:14.880
But if I compare the mausoleum of Augustus to what you see here on the right

200
00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:16.060
hand side of the screen,

201
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:21.300
which is any trust skin tomb and a trust can tomb from the so called,

202
00:13:21.341 --> 00:13:26.050
and I put this on the monument list for you,
the Bondi Tacia cemetery,

203
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:26.561
uh,

204
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:31.090
which is in this at a site called chair Vettery chair Vettery a very important

205
00:13:31.091 --> 00:13:33.270
to trust skin site.
Uh,

206
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.340
and this tomb we believe dates to the sixth,

207
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.590
sixth century BC chair.

208
00:13:39.591 --> 00:13:44.530
Vettery is an extraordinary place to visit now because there is one tomb after

209
00:13:44.531 --> 00:13:48.880
another of this type.
You go into the site and you feel like you've,
you know,

210
00:13:48.881 --> 00:13:53.881
on another planet or some such as you wander among these extremely well

211
00:13:54.371 --> 00:13:57.640
preserved tombs at your veteran.
Sure.
Battery by the way,

212
00:13:57.641 --> 00:14:00.790
is right off the highway between Rome and Florence.

213
00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:05.140
So it's very easy site to get,
get to in very well worthwhile.

214
00:14:05.141 --> 00:14:09.250
There's nothing quite like it anywhere in Italy,
anywhere indeed in the world.

215
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.990
And you see these series and I've just chosen one here to show you.

216
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.080
You see these series of tunes and I think if you look at it,

217
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:20.980
you'll see the similarity of this to the mausoleum of Augustus.

218
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:25.750
These round a trust in tombs have central burial chambers.

219
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:27.970
They have stone,

220
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:32.650
a stone facing around the outermost part of the structure.

221
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.530
And you can see that piled on top of that is an earthen mound.
Uh,

222
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:42.070
and if you expand the size,
the cheer Vettery tomb is much baller.
Actually,

223
00:14:42.071 --> 00:14:46.270
the Individual Chair Vettery tombs are smaller than the mausoleum of Augustus.

224
00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:51.130
The Muslim of Augustus is 290 feet in diameter.
It's very large building.

225
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.090
But if you expand the size of one of these,
what we call to Mulas,

226
00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:59.510
t u m U L U S to Mulas tombs at your Vettery,

227
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:02.960
if you expand the size,
if you plant this with trees,

228
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:07.550
because we know that the mausoleum of Augustus was planted with trees on the

229
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:08.251
earth and mound,

230
00:15:08.251 --> 00:15:11.180
there's been quite a bit of controversy about what kind of trees.

231
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.310
For a long time people said Cypress trees.

232
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:17.630
Now people seem to favor juniper trees,
but whatever trees of some sort,

233
00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:22.460
a decorating that earth and mountain.
So if you acts,
if you enlarge this,

234
00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:24.650
if you put some juniper is on top of it,

235
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:29.030
and if you stick a gleaming bronze statue of Augustus at the apex,

236
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.810
you will have essentially the mausoleum of Augustus.

237
00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:35.030
So I'd like to suggest to you today,
uh,

238
00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:39.650
that the mausoleum of Augustus indicates to us that when it came to his tomb,

239
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:44.570
Augustus wanted to be buried like as Italian ancestors,
like the trust skins.

240
00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:45.131
Uh,

241
00:15:45.131 --> 00:15:50.131
and that is why he chose this particular type of tomb in Rome,

242
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.760
the mausoleum of Augustus.

243
00:15:52.761 --> 00:15:57.440
Like so many other monuments that we'd been looking at this semester survives in

244
00:15:57.441 --> 00:16:02.441
large part because it was reused over the centuries in a wide variety of ways.

245
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:08.030
Uh,
you can see in this engraving that it was used at one point as a garden,

246
00:16:08.031 --> 00:16:12.320
a very nicely manicured garden.
As you can see inside,
uh,

247
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.940
the remains inside those concentric circles.
Very Nice Garden.
Uh,

248
00:16:16.941 --> 00:16:21.941
it was also used as a fortress at one point by the well known Colona family of

249
00:16:22.911 --> 00:16:26.120
Italy.
It was used,
believe it or not,
as a bull ring,

250
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:31.100
a little touch of Spain in the midst of Rome as a bullring.
Uh,
and,

251
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.490
uh,
it was used most recently as a music hall.

252
00:16:34.491 --> 00:16:39.491
It was a music hall before it was turned back into the mausoleum of Augustus.

253
00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:42.710
So again,
this very,

254
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:47.740
very similar saga to this building and its post antique history as to so many

255
00:16:48.321 --> 00:16:50.300
others that we've talked about.

256
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:55.630
Another important point to make about the mausoleum of Augustus is that although

257
00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:59.660
Augustus intended it as his own lab last resting place,

258
00:16:59.661 --> 00:17:04.160
he didn't intend for him to be the only person who was laid to rest there.

259
00:17:04.161 --> 00:17:08.870
He wanted this to serve as a family tomb for him.
His wife,

260
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.320
his well,
it turned out his daughter didn't end up there,

261
00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:15.230
but that may have been the intention originally that she would,

262
00:17:15.231 --> 00:17:18.490
she was discredited because of all the adulterous affairs.

263
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:22.340
She had an Augustus eventually banished her in to BC from Rome,

264
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:23.780
raised her house to the ground,

265
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:27.500
and did not allow her to be buried in the mausoleum of Augustus.

266
00:17:27.501 --> 00:17:31.870
But for his wife,
for his,
uh,
um,
uh,
uh,

267
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.520
nephew and son in law,
Marcellus and others,

268
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:38.270
he wanted to create this family tomb where he,

269
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.360
his family and presumably since his objective was to create a dynasty presumably

270
00:17:43.431 --> 00:17:47.960
where his successors of the dynasty that he founded would also be laid to rest.

271
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:52.530
And there are inscription plaques that have come to light from the mausoleum of

272
00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:53.011
Augustus.

273
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:57.900
And I can show you a couple of them here that do indicate that as exactly was

274
00:17:57.901 --> 00:18:00.570
exactly the case.
We see this plaque over here,

275
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.750
which actually has the name Marcellus inscribed there.

276
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:06.150
This is the Marcellus of the theater of Marcellus,

277
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:09.940
the nephew and son in law of,
uh,
of uh,

278
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.100
Augustus who was laid to rest in this Mozal Liam.
Uh,

279
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:18.670
his sister Sora Octavia,
also laid to rest.
That is Augustus.

280
00:18:18.671 --> 00:18:23.430
His sister Octavia also laid to rest here and it continued to be used as the

281
00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:28.431
burial place again after Augustus to us after Augustus is death and through the

282
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:31.890
so called Julio,
Claudia,
and emperors who will look at next week,

283
00:18:31.891 --> 00:18:34.230
Tiberius and Caligula and Claudius.
Uh,

284
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:39.060
and we see in fact an inscription plaque over here that honors Agra peanut,

285
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.500
the elder Agra peanut,
the elder,
the mother of Colliculi,

286
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.770
the third emperor of Rome.

287
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:47.250
And it was Caligula who laid his mother to rest in this tomb.

288
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.130
So very much a family tomb,
uh,

289
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.950
created by the emperor Augustus.

290
00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:57.090
And I should also mention with regard to burial practice at this time that

291
00:18:57.091 --> 00:19:00.420
everybody was imperial perial individuals.

292
00:19:00.421 --> 00:19:03.540
And those lower on the social pyramid as well,
uh,

293
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.270
were all cremated at this particular time.

294
00:19:06.271 --> 00:19:11.271
So you have to imagine that there were earns for each of these inside the tomb

295
00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:16.010
somewhere as well.
Now,
it may not surprise you to hear that,

296
00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:20.390
that once the emperor chose,
uh,
the form of his tomb,
uh,

297
00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.010
that he set in motion a fashion,
uh,

298
00:19:23.011 --> 00:19:26.790
that just about every aristocrat wanted to follow.
So all of a sudden,

299
00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:31.770
after the construction of the Mazda Liam of Augustus,
again,
between 28 and 23,

300
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:37.010
there is this efflorescence of round tombs in Rome and elsewhere in Italy.

301
00:19:37.621 --> 00:19:40.380
And I want to show you just one example of that.

302
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.520
This is the so called tomb of Cecilia Metalla.

303
00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.830
It dates to 20 BC,

304
00:19:46.831 --> 00:19:51.831
so it began to be put up not too long after Augustus's mausoleum was built.

305
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:56.400
It is located on the famous via Apia in Rome,

306
00:19:56.401 --> 00:19:59.130
the op Ian Way,
uh,
the option way,

307
00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:01.980
which you see this is a Google earth image once again,

308
00:20:01.981 --> 00:20:06.480
where you can see I stretch of the Appian way or the,
uh,

309
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.920
be Apia that is modern asphalt,
although there are remains,

310
00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:13.020
and I'll show you later.
And example of this,

311
00:20:13.021 --> 00:20:18.021
there are remains of the polygonal masonry wall floor pavement that would have

312
00:20:19.441 --> 00:20:19.711
been,

313
00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:24.120
they're initially looking very much like the pavement that we saw in palm pay,

314
00:20:24.121 --> 00:20:28.920
for example.
And you can see the tomb of Cecilia Patella right over here,

315
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.170
like the mausoleum of Augustus.

316
00:20:31.171 --> 00:20:35.850
It was reused in ancient times and there was a fortress and a palace that was

317
00:20:35.851 --> 00:20:36.684
added to it.

318
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:41.500
And you can see also there in a red reddish earth color,
uh,

319
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:46.020
the remains of that fortress and palace.
That was,

320
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:51.080
that abutted the mausoleum of the tomb of Cecilia Patella.

321
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.080
And while this is on the screen,

322
00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:58.081
you can also see that while the tomb was essentially a cylindrical drum

323
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.560
resembling the cylindrical drum of the mausoleum of Augustus,

324
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:07.360
it was placed.
It was given some height by being placed on a podium.

325
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.830
The kind of podium that we saw at the sanctuaries of the podium that we saw at

326
00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:15.280
the Ville of the mysteries to raise it up.
It's not as big as those,

327
00:21:15.281 --> 00:21:16.750
but it's sizable.

328
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:21.100
And it raises this around tomb up a little bit so that it can be more readily

329
00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:24.400
seen as people make their way along the via Apia.

330
00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:28.600
The Mausoleum of Augustus does not have,
uh,
a similar podium.

331
00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:29.710
So that's a unique,

332
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:33.310
a different feature that is added to this particular structure.

333
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:37.000
You can also see there's an inscription on the front and we'll talk about that

334
00:21:37.001 --> 00:21:39.880
in a moment.
And then are crenelations at the top.

335
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.600
There's some dispute about when those crenelations were added,

336
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:45.760
whether they belong to the original tumor,
not,

337
00:21:45.761 --> 00:21:49.570
I think it's highly unlikely that they belong to the original tomb and they may

338
00:21:49.571 --> 00:21:54.540
have been added at the time that this was made into a fortress,
a,

339
00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:56.350
as I've already mentioned,

340
00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.730
this is a view of the tomb of Cecilia Patella as it looks today,

341
00:22:00.731 --> 00:22:05.440
this tomb of this woman,
uh,
and 20 BC.

342
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.880
And you can see that it's actually quite well preserved and we can get a very

343
00:22:09.881 --> 00:22:12.040
good sense of its original appearance.

344
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:17.310
You can see the concrete podium down here without its original facing.

345
00:22:17.441 --> 00:22:18.670
It was surely faced.

346
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:23.860
You can see the great cylindrical drum of the tomb of Cecilia [inaudible] and

347
00:22:23.861 --> 00:22:27.880
you can see the facing and once again,
the facing for this tomb,

348
00:22:27.881 --> 00:22:32.020
just as in the mausoleum of Augustus is not Luna or Carrara marble.

349
00:22:32.021 --> 00:22:34.600
It is travertine,
but very,

350
00:22:34.601 --> 00:22:38.500
very nicely cut travertine blocks as you can see here.

351
00:22:38.501 --> 00:22:40.120
Very well done.
Uh,

352
00:22:40.121 --> 00:22:44.950
she was undoubtedly a well to do patron who was able to hire the best
architects,

353
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.600
the best artisans,

354
00:22:46.601 --> 00:22:51.130
and they have done an outstanding job of cutting that travertine.

355
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.440
Uh,
you can see also the,

356
00:22:53.441 --> 00:22:58.441
that there is a freeze a bit that encircles the monument at the upper most part,

357
00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.110
uh,
right here.
And that frees,

358
00:23:02.111 --> 00:23:07.111
depicts garlands and skulls of Bulls Bu Cranio the same sort of thing that we

359
00:23:07.631 --> 00:23:12.631
saw on the inner precinct wall of the RF pacas although this predates the Arra

360
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:15.670
pacas.
So we can't say that was the influence of the [inaudible] pockets.

361
00:23:15.671 --> 00:23:20.020
This is again 20,
whereas the,
our pockets wasn't begun until 13,

362
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:23.660
and it shows us that this motif was very much in the air,
uh,

363
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.210
during the Augustan period.

364
00:23:25.211 --> 00:23:28.900
This motif of garlands hanging from [inaudible],

365
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.660
which of course makes reference to sacrifice.

366
00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:36.060
And it could be a sacrifice in honor of a funerary,
uh,

367
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.970
a s a event as well as anything else.

368
00:23:39.971 --> 00:23:41.800
And we again see that very well here.

369
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:47.010
One very interesting fact is that freeze is not made out of trapper team,

370
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:52.910
but out of pentelic marble,
p,
e,
n,
t,
e,
l,
I,

371
00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:57.650
C pentelic marble is marble from Mt.

372
00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.180
Penn Telecon in Greece.

373
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:04.500
So it tells us that marble was imported from Greece or marble that was important

374
00:24:04.641 --> 00:24:05.181
from Greece,

375
00:24:05.181 --> 00:24:10.181
was purchased and used for the freeze of this particular structure.

376
00:24:10.311 --> 00:24:13.190
And we'll see that it was used also for the inscription plaque.

377
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.630
So it tells us something,
it tells us that there was,

378
00:24:17.631 --> 00:24:22.631
that some patrons made the decision to spend a little more for the material for

379
00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:27.770
what they considered the most important part of the monument.
So in this case,

380
00:24:27.771 --> 00:24:31.340
the most important part of the monument was the freeze,
uh,

381
00:24:31.341 --> 00:24:36.140
and also the inscription plaque that preserved this woman's name for posterity.

382
00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:38.530
So,
uh,
they paid a little bit more,
uh,

383
00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:42.470
in order to get that more expensive material for that critical,

384
00:24:42.471 --> 00:24:46.160
those critical details of the monument.
Here's the inscription.

385
00:24:46.161 --> 00:24:48.680
We're very fortunate that it's still preserved today.

386
00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:53.600
We see it still inserted into the monument.
Again,
it's done in pentelic marble.

387
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.350
And I think you can see even in this view,
uh,

388
00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.820
the difference between pentelic marble and uh,
and,
um,

389
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.100
travertine,
travertine,
travertine has more texture to it.
Uh,
then the,
uh,

390
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:11.000
the planer a marble,
as you can see,
a,
and her name is given here,

391
00:25:11.001 --> 00:25:12.650
Cecelia Metalla,

392
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:17.360
Cecilia Metalla and Cecilia metalla down here.

393
00:25:17.361 --> 00:25:22.361
And it tells us that she was the daughter f Phelia Flia,

394
00:25:24.351 --> 00:25:29.340
the daughter of Quintess Queue Kritikos credit,
cus c,

395
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:34.220
r e t,
I c u s who may have come from Crete.
It's possible,

396
00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:35.710
uh,
and uh,

397
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:40.310
it also makes reference to the fact that she was married to someone by the name

398
00:25:40.311 --> 00:25:44.540
of Crassus.
This may be crass as the elder,
we're not absolutely sure,

399
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:48.110
but what it does indicate to us is this is an aristocratic woman.

400
00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:51.980
This is an aristocratic woman whose family has a great deal of money,

401
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:56.840
who are honoring her with this tomb in the mode of the day,

402
00:25:56.841 --> 00:25:59.720
which of course was,
uh,
the,
uh,
the,

403
00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:03.230
the tomb type that was chosen by Augustus himself.

404
00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:06.260
You may have noticed up here in this same detail,

405
00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:10.250
not only the freeze that we've already described with the garlands and Bu

406
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.630
Cranium,
but that there is a relief here that represents a Roman trophy.

407
00:26:14.631 --> 00:26:17.840
What is a Roman trophy?
A Roman trophy.
Uh,

408
00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:21.140
what the Romans did at the end of battle if they were victorious,

409
00:26:21.141 --> 00:26:26.060
is they went over to the nearest tree trunk on the battlefield and they took

410
00:26:26.061 --> 00:26:27.350
arms and armor from there,

411
00:26:27.351 --> 00:26:32.351
defeated enemy and they tacked that on arms and armor up on that tree trunk to

412
00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:37.040
create a military trophy commemorating their victory,

413
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.280
right on the battlefield.
And that's exactly what you see here.

414
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:45.510
A tree trunk with a breastplate,
a helmet and shields and so on,

415
00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.960
all tacked up,
uh,
to that trophy.
So we have to ask ourselves,

416
00:26:48.961 --> 00:26:52.170
what does that trophy doing on this particular monument?

417
00:26:52.171 --> 00:26:56.970
It's highly unlikely that it refers to it.
There are,
there are some instances,

418
00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:01.050
um,
well we do do here about women trying to raise troops,

419
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.170
raise money for troops and so on and so forth.
But we don't,
and,

420
00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:09.000
and even thinking that they might go into battle,
but for the most part,

421
00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:11.920
Roman women did not participate in battle.

422
00:27:11.921 --> 00:27:15.790
So it is highly unlikely that this refers to a military,
uh,

423
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.880
and and counter that she had,
uh,

424
00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.260
more likely at either refers to a military encounter of her father or her

425
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:26.970
husband,
or it may be a more generic reference to victory.

426
00:27:26.971 --> 00:27:30.900
We've talked about the fact that in the minds of the Romans,
the victory,
oh,

427
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.560
victory in battle,
victory and hunt and hunt,
uh,

428
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.410
often were conflated with victory over death.

429
00:27:37.411 --> 00:27:39.660
So it could be a more generic reference,

430
00:27:39.661 --> 00:27:44.250
but I would guess it may have something to do more specifically with the

431
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:49.470
conquest of her husband or her father.
The,

432
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:53.430
uh,
structure today,
uh,
is um,
uh,

433
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:57.660
is right just right there out on the via Apia easy to see.
Uh,

434
00:27:57.661 --> 00:28:02.140
there is a small museum that isn't all that often open,
but sometimes it is a,

435
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.330
that is in the remains of the fortress and the palace next door.

436
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.390
You can see that the outside of the monument,

437
00:28:09.391 --> 00:28:11.910
they've inserted a lot of fines just from the,

438
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.790
didn't doesn't mean they came from the tomb of Cecilia Martella,

439
00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:19.510
but from this area on the Vop,
there were tons of Roman tombs out here,
uh,

440
00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:21.690
and all of this paraphernalia that you see,

441
00:28:21.691 --> 00:28:25.710
statuary and fragments of freezes and cornices and so on,

442
00:28:25.711 --> 00:28:28.710
all come in part possibly from this monument,

443
00:28:28.711 --> 00:28:31.740
but more likely from the other tombs in the area.

444
00:28:31.741 --> 00:28:34.860
Those have been inserted into the wall and kind of interesting way.

445
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.350
And then here's the tea.
The museum itself,

446
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.040
the museum doesn't have the stuff that's in there is pretty much the same sort

447
00:28:41.041 --> 00:28:42.180
of thing that you see here.

448
00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:47.190
But going into the museum is interesting because you can see into the central

449
00:28:47.191 --> 00:28:52.191
chamber of the Tomb of Cecilia Patella and see the concrete construction and so

450
00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:54.594
on.

451
00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:00.960
I mentioned already that Roman tombs could be very eccentric indeed.

452
00:29:00.961 --> 00:29:05.961
And I want to show you one of the two most eccentric tombs in my opinion,

453
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:11.720
uh,
from ancient Rome that one can see in the city of Rome today.
Uh,

454
00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:16.730
and the first of these is the so called tomb of Cassius because we believe,

455
00:29:17.611 --> 00:29:22.340
in fact,
we're absolutely sure that it honors a man by the name of Gaius Gai,

456
00:29:22.341 --> 00:29:25.650
U s Castias Csti u s guy is [inaudible].

457
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:30.890
It was put up in 15 BC that is in the age of the emperor Augustus in this Google

458
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:37.110
Earth Ariel view.
We see what that structure looks like today.
It is the,

459
00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:41.980
it is a Roman tomb in the form of an Egyptian pyramid.

460
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.520
Uh,

461
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.840
it's the only Roman tomb in the form of an Egyptian pyramid that we can see in

462
00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:51.100
Rome today.
But we know there were others in antique antiquity.
We have,

463
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:52.530
we have,
um,

464
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:56.620
reports that tell us that certain others that existed at a certain time were

465
00:29:56.621 --> 00:30:01.470
torn down at one point.
That was one,
for example,
not far from where the,

466
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.320
the Vatican that was torn down at one point because it got in the way of the

467
00:30:05.321 --> 00:30:09.670
street.
Uh,
but so this is not unique in the sense of the only one,

468
00:30:09.671 --> 00:30:12.280
although it is the only one still surviving today.

469
00:30:12.281 --> 00:30:15.670
We have no idea how many of these there were.
There was certainly some weather,

470
00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:18.520
there were a lot.
We can't,
we can't be absolutely certain,

471
00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:22.060
but here it is a Roman tomb in the form of a pyramid.
Now,

472
00:30:22.061 --> 00:30:27.010
when it was first put up,
it was put up outside the Serbian walls of the city.

473
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.060
Uh,
because all as we've talked about the fact that by Roman law,

474
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:36.220
the necropolis or city of the dead needed to be located outside the walls of the

475
00:30:36.221 --> 00:30:40.840
city.
But as the city grew and as there was a need for a new wall,

476
00:30:40.841 --> 00:30:43.240
and this happened,
uh,
in the third century,

477
00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:46.440
a d and we'll talk about it way at the end of the semester,
uh,

478
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:50.980
the Romans ended up building a new wall.
This is the famous and really in walls.

479
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:55.700
And the circuit happened to be planned for this particular Depasse,

480
00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:00.620
this particular point where the tomb of Cassius was.
And fortunately,
uh,

481
00:31:00.621 --> 00:31:05.380
they recognize the aesthetic and historical value of this tomb and decided not

482
00:31:05.381 --> 00:31:09.660
to tear it down,
but rather to incorporate it into the wall.

483
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:14.130
So what you see in this aerial view are two of the walls of the two.
Uh,

484
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:18.850
parts of the are really and walls of butting and in fact incorporating the,
uh,

485
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:23.680
the pyramid of Cassius.
But in antiquity,
it,
when it was first built,
excuse me,

486
00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:24.610
it stood alone.

487
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:29.470
And what you see over here is a gateway that also belongs to the later a

488
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.400
religion walls.
So again,
fortunately the,

489
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:36.430
this particular tomb was preserved.

490
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:41.820
These two engravings are helpful in showing us that the inner core of the tomb

491
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:47.791
of Cassius was concrete and the outer pyramidal shape was faced once again with

492
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:50.830
travertine.
So travertine,

493
00:31:50.831 --> 00:31:55.270
clearly the material of choice by aristocrats cause we're going to see the

494
00:31:55.271 --> 00:32:00.010
Cassius was also an Aristocrat for their tombs in the age of Augustus,

495
00:32:00.011 --> 00:32:03.520
concrete core,
travertine facing.

496
00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:06.400
And then if you look at this cutaway view over here,

497
00:32:06.401 --> 00:32:11.230
you will see that the burial chamber inside was very,
very,
very small,

498
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:15.400
very,
very,
very small.
So it's small enough that it's,
uh,

499
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:18.520
that was not a lot of space for these burials.

500
00:32:18.521 --> 00:32:23.521
But we'll see that we still believe that this too was a family to

501
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:31.410
the burial chamber has had and still has remnants of a painted walls.

502
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:37.870
And I show you an engraving here of those walls that was made when they were in

503
00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.720
somewhat better shape than they are today.
And I wondered if any of you,

504
00:32:41.721 --> 00:32:46.490
you're such a experts now on first to forestall Roman wall painting.

505
00:32:46.491 --> 00:32:47.870
If any of you could tell me,

506
00:32:47.871 --> 00:32:51.520
I'm sure all of you could tell me what style painting,
uh,

507
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:56.590
is being used in the burial chamber of the Tomb of Cassius Kristin.

508
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.900
Third style.
Why third style

509
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:05.120
<v 1>logical features
column,</v>

510
00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:10.710
<v 0>very thin candelabra here and mythological figures.</v>

511
00:33:10.711 --> 00:33:11.190
How would the,

512
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:15.450
how would those use that make that show that this is a typical third style wall.

513
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.233
<v 1>They have a black gun,</v>

514
00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:21.260
<v 0>that's the word floating.</v>

515
00:33:21.261 --> 00:33:26.000
They are floating in this random space right in the center of the panels as we

516
00:33:26.001 --> 00:33:29.810
know was characteristic of third style Roman wall painting.

517
00:33:29.811 --> 00:33:32.420
So 15 BC,
third cell,
Roman wall painting.

518
00:33:32.421 --> 00:33:36.860
And if you think back to some of the palace is that we looked at the palace is a

519
00:33:36.861 --> 00:33:39.350
villas that we looked at and their dates.

520
00:33:39.351 --> 00:33:42.090
Think of bus go Trey Causei for example,
11 BC.

521
00:33:42.091 --> 00:33:44.400
You see this as roughly contemporary,
uh,

522
00:33:44.401 --> 00:33:48.350
to what's happening in Campania at this particular time.

523
00:33:48.351 --> 00:33:52.550
And here are two details,
uh,
of the remains of those paintings.

524
00:33:52.551 --> 00:33:55.640
And you can see one of these floating mythological figures.

525
00:33:55.641 --> 00:34:00.230
It looks like a victory figure,
female wing it carrying a wreath over here,

526
00:34:00.231 --> 00:34:03.980
flying in the center of the panel.
This also shows you to,
in this case,

527
00:34:03.981 --> 00:34:07.520
the panels were white,
a very similar to the walls,
for example,

528
00:34:07.521 --> 00:34:10.250
of the third style.
And the Dome is our area in Rome.

529
00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:14.990
And then here this candle labrum,
uh,
very attenuated,
very delicate,

530
00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.610
uh,
that,
that,
uh,

531
00:34:16.611 --> 00:34:21.440
is used in place of columns decker at both of these motifs decorating the flat

532
00:34:21.441 --> 00:34:22.274
wall.
Ah,

533
00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:26.780
that was so characteristic of third style Roman wall painting.

534
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.660
Here's another view of the pyramid.
As it looks today,

535
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:32.360
you can see it is exceedingly well preserved,

536
00:34:32.361 --> 00:34:36.320
one of the best preserved of all Roman tombs.
Uh,
it,

537
00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:41.060
you can see again the way in which the later wall was built into it.

538
00:34:41.061 --> 00:34:46.061
And you can also see the travertine blocks and how carefully carved they were by

539
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:50.420
the designers,
by the artisans.
And here,

540
00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:55.160
this is very helpful because it shows you that the,

541
00:34:55.161 --> 00:34:58.520
at least one,
but I can tell you the two sides of the tomb,

542
00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:03.410
the eastern and western sides of the tomb had in the center of the pyramid,

543
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.580
the name of Cassius.
That's how we know it was his too.
You see it here.

544
00:35:07.581 --> 00:35:11.310
Gaius Cassius.
And it also includes all of his title.

545
00:35:11.311 --> 00:35:16.311
So he was very happy to advertise his titles on this monument,

546
00:35:16.581 --> 00:35:21.170
which the purpose of which of course was for those who mourn,
Tim,

547
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.600
to feel proud of him and his achievements.

548
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:26.660
But even more important than that from his point of view,

549
00:35:26.661 --> 00:35:31.070
I am sure I'm from the point of view of the Romans in general,
was that these,

550
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:34.460
that his name and his deeds be preserved for posterity.

551
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:39.240
So that some day in 2009,
we're sitting in this classroom,
uh,
looking at this,

552
00:35:39.241 --> 00:35:43.770
we think back on Castias his title,
what he did,
what he achieved,

553
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:47.160
uh,
and uh,
the way in which he was memorialized.

554
00:35:47.161 --> 00:35:51.480
So this whole idea of preserving memory,
uh,
not only in your own time,

555
00:35:51.481 --> 00:35:56.040
but into the far flung future,
this tomb,
as I said,

556
00:35:56.041 --> 00:35:58.440
despite the fact that the burial chamber is small,

557
00:35:58.441 --> 00:36:00.270
we do believe it was a family tomb.

558
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:05.270
We have evidence for that because two bases were found or that seemed to belong

559
00:36:05.491 --> 00:36:10.260
to this tune back as Cassius,
his name or members of his family Castillo.

560
00:36:10.261 --> 00:36:13.230
So you can see there are named in these inscriptions.
Uh,

561
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:18.290
these have a markings on the top that suggest to us that statue stood on them at

562
00:36:18.601 --> 00:36:20.530
one point.
So these were statue basis,

563
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:25.550
probably pray placed right in front of the entrance to the pyramidal tomb.

564
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:29.250
And if you cast your eyes over this inscription,

565
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.160
you will not only see the name Cassius a few times,

566
00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:37.460
but you will see another very important name.
And that is m.
Dot.
AGRIPPA.

567
00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:42.440
That's Marcus Agrippa.
That's the Marcus Agrippa,
uh,
the long time,

568
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:44.800
uh,
the boyhood friend and long time,

569
00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:50.160
a close confidant and one time a air and son in law of Augustus.

570
00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.420
Uh,
all of those things he's mentioned here.
So it is,

571
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:58.290
he is a member also of this family.
So it demonstrates to us,
again,

572
00:36:58.291 --> 00:37:00.510
we are dealing with an aristocratic family.

573
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:04.260
So all of those tunes I've shown you thus far,
the mausoleum of Augustus,

574
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:09.470
the tomb of Cecilia Patella and the tomb of Gaius Cassius are all examples of

575
00:37:09.541 --> 00:37:14.040
aristocratic to market texture in the age of Augustus.

576
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:19.310
Why did he choose to choose a pyramid for his tomb is a very interesting

577
00:37:19.831 --> 00:37:22.650
question to ask and I would suggest here,

578
00:37:22.651 --> 00:37:25.470
and it's not rocket science to figure this out at all.

579
00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:27.090
I would suggest here though,

580
00:37:27.091 --> 00:37:30.480
that the reason has to do with Augustus is very important.

581
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:35.430
Victory over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the battle of Actium in 31.

582
00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.610
Uh,
it was at that time and even before that,

583
00:37:38.611 --> 00:37:41.730
an interest in things that Jim [inaudible],
uh,
came into Rome.

584
00:37:41.731 --> 00:37:46.560
We saw that Augustus himself made reference to his victory over,
uh,
over,

585
00:37:46.561 --> 00:37:48.320
um,
over the,

586
00:37:48.321 --> 00:37:53.321
that pair over Cleopatra and Mark Antony in the complex with the,

587
00:37:53.341 --> 00:37:58.341
our pacas and the mausoleum of Augustus by inserting that obelisk in the center.

588
00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:02.430
And Obelisk that I've mentioned to you was actually brought from Egypt itself.

589
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:07.500
So these references to Egypt initially under Augustus himself had political

590
00:38:07.501 --> 00:38:09.990
import.
It was there to show that Augustus had been,

591
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:15.030
that obelisk was there to show that Augustus had prevailed over Mark Antony and

592
00:38:15.031 --> 00:38:17.400
Cleopatra.
And because he had prevailed,
he could,

593
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.840
he could steal obelisks from Egypt and bring them back to decorate Rome as

594
00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:25.980
trophies essentially.
So that was a political statement on his part,

595
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:30.600
but as time went on,
a Egyptian Romania became a kind of fashion statement.

596
00:38:30.601 --> 00:38:32.490
I think that it caught on.

597
00:38:32.491 --> 00:38:37.491
It caught on after Egypt was made a Roman and 30 BC right after Actium.

598
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:42.280
And we begin to see this wave of things Egyptian,
uh,
spreading through Rome.

599
00:38:42.281 --> 00:38:46.180
And it's likely that Castiel perhaps a combination of both since he's from a

600
00:38:46.181 --> 00:38:50.210
grip as family,
uh,
this combination of political reference.
Uh,

601
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:53.530
but also just this was,
this was an interesting,

602
00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.530
this was the style at this particular point,
uh,

603
00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:58.780
to do things in the Egyptian manner.

604
00:38:58.781 --> 00:39:02.920
You might remember some of those Egyptianize motifs that we saw,
for example,

605
00:39:02.921 --> 00:39:07.140
from the black room at Bosco,
Trey Causei,
which was also a real,

606
00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.990
a villa that was closely connected with the imperial family.

607
00:39:10.991 --> 00:39:15.120
Remember grip a posthumous who was,
uh,
the son of a gripper himself,
uh,

608
00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:20.140
born by Julie via his wife Julia.
After a grip is death,
hence his name.

609
00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:26.520
Another view of the back of the Mosque of the pyramid of Castias,

610
00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:30.940
the mausoleum of Cassius,
which again shows us how well preserved it is.

611
00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.770
You can see the real you and walls.

612
00:39:32.771 --> 00:39:35.020
You can see the gate that we looked at before.

613
00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:40.180
And you can also see that the back is actually in a modern cemetery.

614
00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:45.430
This is the so called Protestant cemetery.
And if you are in Rome and half time,

615
00:39:45.431 --> 00:39:48.250
this is one of the most interesting places to visit.

616
00:39:48.251 --> 00:39:51.250
It's again a bit off the beaten track that many tourists go there.

617
00:39:51.251 --> 00:39:53.880
But those that do are rewarded because it's,
um,

618
00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.900
it's a cemetery where many ex patriots,
uh,

619
00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:02.770
were buried.
People who flocked to Rome because they loved it.
Authors,

620
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:06.940
a scholars,
poets,
painters,
came to Rome,

621
00:40:06.941 --> 00:40:09.070
ended up spending the rest of their lives.

622
00:40:09.071 --> 00:40:11.170
They're coming from all different countries around the world,

623
00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:12.640
spending the rest of their lives.

624
00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:16.720
They're dying there and eventually being buried in the so called Protestant

625
00:40:16.721 --> 00:40:20.170
cemetery.
Uh,
Percy Vishy Shelly,
for example,

626
00:40:20.171 --> 00:40:22.840
is buried there as is John Keats.

627
00:40:22.841 --> 00:40:25.300
And the Keats tomb is my Keats marker,

628
00:40:25.301 --> 00:40:28.120
is my favorite by far in the cemetery.

629
00:40:28.121 --> 00:40:32.650
You can see his tombstone here,
uh,
which doesn't even give his name.

630
00:40:32.651 --> 00:40:36.190
It just identifies them.
And you'll remember he died very,
very young and his 20,

631
00:40:36.191 --> 00:40:38.170
early twenties,
I think it was a,

632
00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:42.070
you see him here referred to only as the young English poet.

633
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:47.110
And down below it says here lies one whose name was rich in water.

634
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:52.210
It's an amazing,
uh,
stone.
It does show the liar,
which makes reference of course,

635
00:40:52.211 --> 00:40:57.211
to the fluency and so on of his [inaudible] lift Louis poetry and overhear a

636
00:40:59.471 --> 00:41:01.720
companion of his Joseph Severn,

637
00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:05.920
who doesn't hesitate to mention his relationship to John Keats.

638
00:41:05.921 --> 00:41:09.220
So you see Keats's name in Severns tunes,
don't,
uh,

639
00:41:09.221 --> 00:41:11.110
but not in key to zone him.
So,

640
00:41:11.111 --> 00:41:15.150
but I showed this to you just because it's one of those more fascinating,
uh,

641
00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:18.010
places in Rome and many of the tombs,
by the way,

642
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:22.940
are there many tombstones here that clearly are based on ancient Roman a

643
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:26.140
prototype?
So it's a fascinating place to wander.
And by the way,

644
00:41:26.141 --> 00:41:29.650
you can do that in our own Grove Street cemetery where there are a number of

645
00:41:29.651 --> 00:41:32.860
tombs that are done very much in the Roman style.

646
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:39.440
If you think the Mazda,
the tomb of Cassius is unusual,
uh,

647
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:44.210
the weirdest tomb by far in Rome from ancient Rome is the one that I turned to

648
00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:48.410
now.
And this is the tomb of the baker,
your Rissa keys,
the tomb of the baker,

649
00:41:48.411 --> 00:41:53.150
your risk,
the keys that was put up in Rome in the late first century BC.
Uh,

650
00:41:53.151 --> 00:41:53.990
and,
uh,

651
00:41:53.991 --> 00:41:57.560
that again is another tumor in the age of August from the age of Augustus.

652
00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:00.760
But in this case,
we believe,
although that the inscription doesn't,

653
00:42:00.761 --> 00:42:03.410
it doesn't tell us this for sure,
uh,

654
00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:07.130
but we believe it is highly likely that your recipes for is from a different

655
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:11.790
level of Roman society,
not an Aristocrat,
uh,
about a working man,
uh,

656
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:16.400
who may,
who probably either he himself or his realm or his family,

657
00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:20.240
uh,
were slaves originally.
Eventually freed.
Uh,

658
00:42:20.241 --> 00:42:24.750
he takes up the profession of bread making a and he ends up,
uh,
and,

659
00:42:24.751 --> 00:42:28.910
and building this extraordinary tomb that I'm going to show you in some detail

660
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:32.300
in Rome.
As we look at this particular view,

661
00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:36.290
we see the tomb of your recipes as it looks today.
It's right over here.

662
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:41.060
We see it is,
it is,
it has behind it a great travertine gate,

663
00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:44.810
which is actually later in data dates to the time of the emperor Claudius.

664
00:42:44.811 --> 00:42:46.250
We'll talk about it next week.

665
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:50.260
So you'll have to think that a way for the moment that was not standing,
uh,

666
00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:54.530
when the tomb of your risky keys was put up.
A,
you can also see,
however,

667
00:42:54.531 --> 00:42:56.510
that this gate was placed in a,

668
00:42:56.511 --> 00:43:01.511
an aqueduct system that aqueduct was begun during the time of Augustus.

669
00:43:01.671 --> 00:43:05.930
So you can imagine that at least some of that aqueduct system stood at the time

670
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:10.280
that this tomb was built.
The tomb,
as you can see here,

671
00:43:10.281 --> 00:43:15.080
it was a three story structure,
very eccentric and its appearance.
You,

672
00:43:15.081 --> 00:43:18.890
the bar,
the ground line today is much lower than the modern ground lines.

673
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:20.330
So you'd have to go right up to the monument.

674
00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:22.490
You can look down at the first story.

675
00:43:22.491 --> 00:43:26.270
So you're only seeing a part of the first story here.
Uh,

676
00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:29.540
you can see that it is made of two full blocks.

677
00:43:29.541 --> 00:43:32.510
You can also see the interior is concrete,

678
00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:37.490
the core of the structure is concrete.
And then on the second and third stories,

679
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:41.930
uh,
it,
it,
the tomb is faced with travertine.
So travertine,
again,

680
00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:45.920
a use for tune facing in the age of Augustus.
Uh,

681
00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:50.510
and we see this very unusual design where there are these great,

682
00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:56.250
these great,
uh,
you know,
uh,
I couldn't,
not peers,
um,

683
00:43:57.150 --> 00:44:01.940
uh,
cylinders,
great cylinders,
great cylinders that are placed here vertically,

684
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:05.900
and then cylinders placed in the next tier,
horizontally,

685
00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:10.280
vertically placed in cylinders.
They're not columns.
You don't see any capitals.

686
00:44:10.281 --> 00:44:13.410
They're very fat.
Uh,
so they are cylinders,
uh,

687
00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:17.450
vertically and then horizontally.
And some scholars have suggested,

688
00:44:17.451 --> 00:44:18.860
and I think quite convincingly,

689
00:44:18.861 --> 00:44:23.040
that these may actually make reference to what we're grain measure.

690
00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:27.950
Grain measures were these cylindrical structures in silos in a sense in which

691
00:44:27.951 --> 00:44:31.430
they stored grain in ancient Roman times.
Uh,

692
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:34.710
so that is very possible since we know that this man was a baker,
uh,

693
00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:38.940
that this may make reference to these grain storage cylinders,
uh,

694
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:41.730
that were used in the process of baking

695
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:48.130
with regard to the siting of the tomb.
This is particularly interesting.
Uh,

696
00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:51.600
I show you,
uh,
this plan over here,
uh,

697
00:44:51.601 --> 00:44:55.560
which indicates to us here you can actually see the plan of the tomb of your

698
00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:58.680
recipes,
and you can see that it is very unusual in shape.

699
00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:03.420
It is trap a Zodol in shape.
Why is it trap as oil and shape?
Uh,

700
00:45:03.421 --> 00:45:08.421
it probably is dropped the soil in shape because the tomb was located on a piece

701
00:45:08.701 --> 00:45:13.470
of property that was between two major roads of this,
of the,

702
00:45:13.471 --> 00:45:18.090
of Rome,
uh,
that exited and entered the city at this particular point,

703
00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:21.940
the so called via lobby Connor and the via Prajna Stena.

704
00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:25.010
So two major Roman roads,
uh,

705
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:28.600
that come into the city at this point.
And remember the tomb of your recipes,

706
00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:30.260
like all Roman tombs,
uh,

707
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:33.720
during this period where it was outside the Serbian walls.

708
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:37.620
So build outside the walls,
but between these two,
two,
uh,

709
00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:41.310
two streets,
now this model over here,

710
00:45:41.311 --> 00:45:45.540
which by the way comes from a museum in Rome that again is off the beaten track,

711
00:45:45.541 --> 00:45:50.430
but I can highly recommend the Museo achievable Tar Romana,
uh,

712
00:45:50.431 --> 00:45:55.431
which is in a building built by muscle Leni in the 1930s for a world's fair.

713
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:57.100
And the buildings and it,

714
00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:01.410
it and other buildings like it out there in a place part of Rome that we call a

715
00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:04.830
ar from expos,
Espositos Yonei universe,

716
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.920
Salai the Roma a you are a or a that whole area built up by Mussolini for the

717
00:46:11.191 --> 00:46:11.701
world's fair.

718
00:46:11.701 --> 00:46:14.970
But the buildings were so substantial that they decided to keep them and they

719
00:46:14.971 --> 00:46:19.260
still stand.
And this museum was placed in,
um,
in,
in,
in one of them.

720
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:24.030
It is a museum of casts where you can go and see works of Roman art and

721
00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:28.560
architecture from not only Rome but from around the world all in one place.

722
00:46:28.561 --> 00:46:31.330
Now they're not originals,
they're cast,
but it's a great big,

723
00:46:31.331 --> 00:46:34.350
great place to study for the exam,
for this course,
for example,

724
00:46:34.351 --> 00:46:37.800
because you could walk around and see so many of the buildings that we've talked

725
00:46:37.801 --> 00:46:40.290
about and there are these wonderful models of many of them.

726
00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:43.890
And we see here a model of this aqueduct,
the later,

727
00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:47.060
a little later gate here and the tomb of your recipes.

728
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:50.490
And this shows you very well the way in which these two streets,

729
00:46:50.491 --> 00:46:55.080
the lobby ICANA and the prime minister came into Rome at this point converge

730
00:46:55.410 --> 00:47:00.330
exactly on the facade of this too.
Uh,
and this,

731
00:47:00.331 --> 00:47:03.600
this is clearly,
I mean,
it is clear that your recipes,

732
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:05.280
and I'll tell you how he did this in a moment,

733
00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:09.510
had enough money that he was able to buy what was certainly one of the most

734
00:47:09.511 --> 00:47:13.830
choice pieces of real estate outside the walls of Rome.
Uh,

735
00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:18.630
one in which everyone who came into Rome from either of those two thoroughfares

736
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:21.140
would see the facade of this to.

737
00:47:21.141 --> 00:47:24.630
And this is a man who wanted to be remembered for posterity.

738
00:47:24.631 --> 00:47:29.631
It's another example of how tombs were used for the purposes retaining memory

739
00:47:30.281 --> 00:47:34.990
over time.
This is also interesting because it shows what happened,

740
00:47:34.991 --> 00:47:36.550
what you see with the dotted lines.

741
00:47:36.551 --> 00:47:41.140
Here is one of these later gates that was made for the [inaudible] walls.

742
00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:42.730
Uh,
and in this case,

743
00:47:42.731 --> 00:47:46.390
the tomb of your recipes was right smack dab in the middle of where they wanted

744
00:47:46.391 --> 00:47:50.200
to build a outcropping of this wall.

745
00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:54.700
In this case,
they decided that they were not going to build the wall into it,

746
00:47:54.701 --> 00:47:58.840
but that they were going to build the wall on top of it.
But fortunately,
again,

747
00:47:58.841 --> 00:48:01.930
they did not destroy,
they did not destroy it completely.

748
00:48:01.931 --> 00:48:06.730
They did shear off the front of the tomb,
which actually took away the facade,

749
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.990
but they allowed the debris to fall into the tower,
uh,

750
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.300
s and then they covered it up.
So when,
when,

751
00:48:13.301 --> 00:48:18.301
so when this tower was eventually torn down to free the tomb of your Rissa keys,

752
00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:22.180
they found the fourth wall and the debris from that wall,

753
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:26.260
including a portrait statute and description inside,
uh,
the debris,

754
00:48:26.261 --> 00:48:30.610
which was extremely fortunate and which allows us to reconstruct the monument.

755
00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:34.480
Here you see the,
uh,
the model,
the model in the,
uh,

756
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:38.890
in this AOR museum that shows you what the two of them looked like in antiquity.

757
00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:41.740
You see the three levels,
the three tiers,

758
00:48:41.741 --> 00:48:44.580
you see the entrance to the burial chamber here.
Uh,

759
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:46.870
and this is the facade that we're looking at.

760
00:48:46.871 --> 00:48:50.550
This is the part that no longer survives.
This is the fourth wall or the facade.

761
00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:51.750
Now gone.
Uh,

762
00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:56.740
but we can again reconstructed from those remains and you see them here and you

763
00:48:56.741 --> 00:49:01.330
see it was relatively plain on three tiers except for a portrait statue of your

764
00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:04.720
recipes and his wife an inscription down below.

765
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.450
And you need to think a way the frees up there,

766
00:49:07.451 --> 00:49:10.930
because the freeze was probably not on this side of the monument,

767
00:49:10.931 --> 00:49:13.900
although there was a freeze around the other three sides.

768
00:49:13.901 --> 00:49:18.610
You can see one of those sides here and I'll show that freeze to you
momentarily.

769
00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:20.560
This is a view of the tomb again,

770
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:24.800
where we can see so well those cylinders on two stories.
Uh,

771
00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:27.610
and you can also see here that in the uh,

772
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:31.390
area between the vertical and the horizontal cylinders,

773
00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:33.370
on three sides of the monument,

774
00:49:33.371 --> 00:49:36.490
there is an inscription and it repeats over and over again.

775
00:49:36.491 --> 00:49:41.200
And it tells us that this monument was put up by your Rissa keys.

776
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:44.180
Marcus Virgo alias Uris,
the keys,
uh,

777
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:48.310
who was peace store and redemptive for pis,

778
00:49:48.311 --> 00:49:53.311
t o r r e d e m p t o r p store and redemptor.

779
00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:59.230
That means master Baker and contractor.

780
00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:04.000
The contractor is a very,
the most important part,
master Baker and contractor.

781
00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:09.001
We know this is a man who made bread and sold it to the Roman armies.

782
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:14.590
This was a pretty lucrative thing to do in the age of Augustus when there was so

783
00:50:14.591 --> 00:50:16.360
much military conquest,

784
00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:20.290
he made a fortune selling bread to the Roman armies.

785
00:50:20.291 --> 00:50:24.370
And it is with that fortune that he was able to buy this choice piece of real

786
00:50:24.371 --> 00:50:29.371
estate and to put up this extraordinary monument in the late first century BC,

787
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:35.000
the portrait reliefs still survives.
It's in the Capitol and museums today.

788
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:39.380
You see it here.
It had fallen in again to the debris from the fourth side,

789
00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:44.060
but here it is with your Rissa keys,
a standing next to his wife [inaudible].

790
00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:46.190
We know her name and I'll tell you how in a moment,

791
00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:48.650
artists in that portrait relief,

792
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:50.840
and we're not going to go into this in any detail,

793
00:50:50.841 --> 00:50:55.520
but if you compare it to the figures of Augustus and his family from the our

794
00:50:55.521 --> 00:50:56.300
pockets,

795
00:50:56.300 --> 00:51:00.660
I think you'll agree with me that the are a pockets is serving as a model.
Uh,

796
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:05.510
and that this portrait group is clearly based on a risk Socratic,

797
00:51:05.511 --> 00:51:09.050
even though this is probably a middleclass,
a pair,

798
00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:13.940
a formally from a slave family freed people,
uh,
they are,
uh,

799
00:51:13.941 --> 00:51:18.670
shown here very much as if they are members of the court wearing similar,
uh,

800
00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:22.400
costumes depicted in a similar way with similar hairstyles.

801
00:51:22.401 --> 00:51:24.080
And I point to just one detail.

802
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:27.830
If you look at this view of Livia on the RF pacas Augustus,
his wife,

803
00:51:27.831 --> 00:51:31.940
and you see the wonderful way in which the artist has depicted her hand,

804
00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:35.510
the shape of her hand showing underneath her garment here.

805
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:39.410
The same is done here for a [inaudible].
You can see,

806
00:51:39.411 --> 00:51:43.550
and that's at t I s t I a [inaudible].
You can see her hand.
In fact,

807
00:51:43.551 --> 00:51:47.420
it's even better done here because you can see the shape of the knuckles and so

808
00:51:47.421 --> 00:51:50.480
on.
Underneath the garment,
the,
the,
the,
um,

809
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:53.390
very diaphanous garment that she wears.

810
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:58.390
So clearly a very special portrait artists probably hired to do these portraits,

811
00:51:58.871 --> 00:52:03.020
a portrait artists,
uh,
who,
um,
may have been hired at,

812
00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.560
at great expense and also very significant.

813
00:52:06.561 --> 00:52:11.120
And in keeping with what we saw for the tomb of Cecilia Metalla is the fact that

814
00:52:11.121 --> 00:52:15.370
although the tomb is faced in travertine and the relief around the monument is

815
00:52:15.371 --> 00:52:19.360
in Travertine,
this is done in marble,
uh,
in,

816
00:52:19.361 --> 00:52:24.220
in if I remember correctly,
Greek marble,
uh,
as well.
So important marble,
uh,

817
00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:28.150
that is brought from elsewhere,
uh,
and at greater expense,
uh,

818
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:31.370
is used for the most important portrait relief.

819
00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:34.400
The scenes around the free the scenes,

820
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:38.750
the freeze scenes are particularly interesting because they depict in the

821
00:52:38.751 --> 00:52:43.580
greatest of detail,
uh,
the,
uh,
the profession of the making of bread.

822
00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:48.730
They depict,
uh,
uh,
your risk,
the keys d daily achievement,
uh,

823
00:52:48.731 --> 00:52:51.770
of making bread that he sold to the Roman armies.

824
00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:55.220
I'm going to just show you the scenes very quickly and you can see the style is

825
00:52:55.221 --> 00:52:59.840
very different.
It's a much more journalistic style,
uh,
with figures with that,

826
00:52:59.841 --> 00:53:03.560
with figures that don't have the elegant proportions that we saw on the portrait

827
00:53:03.561 --> 00:53:06.980
relief.
And it is carved on travertine,
not on marble.

828
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:11.510
We see here the grain being ground between two stones.
Uh,

829
00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:16.100
and we see the way in which these,
those,
these,
these men and tunics,

830
00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:17.030
uh,

831
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:22.030
work that we also see that the upper stone is rotated by a mule that is attached

832
00:53:22.341 --> 00:53:26.700
to a wooden handle that comes off the upper a stone there.

833
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:30.900
We have mill stones just like this from Pohnpei and I show you the actual

834
00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:34.970
millstones.
So these depictions on the tomb of your risk,

835
00:53:34.971 --> 00:53:39.660
he's very accurate.
Uh,
in terms of what millstones looked like in antiquity.

836
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:40.381
A number,

837
00:53:40.381 --> 00:53:45.381
another scene here in which we see two men at a table with big gobs of dough

838
00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:50.760
that you can see here,
doe,
uh,
for the bread.
Another scene,

839
00:53:50.761 --> 00:53:54.900
this is one of the more important scenes where we see four men standing behind a

840
00:53:54.901 --> 00:53:59.901
table that are forming that dough into loaves a and overhear a magistrate,

841
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.930
a who has a low,
a short sleeved,

842
00:54:03.931 --> 00:54:06.630
but long garment is supervising them.

843
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:10.410
And the four men are very interestingly rendered because they're rendered almost

844
00:54:10.411 --> 00:54:12.390
exactly the same.
If you look,

845
00:54:12.391 --> 00:54:15.570
if you compare this to the Arra pockets where figures are represented in

846
00:54:15.571 --> 00:54:19.890
different postures,
a lot of variety,
clearly based on Greek prototypes.

847
00:54:19.891 --> 00:54:21.540
Here we see something very different.

848
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:26.190
The major objective of the artist is to get the story across to show these men

849
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:31.230
making these,
uh,
this,
uh,
these loaves.
But look at them.
Each one,

850
00:54:31.231 --> 00:54:33.900
they're bare chested and we'll see why they're bare chest.

851
00:54:33.901 --> 00:54:38.610
It's hot in this part of the,
uh,
of the bakery.
So they've taken off their shirts.

852
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:41.160
There's some attempted to pick their musculature,

853
00:54:41.161 --> 00:54:46.030
but they're essentially shown in exactly the same way,
the same curly hair,
uh,

854
00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:49.230
as almost as if they were cut from a cookie cutter.
Because again,

855
00:54:49.231 --> 00:54:52.110
it's not the form that's of interest to the artists here,

856
00:54:52.111 --> 00:54:54.480
but getting that narrative across and,

857
00:54:54.481 --> 00:54:57.660
and if you try to figure out whose legs belong to who,
believe me,

858
00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:59.340
you'll have a difficult time of it.

859
00:54:59.341 --> 00:55:04.140
So the artist is not as much less a concern with formal things than he is with

860
00:55:04.141 --> 00:55:08.550
getting the story across with regard to why they've taken off their shirts.

861
00:55:08.551 --> 00:55:10.030
They're right near the oven.
Uh,

862
00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:13.710
and I show you this scene that depicts the dome shaped oven,
uh,

863
00:55:13.711 --> 00:55:18.711
in which the loaves are being baked a and you can see that this oven looks very

864
00:55:18.901 --> 00:55:23.130
much like a modern pizza oven and in fact the pole that they use the wooden pole

865
00:55:23.131 --> 00:55:27.210
with the flat,
uh,
and uh,
is just the sort of thing you see at bar or anywhere,

866
00:55:27.211 --> 00:55:32.130
any other major pizza place either in new haven or elsewhere in the world.

867
00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:34.410
And in fact,
these dome shaped ovens are still,

868
00:55:34.411 --> 00:55:38.910
you oozed in rural areas in I took this view and uh,
in Greece,

869
00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:41.990
uh,
in a small rural town and,
uh,

870
00:55:42.090 --> 00:55:45.610
you see these in Italy and some very small towns as well,
still being,

871
00:55:45.611 --> 00:55:47.580
you done in exactly the same way.

872
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.380
There are a number because of the cylinders on the tomb of your recipes.

873
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:55.140
There are some scholars have suggested that the tomb of [inaudible] keys is in

874
00:55:55.141 --> 00:55:56.400
the form of a bakery.

875
00:55:57.450 --> 00:56:00.900
While I do believe that there is reference to those grain,

876
00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:05.790
to those storage bins,
silos that were used for the storage of grain.

877
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.260
I do not think that the tomb of [inaudible] is in the form of an oven.

878
00:56:10.261 --> 00:56:11.700
It makes reference to baking,

879
00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:15.060
but I don't think it's in the form of an oven because this is what Roman ovens

880
00:56:15.061 --> 00:56:19.320
looked like.
They were dome shaped.
Uh,
this has a very different appearance.

881
00:56:19.321 --> 00:56:24.250
As you can see.
Perhaps the most important scene in the freeze is this one.

882
00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:28.690
Uh,
where we see a tool,
we see the lobes have been baked,

883
00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:30.960
they're ready to go to market,
uh,

884
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:34.900
and they're put in these large baskets.
You can see them your,

885
00:56:34.901 --> 00:56:38.620
and then they are weighed in this scale,
this ancient scale.

886
00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:43.860
And I think this is a form of private propaganda on the part of the baker.

887
00:56:43.901 --> 00:56:47.710
You Rissa keys.
What he is telling the public who gaze up on this tomb,

888
00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:52.890
not only in his own day but for posterity is my bread was always not only of

889
00:56:53.471 --> 00:56:57.970
high quality but of the appropriate weight.
I never cheated the public.

890
00:56:57.971 --> 00:57:01.910
I treated you fairly.
I was an honest baker and contractor.

891
00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:06.240
I think that's what the message is here.
And in fact,
uh,

892
00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:08.080
you may think this is a stretch,

893
00:57:08.081 --> 00:57:11.960
but I think that one could easily compare.
Uh,

894
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:16.980
this report that you receive the keys provides of his profession on the freeze

895
00:57:17.381 --> 00:57:22.381
of this tomb as a kind of Baker's version of Augustus is raised guests die.

896
00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:28.620
The list of things accomplished during his life is laid out in narrative form

897
00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:33.340
for not only his contemporaries,
but for posterity.

898
00:57:33.341 --> 00:57:36.340
To see the portrait group again,

899
00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:40.120
and I mentioned that there was an inscription found with that portrait group,

900
00:57:40.121 --> 00:57:41.680
a very interesting inscription,

901
00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:46.360
which tells us that you Rissa keys put up this monument to his wife.

902
00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:50.200
[inaudible] [inaudible]
is bodily remains,

903
00:57:50.201 --> 00:57:55.201
he says are buried in Hoke Panare Mayo in Hoke preneurial in this [inaudible],

904
00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:02.740
what is a panare IOM,
a bread basket,
which is again why scholars have said,
well,

905
00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:05.050
the whole tomb is in the form of an oven,

906
00:58:05.051 --> 00:58:08.770
but I think the breadbasket being referred to here is not the tomb,

907
00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.550
but rather the urn in which artists he,

908
00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:15.940
his remains were placed in the excavation in the 19th century.
When that later,

909
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:21.030
uh,
gateway was removed,
they found one earn one earn,

910
00:58:21.031 --> 00:58:25.770
not two earns,
one earn,
uh,
presumably the urn of [inaudible],
uh,

911
00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:29.560
and that earn,
uh,
was in the form.
It was drawn at that time.

912
00:58:29.561 --> 00:58:31.570
And we can see this view of it here.

913
00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:36.130
I Cross section the lid and the main body of the earn.

914
00:58:36.131 --> 00:58:40.150
And you can see it looks like a bread basket.
Uh,
and I show you,

915
00:58:40.151 --> 00:58:44.050
we have lots of examples of urns in the form of bread baskets and Roman tons is

916
00:58:44.051 --> 00:58:45.780
one in the Metropolitan Museum of art.
You,

917
00:58:45.781 --> 00:58:49.840
if any of you who are going down there anytime soon to look at Roman antiquities

918
00:58:49.841 --> 00:58:51.880
and other things,
you can see one there.

919
00:58:51.881 --> 00:58:54.220
This one is in the national museum in Rome.
Uh,

920
00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:59.310
and women's remains were often placed in bread baskets to accentuate or to speak

921
00:58:59.501 --> 00:59:00.820
to their,
uh,

922
00:59:00.821 --> 00:59:04.990
their domestic virtues that they were good at taking care of the house and

923
00:59:04.991 --> 00:59:08.620
baking bread and so on.
Uh,
but in this particular case,

924
00:59:08.621 --> 00:59:13.420
I think it is much more likely that the reference here is not to her,

925
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:17.800
her two autistic.
He is,
uh,
uh,
cleverness as a housekeeper,

926
00:59:17.801 --> 00:59:21.650
but rather to her husband's profession,
which very,

927
00:59:21.651 --> 00:59:25.880
very interesting in terms of what it tells us about the,
the gender wars of,

928
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:27.230
of antiquity,

929
00:59:27.231 --> 00:59:31.970
that here's a tune that has been put up by this baker with his money that he's

930
00:59:31.971 --> 00:59:36.560
made from his profession in honor of his wife.
But what he depicts,

931
00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:37.423
what he,

932
00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:42.460
what he is preserving for posterity is not the outline of his wife's life,

933
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:45.370
but the outline of his life,
what he has accomplished.

934
00:59:45.371 --> 00:59:48.350
His name is plastered on three sides of the monument.
Uh,

935
00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:50.900
he's got three sides of the monument with the EV,

936
00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:55.910
the successive phases of the baking of bread in all of its aspects.
Yes,

937
00:59:55.911 --> 00:59:58.010
he has a very nice portrait relief of his wife,

938
00:59:58.011 --> 01:00:02.390
but of course he's standing by her side.
I need,
does mention her name down below.

939
01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:06.890
So I'm,
he gives her some do.
But this monument as far as posterity is concerned,

940
01:00:06.891 --> 01:00:11.150
is about,
uh,
your risk,
the keys and not about his wife.
And I think it tells us,

941
01:00:11.151 --> 01:00:15.800
again,
vary a great deal about the motives of this particular individual.

942
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:22.150
I want to say just a very few words about two other tombs out on the via Apia in

943
01:00:22.791 --> 01:00:24.230
Rome,
the RP and way again,

944
01:00:24.231 --> 01:00:27.860
and I show you a view of the Bia Apia as it looks today.
Uh,

945
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:30.650
you can see that although much of the road is modern,

946
01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:34.580
you do find a bits and pieces of ancient ground out there.

947
01:00:34.581 --> 01:00:37.910
You can see some polygonal blocks here and some red marks,
uh,

948
01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.410
from the ancient road.

949
01:00:39.411 --> 01:00:42.770
And you have to be very careful when you drive out there and your chink with

950
01:00:42.771 --> 01:00:44.460
Jane Doe or whatever,
uh,

951
01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.750
two or you bike ride out there as this fellow is doing where you take your

952
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.760
motorbike or whatever,
uh,

953
01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:52.520
because if you're going too quickly and you don't really,
you know,

954
01:00:52.521 --> 01:00:55.640
you don't expect that all of a sudden you hit some ancient road and that makes a

955
01:00:55.641 --> 01:00:59.300
huge difference in terms of your ability to get to move forward.

956
01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:04.620
I want to show you one tune very fleetingly out there,
uh,

957
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:07.640
which is the one that you see over here on the left hand side of the screen.

958
01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.740
There remains of many tombs on the via Apia.

959
01:01:09.741 --> 01:01:13.580
Most of them are just piles of concrete,
but a few of them are better preserved.

960
01:01:13.581 --> 01:01:14.600
And this is one of them.

961
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:20.050
It's a tomb of a Friedman and Friedman and freed women from 13 BC to five.

962
01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:21.740
Uh,

963
01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:26.480
we call it the rebury his tomb because of an inscription on it tells us members

964
01:01:26.481 --> 01:01:28.700
of the [inaudible] family were buried here.

965
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.510
The reason that I show it to you is that the eccentric tombs that I've shown you

966
01:01:32.511 --> 01:01:37.511
today are absolutely marvelous and tell us a lot about the Romans as patrons and

967
01:01:37.521 --> 01:01:41.120
as and their desires,
visa,
the memory.
Uh,
but it is not,

968
01:01:41.121 --> 01:01:43.250
those are not the conventional tomb types.

969
01:01:43.251 --> 01:01:47.210
We see many more of this sort of thing,
which we call a house tomb,

970
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:49.130
a tomb that resembles a house.

971
01:01:49.131 --> 01:01:52.920
Essentially it has a sloping a ceiling and you know,

972
01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:55.030
a main facade.
Uh,

973
01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:58.100
and in that facade there is usually a portrait relief,

974
01:01:58.130 --> 01:02:00.110
either vertical or horizontal.
Uh,

975
01:02:00.111 --> 01:02:04.550
but these horizontal ones represent members of the family.

976
01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:08.410
Some may be deceased,
some may not be deceased.
The messages that,
uh,

977
01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:10.490
even if someone has died before another,

978
01:02:10.491 --> 01:02:14.000
that they will eventually be reunited together in perpetuity.

979
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:15.680
But if you look at this carefully,

980
01:02:15.681 --> 01:02:20.610
you will see that what it looks like is as if these individuals are still alive

981
01:02:20.611 --> 01:02:24.060
and looking out of the window of their tomb,
as,

982
01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:28.860
as if out of the window of a house is very close association in the mind of the

983
01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:33.840
Romans between houses of the living and houses.
Of the dead,
uh,
and,

984
01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:36.480
uh,
that,
that is absolutely the case here.
And you'll remember,

985
01:02:36.481 --> 01:02:39.690
we can trace this all the way back to the eighth century BC.

986
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:43.770
You remember the hut,
the a Villanovan hut earn that I showed you,

987
01:02:43.771 --> 01:02:47.880
and I told you that women's remains were placed in women's cremated remains,

988
01:02:47.881 --> 01:02:52.800
were placed in these huts that resembled Romulus is huts.
Uh,
and uh,

989
01:02:52.801 --> 01:02:57.750
and so this whole idea of a house serving as a tomb goes way back,

990
01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:58.060
uh,

991
01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:03.060
and continues to be a light motif of a Roman two markitecture,

992
01:03:03.330 --> 01:03:07.260
uh,
throughout the entire history of Roman architecture.

993
01:03:07.261 --> 01:03:11.340
And it's something that I hope you'll keep in mind.
Also,
just in passing,

994
01:03:11.341 --> 01:03:12.750
I want to mention we've looked,

995
01:03:12.751 --> 01:03:16.470
the tombs that we've looked at thus far today have been primary.

996
01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:20.700
They'd been of all different social classes from emperor to freed slave,
uh,

997
01:03:20.701 --> 01:03:23.310
but at the same time,
they have all been tombs,

998
01:03:23.311 --> 01:03:27.330
including the raspberries tomb of the well to do a,
if these were freed slaves,

999
01:03:27.331 --> 01:03:30.240
they were ones that made a fortune,
like your receipt keys did,

1000
01:03:30.241 --> 01:03:32.040
selling bread to the Roman army.
Uh,

1001
01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:36.300
and with that fortune we're able to build monumental tombs at great expense.

1002
01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:40.260
But there were lots and lots of people obviously who lived in Rome and palm pay

1003
01:03:40.261 --> 01:03:43.920
and in other cities who could not afford a,
those kinds of tunes.

1004
01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.730
And you might be asking yourself,
where were all of those people buried?
Well,

1005
01:03:47.731 --> 01:03:52.620
they tended to be buried underground,
uh,
in what we call Columbaria,
c o,
l,
U M,

1006
01:03:52.621 --> 01:03:57.600
B a r I a Columbaria,
uh,
underground burial chambers,

1007
01:03:57.810 --> 01:04:01.640
uh,
that were either a burial,
uh,

1008
01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.770
clubs that you could join for a small amount of money.

1009
01:04:04.771 --> 01:04:06.540
You could join one of these clubs,
uh,

1010
01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.990
buy in to your last resting place that way.

1011
01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:14.760
Or they were burial chambers that were created by the very well to do,

1012
01:04:14.761 --> 01:04:17.610
for example,
the Emperor Emperor Augustus in Libya.

1013
01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:21.480
We know they had thousands of slaves,
literally thousands of slaves.

1014
01:04:21.481 --> 01:04:23.910
We have a record of some of Olivia's slave.

1015
01:04:23.911 --> 01:04:27.240
She had slaves not only to tend the garden and that kind of thing,

1016
01:04:27.241 --> 01:04:31.980
but she had a massage.
She had several hairstylist and she even had a slave.

1017
01:04:31.981 --> 01:04:33.420
We know who set her pearls.

1018
01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:37.020
That was her whole job was to set her pearls day in and day out.

1019
01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:41.280
So they had tons and tons of slaves and some of those very well to do,
uh,

1020
01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:46.340
also established these burial areas where their slaves could find a last resting

1021
01:04:46.531 --> 01:04:50.470
place.
And in fact,
the one that I show you here,
the Vignette Codine,
uh,

1022
01:04:50.471 --> 01:04:55.080
is one such that belonged to the Julio to Augusta and Julio,
Claudia and family,

1023
01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:59.190
uh,
and was used for the remains of some of their slaves.

1024
01:04:59.191 --> 01:05:03.060
And you can see that each individual had a little niche and people were
cremated.

1025
01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:06.980
The cremated remains,
I were placed usually in an urn,
uh,

1026
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:09.150
that was placed inside one of these niches.

1027
01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:13.860
And then there would be a small inscription referring to the deceased.

1028
01:05:13.861 --> 01:05:15.330
So this gives you a sense again,

1029
01:05:15.331 --> 01:05:20.331
of those who could not afford individual tombs and how they were buried in the,

1030
01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:23.500
in the fiber or seven minutes that remain.
Uh,

1031
01:05:23.501 --> 01:05:28.501
I'd like to switch gears entirely and look at something very different as a

1032
01:05:29.471 --> 01:05:34.180
prelude to what we'll be talking about next time.
Because next time,
next Tuesday,

1033
01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:38.920
we are going to return once again to innovative Roman architecture,
architecture,

1034
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:41.920
uh,
made,
uh,
concrete,
uh,

1035
01:05:41.921 --> 01:05:44.860
and with a variety of interesting innovations.

1036
01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.200
We'll do that next week as I said,

1037
01:05:47.201 --> 01:05:52.120
and I wanted to give you an introduction to that by turning to this one example

1038
01:05:52.121 --> 01:05:56.650
from the Augustan period that is note worthy enough for us to say something

1039
01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:57.550
about it.

1040
01:05:57.550 --> 01:06:02.550
This is what you're looking at here is the plan of what was,

1041
01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:06.610
uh,
a spa,
essentially an ancient Roman times.

1042
01:06:06.611 --> 01:06:09.900
It's located in Campania at a place called bias.

1043
01:06:09.901 --> 01:06:13.480
So in the vicinity of Pompeii and Herculaneum and [inaudible] and Bosco,

1044
01:06:13.481 --> 01:06:15.310
Trey Cozzie and so on.

1045
01:06:15.311 --> 01:06:19.450
We've already talked about the fact that that was an area that was a mecca for

1046
01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:23.770
the well to do the glitterati from Rome who went down there for their vacations.

1047
01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:28.330
It was a resort area.
Many of them had villas along what is now the Amalfi coast.

1048
01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:32.290
Uh,
others had villas on the island of coppery at,
can't remember if I told you,

1049
01:06:32.291 --> 01:06:34.180
but Augustus and Tiberius,

1050
01:06:34.181 --> 01:06:37.810
his successor owned 12 villas on the island of coppery,

1051
01:06:37.811 --> 01:06:40.900
one of which we'll look at next time.
Uh,
and uh,

1052
01:06:40.901 --> 01:06:44.800
this was an area also where there were sulphur springs and mineral baths.

1053
01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:49.660
And so the natural thing to do for those who are coming here as a resort was to

1054
01:06:49.661 --> 01:06:53.680
create for them a place that they could go to relax and enjoy the thermal

1055
01:06:53.681 --> 01:06:57.730
springs and the sulfur baths and so on and so forth.
And that was this place,

1056
01:06:57.731 --> 01:06:59.950
this spa,
uh,
at bio,

1057
01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:04.980
which consisted of a bunch of thermal structures that were terrorist out over a

1058
01:07:05.141 --> 01:07:05.651
hillside.

1059
01:07:05.651 --> 01:07:10.651
You have to think of the sanctuary or Fortuna Prima Jania at Palestrina a turned

1060
01:07:11.321 --> 01:07:13.930
into a spa because they treated it architecturally,

1061
01:07:13.931 --> 01:07:16.780
it was done in exactly the same way.
They took a hillside,

1062
01:07:16.781 --> 01:07:20.020
they terrorist that hillside,
they poured concrete on that hillside,

1063
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:25.230
creating a whole host of interesting structures in which one could relax and get

1064
01:07:26.471 --> 01:07:27.880
away from it all.
Uh,

1065
01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:31.840
you see a plan of that spot here in the way in which it was terrorist via

1066
01:07:31.841 --> 01:07:34.720
concrete construction over this hillside.

1067
01:07:34.721 --> 01:07:38.350
I am only going to show you one thermal bath,
uh,
from it.

1068
01:07:38.351 --> 01:07:43.150
And it's this one that we see over here.
It is the so called Temple of Mercury.

1069
01:07:43.151 --> 01:07:46.720
That's what the locals have long called.
And it is not a temple of Mercury.

1070
01:07:46.721 --> 01:07:48.520
It is a thermal bath.
Uh,

1071
01:07:48.521 --> 01:07:52.180
but nonetheless we call it that because it's been called that for such a long

1072
01:07:52.181 --> 01:07:56.920
time.
As you look at the plan of the temple of Mercury,
you're going to say to me,

1073
01:07:56.921 --> 01:08:00.340
every one of you will say the same thing.
What's the origin of this?

1074
01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:05.030
Clearly the design is based on the frigging Daria of Pompei,

1075
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.230
the Frigidaire him or the cold room of Pompei.

1076
01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:13.410
This round structure with the radiating alcoves that we saw as part of bath

1077
01:08:13.571 --> 01:08:18.460
architecture very early on,
second century BC and so on in palm pay,

1078
01:08:19.190 --> 01:08:23.660
same scheme.
He was here.
Not Surprising.
This is in Campania.
It's not far away.

1079
01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:28.280
Uh,
I can show you the temple of Mercury is extremely well preserved.

1080
01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:33.230
We can see the dome of the Temple of Mercury made out of concrete construction

1081
01:08:33.231 --> 01:08:36.980
from above.
You can see the Oculus of the,

1082
01:08:36.981 --> 01:08:41.770
just as those for free.
Daria had ocularly,
ocular [inaudible],
uh,

1083
01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:46.070
this one does as well.
And you can see that extremely well here.

1084
01:08:46.071 --> 01:08:50.180
So a concrete building with a concrete dome,
uh,

1085
01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:51.890
used as part of the spa.

1086
01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:56.750
We've traced this desire to make round structures way back,

1087
01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:00.500
uh,
to the six hundreds BC.

1088
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:03.140
The time of Quinto Fiorentino I showed you this,

1089
01:09:03.141 --> 01:09:08.141
a trust can attempt at making a round structure with a dome,

1090
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:12.020
uh,
that,
uh,
that,
uh,
was done in this case in stone.

1091
01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:16.130
And although it was a valiant attempt,
not all that successful,
uh,

1092
01:09:16.131 --> 01:09:21.131
and we talked about the way in which that eventually transformed into the Roman,

1093
01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:24.980
uh,
ability to make the freaky Daria at palm pay.

1094
01:09:25.190 --> 01:09:30.120
And here are two views of the temple of Mercury at via as it looks today.
Uh,

1095
01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:35.030
because of the Oculus,
uh,
there's often rainwater,
the drain,
no longer functions.

1096
01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:39.920
Uh,
so there's often a lot of very,
um,
uh,

1097
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:42.950
on appealing green,
uh,
water that,

1098
01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:46.120
that accumulates in the base of the temple of Mercury.

1099
01:09:46.121 --> 01:09:49.310
So The Times that I've been there,
every time I think I've been there,

1100
01:09:49.311 --> 01:09:52.310
there's been enough water in there that I haven't been able to actually get

1101
01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:53.870
pictures of the alcoves,

1102
01:09:53.871 --> 01:09:58.160
which are covered by these inches and inches of water that are usually collected

1103
01:09:58.190 --> 01:10:01.610
inside the temple of Mercury.
But you get a good sense,

1104
01:10:01.611 --> 01:10:03.140
I think of it here nonetheless,

1105
01:10:03.141 --> 01:10:06.890
that we're talking about around dome structure with an Oculus,

1106
01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:10.820
with some windows,
with a RQ weighted windows,

1107
01:10:10.821 --> 01:10:15.590
windows with our occupations at the top in the upper most part are toward the

1108
01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:20.000
upper most part of the dome to add additional light into the system.

1109
01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.090
And,
uh,
you need to think of these,
by the way,

1110
01:10:23.091 --> 01:10:27.660
as much more ornate and antiquity than they are today.
They would have been,
uh,

1111
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:32.150
stuccoed over,
which you can see and then probably decorated with mosaic.

1112
01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:36.450
So the wonderful effects of the light coming in,
hitting the mosaic.
Uh,

1113
01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:39.320
and then there would have been a pool in the center just as there wasn't the

1114
01:10:39.321 --> 01:10:44.300
frigate Darian around people,
which people could sit,
uh,
you would,

1115
01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.810
uh,
it would have been a quite spectacular space and I just,

1116
01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:51.500
just a few more views to end with today.
Uh,
this one up here,

1117
01:10:51.501 --> 01:10:55.340
which of course is the frigging Darian at palm pay to show you where all of this

1118
01:10:55.341 --> 01:10:56.174
begins.

1119
01:10:56.300 --> 01:11:01.300
These two views are of the temple of Mercury at Baia and this one of course of

1120
01:11:01.671 --> 01:11:03.530
the Pantheon,
which is where we're headed,

1121
01:11:03.710 --> 01:11:07.640
but I think these in particular of the temple of Mercury at Baia,
again,

1122
01:11:07.641 --> 01:11:12.470
give you a sense of the way in which light not only flows into the system.

1123
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:16.320
Again,
imagine on mosaic sealing and mosaic walls,

1124
01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:20.400
spectacular effects the glue,
the way it would have glittered in the light.

1125
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:22.390
But look,
especially at the way the,

1126
01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:25.560
the shape of the shapes that are formed on the water,

1127
01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:30.000
that would have been in the pool down below.
Uh,
it's exactly the same,

1128
01:11:30.001 --> 01:11:34.590
the same sort of sense that you get when you walk into the Pantheon today,

1129
01:11:34.591 --> 01:11:39.510
which also makes circles on the floor of the pavement.
So we're going to again,

1130
01:11:39.511 --> 01:11:41.640
return to these kinds of issues next week.

1131
01:11:41.641 --> 01:11:46.641
I just wanted you to be aware of this intermediate step between the frigate

1132
01:11:46.791 --> 01:11:50.430
Daria upon pay and some of the buildings that we're going to be looking at in

1133
01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:55.260
the next couple of weeks.
Hey,
care,
thank you.
And Happy Valentine's Day.

1134
01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:55.830
Everyone.
