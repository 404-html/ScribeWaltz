1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.243
Good morning.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.880
The title of today's lecture is exploring special subjects on palm pay and walls

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.730
and that's exactly what I'm going to do today.

4
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:16.731
To explore a number of scenes I freeze of figures,

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.780
landscape scene,

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.680
a portrait portraits on a palm pay in walls,

7
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:24.780
and also still life painting.

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.150
And we're going to look at them both in the context of the architectural style

9
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:33.570
walls that we've been discussing thus far this term,
especially the second,

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.610
third and fourth styles.

11
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.170
But we'll also look at them as interesting in their own right.

12
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.840
We ended last time with a discussion of fourth style Roman wall painting and I

13
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:50.760
want to show you again what I consider the quintessential fourth style wall.

14
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.890
It's the [inaudible] room in the house of Vte in palm pay,
uh,

15
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.390
and you see it here once again in all it's garish glory.

16
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.460
It's an amazing painting.

17
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.470
We talked about the fact that it is a kind of compendium of all the styles that

18
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:12.420
went before we described.
For example,
the Sokal,

19
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.690
which is attempt to imitate marble incrustation in paint,

20
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.620
which of course makes reference to the first style of Roman wall painting.

21
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.800
We talked about the fact that the second style elements could be seen in the

22
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.800
substantial columns that are located in the second tier or in the main tier of

23
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:39.231
the painted wall columns that support a lintel above and a coffered ceiling.

24
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.310
We see those here.
We see them over here as well.
Those again,

25
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:45.810
elements of the second style.

26
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:50.430
We talked about the third style features in this particular painting,

27
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.890
the mythological landscape in the center that has a frame,

28
00:01:55.891 --> 00:02:00.891
a black frame around it to make it abundantly clear that this is not a window to

29
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:05.490
something else but rather meant to look as if it is a flat panel painting

30
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.870
hanging on the wall.
A third style element over here,

31
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.430
another third style element,

32
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:14.970
the floating a mythological figure in the center.

33
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:17.880
In this case of a white panel with a,
uh,

34
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.530
with a border that is made up a floral or vegetal motifs.
Again,

35
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.190
elements of the third style with regard to fourth style,

36
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.250
the introduction of architecture once again on either side of the main panel in

37
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:33.120
the main zone.
Uh,

38
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.350
these are not representations of complete buildings,

39
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:42.330
but rather as we discussed,
fragments of buildings depicted in illogical space.

40
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.840
And then in the upper most tier,
uh,

41
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.800
we see the architectural cages that we also described as characteristic of the

42
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:52.410
fourth style.
So all of these elements,
as I said,

43
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:57.411
a compendium of all of these painting styles all in one place is where Roman

44
00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:03.351
painting up right before the destruction of Mount Vesuvius.

45
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.820
We also have looked,
in fact,

46
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:11.821
I want to return at the beginning of today's presentation to the villa of the

47
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:15.460
mysteries in palm pay.
We've looked at it twice already.

48
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:20.070
We looked at it from the standpoint of it's architectural evolution.
Uh,

49
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.610
we looked at the two phases,

50
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:25.690
first and second phases of the villa of the mysteries.

51
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.340
And you'll remember the plan.

52
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:32.260
This is the second phase plan which I showed to you again and you'll recall the

53
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:36.650
design of the,
of the,
of the,
of the villa,
uh,

54
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.080
where you enter at the top,
you enter into the Paris style,
then into the atrium,

55
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.610
then into the tableau denim.

56
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.700
This unusual sequence of rooms that is more in keeping with villa designed

57
00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:51.730
according to Vitruvian,
then to a house design.

58
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.340
And we looked at uh,
a room,
a second style wall painted room,

59
00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.830
uh,
called [inaudible] 16,

60
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:03.970
and I can show you where Kuebix Calum 16 is on this plan.

61
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:05.560
You see it right over here,

62
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.810
and you'll remember that this was an outstanding example of mature second style

63
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:14.950
Roman wall painting.
This idea of opening up the wall illusionistic Lee,

64
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.380
remnants of the first stall wall still here.
That wall is dropped down.
Uh,

65
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:23.170
we do have substantial columns with predict,

66
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.890
projecting and tablatures a coffered ceiling above,

67
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.460
and in this case a lintel and then an RQ weighted lintel.

68
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.020
All of these elements,

69
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.580
a typical of the second style and especially the opening up of the wall to see a

70
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:39.100
vista that lies beyond,
in this case,

71
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:43.510
a philosophy around shrine surrounded by a blue sky.

72
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.860
So quintessential second style in [inaudible] 16.

73
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.220
The room that I want to turn to today also in the bill of the mysteries is room

74
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:56.470
five.
Room five is located over here.

75
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.230
I you see it right to the right of the,

76
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:01.900
to bleed them and close to the southern side,

77
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:06.901
close to the great bay window that was added in phase two to provide magnificent

78
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:11.470
views out over the sea room five.

79
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.120
It's as plain rectangular room or so.
It looks in plan,
fairly large in scale,

80
00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:19.570
not as large as the atrium but fairly large.
And while it's on,

81
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.120
while the plan is on the screen,

82
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:27.121
I just want to point to the entrance way to the room is very small and France

83
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:28.781
way here.

84
00:05:28.781 --> 00:05:33.010
It's actually very important in terms of our decoding of these paintings that

85
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:36.580
we'll find that we find in there,
uh,
that small entrance way.

86
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:41.260
And then what you see in plan here are actually windows rather than additional

87
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:45.820
doorways.
And we're going to see that the designer of this particular room,

88
00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:48.480
the painter,
uh,
took the corners,
took the,

89
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.050
the location of the door and also the corners of the room and the,

90
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.591
and the,

91
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:58.280
and the location of the windows into great consideration when he painted,
uh,

92
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:00.620
the scenes on this wall.

93
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.890
This is a view of the room five as it looks today.
Uh,

94
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.080
it's often also referred to as the,
uh,

95
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.910
the room with the Diana Dionysiac mystery paintings,

96
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.150
mystery paintings that we'll see feature the god of Wine Dionysus.

97
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.320
You can see from looking at this general view that the paintings are quite

98
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.310
WellPreserved.

99
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.930
We'll see that they cover all four walls of the room except for the witness

100
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:33.660
space,
except for where the windows are obviously.
Uh,

101
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.880
and you can also see that this is like nothing we've looked at thus far this

102
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:42.620
semester and that what we have here are a series of very large monumental

103
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:47.210
figures,
uh,
that seemed to walk around the room in a kind of procession.

104
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.330
And you see those extremely well here

105
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.230
with regard to the,
the,
uh,
style of wall that it is.

106
00:06:57.231 --> 00:07:02.231
I show you another view over here where you can see those same large figures,

107
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.880
uh,
walking,
uh,
from the doorway along the side of the left wall.

108
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.840
Uh,
but you can also see the design of the wall as a whole.

109
00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:13.100
And if you look at it carefully,

110
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:16.970
you will note that the figures are of course placed against these large red

111
00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:19.340
panels between those red panels,

112
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:22.250
what look not like they're clearly not columns,

113
00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:26.420
but kind of like flat pilasters here,
uh,

114
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.690
that resting on a Sokal down below and then above a meander pattern,

115
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.860
uh,
uh,

116
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.090
frieze and above that a nother,

117
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.810
a course that represents in paint,
uh,

118
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.640
what looks like very gated marble,
very gated marble.
The implication being,
again,

119
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:50.420
that would've been very expensive to bring from somewhere else.

120
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:55.370
So as we look at this,
we think,
well,
it's kind of like a first style wall.
Uh,

121
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:59.420
but you can see that there,
it's not a relief wall.
It's not built up in Stucco.

122
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:03.230
It's flat,
uh,
because it was done entirely in paint.

123
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.440
And yet as you look at these very large figures,

124
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:11.770
you see that they are standing on a ground line that projects into the

125
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:13.760
spectators space.
Uh,

126
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:17.240
and that suggests to us that what we are dealing with here,

127
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.840
if we have to categorize this and put it into first,
second,

128
00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:22.490
third or fourth style,

129
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:27.670
we're going to call it a second style Roman wall painting because it has again,

130
00:08:28.731 --> 00:08:32.300
residual from the first style,
but it's done entirely in paint.

131
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.540
But it has this projecting element at the bottom,

132
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:40.541
this baseline on which the figures stand and on which the figures process.

133
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.650
So a second style Roman wolf painting with monumental figures and those

134
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:50.480
monumental figures tell a story.
And it's a very interesting,
very intriguing,

135
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:53.690
very mysterious,
a story indeed.

136
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.000
And it is from the mystery scenes here by the way,

137
00:08:57.001 --> 00:09:01.260
that the villa of the mysteries are got its name.
This is a view over here,

138
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:06.261
an excellent view of the small doorway that you need to take a to enter into the

139
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:11.370
room.
And as you enter into the room and you make a sharp left,

140
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:15.240
well first of course you entered the room and you get a glimpse of the entire

141
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:18.920
space.
Uh,
but as you turn to your immediate left,
uh,

142
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.270
you begin with the beginning of the story.

143
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:26.271
And the artist again has orchestrated this in such a way as to make it look like

144
00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:31.230
this woman who was standing here has actually entered through the doorway of the

145
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:35.180
room and is now beginning to precess.
Uh,

146
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.730
from that doorway along the side of the room.

147
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
If we look at the woman we see that she is wearing a quite heavy,

148
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.400
uh,
heavy garment over here,
uh,

149
00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:51.000
but it's a very jaunty representation of this woman because you can,
she,

150
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:55.830
she has her,
her right hand on her hip and an interest in way.

151
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:56.370
Uh,

152
00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:01.370
and then most interesting of all is the fact that she wears a veil over her head

153
00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:05.340
and it's a kind of diaphanous veil is I think you can see it's over.

154
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:10.170
Her head protects her hair.
Uh,
and then it wraps around her.

155
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:11.460
She wraps it around her chest.

156
00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:16.461
She's holding a one corner of it with her left hand and the rest cascades down

157
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:18.920
her back.
Uh,

158
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.580
the artist is paid a great deal of attention to that veil because he wants to

159
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:28.230
identify her for us and to tell us that she is a bride.

160
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:32.760
Brides were often depicted with voluminous veils like that.

161
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.820
As you see her here,
and she is a bride,

162
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.560
as we're going to find out as we interpret these scenes,
she is a bride,

163
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:44.970
probably a young Pompei in woman who is about to enter,

164
00:10:44.971 --> 00:10:49.440
who was about to participate in these religious rights that are going to allow

165
00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:54.240
her to kind of like a fraternity or sorority initiation that she's about to

166
00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:54.871
undergo,

167
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:59.130
let's say a sorority initiation that she's about to undergo because she's about

168
00:10:59.131 --> 00:11:04.131
to go through something that's going to enable her ultimately to enter into a

169
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:08.160
mystical marriage with the god of wine die in Isis.

170
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.990
So she enters here.
Then she comes upon a two other figures.

171
00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:17.991
There's a seated woman as you can see who holds in her hand or her left hand a

172
00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:22.740
scroll.
Uh,
she has her right hand on the shoulder of a little boy.

173
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:26.820
Note that the little boy is completely naked and completely oblivious to the

174
00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:31.080
fact that he is naked.
He holds in his hand a scroll,

175
00:11:31.081 --> 00:11:35.400
which he has another scroll,
which she has unfurled and it looks as if he is,

176
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:40.380
well,
it's no question.
He's very intent on looking at the text on that scroll.

177
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:45.620
And it looks as if he is reading from the text of that scroll and we interpret

178
00:11:46.231 --> 00:11:51.231
that scroll or we interpret his participation in this scene as probably the fact

179
00:11:51.271 --> 00:11:56.271
that he is reading the liturgy liturgy that has to do with this cult of Dionysus

180
00:11:56.981 --> 00:12:01.690
and with the mystical marriage of women with the God Dionysus.

181
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.450
It's a wonderful depiction of that boy.

182
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:07.710
And I also show you here,
uh,

183
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.630
the rest of that particular side of the room.

184
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:13.330
We're going to look at all of the figures in order,
uh,

185
00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:16.900
but I just wanted you to get a sense of the rest of the wall as it unfurls this

186
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:19.480
left wall as you first come into the room.
Uh,

187
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:23.440
and I wanted to point out using this image that again,

188
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:29.020
about how sophisticated this particular artist was because he takes into

189
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:30.970
consideration,
as I mentioned before,

190
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:35.340
the corners of the room and they become part of the narrative.
Uh,

191
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.200
as you can see here,
there's an empty space but,

192
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:43.410
but the story line as we'll see continues across the corner and the figures over

193
00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:49.681
here interact with the figures on the other side of the bend in the wall.

194
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.890
And again,
a very,
very sophisticated and interesting way.

195
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.920
And we'll follow that through.
Before we do though,

196
00:12:56.921 --> 00:13:01.600
I just want to show you a head detail of the seated woman to give you a sense of

197
00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:06.430
the extraordinary talent of this artist whose name unfortunately has not come

198
00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:07.910
down to us.
Uh,

199
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:12.640
we see this head here and you can see the way in which the artists has captured

200
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:16.360
the moment,
what this woman is going through,
what she's thinking about.

201
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.343
She seated,

202
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.760
she's listening to the liturgy that's being spoken by this boy.

203
00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:26.080
You can see that the artist is paid a great deal of attention to her eyes,

204
00:13:26.081 --> 00:13:30.730
which are wide open and very nicely painted.
But one gets a sense,

205
00:13:30.731 --> 00:13:33.440
or at least I get the sense is I look at this,
that she,

206
00:13:33.441 --> 00:13:36.310
she is not only wide eyed at what's going on,

207
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.460
but you also have a sense that she's kind of,
it's almost jaded.

208
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.660
I'm just kind of seen it all.

209
00:13:40.661 --> 00:13:45.661
She has a sense of what the moment is a and what is about to occur.

210
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:50.080
Notice also the way in which her lips are slightly parted,
uh,

211
00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:55.060
and especially the hair the artist is we'll see who was responsible for painting

212
00:13:55.061 --> 00:13:57.970
this.
Uh,
and it may have been more than one artist.

213
00:13:57.971 --> 00:14:01.960
It may have been a designer who worked with obviously others in a workshop.

214
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.990
But whether it's a single individual or several,

215
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:10.170
it is very clear that this person or this person or persons have a very good

216
00:14:10.931 --> 00:14:15.640
sense of what hair real hair is actually like.

217
00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:20.630
It's the same as I mentioned when we talked about the villa,
the um,
the uh,
uh,

218
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.930
garden scape of Livia.

219
00:14:22.931 --> 00:14:26.620
And I said that that artists had clearly looked at nature and was actually

220
00:14:26.621 --> 00:14:31.570
depicting what he saw and knew about nature.
Here is somebody I believe,

221
00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:35.410
who has really looked at human beings who was really looked at the way in which

222
00:14:35.411 --> 00:14:40.411
hair grows from the scalp because you can see the way in which he has shown that

223
00:14:40.571 --> 00:14:44.470
hair growing from the scalp and he understands that when you part your hair on

224
00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:45.530
this in the middle,
uh,

225
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:50.620
there may be a certain part of the scalp that you actually see through the hair.

226
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:54.140
And he's represented that extremely realistically here.

227
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:58.520
So although we don't know the name of this particular artist,
we can,
we can,
uh,

228
00:14:58.521 --> 00:15:03.521
claim his talent here as we look at details such as this one,

229
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:10.390
the story continues from the boy reading the liturgy to the figure that you see

230
00:15:10.491 --> 00:15:13.220
here.
Uh,
it is a figure,
again of a woman.

231
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:18.250
She is holding some kind of a dish and she has on that dish probably it's very

232
00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:20.780
hard to identify exactly what's there.
Uh,

233
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.790
but she has probably some items that have something to do with this cult,

234
00:15:25.791 --> 00:15:30.260
with this mystical marriage,
uh,
of these Pompei and women with Dionysus.

235
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.120
She is dressed in,
she has a light colored top and uh,

236
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.650
a purple is a lot of purple in this scene.
A very vividly purple,

237
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.780
a skirt.
As you can see down here.

238
00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:46.610
She is the first woman of the group to where a Laurel wreath over her head as

239
00:15:46.611 --> 00:15:50.870
you can see.
And she and all of them,
by the way,
we're bracelets,

240
00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:53.510
you can see bracelets around her lower arms.

241
00:15:53.511 --> 00:15:57.890
Some of them were these arm bracelets up higher on their arms is we'll also see,

242
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.690
and she's one of the only figures that actually looks out at us,
the spectator.

243
00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:07.691
She really is basically confronting as we linked eyes with her when we look at

244
00:16:08.061 --> 00:16:12.530
this particular painting and the artist is obviously trying to establish fairly

245
00:16:12.531 --> 00:16:17.531
early on a connection between the viewer and what is happening in this scene.

246
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.610
Uh,
the beginning of another scene here with a series of women,

247
00:16:22.611 --> 00:16:26.750
I have a better view of it here where you can see what's happening next.

248
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.960
Here we have three women who are standing at some kind of a table and one of the

249
00:16:32.511 --> 00:16:33.410
women,
the women,

250
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.390
the woman on the right has a picture from which he's pouring some kind of
liquid,

251
00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.520
whether it's water or wine or what,

252
00:16:40.521 --> 00:16:44.890
we're not absolutely sure it might well be wine given that this is a,

253
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:49.580
a the mysteries of Dionysus.
She may be pouring wine,
but whatever it is,

254
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.470
uh,
it has been interpreted as a purification seen,
uh,

255
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.770
in which something and we can't see what it is that's underneath this purple

256
00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.150
piece of,
of,
of cloth.
Uh,
that,
that,
that the cheap one of the women is,

257
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.890
is holding up and revealing a,

258
00:17:04.891 --> 00:17:09.891
they are purifying that or either an object or a series of objects on this

259
00:17:11.091 --> 00:17:14.630
table.
It's a wonderful depiction of these three women.

260
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:19.550
One woman holding the edge of the table over here and looking to her compatriot

261
00:17:19.551 --> 00:17:23.660
who is pouring the liquid on this side and a real tour de force.

262
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:27.710
It's not so easy to depict a figure from the rear and make it work.

263
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:32.610
But this artist has done so.
A very monumental woman seated on a,

264
00:17:32.611 --> 00:17:36.620
a wonderful thrown here with the,
uh,
with the purple,
uh,

265
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.240
Ham as you can see down below.
Uh,
but look at the way he's depicted her garment.

266
00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:46.240
It's tight in some places and molds or body and cascades in others.

267
00:17:46.241 --> 00:17:50.370
She's also wearing a scarf that's tied back behind her head.
And she too.

268
00:17:50.371 --> 00:17:52.740
Where's a Laurel wreath over that scarf?
Uh,

269
00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:57.300
this woman has a Laurel wreath as well,
so they're purifying as part of this,

270
00:17:57.301 --> 00:17:58.950
right?
They are pure,
but women.

271
00:17:58.951 --> 00:18:03.560
Three women are participating and purifying,
uh,
these,
uh,

272
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:08.310
this object or objects here.
This woman has her,
her,
she's,
look,

273
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:11.100
she's not really looking as you.
Well,
she isn't looking at what she's doing.

274
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.181
As you can see,

275
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:15.540
she's not actually what doesn't seem to be watching the purification,

276
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:20.340
but rather is looking at this fellow over here and given what he looks like,

277
00:18:20.341 --> 00:18:24.270
I guess that's not surprising.
Her glance is caught by him.
Now,
who is he?

278
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.980
He is what we call a silo.
Anus,
s,
I,
l,
e,
n,
u,
s,

279
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:33.360
and the silliness is an older Satre,
s,
a,
t,
y,
r,

280
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.140
who were the seders.
The seders were,
uh,
the,
um,

281
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.320
the compatriots of Pan Pan compatriots of pan.

282
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.910
Uh,
and,
uh,
so a young seder grows up into an old site lameness,
uh,

283
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:50.840
and you see that sideline this here.
And he's a very interesting figure.
Uh,

284
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:54.870
you can see that he,
he's completely naked and in fact that,
well they're,

285
00:18:54.871 --> 00:18:58.540
they're naked men and naked women in this,
as in this as we'll see.
Uh,

286
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.900
but it's interesting to see that,
uh,
you know,

287
00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:03.180
which ones are and which ones aren't.
He is,

288
00:19:03.181 --> 00:19:07.710
and you can see that this great purple mantle that he had draped around his body

289
00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:10.860
has completely,
or almost completely fallen off.

290
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:16.130
He is playing a liar as you can see here in probably singing along with his liar

291
00:19:16.501 --> 00:19:20.970
playing.
And not only has his garment fallen off,
but you can see that he is not,

292
00:19:20.971 --> 00:19:25.350
one foot is on the pedestal on which,
uh,
the,
um,

293
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:30.120
or on a base on which the pedestal that supports the liar is located.

294
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:34.500
But another leg has slipped off that pedis pedestal.
Why is that?

295
00:19:34.501 --> 00:19:37.530
He's quite tipsy.
Uh,
we know that the silliness,

296
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:42.750
the PSI lamenesses and the Sanders did a lot of drinking,
very serious drinking.

297
00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:43.140
Uh,

298
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:48.140
he's clearly a imbibed a and he is not very much in control of himself any

299
00:19:48.811 --> 00:19:49.670
longer.
Uh,

300
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.180
so he's probably pretty oblivious to the fact that his clothing has fallen off

301
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.170
and that he too has slipped off the base as he sings.

302
00:19:58.171 --> 00:20:03.171
So it's not surprising that this woman casts her glance towards the goings on.

303
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:08.640
Uh,
next to her.
Here are the,
I mentioned that,
uh,
the,

304
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.000
uh,
I mentioned the Seder,
the Seders,

305
00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:15.330
and we see two of the young seders right next to that older man.

306
00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.780
And the seders again,
uh,

307
00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:23.781
are associated with pan and goats are also associated with pan.

308
00:20:24.391 --> 00:20:28.560
And you can see one of them is feeding the goats here,
these young boys.

309
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:31.320
And it's true of the man too.
I neglected to mention it all.

310
00:20:31.321 --> 00:20:36.210
Have a sort of pan or animal ears.
Uh,
as you can see very clearly here,

311
00:20:36.211 --> 00:20:41.100
the pointed animal ears and this one is playing a flute.
So one playing a flute,

312
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.620
one playing the one feeding the goats.
Uh,

313
00:20:44.621 --> 00:20:49.210
both of them seated on a kind of rocky area over here.

314
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.540
This figure is of particular interest.

315
00:20:52.541 --> 00:20:57.541
It's a woman clothed with egg white garment that is sleeveless.

316
00:20:57.611 --> 00:21:02.510
She has one of these bracelets on the upper part of her arm.
Uh,

317
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:06.640
it is clear that she is afraid and she is fleeing from something.
Uh,

318
00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:11.050
you can see that she holds up her,
uh,
one of her her left hand.

319
00:21:11.051 --> 00:21:16.051
She holds up her left hand as if she is trying to ward something horrific off.

320
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.450
Uh,
and you can see that she is,
but she can't by the way,

321
00:21:19.451 --> 00:21:21.520
while she's holding up her hand toward it off,

322
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:26.050
you can see that she's absolutely mesmerized by whatever it is that she's
seeing.

323
00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:29.750
Her eyes are staring straight ahead,
wide eyed,

324
00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:34.060
staring straight ahead to look at whatever it is that is at one hand,

325
00:21:34.061 --> 00:21:37.810
fascinating on and on the and the and on the other horrific,
uh,

326
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:42.280
she is clearly in a rush because you can see that the purple mantle that she

327
00:21:42.281 --> 00:21:45.310
wore a has been caught in the breeze as she,

328
00:21:45.311 --> 00:21:49.750
as she tries to escape the breeze is caught in that and it almost serves the

329
00:21:49.751 --> 00:21:54.751
purpose of a kind of parachute that's about to rescue her from whatever it is

330
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:58.330
that she has seen.
And that has frightened her.

331
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.780
We are now at the first corner of the room.
So again,

332
00:22:01.781 --> 00:22:06.781
the artist has taken the corner into consideration and created this dramatic

333
00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:12.400
interaction between this woman and whatever it is that she's afraid of on the

334
00:22:12.401 --> 00:22:17.260
other side of the corner.
Uh,
and before I show that to you,

335
00:22:17.261 --> 00:22:20.920
I just wanted to show you a closeup of her face to again,

336
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.720
give you a sense of how talented,

337
00:22:22.721 --> 00:22:27.721
how extraordinarily gifted this artist was in capturing the moment encapturing

338
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.900
the feelings that this woman must have been going through.
Once again,

339
00:22:31.901 --> 00:22:35.170
the very wide eyes fascinated by what she sees.

340
00:22:35.171 --> 00:22:37.330
But seemingly all knowing,
she,

341
00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.520
she's seeing something that she doesn't quite expect,

342
00:22:39.521 --> 00:22:43.330
but you get the sense that perhaps she did know all along that she was going to

343
00:22:43.331 --> 00:22:46.960
see something of this nature.
The parted lips once again,

344
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:51.990
and the expert way in which the artist has shown the way hair naturally grows

345
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.450
out of the scalp of the head.
Again,

346
00:22:55.451 --> 00:22:59.440
achieved a magnificently in this head detail.

347
00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:04.300
Now the object of her fear,
uh,
is what we now see over here.
Here again,

348
00:23:04.301 --> 00:23:08.350
we see the coroner,
the coroner itself and empty red space.

349
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:12.040
The woman fleeing on this side.
What is she fleeing form?
What is she afraid of?

350
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.720
This horrific mask that is being held by one of the seders.

351
00:23:16.721 --> 00:23:21.721
We see another set of two young seders here and an old silo anus again and one

352
00:23:23.531 --> 00:23:26.350
of the seders holding up this horrible mask.

353
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:29.470
And that seems to be what has,
uh,
put,

354
00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.820
put fear in to the eyes of this particular woman.

355
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:38.290
With regard to the scene of the Seders,
you can see that the,
uh,
the,

356
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:39.640
the side lameness and the seders,

357
00:23:39.641 --> 00:23:43.450
the Salinas is seated on some kind of marble block.

358
00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.770
As you can see here,

359
00:23:44.771 --> 00:23:49.771
he looks similar to the one that we saw before and older man with those animal

360
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.160
ears,
as you can see,
a,

361
00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:56.630
and he is one of the seders holds the mask a boat.
All of these figures,

362
00:23:56.631 --> 00:23:59.560
by the way,
are,
are,
are,
are you,
you know,

363
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.180
do not have any our semi naked.

364
00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:04.880
You can see that they have bare chests in all cases,

365
00:24:04.881 --> 00:24:08.120
in the mantles only covering the lower parts of their bodies.

366
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:13.390
And the silliness while looking back toward the woman is holding a large cup,

367
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.720
uh,
from which one of the seders is drinking.
It's a kind of,

368
00:24:17.721 --> 00:24:21.740
I always think of this as a kind of Morrie's cup and you see that the Seder is

369
00:24:21.741 --> 00:24:26.420
whole.
The Salinas is holding it,
the younger Seder is drinking from it.
So again,

370
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:30.800
there's,
this is a lot to do with,
with drinking and getting drunk.
This,

371
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.710
this mystery,
uh,
and uh,
at least,

372
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:36.020
at least from the male point of view,

373
00:24:36.021 --> 00:24:40.180
because it actually seems to be the men who were drinking and not the women who

374
00:24:40.181 --> 00:24:43.370
are drinking in this particular instance.
It's a wonderful,

375
00:24:43.371 --> 00:24:47.510
let me also show you a detail of the say of these young Seder drinking out of

376
00:24:47.511 --> 00:24:51.260
the cup and you can see how gifted,
again,
this particular artist is.

377
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.950
I don't think this artist always gets the hands right.
He tries,
uh,

378
00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.190
there's sometimes a little bit awkward.
Uh,
but on the other hand,

379
00:24:58.191 --> 00:25:01.850
he really has made an effort to show the way in which hands and fingers grip

380
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.660
something both from the bottom and also from the top.

381
00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.180
He's very good with the eyes.
Again,
you get,

382
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:12.860
it's just wonderful the way he is achieved,
uh,
showing the Seder.
You know,

383
00:25:12.861 --> 00:25:16.010
on one hand,
greedily drinking from the cup,

384
00:25:16.011 --> 00:25:19.370
but at the same time with one eye you can see one eye and that one I is,

385
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.460
you know,
very much on what it is that he's doing.

386
00:25:22.461 --> 00:25:26.420
He's looking at that liquid quite intently as he drinks it.

387
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:29.330
And I think that's very well achieved here.
And again,

388
00:25:29.331 --> 00:25:34.040
this extraordinary way in which the artist has depicted,
uh,

389
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:38.420
the hair of this young man as it grows out of his scalp,

390
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.100
particularly talented.
You don't see that very often in Roman painting.

391
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:48.170
Uh,
the center,
this is,
we're now on the back wall.
We've turned the corner.

392
00:25:48.171 --> 00:25:48.951
It's the back wall,

393
00:25:48.951 --> 00:25:52.420
the wall that you face when you come into the room and look ahead.
Uh,

394
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.940
and we see that the scene that follows,
uh,

395
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:59.750
the silliness and the seders with the mask is the scene that you see here.

396
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:04.930
And it is the most important scene in the painting because it is a scene that

397
00:26:05.661 --> 00:26:08.030
represents Dionysus himself,

398
00:26:08.031 --> 00:26:13.031
this man with whom all of these Pompei and women are anxious to be initiated

399
00:26:14.001 --> 00:26:17.030
into his rights and to enter into mystical marriage with him.

400
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:22.010
Here he is and he is wasted clearly.
I mean,
look at him.

401
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:22.970
Uh,
you know,

402
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:26.450
despite the fact that he's about to enter into marriage and all these attractive

403
00:26:26.451 --> 00:26:29.030
young women,
I mean,
he's completely out of it.

404
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:34.130
He is lying in the lap of Ariadne is mortal lover.
You see her here,

405
00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:39.110
uh,
and look at his eyes.
There's sort of rolled up into the top of his head.

406
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:40.610
He is,
he is,
he could,

407
00:26:40.611 --> 00:26:45.120
couldn't possibly support him self without Ariadne's help.
Uh,

408
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.480
his arms are,
are,
are outstretched behind him.
In fact,

409
00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:52.230
she has to put her arm around his chest in order to protect him.

410
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.760
And I think it's interesting to see the way in which women are,

411
00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.220
are represented as protective beings in these paintings.
The,

412
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:03.120
the woman earlier on who puts her hand around the boy who's reading from the

413
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:07.650
liturgy and now Ariadne who rapes her arm around,
uh,

414
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.070
around Dionysus,
Dionysus,
the god of wine.

415
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:15.280
You can see again that he had a mantle and that's about it on a,

416
00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:17.270
but that is slipping off.
Uh,

417
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:21.450
and you can also see that he's so drunk that although he's kept one sandal on,

418
00:27:21.451 --> 00:27:24.690
he's lost the other sandal.
You can see his barefoot over here.

419
00:27:24.691 --> 00:27:27.270
You're looking at the bottom of the foot.
That Sandal is going.

420
00:27:27.271 --> 00:27:29.820
And if you look for it,
you can find it.
Here it is.
Uh,

421
00:27:29.821 --> 00:27:33.820
it has fallen off and it is located closer to Ariadne.

422
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.960
Look also at the staff that Dionysus usually carries the fiercest t,

423
00:27:39.241 --> 00:27:43.960
h,
y,
r,
s,
u s the thesis of Dionysus.

424
00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:45.300
Uh,

425
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:50.300
it's there and it helps to identify him as does the ivy wreath that he wears,

426
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.930
that he typically wears.
Note the yellow ribbon that is tied around the thesis,

427
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:57.780
but it does,
you know,
one wonders how that theorists,

428
00:27:57.781 --> 00:28:00.090
this is being supported because you can see it's,

429
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:05.240
I guess it's just leaning slightly against the chair on which Dionysus sits,

430
00:28:05.941 --> 00:28:09.180
but one wonders how it is being,
uh,
supported,

431
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:11.790
but it crosses his body here and is meant,
again,

432
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:16.020
as an identifying attribute for the god of wine.

433
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:21.500
The fact that we see Diane Isis in this state and also on the lap of Ariadne is

434
00:28:23.551 --> 00:28:28.170
interesting,
especially the lap of Ariadne because again,
she was his mortal.

435
00:28:28.171 --> 00:28:30.420
She herself was a mortal,
his mortal lover.

436
00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:35.070
And I think one of the ways of interpreting this as that a scene like this,

437
00:28:35.071 --> 00:28:38.520
seeing that Diane Isis could unite with a mortal woman,

438
00:28:38.521 --> 00:28:43.521
gave hope to the women of Pompei who were hoping to be initiated into this

439
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:47.500
mystical,
uh,
religion and it,

440
00:28:47.501 --> 00:28:50.340
and to embark on a mystical marriage with Dionysus.

441
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.420
This gave them hope that if another mortal woman was allowed to enter into a

442
00:28:54.421 --> 00:28:56.190
relationship with Diane Isis,

443
00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.110
then they too would be able to follow in their,
in,

444
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:04.170
in our yard and these footsteps.
And so this is a very important message,
I think,

445
00:29:04.171 --> 00:29:08.640
of hope,
uh,
to those women who are hoping to become initiatives,

446
00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:13.790
initiate initiates initiative initiates of this particular,

447
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:14.880
um,
cult.

448
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:20.430
The next scene that we see is also a very interesting scene and a very important

449
00:29:20.431 --> 00:29:20.611
one.

450
00:29:20.611 --> 00:29:25.611
It's the one that comes right to the right of the scene of Dionysus and Ariadne.

451
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:26.611
Uh,

452
00:29:26.611 --> 00:29:31.530
and we see here the discovery of the most important cult object,

453
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.200
uh,
in this scene,
which is the Phallus.

454
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:38.550
We see a woman kneeling,
uh,
she is,
uh,
she,

455
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:42.850
her arms are wonderfully depicted a as they,
um,

456
00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:48.090
seem to barely touch or whatever it is that lies beneath this,

457
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:53.700
uh,
purple cloth we see down below a basket.
Uh,

458
00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:58.130
that is certainly the basket in which the Fallis the secret,
uh,

459
00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:02.390
ritual,
the most important but secret ritual item,
uh,

460
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:07.190
in the Dionysiac religion was kept.
Uh,

461
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.500
and,
uh,
there's been a lot of speculation.
What was behind the purple cloth?

462
00:30:11.501 --> 00:30:16.150
Is it an erect Phallus?
Uh,
very possibly that's exactly what it is.

463
00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:19.510
That would have been kept again in this basket,
but is underneath here,

464
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:24.340
although the speculation has been so wild that we even have a scholar who has

465
00:30:24.341 --> 00:30:29.341
written an article suggesting that the profile of this particular object,

466
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:34.500
this particular cloth here is so similar to the profile of Mount Vesuvius.

467
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:39.220
But what we have here is a reference instead to mount Vesuvius into the fact

468
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:42.730
that this scene takes place in Palm Bay.
It's a very intriguing idea.

469
00:30:42.731 --> 00:30:45.360
I think it's,
I can't imagine that it's correct.
Uh,

470
00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:48.670
but nonetheless it gives you some sense of the kind of scholarship.

471
00:30:48.671 --> 00:30:53.671
And some of the speculation there has been about what is actually going on here,

472
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:57.650
but it seems to be,
uh,
the,
uh,

473
00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:02.670
the covering in this particular case and possibly about to reveal the secret,

474
00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:07.960
the most important secret item in this cult.

475
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.780
Over here we see another fascinating figure.

476
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.650
We've gotten to another corner and we can see that she straddles the empty red

477
00:31:14.651 --> 00:31:18.470
space in that corner.
A figure of a woman,
uh,

478
00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:23.170
who is winging it.
The only wing had to figure that we see in the scenes,

479
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:27.040
you can see her large stretch outstretched wings,
uh,
behind her.

480
00:31:27.041 --> 00:31:31.060
She is naked from the waist up.
She's wearing a fantastic skirt.

481
00:31:31.061 --> 00:31:34.000
I love this skirt,
uh,
with uh,
with,
she has a,

482
00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:38.410
with purple around the waist and purple at the Ham.
And then,
uh,
a wonderful,

483
00:31:38.411 --> 00:31:43.030
it flips out,
it's brown and it flips out and it matches these great tall boots,

484
00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:47.770
Brown boots that she also wears.
And she's sort of on her tippy toes as she,

485
00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:52.570
as she herself puts up one of her hands,
perhaps again toward something off.

486
00:31:52.571 --> 00:31:55.540
We don't know what,
but with the other hand what's most important,

487
00:31:55.541 --> 00:31:58.450
she has her hand behind her back and she's about to bring a whip,

488
00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.310
which you can stay down on the back of one of the initiates.

489
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.950
And as we look across the corner,
again,

490
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:11.020
artists masterfully taking the corner into consideration in his design,

491
00:32:11.021 --> 00:32:14.300
visa vi the content and the execution.
Uh,

492
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:19.440
we see the way in which that whip is about to come down on the back of one of

493
00:32:20.591 --> 00:32:21.490
these initiatives,

494
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:26.630
who's kneeling and has her a head in the lap of a woman who protects or here is

495
00:32:27.881 --> 00:32:31.930
the scene.
So again,
we see the figure of the wing had figure with the wif.

496
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:36.880
We see the object of the whipping,
uh,
this initiative here.
Uh,

497
00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.260
she is kneeling,

498
00:32:38.261 --> 00:32:43.261
she is in the lab in part of a woman who seems to protect her or try to protect

499
00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:47.840
her.
The woman who was trying to protect her,
her eyes are very wide.

500
00:32:47.841 --> 00:32:52.841
She is staring up at the wing and figure imploringly it seems almost imploring

501
00:32:53.481 --> 00:32:57.830
or please you know enough enough,
please stop.
Uh,
and she is a,

502
00:32:57.831 --> 00:33:02.831
she is very nurturing to the young girl who is undergoing this initiation as she

503
00:33:03.591 --> 00:33:06.650
pats her on the head.
As you can see here.

504
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:10.100
And incredible view of this woman,
uh,

505
00:33:10.101 --> 00:33:14.180
the way in which the upper part of her body is exposed for the whipping,

506
00:33:14.181 --> 00:33:19.100
the rest of it covered,
and the voluminous purple mantle,
as you can see here,

507
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:23.990
uh,
also figures to her right.
Uh,
a naked woman who is,

508
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.113
uh,
who,

509
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:29.630
who is placed in front of interestingly a woman,

510
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:33.110
a very heavily clothed woman in a dark garment,

511
00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:37.190
which only serves to accentuate the lightness of this woman's flesh.
This,

512
00:33:37.191 --> 00:33:41.690
this sort of contrast or tension between clothed and unclothed also seems to

513
00:33:41.691 --> 00:33:45.320
play a very important part in this particular painting.

514
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:48.940
But this woman is incredible.
Again,
the artist has,
uh,
has,

515
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.510
has enjoyed trying to represent figures from the rear as well as from the front.

516
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:55.200
Uh,
and you see a,

517
00:33:55.260 --> 00:34:00.200
he has also shown her on her tippy toes as she is.
She,

518
00:34:00.201 --> 00:34:03.110
she'll,
she has symbols above her head and she's crashing those symbols.

519
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:06.980
And then she is dancing under tip on her tiptoes down here.

520
00:34:06.981 --> 00:34:11.981
But it's an incredible feat because she also has this gold mantle that is over

521
00:34:14.001 --> 00:34:18.740
her shoulder and between her legs and somehow she's keeping this mantel balanced

522
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:23.870
as she is dancing and as she is playing her music.
And then there's another one,

523
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:26.270
another thesis of Dionysus.

524
00:34:26.271 --> 00:34:29.600
It seems to be located that is located between these two women.

525
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:30.950
And one wonders again,

526
00:34:30.951 --> 00:34:35.951
how in the world that [inaudible] is being held up as this woman is

527
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.840
participating in this,
um,

528
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:43.430
in this dance and music making over here at the right to get back to this

529
00:34:43.431 --> 00:34:44.090
figure,

530
00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:48.530
I just want to show you a detail because I think in this detail you really get

531
00:34:48.531 --> 00:34:52.010
almost more than anywhere else in this painted freeze,

532
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:56.450
the extraordinary talent of this particular artist.
I mean,
here,

533
00:34:56.451 --> 00:35:01.190
here the artists gets these hands really,
right?
Uh,
you can see this,

534
00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.360
the limp hand of the woman being whipped,
uh,
almost says it all.

535
00:35:05.361 --> 00:35:10.361
It's an incredible detail as does the more nurturing hand of the woman who is

536
00:35:10.581 --> 00:35:12.350
trying to protect her.
Uh,

537
00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:16.010
and I think you can get a sense of what she must be going through.

538
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:20.600
A by the way in which the artist has represented her face,
he has cast her eye,

539
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.940
her eyes are,
this is one of the only closed dies.

540
00:35:22.941 --> 00:35:25.520
If it may be the only closed die in the scene,

541
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:29.090
her eye is closed or almost closed.
Uh,
and it is,

542
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:33.230
it is [inaudible] seems to be sunken in a kind of darkness here.
Uh,

543
00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:38.231
that gives you some sense of the pain that this woman must be going through pain

544
00:35:38.941 --> 00:35:41.280
that she obviously feels however is worth it.

545
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.750
And look also at the way in which the hair has been depicted here you really get

546
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:49.890
the sense of sweat drenched hair,
uh,
of this woman again,

547
00:35:49.891 --> 00:35:53.580
who's going through what is almost certainly the most difficult moment in her

548
00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:56.830
life,
but one that she hopes,
uh,
is going to,
uh,

549
00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:00.300
to be well worth it at the end of the day.

550
00:36:00.301 --> 00:36:03.330
It's an incredible detail.
I think

551
00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.740
after that scene there's a window.

552
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:10.260
And then at the very end of that wall,

553
00:36:10.261 --> 00:36:14.460
we're now on the facing the room on the right wall of the room.
Uh,

554
00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:19.490
there is one last corner and we see here what is represented across that one

555
00:36:20.101 --> 00:36:20.940
last corner.

556
00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:26.220
It is a very young woman seated on a kind of a throne here.

557
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.570
She has an attendance standing next to her and then there's a small wing and

558
00:36:30.571 --> 00:36:32.130
cupid at the left.

559
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:37.370
And then across the corner we see another cupid standing on a base leaning on a

560
00:36:37.591 --> 00:36:40.350
pedestal.
Wing it again,
he's his,

561
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:43.650
his head in his on resting on one of his hands.

562
00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:48.980
And he is looking across the corner at what is going on on the other side.

563
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:53.880
And he looks very,
very admiring.
And in fact,
who is he admiring?

564
00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:57.300
He's admiring another one of these young initiates,

565
00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:02.460
a young woman who seems to be readying herself to become a bride who's getting

566
00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:04.230
ready,
uh,
for her initiation,

567
00:37:04.231 --> 00:37:09.231
she wears a glorious golden garment that is wrapped and wrapped around her waist

568
00:37:10.831 --> 00:37:15.810
is a purple,
purple tie,
a purple ribbon or tie.

569
00:37:15.811 --> 00:37:20.811
As you can see here she is again accompanied by a another woman and attendant

570
00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:23.550
and the two of them together are,

571
00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:28.570
are actually fixing her hair to get her ready again for her mystical marriage.

572
00:37:28.771 --> 00:37:30.810
I have a detail of her to show you in a moment.

573
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:35.820
And then this wonderful anecdotal detail here where we see the other cupid,

574
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:40.680
a wing it again holding up a mirror in his hand,
uh,

575
00:37:40.681 --> 00:37:42.780
a rectangular mirror.
And if you look very,

576
00:37:42.781 --> 00:37:46.440
very closely and you can study this detail on your own as well,

577
00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:47.520
if you look very closely,

578
00:37:47.521 --> 00:37:52.170
you can see that there is a reflection of the young woman's face,
uh,

579
00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.970
in that mirror.
Uh,
so I,

580
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:59.990
I lot of a lot of attention being paid to the readying of this woman to be a

581
00:38:00.421 --> 00:38:04.200
bride to enter into the mystical marriage with Diane Isis.

582
00:38:04.201 --> 00:38:08.580
And we see a detail here where we can see her,
see how pretty she is,

583
00:38:08.581 --> 00:38:10.680
see how,
uh,
her,
again,

584
00:38:10.681 --> 00:38:15.681
the artist has shown this extraordinary ability to depict hair as it really is

585
00:38:17.821 --> 00:38:21.090
growing out of her scalp.
You can see the part of her hair,
the scalp,

586
00:38:21.091 --> 00:38:24.060
showing through the way in which the hair grows from that.

587
00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:27.660
And then you can see that not only is she working on arranging it,

588
00:38:27.661 --> 00:38:30.030
but she's getting help from the attendance.

589
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:34.920
The attendance also has a section of her hair in her hand and the two of them

590
00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:39.610
together are trying to get her ready for her mystical marriage.
Her arm is up.

591
00:38:39.611 --> 00:38:42.520
You can see both of her bracelets and one around her wrist.

592
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:46.450
And then another bracelet up on the upper part of her arm.

593
00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.800
Then we have another window.
And then the last figure,

594
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.840
the last figure that we see,
uh,
is this woman here.

595
00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:59.900
A woman who was seated on a very elaborate thrown,
uh,

596
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:03.130
she too is veiled.
She has a,
again,

597
00:39:03.131 --> 00:39:07.710
a combination gold and purple garment bracelets.

598
00:39:07.711 --> 00:39:11.080
She's wearing bracelets,
but she is veiled.
Uh,
so again,

599
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.760
the implication is she too is a bride.
She seems very placid.

600
00:39:15.761 --> 00:39:19.210
She seemed somehow a little bit older than some of the other brides.

601
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:23.800
And what has been speculated and she's very pensive.
You can see she leans one,

602
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:28.510
she leans her chin on one of her hands.
She seems to be sitting there,
you know,

603
00:39:28.511 --> 00:39:32.920
all right.
At right at the,
and again the,
the doorway of the room.

604
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:37.570
She seems to be seated there and basically surveying everything that's happening

605
00:39:37.571 --> 00:39:38.470
in front of her.

606
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:42.040
And because she looks a little bit older because she looks a little bit wiser

607
00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.450
because she is looking out at a Pi at the panorama of what's happening in front

608
00:39:46.451 --> 00:39:47.080
of her.

609
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:51.430
It has been speculated and I think quite convincingly that the woman we see here

610
00:39:51.431 --> 00:39:53.620
is probably the matron of the house,

611
00:39:53.621 --> 00:39:58.621
probably the wife of the man who owned and built the villa of the mysteries in

612
00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:00.520
Rome,

613
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:05.520
in Nepal pay who was herself an adherent to the cult of Dionysus and has set

614
00:40:06.311 --> 00:40:09.010
aside this secret room in her house,
uh,

615
00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:14.100
for the cult of Dionysus in which she can help initiate other young women,

616
00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.510
uh,
in to this mystery cult.

617
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:21.250
Just won a couple of quick words about religion and cults.
During this period,

618
00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.100
the Roman religion was the Roman state religion.

619
00:40:24.101 --> 00:40:27.160
Everyone essentially adhered to the Roman state religion,

620
00:40:27.161 --> 00:40:31.890
which was very closely allied with the government of Rome.
Uh,

621
00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:36.880
so church,
a church and state,
very closely allied,
uh,
in,
in Roman times.

622
00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.590
But as time went on,

623
00:40:38.591 --> 00:40:41.950
a number of religions that emanated from other parts of the empire,

624
00:40:41.951 --> 00:40:44.800
especially the eastern empire cultivating ionizes,

625
00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:49.570
the cult of the Egyptian goddess,
Isis began to take hold both for men and women.

626
00:40:49.571 --> 00:40:53.380
Women had a particular predilection for the Egyptian Goddess Isis,

627
00:40:53.381 --> 00:40:56.650
and for the DIONYSIAC mystery religions.

628
00:40:56.651 --> 00:41:00.220
And initially because they were not accepted by the state,

629
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:05.170
the only religion that was considered legitimate was the Roman state religion

630
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:08.950
and say,
weren't
accepted by the state.

631
00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:10.570
And this included Christianity.

632
00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.770
These religions had to be celebrated in or had to be,

633
00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:19.570
the rights had to be done in secret.
And so we see underground,
uh,

634
00:41:19.571 --> 00:41:23.380
rooms,
underground buildings being built for this purpose.

635
00:41:23.381 --> 00:41:26.320
I'll show you one a bit later in the course.
Uh,

636
00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:31.350
but we also see rooms in houses being set aside for these kinds of rights.

637
00:41:31.541 --> 00:41:35.290
And that seems to be what happened.
The woman of the House,
the Metronome,
uh,

638
00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:36.490
the Matera Familia.

639
00:41:36.491 --> 00:41:40.820
So this particular family who lived in the Ville of the mysteries has set aside

640
00:41:40.821 --> 00:41:43.860
room five as the secret chamber,
uh,

641
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.910
in which she can practice the Dionysiac rituals.

642
00:41:46.911 --> 00:41:51.911
And she can also encourage other women in Pompei to partake of those same

643
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:57.380
rituals.
I just,
just,
I just,
I put on your monument list,

644
00:41:57.381 --> 00:42:02.381
you'll see a image of the drawing of all of these scenes that I've now gone

645
00:42:03.651 --> 00:42:04.640
through in order.

646
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:09.320
And I think it's helpful for you to have that as a reference just to be able to

647
00:42:09.321 --> 00:42:10.970
follow along again,

648
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:16.120
the narrative and where each of the scenes that we've described comes up.

649
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:20.690
And then just one last view of the room as a whole.
Uh,

650
00:42:20.691 --> 00:42:24.710
I bring it back because I just wanted to end our discussion of this particular

651
00:42:24.711 --> 00:42:29.711
monument with the point that this is really quite unique in terms of the

652
00:42:30.591 --> 00:42:33.380
paintings that we've seen thus far this semester.

653
00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:38.120
That is to have a painting with such monumental figures that tells the story

654
00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:40.970
that this particular painting does.
Uh,
and I,

655
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.170
it's such a famous set of paintings that Mo that I think because people know it

656
00:42:45.171 --> 00:42:45.501
so well,

657
00:42:45.501 --> 00:42:49.390
they think we'll let that must be a comparable to other things from Roman times.

658
00:42:49.391 --> 00:42:51.770
But this is the only painting that we have like this.

659
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:54.110
It doesn't mean that there might not have been others,

660
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:57.800
but I think it probably means that there weren't a lot of others,

661
00:42:57.801 --> 00:43:02.801
that this was truly an exceptional work of art that is preserved in the Ville of

662
00:43:02.961 --> 00:43:05.020
the mysteries at Pompei.

663
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.920
I want to show you in the half an hour that remains a,
uh,

664
00:43:09.921 --> 00:43:14.560
a number of other paintings,
much in much less detail,
uh,

665
00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:18.710
but paintings that also are of special subjects that also belong to second,

666
00:43:18.711 --> 00:43:20.180
third or fourth style walls.

667
00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:23.390
And they're particularly interesting in a variety of ways.

668
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.950
The first of these is also mythological in subject matter.

669
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:32.570
I'm going to show you the so called Odyssey paintings.
We're moving back to Rome.

670
00:43:32.571 --> 00:43:36.170
These are located in a house on the Escalade hill,

671
00:43:36.171 --> 00:43:40.430
one of Rome's original seven hills in Rome.
Uh,

672
00:43:40.431 --> 00:43:43.430
and while I don't even think I neglected to give you a date for the mystery

673
00:43:43.431 --> 00:43:47.390
paintings,
but those are 60 to 50,
and these paintings are a little bit later,

674
00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:50.180
52 40 BC.

675
00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:55.690
They are also extremely interesting because they seem to represent,

676
00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.173
uh,

677
00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:02.600
scenes from the 10th and 11th book of Homer's Odyssey.

678
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:07.400
And Vitruvian the architectural theorist writing in the age of Augustus.

679
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:12.500
Truvia tells us that the Greeks were particularly interested in representing the

680
00:44:13.581 --> 00:44:16.370
wanderings of Odysseus in landscapes.

681
00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:20.150
So he tells us it's very important for us to know because it means that the

682
00:44:20.151 --> 00:44:23.000
Greeks painted paintings like this,
uh,

683
00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:26.600
illustrations of a Odysseus's wanderings.

684
00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.180
And yet we see one of these paintings in this house,
uh,

685
00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:35.190
on the eschalon hill in Rome between 50 and 40 BC.

686
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:41.960
The books 10 and 11 focus on Odysseus's coming upon the Lice Oregonians.

687
00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:48.620
I put that name on the monument list for you.
The lice,
draconian,
uh,

688
00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:51.900
and what happens when he meets the lice?
Draconian.
Uh,

689
00:44:51.901 --> 00:44:54.300
and we see one of the scenes here,

690
00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:59.850
we see in fact that several scouts,
uh,
working for Odysseus,

691
00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:02.700
uh,
get off their boats on an island.

692
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:06.810
And they come across this beautiful young woman,
uh,
who is,

693
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.860
who is,
has just fetched,
you can see she's holding a picture.

694
00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:15.780
She has just fetched water from a well and she's walking down this mountain and

695
00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:20.100
she comes upon these scouts of Odysseus.
Uh,
and uh,

696
00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:22.440
being a friendly sort,
she says to them,

697
00:45:22.441 --> 00:45:26.040
I'd like to invite you back to my father's house for dinner.
We'll,

698
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:29.840
her father is a man eating giant,
as are the other lice,

699
00:45:29.841 --> 00:45:34.710
draconian and the scouts fall forward and they come with her to meet her father.

700
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:39.930
And uh,
the father immediately cooks up one of the three for dinner

701
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:46.220
and uh,
other various other adventures,
you know,
happen,
uh,

702
00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.030
on this island.

703
00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:53.520
But what's particularly interesting for us is the fact that uh,
these,

704
00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:54.211
these scenes,

705
00:45:54.211 --> 00:45:58.760
again our from a well known work of literature but the figures are,

706
00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:03.570
are,
are very small in relation to the landscape.
It's clear that the artist,

707
00:46:03.571 --> 00:46:05.430
whether the,
you know,
originally Greek artists,

708
00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:09.270
we're particularly interested in the landscape and the telling of a narrative

709
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:11.100
across that landscape.

710
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:16.350
A landscape that is magnificently rendered as you can see by these artists.

711
00:46:16.351 --> 00:46:20.250
There are a number of scenes still preserved.
Uh,
after that dinner,
by the way,

712
00:46:20.251 --> 00:46:24.920
where,
what are the scouts,
uh,
gets,
um,
gets consumed.
Uh,

713
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:27.350
after that,
the Leister Goni Ian's,
uh,

714
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:31.860
decide that they don't want any more of Odysseus and his and his and his crew

715
00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:35.490
and they take boulders as you can see in this scene here.

716
00:46:35.491 --> 00:46:40.080
And they begin to attack the ships of Odysseus,
destroying most of them.

717
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:43.800
And only the one with Odysseus himself is able to escape.

718
00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:48.570
And He makes his way at that point,
uh,
to the,
uh,
to the,

719
00:46:48.571 --> 00:46:53.220
to another island to meet up with the and chant and chant truss Searcy.

720
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:56.250
So we see all of this very carefully described here.

721
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.280
But as we look at these scenes,
I think were particularly struck,

722
00:46:59.281 --> 00:47:03.450
or at least I'm particularly struck and I would imagine you'll share this by the

723
00:47:03.451 --> 00:47:08.040
interest of this artist in depicting the landscape.
We have an artist,
again,

724
00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:09.740
whether it's the original regardless,

725
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:13.050
but certainly copied here by an artist in Rome.

726
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:17.730
We see an incredible interest in landscape by someone who is clearly not only

727
00:47:17.731 --> 00:47:22.680
looking at earlier models but looking at landscape itself and is very interested

728
00:47:22.681 --> 00:47:25.720
in depicting all kinds of anecdotal details,

729
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:29.540
inlets of water as you can see here,
uh,

730
00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:34.650
rocks and the way in which the rock is cast in shadow on one side and his

731
00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:38.020
lighted on the other,
the way in which branch is bend,

732
00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:41.350
both when people pull on them or when they are,

733
00:47:41.351 --> 00:47:46.120
they are a buffeted by the breeze or by the wind as you can see with that tree

734
00:47:46.121 --> 00:47:48.790
at the upper most part of the peak.
So again,

735
00:47:48.791 --> 00:47:53.380
the artists here particularly interested in nature and in the display of nature

736
00:47:53.381 --> 00:47:58.210
and in that way very comparable to what we saw in Olivia's garden scape at the

737
00:47:58.211 --> 00:48:00.220
villa at Prima Porta.

738
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:04.530
I mentioned already that,

739
00:48:04.531 --> 00:48:09.040
that it is believed that these paintings on the Escalade hill are based on

740
00:48:09.041 --> 00:48:14.041
Hellenistic Greek models that probably were made in about 150 BC.

741
00:48:14.861 --> 00:48:15.790
So a copy.

742
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000
And in that regard should strike you as very much the same trend as we've seen

743
00:48:21.341 --> 00:48:24.220
so often in the beginning of this semester,
uh,

744
00:48:24.221 --> 00:48:29.221
of the Romans looking back and admiring Greek art and incorporating it,

745
00:48:29.711 --> 00:48:34.711
a kind of Hellenization of Roman art and architecture because of this reverends

746
00:48:34.961 --> 00:48:39.880
and because of this incorporation of earlier Greek,
uh,
scenes and prototypes.

747
00:48:39.881 --> 00:48:41.860
And so we see that here.
And one,

748
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:46.720
there are three reasons that scholars believe that what we're looking at here is

749
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:50.230
based very closely on a Greek model.
Uh,

750
00:48:50.231 --> 00:48:53.760
one of those is that passage in Bertrubias that I already mentioned that the

751
00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:58.090
Truvia is tells us that the Greeks were particularly interested in representing

752
00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.810
a scenes from the odyssey against the landscape background.

753
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:06.760
So that certainly tells us that it's likely that these are based on,
uh,
on,

754
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:10.780
uh,
earlier,
uh,
Greek originals.
The second has to do,

755
00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:14.650
you've probably noticed this with the fact that many of the figures in these

756
00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:18.820
paintings are labeled a,
and those labels are,

757
00:49:18.821 --> 00:49:21.730
if you look very closely,
you will see in Greek.

758
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.040
And not only are they in Greek,

759
00:49:24.041 --> 00:49:27.100
but some of the words are misspelled.

760
00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:31.120
So since those words are misspelled,
it has been speculated.
And I think,
again,

761
00:49:31.121 --> 00:49:34.300
quite convincingly that those are who are misspelling them,

762
00:49:34.301 --> 00:49:37.120
don't really know Greek,
uh,
and maybe,
uh,

763
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:41.020
Roman artists who are not familiar with that language or copying it and making

764
00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.760
mistakes in the process.

765
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:47.410
So that also suggests to us that earlier Greek models are being looked at,

766
00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:52.690
absorbed and even copied here,
but most interesting of all for us,

767
00:49:52.691 --> 00:49:55.160
efficient autos of the second style,
uh,

768
00:49:55.161 --> 00:49:59.660
is the fact that very careful,
uh,
uh,

769
00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:05.620
the archeologists who have looked at these with great care have determined that

770
00:50:05.621 --> 00:50:08.930
the landscape scenes that we've studied,
uh,

771
00:50:08.931 --> 00:50:13.390
our continuous beneath the columns,
that when they copied these,

772
00:50:13.391 --> 00:50:17.830
they copied,
perhaps they had a scroll,
uh,
that they had from somewhere else.

773
00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:18.780
A Greek scroll.

774
00:50:18.781 --> 00:50:23.290
It came from a library that had images on it and they unfurled that scroll and

775
00:50:23.291 --> 00:50:26.320
they copied it here.
They did that first they copied.

776
00:50:26.321 --> 00:50:31.321
So we had a landscape scene and it was only after that landscape scene was

777
00:50:32.421 --> 00:50:37.421
painted that the artists went back and painted the columns on top.

778
00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:41.000
They put these Greek paintings of,

779
00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:46.010
or copies of these Greek paintings of Odysseus's wanderings based on this Greek

780
00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:48.830
prototype of the mid second century BC.

781
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:54.390
They put it into a Roman context by providing these second,

782
00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.110
uh,
style wall,

783
00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:02.120
second style columns or Pilasters pilasters I believe blasters.
Uh,

784
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:07.150
by creating these second stop pilasters and making this into a vista or panorama

785
00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:11.430
that would have been seen through the window in a sense of a,

786
00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:16.530
a second style painting.
So it's a Roman ization,
uh,
of a,
uh,

787
00:51:16.531 --> 00:51:19.680
of an original Greek painting in,

788
00:51:19.681 --> 00:51:23.630
in an extraordinary way that tells us a good deal about how the Romans were

789
00:51:23.631 --> 00:51:28.580
thinking about,
uh,
these Greek prototypes at this particular juncture.

790
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:32.500
I showed you last time the villa at applaud this,

791
00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:34.670
the call Darian eight.
Uh,

792
00:51:34.671 --> 00:51:39.110
and we looked at the soffit of called Doriam eight,

793
00:51:39.111 --> 00:51:44.111
and we saw a floating mythological figures and we saw women in niches with

794
00:51:44.541 --> 00:51:48.090
shells at the top.
And I pointed out to you at that time,
uh,

795
00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:53.140
that we also have a number of small panel pictures representing,

796
00:51:53.721 --> 00:51:56.450
still lives with fruit and the like.
Uh,

797
00:51:56.451 --> 00:52:01.451
and these get in a sense get lost in the overall scheme of these second,

798
00:52:01.671 --> 00:52:06.110
third and fourth style walls.
But they're very interesting if we look at them in,

799
00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:11.000
in greater detail.
And I want to show you just a two examples today.

800
00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.770
This is a a,

801
00:52:12.771 --> 00:52:16.640
it's blown up obviously way beyond the size that it was a,

802
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:19.580
but it gives you some sense of what these look like in detail.

803
00:52:19.581 --> 00:52:24.581
It's a still life painting that comes from the villa of Julia Félix in Pompei

804
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:28.880
which dates to around 50 BC.

805
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:34.510
And we added probably we do believe that it is a detail from a second style

806
00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:39.200
wall.
Uh,
and we look at that detail here and we see that these,

807
00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:42.500
for those of you who enjoy modern art,
for example,

808
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:47.770
I think you'll agree that this is as tends to be as modern as Roman art gets a,

809
00:52:48.501 --> 00:52:52.220
because we see it has a very contemporary appearance.

810
00:52:52.221 --> 00:52:54.860
I think this particular still life painting,

811
00:52:54.861 --> 00:52:59.360
we see that the artist has shown a striking,
a penchant for,

812
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:03.980
or sensitivity for composition,
uh,
for light.

813
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:09.010
The way in which light falls on objects of that are made of different materials,

814
00:53:09.981 --> 00:53:12.160
be it metal or stone.
Uh,

815
00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:16.040
the artists has shown that kind of sensitivity I think here as well as to

816
00:53:16.041 --> 00:53:21.041
composition the way in which a group of objects are composed in relationship to

817
00:53:21.231 --> 00:53:22.064
one another.

818
00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:25.410
If we look at this painting I think will agree it's quite a tour de force.

819
00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:30.390
We see,
uh,
some interesting things which are not that easy to decipher.
A,

820
00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.070
we see over here,
for example,

821
00:53:32.071 --> 00:53:35.730
a cloth with fringe that hangs on a nail on the wall.

822
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:40.830
We see over here also hanging on the wall for dead birds.

823
00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:46.730
We see a plate of oval plate of what seemed to be eggs.

824
00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:50.700
Uh,
we see a picture over here,
which again,

825
00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:55.650
it looks like a metal picture bathed in light on one side with a handle.

826
00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:59.550
And then we see here what it looks like.
Some kind of a beaker with a,

827
00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:04.580
something that may have been used to stir whatever liquid was inside all of this

828
00:54:04.771 --> 00:54:09.720
on the stone pedestal.
And then leaning against that stone pedestal.

829
00:54:09.721 --> 00:54:13.740
We see a one of these clay amp clay,
uh,
vessels,

830
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:17.550
which seems to have an inscription on that clay vessel.

831
00:54:17.551 --> 00:54:20.160
So what is this a still life painting?

832
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.780
Is it just meant to be a mix of objects that would be found in the kitchen of a

833
00:54:24.781 --> 00:54:29.760
house or is it something more than that?
Do these have meanings beyond that?

834
00:54:29.761 --> 00:54:32.580
Is there some religious symbolism here?
For example,

835
00:54:32.581 --> 00:54:37.440
this is not easy to decipher and no one really has done that satisfactorily up

836
00:54:37.441 --> 00:54:38.274
to this point,

837
00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.840
but it's something that one would want to keep in mind as one thinks about the

838
00:54:42.841 --> 00:54:45.510
meaning of the still life paintings.
And keep in mind,
again,

839
00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:48.120
if you think back to a room like the flexion room,

840
00:54:48.121 --> 00:54:51.630
there are a number of these small panel paintings in the ECC on room.

841
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:54.900
When you look at the room as a whole,
these are not easy to see.
They're,

842
00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:58.200
they're so small that they're lost in the overall scheme.

843
00:54:58.201 --> 00:55:00.370
So you'd really have to go up very close,
uh,

844
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:02.910
to these if you could even reach them.
If they're way up in the top,

845
00:55:02.911 --> 00:55:05.580
it would be difficult.
But if they're down below,
go up close,

846
00:55:05.581 --> 00:55:10.290
look at them and try to figure out for yourself exactly what is going on here.

847
00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:14.520
Another one,
uh,
from,
in this case from Herculaneum,

848
00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:19.350
which is not not so ingeniously called a still life painting with peaches and

849
00:55:19.351 --> 00:55:23.040
glass jar,
but that's very descriptive.
That's exactly what it depicts,

850
00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:28.310
which is later in data around 62 to 79 and probably it was a panel in either a

851
00:55:29.011 --> 00:55:31.170
third or a fourth style,

852
00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:35.670
a Roman Roman painting,
more Roman painted wall.
Uh,

853
00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:38.640
we see two tiers here.
We indeed do see,
uh,

854
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:42.690
peaches and the artist again has really looked at peaches to depict this,

855
00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:47.940
shows the peaches on the vine with the leaves as you can see here and wants to

856
00:55:47.941 --> 00:55:50.820
make sure that we know what a peach looks like inside as well.

857
00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:55.820
So has cut a section off one of these and shows the pit inside just to make sure

858
00:55:56.581 --> 00:56:00.960
that we get a full sense of,
of how peaches grow,
uh,
and uh,

859
00:56:00.961 --> 00:56:02.160
of what happens when you,

860
00:56:02.161 --> 00:56:06.510
when you open a peach and then down here below a glass vase.

861
00:56:06.511 --> 00:56:10.740
And you can see that the artist has filled that boss halfway with water so that

862
00:56:10.741 --> 00:56:15.480
he can explore the effects of light on that water and the reflection of that

863
00:56:15.481 --> 00:56:20.130
water on the glass vase itself.
So clearly,
again,

864
00:56:20.131 --> 00:56:21.380
artists that there,
there,

865
00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:25.780
there may be other reasons that a juxtapose these particular items,

866
00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:29.710
these reasons that may be beyond our comprehension,
uh,
today.

867
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:32.710
But while they may do that for ritual or other reasons,

868
00:56:32.711 --> 00:56:37.480
they also are clearly very concerned with just exploring composition,
light,
uh,

869
00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:40.270
and so on and so forth.
As I said before,
which is a very,

870
00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:43.030
which is a very modern thing to do.

871
00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:48.880
We also see among the paintings that I've called special subjects today,

872
00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.260
a genre scenes,

873
00:56:50.261 --> 00:56:54.160
scenes that represent daily life in palm pay or Herculaneum.

874
00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:56.830
I'll show you just one of those here.

875
00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:59.750
It is a painting of [inaudible].

876
00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:04.180
We usually call it a painting of a magistrate distributing free bread.

877
00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:08.810
And it comes from house seven,
three 30 in Pompei,

878
00:57:09.090 --> 00:57:14.090
a wall painting from seven three 30 and Pompei dates to around d 70.

879
00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:16.330
And what's depicted here,

880
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:20.740
whether the magistrate is distributing free bread or it's bread being sold,

881
00:57:20.741 --> 00:57:22.060
we're not absolutely sure,

882
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:26.380
but what you can see here is piles and piles of round breads that are being

883
00:57:26.381 --> 00:57:31.250
distributed to those who stand in front of the,
uh,

884
00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:35.380
bread stand.
And I can show you a detail also of the same,

885
00:57:35.381 --> 00:57:37.900
where you can get a better sense of the shape of the breads.

886
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:41.210
You remember the petrified,
petrified bread,
uh,

887
00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:44.530
that we looked at from Pompei and the,
um,

888
00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:49.290
the division into shapes that make it resemble a pizza.
Uh,

889
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:52.300
the same kinds of breads can be seen here in,
it's those,

890
00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:56.890
that bread that is being distributed to these people down below.
While this,

891
00:57:56.950 --> 00:58:01.150
while this painting comes from a house,
uh,
there,
uh,
you know,

892
00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.570
and it may have been,
you know,

893
00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:06.970
may have just referred to the particular profession of someone who lived in that

894
00:58:06.971 --> 00:58:09.940
house,
but paintings like this we believe,

895
00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:13.240
and it may or may not have been the case with this one,
could also have,

896
00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:16.870
we're were also used as shop signs to advertise,
uh,

897
00:58:16.871 --> 00:58:20.140
what was being sold in one of those to bear.
And I,
uh,

898
00:58:20.141 --> 00:58:25.141
that opened off off that often opened off houses in places like palm pay and

899
00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:29.530
Herculaneum.
And that may have been the case here as well.

900
00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:34.450
Just a few words about what we might call history painting.
Uh,

901
00:58:34.451 --> 00:58:35.950
among the Romans.

902
00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:41.160
This is a fascinating and very famous painting of the amphitheater at palm pay.

903
00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:44.290
You see it on the lefthand side of the screen that comes from house one,

904
00:58:44.291 --> 00:58:49.291
three 23 in palm pay and dates to between 59 and 70 ady.

905
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:55.450
And it purports not only to represent,
uh,
the Pompei amphitheater,

906
00:58:55.451 --> 00:58:56.950
which I remind you of here.

907
00:58:56.951 --> 00:59:01.951
And you'll recall the very distinctive staircase of the amphitheater pump pay.

908
00:59:02.711 --> 00:59:07.570
And you can see how carefully that is rendered here by the artist to make sure

909
00:59:07.571 --> 00:59:11.410
that we know this is indeed the amphitheater at Pompei.

910
00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:15.370
It purports to represent a very famous historical event,

911
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:18.670
at least for it,
at least in terms of local history.

912
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.630
And that is a brawl that broke between the palm pains and a,

913
00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:24.130
uh,

914
00:59:24.130 --> 00:59:28.340
another group of individuals who lived in the area called the nutrients and u c

915
00:59:28.341 --> 00:59:31.610
e r I a,
n s upon pains and the nutrients,

916
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:33.470
a brawl broke out between them.

917
00:59:33.471 --> 00:59:38.300
You can see that brawl being represented in the oval arena.
There,

918
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:43.450
the brawl was so serious that the local magistrates decided to punish both the

919
00:59:44.611 --> 00:59:48.620
palm pains and the nutrients and they did something quite extraordinary.

920
00:59:48.621 --> 00:59:53.621
And that is that they decided to close down the amphitheater in palm pay for 10

921
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:57.210
years.
Count them.
I mean,
can you imagine,
uh,

922
00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.620
the city of palm pay without an amphitheater for 10 years.

923
01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:05.420
That was a very brutal,
uh,
punishment,
but it seems to have happened,
uh,

924
01:00:05.421 --> 01:00:10.100
and it is memorialize that very event is memorialized in this painting,

925
01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:14.780
in this house at Pompei.
This painting is also very valuable.

926
01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:17.810
I think I've mentioned this to you before is also very valuable,

927
01:00:17.811 --> 01:00:22.730
not only for showing us the shape of the,
uh,
of the,
uh,
amphitheater,

928
01:00:22.731 --> 01:00:26.210
which of course is,
you know,
still survives the oval shape and the seating,

929
01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.750
but for an a,
for a detail that doesn't still survive.

930
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:33.510
And that is the awning I mentioned to you that an amphitheater design,
uh,

931
01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:38.000
they put poles at the very upper most part of the amphitheater and they would,

932
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:43.030
were able to put an awning on those poles to protect people in inclement

933
01:00:43.491 --> 01:00:43.881
weather.

934
01:00:43.881 --> 01:00:48.881
And we see the representation or only preserved representation in paint a of one

935
01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:52.210
of these awnings.
Uh,

936
01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:56.870
so again is very valuable in terms of helping us understand a amphitheater

937
01:00:56.871 --> 01:00:57.704
design.

938
01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:02.690
The last two paintings I want to show you today are both portrait paintings.

939
01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:06.860
And you have to think of these portrait paintings like the mythological panel

940
01:01:06.861 --> 01:01:11.170
pictures as paintings that were inserted into walls,
uh,

941
01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:12.860
inserted into a,

942
01:01:12.861 --> 01:01:17.090
you probably mostly third and fourth style Roman walls.

943
01:01:17.091 --> 01:01:21.170
And when all of when those treasure hunters hit Pompeii and Herculaneum,

944
01:01:21.171 --> 01:01:23.150
these were the ones they went to first.

945
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:27.920
They cut a fair number of these out of their original context and,

946
01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.020
and made off with them.
But some of them,

947
01:01:30.021 --> 01:01:32.330
fortunately you have found their way into,

948
01:01:32.331 --> 01:01:34.970
especially into the Naples archeological museum.

949
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:39.770
This is the first one that I want to show you an absolutely fetching a portrait

950
01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.510
of a young woman from Pompei.
Uh,

951
01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:45.920
that dates to around the middle of the first century,

952
01:01:45.921 --> 01:01:50.510
a d that is 45 to 50 a d.
Uh,

953
01:01:50.511 --> 01:01:54.050
and we see it here and it's a,
it's a,
it's a,
it's an incredible,
uh,

954
01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.750
painted portrait by clearly once again,

955
01:01:56.751 --> 01:02:01.751
a very talented artist who's done an extraordinary job of capturing this woman.

956
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:06.380
It's a very,
very,
very,
uh,
appealing portrait.
We see her.

957
01:02:06.381 --> 01:02:09.660
She's quite attractive young woman with wide,
uh,

958
01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:14.570
sort of Hazel colored eyes,
a sharp straight brows,
um,

959
01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:19.800
straight nose of sort of a cupid cupid's lips.
As you see down below,

960
01:02:19.801 --> 01:02:23.830
the hair is magnificently rendered.
You can see that she has,
uh,

961
01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:27.030
a bevy of corkscrew curls.
Those,

962
01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:32.070
the front toward the front of her face are highlighted and match very well.

963
01:02:32.131 --> 01:02:37.131
The color of her eyes that she wears gold hoop earrings that also mimic the curl

964
01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:39.930
accuse of her locks.

965
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.410
And then you can see also that she wears something that appears to have been

966
01:02:43.411 --> 01:02:46.920
fashionable to wear among Roman and Pompei and women.

967
01:02:46.921 --> 01:02:50.460
And that is a gold hairnet at the very apex,

968
01:02:50.461 --> 01:02:52.470
which adds a shine and,
and,

969
01:02:52.530 --> 01:02:57.510
and a glimmer to her port to the hair.
Uh,
but also you can see the hair,

970
01:02:57.511 --> 01:03:00.330
but beneath it threw that down below.

971
01:03:00.331 --> 01:03:03.620
You can see she wears a green garment and a,
a,

972
01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:08.640
a sort of purple or brownish mantle over her shoulder and she holds a stylist to

973
01:03:11.401 --> 01:03:15.990
her lips and she has in her other hand,
uh,
a,
um,

974
01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:17.240
a,
uh,

975
01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:21.510
as you can see a tablet in front of her and she is,

976
01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.990
it is clear as she puts that stylist to her lip,
she has deepened thought,

977
01:03:24.991 --> 01:03:26.370
very pensive,
uh,

978
01:03:26.371 --> 01:03:31.020
figuring out what it is that she's going to write on her wax tablet because

979
01:03:31.021 --> 01:03:36.021
these were wax and they would write into the wax tablets because she is caught

980
01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:39.150
in this moment of a deep thought.

981
01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:44.130
A number of scholars have suggested that she must represent the Greek Poetess

982
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.510
Sappho.
Uh,

983
01:03:45.511 --> 01:03:49.980
which is why I put that painted portrait of Sappho on your monument list.

984
01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:52.110
But you can see I've put Safo in quote marks.

985
01:03:52.111 --> 01:03:56.160
I think this is almost certainly not Sappho.
Uh,

986
01:03:56.161 --> 01:04:00.900
it is probably a palm pay in woman and she may not be thinking about the poetry

987
01:04:00.901 --> 01:04:03.990
that she's about to write,
but perhaps the shopping list,
uh,

988
01:04:03.991 --> 01:04:08.991
that she's putting together before she makes her way down to the central market

989
01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:13.920
of the city of palm pay or sends her slave to go down to the central market of

990
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:17.640
the city of palm pay.
But it may also be that she was literate,
uh,

991
01:04:17.641 --> 01:04:20.910
and that she wants to underscore the fact that she was literate.

992
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:26.150
It may also be that this was just a set way of representing women in portraiture

993
01:04:26.971 --> 01:04:31.440
and palm pay because this is not the only portrait we have of a woman with her

994
01:04:31.441 --> 01:04:35.400
stylist to her lips and her tablets in our hands.
Here's a,

995
01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:40.440
another portrait that we have also from palm pay with a woman represented in

996
01:04:40.441 --> 01:04:41.850
exactly the same way.

997
01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:47.030
This portrait is from house seven to 60 and dates to around 62 to 79.

998
01:04:49.951 --> 01:04:54.951
A d the portrait of a woman and presumably her husband by her side.

999
01:04:55.231 --> 01:04:59.430
She again has the stylist to her lip.
She has the tablet down below.

1000
01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:03.590
You can see that he holds a scroll,
which has a,
um,

1001
01:05:04.270 --> 01:05:07.450
a red place marker,
uh,
up above a.

1002
01:05:07.451 --> 01:05:12.240
So this portrait of the two of them may either a allude to the fact that they

1003
01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:17.130
are both literate,
that they can both read and write.
It's also possible that the,

1004
01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:17.680
uh,

1005
01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:22.660
that the scroll that he holds may indicate that he's a magistrate or lastly,

1006
01:05:22.661 --> 01:05:26.050
and one of the more popular solutions is that this May,

1007
01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:30.730
he may be holding the marriage certificate,
the marriage between the two.

1008
01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:33.070
Uh,
the portraits are very interesting.

1009
01:05:33.071 --> 01:05:38.071
You can see that she isn't quite as gorgeous as her other counterpart.

1010
01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:41.630
Um,
her hair is not a range in those wonderful,
uh,

1011
01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:46.650
golden locks but are kind of frizzy over her forehead and down her neck.

1012
01:05:47.021 --> 01:05:51.490
As you can see here,
her ears stick out to you as a unit brow.
Uh,
but she's,
she's,

1013
01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:56.520
she's more than happy to be represented as she was preserved for posterity as

1014
01:05:56.801 --> 01:06:00.640
she was a along with her husband over here.

1015
01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:01.930
And if you look at the portrait,

1016
01:06:01.931 --> 01:06:06.520
you will see again that it has a black frame around it.
And then a Maroon frame,

1017
01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:10.780
which tells us again that this was inserted into a wall,

1018
01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:13.310
a third or fourth style wall.
Uh,

1019
01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:18.290
just like the mythological paintings were inserted into those walls,
uh,

1020
01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:19.520
as a,
uh,

1021
01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:23.800
as a painting that was located in the center of that wall.

1022
01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:26.890
And in this case emphasized,
uh,
the,

1023
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:31.450
the owners of this particular house,
uh,
and their,
uh,

1024
01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:36.150
their undying love for each other.
Their relationship honors their marriage,
uh,

1025
01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:41.220
and served as a kind of counterpart to a portrait of the loving couple that one

1026
01:06:41.471 --> 01:06:45.910
might put on a mantle piece or on a piano in one's house today.

1027
01:06:45.911 --> 01:06:49.030
So you have to think of it as quite comparable to that.
Again,

1028
01:06:49.031 --> 01:06:50.360
when you wander through Pompei,

1029
01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:54.220
you don't see many of these portraits and C2 in large part because they were so

1030
01:06:54.221 --> 01:06:58.900
popular with treasure hunters.
But fortunately,
we do have a few preserved,

1031
01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:02.440
uh,
in,
uh,
from both Pompei and Herculaneum.

1032
01:07:02.441 --> 01:07:06.820
And those can be seen in museums like Naples today.
Thank you.
