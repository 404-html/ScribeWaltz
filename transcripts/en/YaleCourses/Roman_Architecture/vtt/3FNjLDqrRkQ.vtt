1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.363
Good morning.

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.690
The title of today's lecture is home town boy honoring an emperors roots in

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.170
Roman North Africa.
And who was that hometown boy?

4
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:19.020
We met him before we met him in the last lecture.

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.410
His name was Lucius Septimius severities and he was emperor of Rome between one

6
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:27.840
93 and two 11 a d.

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.200
And we saw him in this extraordinary round painting on wood,

8
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.080
uh,
that comes from Egypt and is now in the museum in Berlin.

9
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.010
That depicts Lucia Septum,
me saveras with his family.

10
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.430
You see September you severity on the right hand side of the screen.

11
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.830
You see his wife,
Julia,

12
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:51.510
Donna on the left with her famous wigs and pearls,

13
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:55.620
wig and pearls.
And then down below their two sons gate,

14
00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.690
a carer color over here on the right and gator who's faced has been a race

15
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:02.280
because of the dog,

16
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:07.281
not too memoria that was voted him by the Senate at his death.

17
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.570
We learned that Julia Domino's came from Syria.
She was the wife,

18
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.760
she was the daughter of a priest by the name of bossiness and Septimius severity

19
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.450
came from North Africa.

20
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.260
He was the third Roman emperor to be from somewhere other than Italy.

21
00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:28.530
You'll recall that Trajan and Hadrian came from Spain.

22
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.740
Cep to me is severity from North Africa and after he ascended to the throne,

23
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.140
uh,
and after he began his,

24
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.120
his reign and with all the interesting things that he initiated as emperor,

25
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.530
he was honored by his hometown,
his hometown boys often are,

26
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.860
and the city of lept is Magdna was renovated quite sick quite significantly

27
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.550
during his reign.

28
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.020
And it's to that renovation and to the history of leftist Maga in general and

29
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:01.350
its architecture that I want to turn today.

30
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.630
Before I do that,
however,

31
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:07.230
it's important for us to get a sense of this part of the world,

32
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:11.010
this part of the world before the Romans took over.
Uh,

33
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.390
and any of you who are working on term papers that are on,

34
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.160
uh,

35
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.160
works of architecture in the provinces or are designing a Roman city in anywhere

36
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:23.010
other than Italy,

37
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.000
have definitely found out that in order to analyze those,

38
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:29.910
in order to think about them and figure out what's happening,

39
00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:34.230
you have to not only look at what's going on in the center of the Empire that is

40
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:38.340
in Rome and what may have been sent from the center out to the periphery,

41
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.640
but you also have to understand what was going on in the local area in which

42
00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:47.910
that building was built,
the local culture,

43
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:51.740
the civilizations that proceeded the Roman civilization.
Uh,

44
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:56.370
and what's fascinating about provincial Roman architecture is the way in which

45
00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:58.110
those two things come together.

46
00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:02.890
That is what comes from Rome to the frontiers,

47
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.900
but also the indigenous culture that mixes with what comes from Rome to make

48
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:11.200
something unique in the case of each of these provinces.

49
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.230
So it's absolutely critical for us to understand,
uh,

50
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.950
the area that we're looking at it,
in this case,

51
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.930
a Roman north Africa before the Romans got to,

52
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.470
uh,
the north northern part of Africa.
Uh,

53
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.440
it was an area that was overseeing primarily by Carthage.

54
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:37.060
There was a very significant Carthaginian period in this part of the world.

55
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.570
Uh,

56
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.570
the language was a neo Punic and burbur before it was Latin and neo Punic stays

57
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:49.660
on even when Latin becomes important.
Here there was,

58
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:51.940
the Greeks did have some impact,

59
00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:55.600
but they didn't have as strong a foothold in this particular part of the world

60
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:56.890
as they did elsewhere.

61
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.460
And then eventually the area is colonized by Rome and begins to be,

62
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:07.090
and Roman colonies begin to be built here.
Uh,

63
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.480
it all over the northern part of Africa.

64
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.750
I show you here a map of the western empire where we see,

65
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.140
uh,

66
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.810
not only places that we've already studied Rome and Ostia and palm pay,

67
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.870
uh,
but also down here,
uh,
the continent of Africa.

68
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.440
You see it here.
Uh,
and the cities that we're going to be talking about,

69
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:32.920
there was lots of,
there were lots of Roman cities in this part of the world,

70
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.450
but the two that we're going to be focusing on today are the city of Tim Gad,

71
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.620
which you see over here.
And then the city of lept is Magdna.

72
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.110
And please note while the map is on the screen,

73
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:47.290
that lept is Magdna is right on the coast.
In fact,

74
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:52.000
it was an extremely important seaport,
which is one of the reasons that it grew,

75
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.290
grew in to,

76
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.670
to the size and significance that it did have in ancient times.

77
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.850
Tim Gat a little bit further into the mainland of North Africa.

78
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.680
And you can also see of course the relationship when you think of is Magdna as a

79
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:10.660
port.
You can see the relationship,

80
00:05:10.661 --> 00:05:14.740
the easy relationship in the sense that it had to other major ports in Roman

81
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:16.810
times,
specifically Ostia and how,

82
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:21.220
how easy it clearly was a descend things from one place to another,

83
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:25.930
which again led,
uh,
to the efflorescence of Leptin is Magdna.

84
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.410
Now,
the reason I've chosen these particular cities,

85
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:32.050
we're going to be talking primarily about Leptin is today.

86
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:36.760
But the reason that I've also chosen to look at Tim Gat is because they make a

87
00:05:36.761 --> 00:05:39.430
very interesting contrast to one another.

88
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:43.150
Both of them have extraordinarily WellPreserved Roman remains,

89
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.450
but they're interesting to play off against one another.

90
00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:48.030
Because the city of leftist modern,

91
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.930
and this is extremely important in analyzing it,

92
00:05:50.931 --> 00:05:55.931
the city of lept is Magdna had a longer Roman history.

93
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:57.730
It was already,
uh,

94
00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.350
we it to had a Carthaginian period.
Uh,

95
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.480
but most important in this regard was the fact that the Romans began to build.

96
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:11.420
They're already in the first century.
BC is,
we shall see.

97
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.630
It was built up under Augustus,
then under Hadrian,

98
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.430
a renovated under Septicemia Savara.
So there's not only the local,

99
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:22.480
the local,
uh,
structures and buildings and,

100
00:06:22.481 --> 00:06:24.830
and customs and so on to contend with,

101
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.730
but also earlier Roman architecture.
By the time we get to the time of September,

102
00:06:29.731 --> 00:06:32.330
the severity,
in the case of Tim Gad,

103
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:35.090
the city was built entirely from scratch.

104
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:39.080
There was nothing on the site when Trajan founded the city.

105
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:44.081
As a Roman colony in 100 and 100 Aad and it was at that time that the Romans

106
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.870
laid out their ideal plan.

107
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.440
And what we're looking at here is a view from the air of Tim Gad as it would've

108
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.351
looked after.

109
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:58.790
It was laid out by Trajan in 100 as it continues to look today,

110
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:03.791
we are looking down from the air and we see here one of the best examples that I

111
00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:07.940
have been able to show you this semester of the way in which the Romans,

112
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.670
when they are left to their own devices,
when there are no earlier,
uh,

113
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.440
structures that they need to contend with,
no earlier customs on the site,

114
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.770
earlier temples and the like that they need to contend with.

115
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.220
This is what they do when they build their ideal Roman city.

116
00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:27.221
And you can see it as exactly as we described it in the mid fourth century BC at

117
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:32.060
Ostia.
That is a costume plan.
It's laid out like a military camp,

118
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.380
very regular,

119
00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:38.381
either rectangular or square as you see it here it is surrounded by city walls.

120
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.190
It has the two main streets,
the carto and the deck.

121
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:46.460
You Montas exactly in the center of the city,

122
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.910
intersecting with one another at the center of the city.

123
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.150
And then right at that intersection as was customary for Roman town planning of

124
00:07:57.021 --> 00:07:58.130
this cost from type,

125
00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:01.850
they have placed the forum right at the intersection of those two and you can

126
00:08:01.851 --> 00:08:06.740
see it here also from the air.
The forum has a great open rectangular space.

127
00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:09.530
It has a basilica,
it has a temple on one short,

128
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:13.550
and I'm not going to show you that,
uh,
that forum in any deep,

129
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.370
I'm not going to show it to you at all except for what you see here.

130
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.720
But it is very,
it is a similar to others that we've seen.

131
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.970
We can also see from the air,

132
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
the theater of the city of Leptin is a city of Tim gap also taking it's

133
00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:34.070
customary shape.
Uh,
and in this case,
again,
very close to the forum.

134
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.010
But as you look at the rest of this from the air,
you can see again,

135
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:40.790
not only is it a regular is the whole city irregular shape,

136
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.460
but it has been laid out within the city,
uh,

137
00:08:43.461 --> 00:08:47.630
in very regular into lie or blocks with the streets.

138
00:08:47.631 --> 00:08:52.460
Very straight as again,
the Romans were want to do the city of Tim.
God,

139
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:57.180
by the way,
is located in the high plains of what is Algeria today,

140
00:08:57.181 --> 00:08:59.760
just for you to get your bearings in terms of,
uh,

141
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.470
the modern location of this city.
What,

142
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.660
what I hope you can also see from this view,
from the air,
if you look very,

143
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:09.570
very closely at the individual streets,

144
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:14.190
and especially this one right here,
you will see perhaps it's clearest over here.

145
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.450
You will see that one of the ways in which this however differs from a town like

146
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:22.980
Ostia and the way Osteo was laid out is although the general layout is

147
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:26.880
comparable,
the city streets are lined with columns.

148
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:29.280
We talked about the fact that colonated streets,

149
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:33.420
we never see colonated streets in Rome or in Italy,

150
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:38.580
but we do see them quite extensively in the provinces.
This is a,
this is a,

151
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:40.950
an area that is part of the western provinces,

152
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:45.090
but we see them also even more extensively in the eastern provinces.

153
00:09:45.091 --> 00:09:48.380
So you see this colonated,
it's very dramatic,
uh,

154
00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:53.490
colonated street and I can show you a detail of one of the colonated streets of

155
00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:56.910
the city of Tim Gad as it looks today.

156
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.880
And you can see the effect that putting those columns,

157
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.360
the punctuation points of those columns along the way,

158
00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:06.360
which actually adds to it makes the Vista,
uh,

159
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.960
that one sees from one part of the street to another.
Uh,
very,

160
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:14.961
very interesting and deed as those columns in the sense of March toward the arch

161
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.370
that you see at the end here.

162
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.760
I'm going to show you that arch just as the one example of a monument in the

163
00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:26.250
city of Leptin is Magdna.
It's very well preserved.

164
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:30.180
It's usually called the arch of Trajan because Trajan was the one to have

165
00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:32.490
founded this particular city.

166
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:36.930
But it is almost certainly not an arch of Trajan since we believe it was put up

167
00:10:36.931 --> 00:10:39.600
in the late second century a d.

168
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:45.530
But we still call it the arch of Trajan cause that's it's conventional name.
Uh,

169
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:50.400
and I can show you a detail of that arch as it looks today on the screen.

170
00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:54.120
And I think it's interesting to compare it to another in this case,

171
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.890
early third century arch,
the arch of September,

172
00:10:56.891 --> 00:10:58.800
he is severity in the Roman forum,

173
00:10:58.801 --> 00:11:02.670
put up to September [inaudible] Parthian victories in the eastern part of the

174
00:11:02.671 --> 00:11:05.130
empire that we looked at last time.

175
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.730
And I think you'll see immediately why I've chosen to pair those two,

176
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:11.760
not only because they're roughly comparable in date,

177
00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:13.690
but because both of them have,
uh,

178
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.940
a triple bay triple bays is central,
a very central,

179
00:11:17.941 --> 00:11:22.770
large archi weighted bay to smaller RQ weighted Bay's one on either side.

180
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.140
And since the building that you see here,

181
00:11:25.141 --> 00:11:28.200
we believe dates to the late second century Aad.

182
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.870
And this building is not until the early third century ID two oh three,

183
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:37.890
two oh three had to be precise.
It is another example.

184
00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:39.390
I mentioned this last time.

185
00:11:39.391 --> 00:11:42.780
I talked about the fact that the arch in the Roman forum,

186
00:11:42.781 --> 00:11:46.370
the Archer Septimius Severus and the Roman forum is our first uh,

187
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:51.440
preserved Roman arch with a triple RQ weighted bay in Rome.

188
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.980
Uh,
but that there are,
there is,

189
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.030
there was an earlier example that I showed you in the south of France at a place

190
00:11:58.031 --> 00:12:00.840
called old wrongs and what is now provost,
uh,

191
00:12:00.841 --> 00:12:03.850
where we seem to have a tie Berian arch,

192
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.660
a Tiberian arch that is also triple Bates.
So I raised the,

193
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.580
the point with you that it,

194
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:14.500
that while we usually think of ideas flowing from the center to the periphery,

195
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.020
uh,

196
00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:20.020
this may be an instance where certain ideas are developed first in the provinces

197
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.210
and then make their way to Rome.

198
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:27.390
Or it is also possible that there may have been triple RQ weighted arches in

199
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:30.880
Rome that no longer survive today,
that we don't know about.

200
00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:33.640
That might have been earlier than the early third century.

201
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:37.390
But the fact that here we have another example in one of the province is a

202
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:39.850
completely different part of the world,
but,
uh,

203
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.710
the western province is nonetheless,

204
00:12:41.711 --> 00:12:46.010
we have another example of a triple archi weighted bay arch,
uh,

205
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.100
that was put up prior to the arch of Septimius Rivera's in the Roman forum.

206
00:12:51.221 --> 00:12:56.200
So it just,
it just,
uh,
it just makes us think even more so,

207
00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.120
uh,
that,
that this idea was floating around the empire earlier,

208
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:06.190
clearly than the time of Septimius Riveras and makes it more possible that the

209
00:13:06.191 --> 00:13:09.130
idea may have begun in the,
in,
in,
in,

210
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.550
in the provinces rather than in Rome itself.

211
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.200
The other major difference between this arch and the arch of Septimius

212
00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:20.410
severities and the Roman forum,
well,
there are two,
uh,

213
00:13:20.411 --> 00:13:25.180
but the main one is that it relies for the most part for its effects where it's

214
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:30.181
visual effects on its architect tonic elements on its columns,

215
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.550
on its niches,
on its pediments,
uh,

216
00:13:33.551 --> 00:13:35.920
the arch of septicemia severity in Rome,
yes,

217
00:13:35.921 --> 00:13:38.050
has projected and columns and the like,

218
00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.180
but it relies for its effects largely on the figural sculpture that decorates
it.

219
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.900
The decorates the panels over each of the smaller bays,

220
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:51.220
the freeze and so on and so forth.
That is not true here.

221
00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:54.950
This may have had some sculpture.
It probably had a group,

222
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:59.560
a quad [inaudible] quad drug group or a group of statues on the attic.

223
00:13:59.561 --> 00:14:03.220
It probably had a statue or two in these niches,

224
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.690
but it has no relief sculpture,
no figural relief sculpture at all.

225
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.670
And realize instead,
as I said,

226
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:14.320
on the architectural elements to enliven the surface and to make it an

227
00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:17.080
interesting billboard,
uh,
for,
uh,

228
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:21.940
whoever this was put up to commemorate.
We see,
for example,
these large,

229
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:26.770
uh,
Corinthian columns on tall basis,
the basis or not decorated.

230
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:32.020
Uh,
and we also see if we look very carefully,
uh,
that there were,

231
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.960
um,
there were smaller columns,

232
00:14:34.961 --> 00:14:38.580
there are capital still preserved on either side of the niches of,

233
00:14:38.581 --> 00:14:40.630
there were smaller columns here as well.

234
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.160
An interesting contrast between the larger columns and the smaller columns.

235
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:49.270
And then if you look very closely at the pediment above,

236
00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.950
you see that it is an RQ pediment.

237
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.480
Sometimes these are referred to as segmental,
s,
e,
g,
m,
e,
n,
t,
a,
l,

238
00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:58.730
segmental or RQ weighted pediments.

239
00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.780
And you can see that it is not only an RQ weighted pediment,

240
00:15:02.781 --> 00:15:06.320
but it's a broken RQ,
weighted pediment.
Uh,
it has been,

241
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.980
the bottom is not complete.
It's broken on either side.

242
00:15:09.981 --> 00:15:13.340
We've seen an increasing tastes with these broken triangular,

243
00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:16.400
a segmental pediments enrollment architecture.

244
00:15:16.401 --> 00:15:19.910
This willingness to break the rules of traditional,
uh,

245
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:24.020
traditional columnar architecture.
We see that here.
So again,

246
00:15:24.021 --> 00:15:28.550
it is the surface is enlivened,
uh,
through architectural means entirely,

247
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:32.870
uh,
which is,
uh,
an interesting phenomenon for this part of the world.

248
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.370
You can also see,

249
00:15:34.371 --> 00:15:39.371
I think that the stone that is used here is a local limestone,

250
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:44.590
a wonderful tan color that goes very well with the desert area in which this

251
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:46.851
finds itself.

252
00:15:46.851 --> 00:15:51.851
So local stone used the so called arch of Titus in the city of Tim Gad.

253
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.080
I talked about the sand and there's a lot of sand in this part of the world.

254
00:15:57.081 --> 00:16:00.170
This is essentially a desert,
uh,
and we see it,

255
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:04.250
especially around the city of leftist Magnar,
Leptos Magdna.

256
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:09.080
If Tim Gad is in modern,
Algeria,
lept is Magdna is in modern Libya,

257
00:16:09.081 --> 00:16:14.000
Colonel Kadafi country.
And uh,
it is an amazing site.

258
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.390
A few words about the history of leftist magna prior to the birth of September

259
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.900
is severity.
Uh,
it too,
well,
it was,
as I mentioned,
a port city,

260
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.580
uh,
it was a Phoenician port actually initially.

261
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:33.350
Then it came under the sway of Carthage of the Carthaginians.
Uh,

262
00:16:33.351 --> 00:16:37.210
it had some interactions with Greece,
but again,
I just as a,

263
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.960
this area as a whole,
and this part of the part of Africa,
uh,
that we,
uh,

264
00:16:41.961 --> 00:16:44.720
that leapt a smog is located in is,

265
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:49.280
was known as Triphala Tanea Triphala,
Tanea.
And,
uh,

266
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.610
so we,
we see the Carthaginians holding sway.

267
00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:55.610
We see some interactions with Greece,
but again,
but again,

268
00:16:55.611 --> 00:16:59.630
it doesn't take as significant a foothold here as it did in other parts of the

269
00:16:59.631 --> 00:17:04.160
Roman world.
And then Rome,
Rome takes over.

270
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.550
Leptin is Magdna.
It makes,
it,
makes it a colony.

271
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:12.740
It makes the area colony for Pelotonia.
Tanium it's a colony.
And,
uh,

272
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.690
it begins to be built up,

273
00:17:14.691 --> 00:17:19.010
as I mentioned to you before already in the late republic and into the Augustan

274
00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:19.491
period,

275
00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:23.360
we'll see that there was significant Augusta in architecture there that still

276
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.300
survives.
Uh,
it was then,
uh,

277
00:17:26.301 --> 00:17:29.380
that architecture was added to by Hadrian,
uh,

278
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:33.620
or during the period of Hadrian during the time during the reign of Hadrian when

279
00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:37.560
there was a continued interest in leftist Magnar.
And,
uh,

280
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:42.580
then it was built up,
uh,
and renovated significantly under Septum,

281
00:17:42.581 --> 00:17:45.050
Mya Savara.
So in the early third century,

282
00:17:45.051 --> 00:17:50.040
a d it continued to thrive throughout the third century,
into the fourth century,

283
00:17:50.041 --> 00:17:53.310
a d,
but in the fifth century,
a d it was attacked,

284
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:57.780
significant attack by the vandal tribes.
Uh,
it was,

285
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:02.810
it was devastated actually during that period at butted had a brief renascence

286
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:05.950
under the Byzantines,
uh,

287
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.630
a Byzantine wall was added to the city as well as a church.
Uh,

288
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.800
during that period in medieval and modern times,

289
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:18.750
though it was essentially abandoned and it became a place where treasure hunters

290
00:18:18.751 --> 00:18:19.584
did not,

291
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.620
did not hesitate to go and take stone and works of sculpture a away with them.

292
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.350
But fortunately because of these sands,

293
00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:32.670
because these sands shifted over time with the winds,
with the Shiroko and so on,

294
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:34.290
they eventually did,

295
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.520
w did their job by covering over a good part of the city,

296
00:18:38.521 --> 00:18:41.400
which was actually fortunate because it meant that everything that hadn't

297
00:18:41.401 --> 00:18:45.660
already been looted by those treasure hunters was at that point preserved.

298
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.370
It stayed covered for the most part until around World War II.
Uh,

299
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:53.940
at that time in the 20th century,
uh,
for Triphala,

300
00:18:53.941 --> 00:18:57.460
Tanea was essentially a protectorate of Italy.
Uh,

301
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:02.220
and in right at the time of World War II and right after World War II,

302
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:02.611
uh,

303
00:19:02.611 --> 00:19:07.611
Italian archeologists went in and excavated the site and revealed it in the way

304
00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:13.860
that we can experience it.
If we visit a leftist Magdna today,

305
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.690
and if we visit [inaudible] today,
we're going to see sights like this.

306
00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:23.400
What I'm showing you is a view from the air of the forum that was put up in the

307
00:19:23.401 --> 00:19:25.340
time upset to me is severity.

308
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:28.980
The so called Severen forum I've left is Magnar.

309
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.080
And you can see that this is,
uh,

310
00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.290
another one of these bigger is better buildings.

311
00:19:34.291 --> 00:19:39.140
It's extraordinarily large.
Uh,
and you can see that it has a,

312
00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.770
that it is not in the best of conditions.
Then much of it has fallen down.

313
00:19:43.771 --> 00:19:48.770
We see extensive fragments of columns,
uh,
and um,

314
00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:49.270
uh,

315
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:54.120
an tablatures and arcades and so on and so forth strewn around,

316
00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.160
uh,
the structure today.

317
00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:01.370
But there's enough there that we can get a quite good sense as we shall see of

318
00:20:01.441 --> 00:20:04.320
what these buildings looked like in antiquity.

319
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.250
If one goes to the sculpture depot on the site,

320
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.640
one can also see a host of sculpture despite the,
the,

321
00:20:11.641 --> 00:20:16.410
the looting one can also see a host of sculpture that still survives.
In fact,

322
00:20:16.411 --> 00:20:21.090
it's interesting,
right in the center here we see a portrait of Joe.
Who is it,

323
00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:29.500
sorry to put you on the spot,
but having taken Roman,
it's Augustus.
Good.

324
00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.580
Excellent.
It's the emperor Augustus right there in the center,
which proves,

325
00:20:33.581 --> 00:20:38.470
or which tends to make it likely,
uh,
to,
uh,
to,
uh,
to support,

326
00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.350
uh,
the point,
uh,
that,
uh,

327
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.570
this was an area that was built up under Augustus and decorated with Augustan

328
00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:48.760
sculpture.
We see a host of statues,
women,
uh,

329
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.840
fragments of a body parts including hands and arms,

330
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:57.000
as you can see over here at the depot.
And uh,

331
00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:02.030
this again gives us some general sense of how a heavily decorated the this town

332
00:21:02.531 --> 00:21:06.400
was in its hay day with sculpture of the imperial family,

333
00:21:06.401 --> 00:21:08.610
surely and uh,
and uh,

334
00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:12.490
local magistrates as well as gods and goddesses.

335
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:18.930
This is a plan of a leftist Magnar as it would have looked in the ancient

336
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:22.150
period.
Uh,
we are,
if we look at it here,

337
00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:26.140
we will see number one that it is,
you can tell very well from this.

338
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:30.970
And it was a port city and the airport was built.
You seeing,
uh,
the,
um,

339
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.920
the Mediterranean,
then you're seeing a,
a tributary of that river,

340
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.190
uh,
and you can see right below that river,

341
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:43.930
you can see a sort of roughly circular area that was the port of leftist Magna,

342
00:21:43.931 --> 00:21:47.950
not so different from the port of Claudia's,
for example,
at Portas.
Uh,

343
00:21:47.951 --> 00:21:51.910
and then you see the rest of the city as it was laid out from the first century

344
00:21:51.911 --> 00:21:56.580
BC until or through the time of Septum.
You severity.
Uh,

345
00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.380
and if you look very carefully,
you will see a host of buildings.

346
00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:02.680
The one that's right in the upper most part,

347
00:22:02.681 --> 00:22:07.270
they're closest to the harbor is the old forum.
It's not on your monument list,

348
00:22:07.271 --> 00:22:09.970
but I'm going to show it to you briefly.
Uh,
if you,

349
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.610
if you go down from that to the left,

350
00:22:12.611 --> 00:22:16.540
you will see the theater that's easy to pick out the theater that was put up,
uh,

351
00:22:16.541 --> 00:22:20.260
during the reign of Augustus.
And to the right of the theater,

352
00:22:20.261 --> 00:22:21.700
you see two circles there.

353
00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:26.710
That is the marketplace that was also put up during the age of Augustus.

354
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:31.790
Down here you see a very large bath,
uh,

355
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.830
in the imperial bath type that was built during the reign of Hadrian.

356
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.110
And then right above to the right of the bath,
uh,

357
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:42.820
you see the forum as it was laid out,
the forum,

358
00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:47.270
the basilica and the temple as they were laid out during the reign of symptom

359
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:48.223
severity.

360
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:53.020
And then down here to the left of the Patriotic Bads,

361
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.470
there was an arch,
uh,

362
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:59.400
put up on one of the streets and arch put up also to symptom.
Is Severity,

363
00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:04.420
which we will look at together today.
I want to begin with the Augustan remains.

364
00:23:04.421 --> 00:23:07.500
I'm going to show you to Augusta and buildings from [inaudible].

365
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.240
The first is the markets,
uh,

366
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:14.770
and the second will be the theater and they're very interesting in all kinds of

367
00:23:14.771 --> 00:23:15.604
ways.

368
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.290
I you see a restored view of what the market would have looked like in the

369
00:23:20.291 --> 00:23:24.360
Augustan period.
This is a restored view,
uh,
that comes from your textbook,

370
00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.800
from the Ward Perkins.
Uh,

371
00:23:26.801 --> 00:23:31.801
we know that the building dated precisely to eight BC,

372
00:23:31.841 --> 00:23:35.050
that is in the reign of Augustus eight BC.
How do we know that?

373
00:23:35.051 --> 00:23:38.410
Because there's an inscription on the building,
uh,

374
00:23:38.411 --> 00:23:43.411
that interestingly enough is written in both Latin and then has a neo Punic

375
00:23:44.021 --> 00:23:47.960
translation.
So this is a nod still in the Augustan age two,

376
00:23:47.961 --> 00:23:52.850
the Carthaginian segment of the population who still continued to live there,

377
00:23:52.851 --> 00:23:57.310
even with the Roman,
uh,
advent.
So eight BC,
uh,

378
00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.670
and as we look at this,

379
00:23:58.671 --> 00:24:02.120
we know in fact what was built in eight BC was only part of this.

380
00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:03.530
It was the two pavilions,

381
00:24:03.531 --> 00:24:07.130
a two market pavilions that you see in the center here.

382
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:12.140
This scheme of having a round or round dish,
a structure,

383
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:17.170
either one or two pavilions in the center of an open courtyard is actually not

384
00:24:17.481 --> 00:24:20.690
special to leftist Magdna.
We know this type in Italy,

385
00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:24.740
they're examples still preserve.
For example,
in Campania I showed you one,

386
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:29.210
although we didn't discuss it in the plan of the forum upon pay,
uh,

387
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.520
for example.
Uh,
but so this is not,

388
00:24:31.521 --> 00:24:36.521
this is an idea that probably made its way from May of made its way from Italy

389
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:42.080
to leftist mom in the age of Augustus.
We see it here,
these two pavilions.

390
00:24:42.081 --> 00:24:45.440
But if we look at these pavilions carefully,
we see some interesting features.

391
00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.890
We see that the central element is indeed circular.

392
00:24:48.891 --> 00:24:53.891
There's a circular wall here that has in it RQ weighted windows and doorways

393
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:59.750
that pierce it and open it up.
Then around it though interestingly enough,

394
00:24:59.751 --> 00:25:02.520
we see that the staircase,
uh,
the,

395
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:07.470
the way in which the columns are arranged,
a and the roof,
uh,

396
00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.640
our makeup and octagon make up an octagon.

397
00:25:10.641 --> 00:25:13.790
In the case of both of these pavilions.
Now that is very,

398
00:25:13.791 --> 00:25:17.470
very interesting when we talk about,
uh,
what happens first,
uh,

399
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:22.520
at where in Rome itself campaign here in central Italy or in the provinces.

400
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.800
Because in this particular instance,
we are seeing an octagon extremely early.

401
00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:31.040
This is eight,
eight BC,
the age of Augustus.

402
00:25:31.041 --> 00:25:36.041
We don't see the octagon used in Rome until the age of Nero until the Dome is

403
00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:39.680
trends Vittoria sort of.
And then fully blown,
uh,

404
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.280
in the dome is our e and the octagonal room of the Dome is area.

405
00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:48.290
So is this a formulation that begins first in the provinces and ends up in Rome

406
00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:49.430
or are again,

407
00:25:49.431 --> 00:25:53.030
there's some missing links where they're octagon earlier in Rome that have no

408
00:25:53.031 --> 00:25:53.930
longer survived.

409
00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:58.070
It's an interesting and almost certainly unanswerable question unless something

410
00:25:58.071 --> 00:26:00.590
new is excavated that changes the picture.

411
00:26:00.591 --> 00:26:04.760
So for now it looks as if we see an octagon earlier in the provinces,

412
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:08.630
then we see it in Rome,
the,
uh,
the,

413
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:13.720
the while the pavilions and the pavilions were indeed these market pavilions.

414
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:19.100
And by the way,
I should mention that there were no permanent markets here.

415
00:26:19.101 --> 00:26:23.540
There were temporary stalls that would have been set up daily between the

416
00:26:23.541 --> 00:26:27.740
columns around the pavilions and the columns and the portico.

417
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:32.420
The open portico was not done in eight BC,
was not done in the age of Augustus,

418
00:26:32.421 --> 00:26:37.370
but was added under type areas.
Augustus,
his successor,
uh,
between,

419
00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.630
uh,
31 and 37,

420
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.650
as is indicated on your monument list.

421
00:26:42.651 --> 00:26:46.280
And there is a difference in the materials that were used here.
Ah,

422
00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:48.390
and the materials.
Interestingly enough,

423
00:26:48.391 --> 00:26:52.110
and this is very important for our understanding of the evolution of

424
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:55.110
architecture and leftist Modna.
During this period,

425
00:26:55.111 --> 00:26:59.690
the age of Augustus local stone was used,
uh,
entirely.
Uh,

426
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:04.350
they used a local sandstone and limestone.
I'll show it to you in a moment,

427
00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:09.180
uh,
for these pavilions.
And then when Tiberias added or when they,

428
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:14.130
when the outer area,
the Portico was added in the age of Tiberius,

429
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.820
uh,

430
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:19.740
the columns were made out of a gray stone about a gray stone that was also

431
00:27:19.741 --> 00:27:22.500
local.
So only local stone use two year,

432
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:27.330
no concrete used in this building.
This is an entirely stone building,

433
00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:32.550
uh,
put up in the Augustan period in leftist Modna,

434
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.150
one of the pavilions,
very well preserved.
As you can see here.

435
00:27:36.151 --> 00:27:41.151
And you can see that we are dealing again with a very attractive local sandstone

436
00:27:42.541 --> 00:27:45.870
or limestone that is used for the instruction for the structure,

437
00:27:45.871 --> 00:27:48.120
for the central pavilions entirely.
Uh,

438
00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.470
and then you can see the contrast between the coloration of that and the gray

439
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:57.510
columns.
Also local stone that are used for the surrounding portico.

440
00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:00.210
If we look at this center,
if we look at this pavilion,

441
00:28:00.211 --> 00:28:01.980
we can see both the central,

442
00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:06.150
the central round element that I've already described with its RQ,

443
00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:08.970
weighted windows and doorways on a tall base.

444
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:12.470
We can also see the columns that surrounded,

445
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.800
and you can tell very well that these are ionic columns.
Some of them are column,

446
00:28:16.801 --> 00:28:18.780
some of them are in the sense peers.

447
00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:21.840
They're wider and those wider ones are at the corners.

448
00:28:21.841 --> 00:28:25.920
And it's interesting to see how the architects have gotten around the fact that

449
00:28:25.921 --> 00:28:30.650
they have to turn the corners in this octagon,
uh,
by making these wider,
uh,

450
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:33.540
and making them splay out on either side.

451
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.800
You can also see some stone benches in between some,

452
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:41.970
but not all of the columns here.

453
00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.840
And when I did,
I,
I,
let me,
uh,

454
00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:50.310
let me go back for a second just to show you also that the,

455
00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:54.060
um,
that while the columns of the,
uh,

456
00:28:54.061 --> 00:28:57.390
of the pavilions or the Michela by the way,

457
00:28:57.391 --> 00:28:59.880
that's the word in Latin,
Mac,

458
00:28:59.881 --> 00:29:04.230
e l l a or McKellen and Macy,
e l l u m in the singular,

459
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.920
the columns,
the capitals of the,
uh,

460
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:12.040
surrounding portico were Corinthian as opposed to the ionic ones that are used

461
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.650
for the earlier market pavilions.
Here's another detail.

462
00:29:16.651 --> 00:29:18.900
This is the one that's on your monument list.
Uh,

463
00:29:18.901 --> 00:29:22.230
and although it's in black and white doesn't give you a sense of the coloration

464
00:29:22.231 --> 00:29:23.064
of the stone.

465
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:27.240
It's useful because you can see one of these piers that turns a corner better

466
00:29:27.241 --> 00:29:28.100
here.
Uh,

467
00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:33.150
and you can also see that there are a strike patients that make up the flutes of

468
00:29:33.541 --> 00:29:38.541
the pilasters that are located in between these arcuate and openings on the

469
00:29:39.301 --> 00:29:43.180
central element.
This is another view that shows you the less,

470
00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:46.190
the less preserved second pavilion.
Uh,

471
00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.730
you can see here again the color of the stone.

472
00:29:48.731 --> 00:29:53.440
You can see the way in which the peers turn the corner a here and get a sense of

473
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:54.191
the remains,

474
00:29:54.191 --> 00:29:59.191
a further sense of the remains of the Augusta marketplace from this view.

475
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.400
The other Augustan building as I mentioned,

476
00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:08.401
was the theater of leftist Magdna and this theater again also put up in the age

477
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:13.600
of Augustus.
It dates us specifically to a d one,
two,
two,

478
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:18.490
so a very early Roman theater and a quite well preserved Roman theater.

479
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:23.820
And we should think of it in connection to the other Augusta enrollment theater

480
00:30:24.821 --> 00:30:28.430
that we saw.
For example,
the theater of Marcellus in Rome.
Uh,

481
00:30:28.431 --> 00:30:32.350
this one as we'll see,
better preserved in some of its aspects.

482
00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:37.030
Then the theater of Marcellus in Rome.
If we look at the plan,

483
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:41.590
we see some interesting features.
We see first of all a that it is,

484
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:45.880
it corresponds extremely well to the theaters that we've seen thus far this

485
00:30:45.881 --> 00:30:48.220
semester.
In that sense it's a conventional building.

486
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:53.110
I should mention that it is not built on a hillside and the Greek manner but is

487
00:30:53.111 --> 00:30:56.770
built on a hill of concrete.
We're going to see that very,

488
00:30:56.771 --> 00:30:59.650
very little concrete is used in lept,

489
00:30:59.651 --> 00:31:01.990
is Magdna is used in uh,

490
00:31:01.991 --> 00:31:06.610
in north Africa enrollment North Africa in general where the work is primarily

491
00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:10.600
of stone.
The buildings are made primarily out of stone,
very little concrete,

492
00:31:10.601 --> 00:31:13.690
but they did use it here,
uh,
to create a hill,

493
00:31:13.691 --> 00:31:18.480
a manmade artificial hill out of concrete on which they could rest,
uh,

494
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:21.550
the seats of the theater or the coffee of the theater.

495
00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:26.140
The seats themselves are done in local stone,
local stone.

496
00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:31.090
And uh,
we can also see the other features of the typical Roman theater,

497
00:31:31.091 --> 00:31:35.620
the semicircular orchestra,
the semicircular Kava Kava,

498
00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:40.450
the division of the Kavya into these Kunae or wedge sections.

499
00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:43.390
Now we can also see that the stage building,

500
00:31:43.391 --> 00:31:46.570
we know quite a bit about the stage building because it's extremely well

501
00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:50.410
preserved,
uh,
in a way that the theater of Marcellus of course is not.

502
00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.620
We see that it was made up of these t three very large,
uh,

503
00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:59.670
niches here that have columns screening the inside following the curvature in

504
00:32:00.281 --> 00:32:02.050
fact of those niches.

505
00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.820
And you can also see there are architectural elements in the center here that

506
00:32:06.821 --> 00:32:11.290
seemed to project into that space.
So,
and this is pretty early.

507
00:32:11.291 --> 00:32:14.990
This is a d one to two.
So it does give us some sense.
We,

508
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.750
when we talked about painting,

509
00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.020
we talked about the fact that we see things in Roman painting of the second

510
00:32:20.021 --> 00:32:23.500
style in particular 60 BC,
50 BC,
uh,

511
00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:25.540
that we don't see in built architecture.

512
00:32:25.541 --> 00:32:30.310
And I mentioned that that time it's conceivable that they are based on lost

513
00:32:30.311 --> 00:32:33.130
theatrical sets that were made out of wood.

514
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:37.770
But a building like this where we do have local stone use for the co,
for the,

515
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.110
for the,
for this forest of columns that we see inside these niches.

516
00:32:42.111 --> 00:32:44.990
And I'll show it to you cause it's WellPreserved in a moment.
We get it.

517
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.740
We get a sense of the kind of thing that may have existed,
uh,

518
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.770
that may have had some impact on some of the paintings that we saw of the second

519
00:32:54.651 --> 00:32:57.440
style in places like palm pay and elsewhere.

520
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.500
This is also interesting because if you look,
it's hard,

521
00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:01.940
you can't really see it in plan.

522
00:33:01.941 --> 00:33:05.810
But if you look at the very top of the cabi up the top of the coffee and the

523
00:33:05.811 --> 00:33:10.811
center was the location of a temple and that temple was put up to series the

524
00:33:11.281 --> 00:33:16.100
God,
a series a cre s the God has series,
series Agusta.

525
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:20.990
So the Augustan version of series a and that was at the very top.

526
00:33:20.991 --> 00:33:21.840
And that,
uh,

527
00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:26.780
makes this temple a type of temple that we have not talked about this semester.

528
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.450
And that is what is called a theater temple.

529
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:34.310
A temple that has a theater that has a temple as an integral part of it.

530
00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:37.760
This is not a new idea to Leptos Moderna.
We know,

531
00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:42.820
for example in Rome that the Republican general pumpy built such a theater in

532
00:33:44.031 --> 00:33:48.860
Rome,
a temple theater,
a theater that had a temple at the apex of the cabiya.

533
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.240
It is not preserved,

534
00:33:50.241 --> 00:33:54.140
although there is enough evidence and fragments and so on for us to get a quite

535
00:33:54.141 --> 00:33:57.350
good sense of what it looked like.
And it was one of these.
So again,

536
00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.760
ideas that seemed to have been developed in Rome first are making their way in

537
00:34:01.761 --> 00:34:06.761
this case to left is Magdna notice that the theater at the apex is aligned with

538
00:34:07.881 --> 00:34:11.630
another theater that's located down here.
A large problem,

539
00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:14.790
possibly a larger one a.
And this one,
uh,

540
00:34:14.791 --> 00:34:19.791
this one seems to have been put up to the divine Augustus or to a number of d.

541
00:34:19.941 --> 00:34:21.700
We,
uh,
and uh,

542
00:34:21.701 --> 00:34:25.070
again purposefully aligned with the temple at the top.

543
00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.820
Here's something very interesting.
We see the portico us in the back.

544
00:34:28.821 --> 00:34:33.320
This porticoes that we saw,
for example,
at the,
uh,
theater in palm pay,

545
00:34:33.321 --> 00:34:38.060
the early theater in palm pay,
80 to 70 a BC is,

546
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.770
as you'll remember,
a,

547
00:34:39.771 --> 00:34:44.771
we see it here and you can see that it is not as regular as the porticos in palm

548
00:34:46.061 --> 00:34:46.580
pay.

549
00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:51.580
And the reason for that is likely a because of the preexisting buildings on this

550
00:34:52.221 --> 00:34:52.581
site.

551
00:34:52.581 --> 00:34:56.990
And this is where we see a significant difference with the planning of Tim Gat.

552
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:58.070
Tim Gat.
Again,

553
00:34:58.071 --> 00:35:02.270
the Romans could just lay this out any way they wanted because nothing was
there.

554
00:35:02.271 --> 00:35:06.500
And they chose this ideal costume plan and the theater and so on.
Very,

555
00:35:06.501 --> 00:35:10.490
very regular here they have to contend with earlier structures.
Uh,

556
00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:14.810
they have to bill,
they have to design their building,
keeping those in mind,

557
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:17.720
they certainly don't want to destroy temples,
for example,

558
00:35:17.721 --> 00:35:22.410
a shrines of the locals that would not be good politics.
So they don't,
uh,

559
00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.370
and they have to build their building with that in mind.

560
00:35:25.371 --> 00:35:28.880
And so we see some very unusual shapes here.

561
00:35:28.881 --> 00:35:31.520
It's not what they would've done if they could have done differently,

562
00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:35.420
but they had to do it given the reality of the situation.

563
00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.710
This is a view of the,
uh,

564
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:43.230
theater of Augustus at Leptin smog.
Now as it looks today,

565
00:35:43.231 --> 00:35:48.180
you can see once again that the stone of choice is local stone,
local,

566
00:35:48.181 --> 00:35:50.290
limestone and sandstone,
uh,

567
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:55.350
for the columns as well as for the car caveat.
But again,

568
00:35:55.351 --> 00:36:00.351
the copy of rests on a concrete foundation and we can see again what I described

569
00:36:01.501 --> 00:36:01.891
before,

570
00:36:01.891 --> 00:36:06.870
the three great niches as well as these square elements with columns that

571
00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:11.100
project into our space that give a very interesting,
uh,

572
00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:14.430
scenic view of columnar architecture.
Uh,

573
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:19.460
that again gives us an idea of perhaps some of those temporary structures in

574
00:36:19.501 --> 00:36:24.270
wood that would have had a significant impact on second style Roman wall

575
00:36:24.271 --> 00:36:25.980
painting.
This is interesting.

576
00:36:25.981 --> 00:36:30.630
This is an extremely WellPreserved inscription that comes from the theater of

577
00:36:30.631 --> 00:36:33.230
leftist Modna and is still preserved.
Uh,

578
00:36:33.231 --> 00:36:36.270
and we can see here as in the market,
uh,

579
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:38.970
of Augustus that it is in Latin,

580
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.990
but also translated into neo Punic below.

581
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:47.670
And I thought you might be interested in hearing what it says a and it says,

582
00:36:47.671 --> 00:36:51.450
and I quote,
and I'll do that in English.
Uh,

583
00:36:51.451 --> 00:36:56.451
when the father of the Father Land Caesar Augustus son of the Deified Caesar,

584
00:36:56.791 --> 00:36:58.800
namely Julius Caesar.
So this is again,

585
00:36:58.801 --> 00:37:03.720
one of the ways we know that this is an Augustan building was Pontifex maximus

586
00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:06.030
that is chief priest of Rome because,
uh,

587
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.840
state and religion very closely allied and the Roman period.

588
00:37:09.841 --> 00:37:14.620
And Augustus was at one point both chief priests of Rome as well as Imparato or

589
00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:19.640
emperor when Augustus was Pontifex maximus vested with the Tribune emission

590
00:37:20.341 --> 00:37:25.341
power for the 24th time being console for the 13th time,

591
00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:29.100
a man by the name of Ana Ball,
Rufus,

592
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:33.420
the adorn or of his country.
So he must've commissioned not only this,

593
00:37:33.421 --> 00:37:35.010
but other buildings as well,

594
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:40.280
the adorn or of his country and lover of Concord priest sue feet prefect of the

595
00:37:41.011 --> 00:37:43.620
sacred objects.
The son of him,
of him,

596
00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:48.621
Milko to Papias took care to build this at his own expense and dedicated it.

597
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:54.870
So here we see a good example of the sort of thing that we see often in the

598
00:37:54.871 --> 00:37:59.871
provinces that is buildings put up in honor of the emperor is during the period

599
00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:01.290
in which they reign,

600
00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:06.480
but put up by major local benefactors who have significant funds,

601
00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:10.290
their disposal who want to do the same sort of thing that anyone who wants to

602
00:38:10.291 --> 00:38:14.520
put their name on a building at Yale is preserved their name for posterity,

603
00:38:14.521 --> 00:38:19.170
their generosity,
their benefaction for posterity.
And at the same time do good,

604
00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:23.220
uh,
by providing the kind of amenities that cities need,

605
00:38:23.221 --> 00:38:26.070
like theaters and baths and the,
like

606
00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:31.820
I mentioned already that a building continue to pace,
uh,

607
00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:36.830
during the time of the emperor Hadrian and the main building that was added to

608
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:42.300
leftist Magnar during the Adriatic period was a very large bath structure.

609
00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:47.230
The second largest bad structure preserved,
uh,
in Roman North Africa.

610
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:51.910
And we see it in plan here,
the building block on the right,
uh,

611
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:56.970
and then a view of a fuller view of the entire bath complex at the left,

612
00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:02.550
it dates to a d 126 to a d 127.

613
00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:08.620
Just looking quickly at the,
uh,
at the,
uh,
at the plan over here,

614
00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:12.640
you can see not only the bathing block,
same as we see on the right,
uh,

615
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:16.660
but also the Polestar of the structure and the Polestar of this structure should

616
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:21.550
strike you as very different from any other polestar that we've seen thus far

617
00:39:21.551 --> 00:39:24.600
this semester.
It's almost shaped like a hippodrome,
uh,

618
00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:28.030
although it doesn't have the hairpin shape with one curved in one straight end,

619
00:39:28.031 --> 00:39:29.350
but two curved ends.
In fact,

620
00:39:29.351 --> 00:39:33.600
it might remind you more than a hippodrome of the basilica.

621
00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:37.240
Olivia in the forum of Trajan with its two curved ends,

622
00:39:37.241 --> 00:39:41.850
one on either side and columns running around the center,
and then to,
uh,

623
00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:46.900
to radiating is up here on the right on the upper most part.

624
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:50.320
Excuse me.
Uh,
so at a very unusually shaped Polestar,

625
00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:52.660
we've never seen it Balestra like this before,

626
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:57.250
but perhaps even more interesting than the shape of the structure is the way

627
00:39:57.251 --> 00:40:02.020
it's off axis with the rest of the building,
right?
It's off axis.
It's not,

628
00:40:02.021 --> 00:40:02.630
it's not,

629
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:07.630
it's not lined up axially and symmetrically with the rest of the building the

630
00:40:07.901 --> 00:40:08.320
same.

631
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.710
But the reason for that is almost certainly the same as we saw with the port.

632
00:40:12.711 --> 00:40:14.920
It goes in the theater,
the Augustan theater,

633
00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:18.810
and that is something else must have stood on the site that,
that,

634
00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:24.110
that forced them to design this in such a way that it was off center with the

635
00:40:24.821 --> 00:40:26.950
rest of the structure.
But it actually made it,

636
00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:31.330
it makes it more interesting in a sense architecturally with regard to the

637
00:40:31.331 --> 00:40:33.550
bathing block that is very conventional,

638
00:40:33.551 --> 00:40:38.551
you can pick out all the rooms that we've become so accustomed to naming a in

639
00:40:38.771 --> 00:40:41.180
Roman bath architecture.
This is a,

640
00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:46.240
an example of the imperial bath type that we've seen developed in Rome from uh,

641
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:49.990
the time of Titus,
uh,
up through Trajan,

642
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:52.660
Baz of Titus and the best suit tray of Trajan,

643
00:40:52.661 --> 00:40:57.650
the imperial bath type where we have the main,
uh,
bathing rooms,
uh,

644
00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:01.180
placed in a row in the center of the structure.

645
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:04.240
Axel axially related to one another.

646
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.670
We see what do we see at the top with the cop,

647
00:41:06.671 --> 00:41:10.470
with the columns around it or the basis and basis.

648
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.070
And then columns above is the what

649
00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:17.480
Natacha than the top Deo.
They

650
00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.360
forget Darian

651
00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.530
tepid Arrium called Rem Caldari.

652
00:41:24.531 --> 00:41:28.730
I'm here with it's radiating niches as you can see.
So Nataka,

653
00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:32.630
Ato Freakatorium,
tepid,
Doriam called Rem,

654
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:33.920
all in succession.

655
00:41:33.921 --> 00:41:38.420
And then the other rooms actually symmetrically arranged around them,

656
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:42.920
duplicated one mirror images of one another on either side.

657
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:43.801
In this plan,

658
00:41:43.801 --> 00:41:48.530
it doesn't show the frigging Doriam as if it were tripled groin vaulted,
uh,

659
00:41:48.531 --> 00:41:52.670
but most who studied this believe that it was,
uh,
the,

660
00:41:52.671 --> 00:41:55.820
and I'll show you a view of that in a moment before I get to that,

661
00:41:56.170 --> 00:42:00.740
a view into the remains of the bads of Hadrian today.

662
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:06.110
And we see with the bads of Hadrian a very major change in terms of building

663
00:42:06.111 --> 00:42:09.050
stone in the city of leftist Modna.

664
00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.450
And that is while up to this point,

665
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:16.630
they were using entirely local stone all of a sudden in the time of Hadrian.

666
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.660
Uh,
and it's not surprising,
I suppose with Hadrian and his,

667
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:25.670
his era being a time of international travel and the like internationalism.

668
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:28.040
Uh,
we see the,
uh,
the,

669
00:42:28.041 --> 00:42:33.041
the beginning to import a marbles from all over the world for,

670
00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:37.610
uh,
the buildings up.
Lept is Magdna.
This being the prime example,

671
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.130
we have building stone in this building.

672
00:42:40.131 --> 00:42:44.300
We have some local stone in this building,
but we also have marble from Greece,

673
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:49.480
marble from Asia minor and even marble from Italy used in the baths of Hadrian

674
00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:54.020
at leftist Maga.
And making it a very,
very,

675
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.620
quite magnificent building to say the least.

676
00:42:57.621 --> 00:43:02.621
So this a very significant change in the way they are thinking about the

677
00:43:02.751 --> 00:43:07.751
building materials used for the structures of Leptin is here is a restored view

678
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:12.500
of what scholars,
some scholars at least believe.
Uh,

679
00:43:12.501 --> 00:43:17.501
the [inaudible] of the baths of Hadrian looked like very similar to what we

680
00:43:17.961 --> 00:43:22.820
imagined that the Freekeh Daria have a bas in Rome looked like of the imperial

681
00:43:22.821 --> 00:43:25.700
type of,
think of the later,
the later,
uh,

682
00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:29.840
massive of Caracalla that we looked at last time with the same triple groin

683
00:43:29.841 --> 00:43:34.841
vaulted scheme supported by engaged columns on either side and then very heavily

684
00:43:35.001 --> 00:43:35.834
decorated.

685
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:40.610
It could be that those who have thought about this have been too influenced by a

686
00:43:40.611 --> 00:43:43.280
spaces like the frigging Daria,
uh,
in,

687
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:47.270
in the baths of Caracalla.
Uh,
because to do this,

688
00:43:47.271 --> 00:43:51.800
we know that very little concrete was used in leftist magnet to do this kind of

689
00:43:51.801 --> 00:43:56.000
building,
this kind of scale to devote this kind of room at this kind of scale,

690
00:43:56.001 --> 00:44:00.110
you would need to use concrete construction.
So there are two possibilities here.

691
00:44:00.111 --> 00:44:04.580
Either they did use it in this building and used it very well to create a space

692
00:44:04.581 --> 00:44:09.500
that was quite comparable to what was being put up in Rome or it may have been

693
00:44:09.501 --> 00:44:14.060
bolted somewhat differently.
But those who have studied this with,
with some,

694
00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.850
you know,
who are not very knowledgeable about this kind of thing,

695
00:44:16.851 --> 00:44:20.450
seemed to believe that this was a groin vaulted building.

696
00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:24.530
Now growing vaults can be done out of material other than concrete.
We saw some,

697
00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:29.210
uh,
some,
um,
vaulting,
uh,
in Pompei,
not growing vaults,

698
00:44:29.211 --> 00:44:33.780
but regular de of vaults in palm pay that were made out of,
out of wood.

699
00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:38.070
But to do it at this scale would be near impossible in one has to imagine that

700
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:40.110
concrete would have been used.
So that's,

701
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:45.140
that's controversial and we don't know for sure exactly how this building was

702
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:47.003
bolted.

703
00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:53.790
Cep Timia severities follows the lead of Hadrian,

704
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.630
uh,
or,
uh,
of the,
of,

705
00:44:55.710 --> 00:45:00.150
of those benefactors of leftist modern building buildings in the Adriatic period

706
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:05.340
by continuing to,
uh,
to have the buildings,

707
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.620
uh,
of his renovated home town.

708
00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:12.760
She D in important marbles.
And in fact,
it could be said if,
if,

709
00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:17.490
if CEP,
Timmy is severity,
where to boast as Augustus had before him,

710
00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:22.170
uh,
that he had transformed the city of leftist Magnar.
Instead of saying,

711
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:26.970
as Augustus did that he found Roma city a brick and left Rome city of marble,

712
00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:32.080
a Septimius Rivera's might've said he found a leftist Magnar,

713
00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:36.120
a city of local limestone and left leftest Magnar,

714
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:40.680
a city of imported marble because from this time forth,

715
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:44.160
all of the buildings that we see,
uh,
in the Severin,

716
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:49.390
a city of lept is Magnar are made out of imported marble.

717
00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:56.070
I'm going to show you a series of these,
uh,
and I'm going to begin first,
oh,

718
00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:56.670
excuse me.

719
00:45:56.670 --> 00:46:01.670
Begin first with the so called fountain or a Nim Fam of the city of leftist

720
00:46:02.371 --> 00:46:05.820
Magna,
which does indeed date to the severance period.
I should,

721
00:46:05.821 --> 00:46:07.170
before I show you that though,

722
00:46:07.171 --> 00:46:11.760
I should mention that we know that September is severity traveled back to

723
00:46:11.761 --> 00:46:15.600
Leptin's once he was emperor of Rome,
but he was involved in,

724
00:46:15.601 --> 00:46:19.260
you'll remember that war and Parthenia,
so he couldn't do it right away.
Uh,

725
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:23.580
but after the Great Parthian victory,
uh,
and you'll remember the arch in Rome,

726
00:46:23.581 --> 00:46:25.070
the arch of Septum,

727
00:46:25.071 --> 00:46:28.380
you severity in the Roman forum was put up to celebrate that part of the in

728
00:46:28.381 --> 00:46:31.830
victory in 203 and in precisely that same year,

729
00:46:31.831 --> 00:46:36.660
203 [inaudible] Septimius appears to have made his way along with his wife Julia

730
00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:41.320
dominant,
his family,
uh,
to the city of leftist modern,
a hometown boy,
uh,

731
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:46.330
comes back,
uh,
add to great parades and the like for sure.
Uh,

732
00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:49.560
and it also jumpstarted a major,

733
00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:52.130
a building renovation as I've mentioned.
Uh,

734
00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:56.520
and although we think that the arch of me severity in Leptins and I'll show it

735
00:46:56.521 --> 00:47:00.090
to today,
uh,
was put up to,
uh,
honor September,

736
00:47:00.091 --> 00:47:04.980
he on his visit to Rome on his visit to leftist Maga and probably stood,

737
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:09.150
uh,
into o three when he arrived.
We date it to 203.

738
00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:12.770
The other buildings were begun at about that time.
Uh,

739
00:47:12.771 --> 00:47:17.430
and then some of them were completed by his son,
car color after his death.

740
00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:22.260
One of the buildings that belongs to the separate city is this fountain or Nim

741
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.600
Fam that you find on your monument list.

742
00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:30.770
Then in fam in Leptos Magnar that we believe dates a d 211.

743
00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:36.760
You see it here in plan a and you can see it's located next to what?

744
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:37.780
What's this?
Over here?

745
00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:42.913
<v 1>Okay.</v>

746
00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:48.020
<v 0>Uh,
Balestra excellent.
That coffee did you good?
Uh,
that Polestar over here,</v>

747
00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:48.681
uh,
with,

748
00:47:48.681 --> 00:47:53.520
it's projecting a con con [inaudible] here.

749
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:58.220
Uh,
and we see a on the other side,
the uh,

750
00:47:58.221 --> 00:47:59.054
the uh,

751
00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:04.120
fam or fountain and you can see how very carefully orchestrated it was in terms

752
00:48:04.851 --> 00:48:09.310
of,
uh,
you know,
making cities,
building cities,
building urban areas.
Uh,

753
00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.210
the architects have played a great deal of,

754
00:48:11.211 --> 00:48:15.170
paid a great deal of attention to exactly where they're siting this found in and

755
00:48:15.171 --> 00:48:19.970
its relationship to these other buildings by playing off con cavities against

756
00:48:19.971 --> 00:48:22.860
convex cities and so on.
We can see that the plan,

757
00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:25.450
the plan of the nymph Valium shows it to be a,

758
00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:28.550
a structure that had one large central niche,

759
00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:34.070
which we're going to see had one central apps or niche that had in it,

760
00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:36.920
a series of smaller niches for statuary,

761
00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:42.160
probably images of the emperor and the imperial family as well as important

762
00:48:42.381 --> 00:48:46.430
local magistrates as well as gods and goddesses in front of it.

763
00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.210
There was the,
um,

764
00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:53.500
what would be the basin where the water when to water would have flowed out of

765
00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:55.900
the center of the ore,

766
00:48:56.870 --> 00:49:00.920
out of those niches in between the statuary into the base and below.

767
00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:05.300
And you can see the way it's been kind of splayed off to either side to give it

768
00:49:05.301 --> 00:49:08.990
an interesting shape and to make it seem a very welcoming.

769
00:49:08.991 --> 00:49:12.980
Now why did a city like leftest modern and need a fountain of this magnitude?

770
00:49:12.981 --> 00:49:16.910
Well,
yes,
it did supply water,
uh,
that it was helpful in that regard.

771
00:49:16.911 --> 00:49:18.440
But I think it was much more than that.

772
00:49:18.441 --> 00:49:20.950
I think it was viewed as a kind of showpiece,
uh,

773
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:25.970
for the city that there came a time when every city worth its salt needed to

774
00:49:25.971 --> 00:49:29.120
have a showpiece like this,
an ostentatious fountain,

775
00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.490
a leftist was no example.
Uh,

776
00:49:31.491 --> 00:49:35.230
and so they build such an Austin Sacious fountain in the,

777
00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.770
in the seven period in leftist Magnar.

778
00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.320
Here's a view of part of it.
As it looks today,

779
00:49:42.321 --> 00:49:47.030
it's actually decently WellPreserved.
Uh,
and we can see,
uh,
the,
uh,
one of,

780
00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:50.930
we can see the great niche or part of the great niche here with it's great apps

781
00:49:50.931 --> 00:49:55.400
here with it's a smaller niches for statuary as I've described.

782
00:49:55.610 --> 00:50:00.440
We can also see that we are dealing here with regard to the walls with local

783
00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:04.850
sandstone or limestone being used for the wall construction.

784
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:09.590
But all of the columns,
and you can see a columnar scheme here on two stories,

785
00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:14.230
a very similar to the sort of thing that we saw in the theater.
Uh,

786
00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:17.840
a display of columns a and they go,

787
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:21.940
they go into the niches as well.
As you can see here,
uh,

788
00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:25.550
in two tears,
these are made out of marble.

789
00:50:25.551 --> 00:50:30.410
That is brought in from minor Asia minor marble.
So imported marble.

790
00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:35.240
And we do believe that the,
uh,
the stone carvers who were,

791
00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:39.770
who were used to carving this kind of marble in Asia minor were brought in with

792
00:50:39.771 --> 00:50:42.530
them to do the carving on the spot.

793
00:50:42.531 --> 00:50:47.531
So one of these examples of the use of imported marble in buildings that were

794
00:50:47.871 --> 00:50:50.850
put up in Severen leftist Magdna,

795
00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:56.150
I mentioned that I would show you just in passing the old forum of leftist

796
00:50:56.151 --> 00:50:59.180
Magnar before we look at the sovereign forum.
Just so that you know,

797
00:50:59.181 --> 00:51:01.550
it's not a new monument list.
You're not responsible for it,

798
00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:05.330
although it is in Ward Perkins and you can read about it there.
Uh,

799
00:51:05.331 --> 00:51:08.180
but I show it to,
to make a couple of very important points.

800
00:51:08.181 --> 00:51:10.430
One that there was an earlier forum on this site.

801
00:51:10.431 --> 00:51:15.020
It was begun in the late republic and continued into the Augustan period.

802
00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:19.910
It was laid out very close to the port,
which,
which makes a lot of sense.

803
00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.090
Uh,
and uh,
you can see that like other four are,

804
00:51:23.091 --> 00:51:27.390
we've seen it had a great open rectangular space.
It had a basilica,
uh,

805
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:28.161
down here,

806
00:51:28.161 --> 00:51:32.820
very similar in shape and plan to bacillus cause we've seen like the one at palm

807
00:51:32.821 --> 00:51:36.020
pay.
Uh,
but it's interesting both because again,

808
00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:40.820
it is not exactly a square or rectangular in shape.
It has one,

809
00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:45.530
a one side that is different from that.
It's on a diagonal.

810
00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.000
And this indicates to us,

811
00:51:47.001 --> 00:51:50.380
once again that likely there were some remains on the site,
uh,

812
00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:54.350
that had to be taken into consideration when this structure was designed.

813
00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:57.920
But otherwise it has a colonnade around it.
It has,
in this case,

814
00:51:57.921 --> 00:52:02.540
three temples on one end,
which is different from what we usually see in Rome,

815
00:52:02.541 --> 00:52:03.440
but not unheard of.

816
00:52:03.441 --> 00:52:07.790
I didn't show you an example of what we do know of triple temples,
uh,
in,

817
00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:10.880
in architectural spaces,
complexes in Rome,

818
00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:13.040
a fairly early on already in the republic,

819
00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:16.160
but we see three of them here and they're very instructive ones.

820
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.530
The North Temple,
we don't know to whom that was dedicated.

821
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.870
The other is a temple of Roma and Augustus,

822
00:52:20.871 --> 00:52:24.530
which one sees in most Augustan cities.
Uh,
and then over here,

823
00:52:24.531 --> 00:52:28.600
a temple of Liebherr pot tear who was Liebherr pot tear will leave bear pot.

824
00:52:28.601 --> 00:52:32.090
There was a god who was very important to this particular part of the world.

825
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:35.600
So this interesting coming together of Roman gods.

826
00:52:35.601 --> 00:52:40.601
Local gods are a another indication that we are dealing here with a Roman

827
00:52:41.361 --> 00:52:46.160
society that is being laid on top of an earlier society and that the,

828
00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.280
that the cultures,
religion,
uh,

829
00:52:48.281 --> 00:52:52.730
architectural practices and so on of them merged together to make a very

830
00:52:52.731 --> 00:52:54.440
interesting may launch.

831
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:58.400
And we see that again extremely well in this old forum.

832
00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:02.750
The old forum was replaced by the new forum,

833
00:53:02.751 --> 00:53:06.380
the new Severen forum in the age of Septum,
Mya severities.

834
00:53:06.381 --> 00:53:11.381
And that is the single most important building is still surviving in the city of

835
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.050
a building complex in the city of leftist Magdna.

836
00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:19.760
And I show you once again that view from the air of the forum,

837
00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:24.920
the Severin Forum that we believe dates to 216,

838
00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:29.930
a d in fact completed by Caracalla in 216 and I,

839
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:34.680
and now that you know a bit more about Leptos Spadina and building practice

840
00:53:34.681 --> 00:53:35.011
there,

841
00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:39.210
I think you'll see something that you probably didn't notice before when you

842
00:53:39.211 --> 00:53:42.870
looked at this image when we looked at it earlier.
And that is a,

843
00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.130
if you look at the actual,
um,

844
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:49.470
remains of the columnar architecture,
for example,

845
00:53:49.471 --> 00:53:51.150
from this forum,

846
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:56.390
you will see very quickly that we are dealing not with local limestone but with

847
00:53:56.690 --> 00:54:00.210
imported marble.
If you look at this marble in the foreground in particular,

848
00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:03.120
you can see that it has a pink tint to it.
Uh,

849
00:54:03.121 --> 00:54:08.100
that pink tint tells us that it is a,
it is a granite pink granite,

850
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:10.380
uh,
that we know was quarried and Egypt.

851
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:14.900
So we are seeing marbles being brought from all over the world,
uh,

852
00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:19.830
to be used in the construction of these Severen structures.

853
00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:23.700
A plan of the AH,

854
00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:28.730
Severen forum in leftist magna shows it to be a very interesting structure.

855
00:54:28.801 --> 00:54:29.221
Indeed.

856
00:54:29.221 --> 00:54:33.960
One that is based on earlier models in Rome is especially the forum of Trajan,

857
00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:38.190
uh,
but one that departs from it in all kinds of interesting ways.

858
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:42.290
It's also interesting to us,
not only because it tells us what are,

859
00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.280
it shows us what was being built in Severen Magdna,

860
00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:48.470
but it also gives us some indication of what a,

861
00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:53.130
an emperor likes up Timmy severes might have built in Rome if he had built a

862
00:54:53.131 --> 00:54:53.940
forum in Rome.

863
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:58.230
You'll remember that I told you the last great imperial forum in Rome was the

864
00:54:58.231 --> 00:55:02.280
forum of Trajan and there was no other forum built later than that.

865
00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:05.280
But what if you know,
the,
what if,
what if,
uh,

866
00:55:05.281 --> 00:55:07.680
September he has had said severs had build,

867
00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:12.720
Bill had built a forum and basilica in Rome.
What would it have looked like?
Well,

868
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:15.780
maybe it would've looked something like this,
at least in plan,

869
00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:20.280
but almost certainly not in building materials.
As we look at it here,

870
00:55:20.281 --> 00:55:24.720
we see that it is conventional in that is very large in scale.
By the way,

871
00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:29.220
it's conventional in that it has one great open rectangular space surrounded by

872
00:55:29.221 --> 00:55:32.910
columns with a temple put up against one of the short walls,

873
00:55:32.911 --> 00:55:36.900
in fact pushed up against one of the short walls dominating the space in front

874
00:55:36.901 --> 00:55:40.260
of it.
If we look quickly at the plan of the temple,

875
00:55:40.261 --> 00:55:41.880
we will see it's fairly conventional.

876
00:55:41.881 --> 00:55:46.881
Also plain back wall single seller in this case a freestanding columns in the

877
00:55:47.821 --> 00:55:51.300
port deep porch,
single staircase facade orientation.

878
00:55:51.301 --> 00:55:54.960
So very much in keeping with what we've seen throughout the course of the

879
00:55:54.961 --> 00:55:55.794
semester.

880
00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:00.800
You'll notice also on this side of the structure of the southern side of the

881
00:56:00.811 --> 00:56:03.930
structure,
a series of shops or to bear and I,

882
00:56:03.931 --> 00:56:08.430
we've seen that in forum design before.
Think of the form of Julius Caesar,
uh,

883
00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:13.520
where they were placed in exactly that same position we see over here the

884
00:56:13.651 --> 00:56:17.610
basilica of the structure.
I'm not going to describe,
it's planned for the moment.

885
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:19.320
We'll return to it a little bit later.

886
00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:24.560
But what's interesting about it here is the way in which it is splayed off it is

887
00:56:24.971 --> 00:56:28.780
not actually related exactly to the,
uh,

888
00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:30.770
to the forum proper.
Uh,

889
00:56:30.771 --> 00:56:34.720
it moves off in a slightly different direction with the Romans have done this.

890
00:56:34.721 --> 00:56:37.380
If they didn't have to,
certainly not a,

891
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:42.070
they probably again had to contend with some sort of earlier building on the

892
00:56:42.071 --> 00:56:44.320
site,
which forced them to do this.

893
00:56:44.321 --> 00:56:48.040
But they've done something quite extraordinary as you can see here.

894
00:56:48.041 --> 00:56:52.420
They wanted to make sure that when you were standing in the forum and looking

895
00:56:52.421 --> 00:56:53.620
toward the basilica,

896
00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:58.860
that you wouldn't realize that that basilica was not on axis with the forum.

897
00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:02.140
And so they've done something extraordinarily ingenious.

898
00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:04.840
And what they've done is to create this series,

899
00:57:04.841 --> 00:57:09.841
this wedge shaped series of shops that forms the transition between the forum

900
00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:14.800
and the basilica that's narrow on,
went in and is wider on the other end.

901
00:57:14.801 --> 00:57:16.840
And when you stand and look at it from the inside,

902
00:57:16.841 --> 00:57:21.160
and I'll show you an image in a moment,
it looks like it is completely straight,

903
00:57:21.161 --> 00:57:25.360
which it is in the front.
Uh,
but you can't tell what lies behind.

904
00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:26.620
So when you're standing there,

905
00:57:26.621 --> 00:57:30.430
you do get the sense and as you move from the forum,
uh,

906
00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:35.510
into this niche apps area here through columns into the columns of the basilica,

907
00:57:36.011 --> 00:57:37.540
which you can do a,

908
00:57:37.541 --> 00:57:42.541
you don't realize that the basilica is really off axis with the rest of the

909
00:57:43.301 --> 00:57:43.631
building.

910
00:57:43.631 --> 00:57:48.631
So some ingenious work here on the part of the designers of the separate forum.

911
00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:54.220
I'll come back to the basilica again momentarily,
but for the moment,

912
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:56.550
just to stick with the forum proper,
uh,

913
00:57:56.551 --> 00:58:01.551
we are looking here at one of the entrance ways into that forum.

914
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:02.180
Uh,

915
00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:06.400
and you can see even in black and white that we're dealing with local sandstone

916
00:58:06.401 --> 00:58:09.910
or limestone for the walls,
uh,
but with,
uh,

917
00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:14.620
imported marble for the doorways and for the pilasters.

918
00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:16.060
And if you look very carefully,

919
00:58:16.061 --> 00:58:19.960
you will see that these are capitals that are unlike any capital's we've seen

920
00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:21.720
thus far this semester.
And,

921
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:25.580
and underscore again this interesting merging of influences,

922
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:28.840
not only from Rome but elsewhere in the Roman empire.

923
00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:30.760
We see these striatum,

924
00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:35.470
the striatum capital's on the pilasters up above that are very similar to the

925
00:58:35.471 --> 00:58:37.730
sorts of things we see in Egypt.
Uh,

926
00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:41.530
and then if we look at these capitals down below and we see these capitals used

927
00:58:41.531 --> 00:58:45.400
extensively in the forum,
I'll show you other examples momentarily.

928
00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:49.330
You will see that what we are dealing with here are the Roman a can't this

929
00:58:49.331 --> 00:58:50.320
leaves at the bottom.

930
00:58:50.321 --> 00:58:54.430
But growing out of those Roman a canvas leaves are lotus leaves,

931
00:58:54.431 --> 00:58:57.280
Lotus leaves,
uh,
that come from Egypt,

932
00:58:57.490 --> 00:59:00.220
a lotus leaves that were used in Egyptian capitol.

933
00:59:00.221 --> 00:59:04.840
So this interesting merging of Roman culture,
Egyptian culture,

934
00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:09.190
uh,
for this structure in a Roman north Africa.

935
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:14.430
This is a view of the shops of that wedge shape section of shops were standing

936
00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:18.700
in the forum looking back toward the basilica about to go from one to the other

937
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:22.400
and you can see that they are in a straight line and that you would not be able

938
00:59:22.401 --> 00:59:26.990
to tell as you were standing in front of them.
Uh,
that the,
uh,
that the,

939
00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:30.610
uh,
forum was not actually related to,
uh,

940
00:59:30.730 --> 00:59:32.180
the basilica next door.

941
00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:37.330
We can also see some remains of statuary columns preserved in their entirety as

942
00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:41.150
well as capitols of the same type that I just showed you.

943
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:46.150
The combination of Lotus leaves and a canvas leaves the temple,

944
00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:51.680
the temple in this,
uh,
the temple here is the one that you see here.

945
00:59:51.681 --> 00:59:52.970
It is a restored view.

946
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:58.210
It is from Ward Perkins is a temple that was put up by Caracalla.
Uh,

947
00:59:58.290 --> 01:00:02.480
it's this the temple at the back wall that we looked at and plan just before it

948
01:00:02.481 --> 01:00:07.370
was put up by Caracalla to honor his parents as a due,
uh,

949
01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:12.380
September.
The severity and Julia Domino.
It's interesting in a variety of ways.

950
01:00:12.381 --> 01:00:15.080
It's interesting because it is surrounded by a,

951
01:00:15.081 --> 01:00:18.270
an arcade columns supporting occupations.

952
01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:22.510
We've seen an interest in this sort of thing,
uh,
starting to come to the fore at,

953
01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:26.390
at this time we saw it in late domestic architecture in Ostia.

954
01:00:26.391 --> 01:00:30.620
Think of the house of cupid and psyche for example,
of the early fourth century.

955
01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:35.150
So placing these arcades on columns with Medusa heads in between them is

956
01:00:35.151 --> 01:00:38.330
something that comes to the fourth.
This time.
Uh,

957
01:00:38.331 --> 01:00:42.020
we see that the temple is placed on a very,
very tall podium,

958
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:44.240
19 feet tall.
Why?

959
01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:48.110
To raise it up over the walls so that you could see it from a distance.

960
01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:48.920
It's like they,

961
01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:53.920
when they raise the to Liam and Ostia also up high so that it could compete with

962
01:00:54.051 --> 01:00:56.750
the apartment houses.
The same general idea here.

963
01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.720
Local limestone for the walls,

964
01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:04.760
imported marble for the columns.
Uh,
the,
um,
the,

965
01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:08.600
uh,
the staircase is interesting.
It's a single staircase,

966
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.910
but you can see it as parameter all in shape.

967
01:01:10.911 --> 01:01:13.190
I don't want to push the Egyptian thing too far,

968
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:17.750
but it's conceivable that it might've been designed under Egyptian influence.

969
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.180
And if you look at the column bases,

970
01:01:20.181 --> 01:01:24.860
we know that they were depicted with images of the battle between God's and

971
01:01:24.861 --> 01:01:29.300
giants.
A,
uh,
a very important theme in Greek art.
Uh,

972
01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.650
so we see,
once again,

973
01:01:30.651 --> 01:01:33.530
what's so interesting about some of these provincial cities,

974
01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:37.220
this coming together of influences from all over the world,
from Greece,

975
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:41.630
from Carthage,
from Egypt,
and also of course from Rome.

976
01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:46.330
Here's a view of the arcades.
The Medusa's heads,

977
01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:49.310
very deeply carved a,
as you can see here,

978
01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:54.470
characteristic also of the decorative work of the severance period.
Uh,
the plan,

979
01:01:54.471 --> 01:01:56.990
once again that shows us the,
uh,

980
01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:02.020
the basilica central nave side aisles apses on either side,

981
01:02:02.361 --> 01:02:06.540
looking very much like the Basilica Olivia of Trajan in Rome.
Uh,

982
01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:10.880
probably influenced by that look.
Also you,
there's a wall here.

983
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.810
You can walk into the wall at several points and there are columns decorating

984
01:02:14.811 --> 01:02:17.630
that wall.
Columns that just project into our space.

985
01:02:17.631 --> 01:02:19.770
They have no structural purpose whatsoever.

986
01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:24.480
The in and out a undulation of the wall through the traditional vocabulary of

987
01:02:24.481 --> 01:02:25.550
architecture.
Uh,

988
01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:29.570
another sign that we're moving toward what I've called a baroque phase,
uh,

989
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.050
in a Roman antiquity.

990
01:02:31.051 --> 01:02:36.051
This is an amazing view from the air of the remains of the forum and also the

991
01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:39.690
basilica.
The basilica is better preserved than the forum.
Uh,

992
01:02:39.691 --> 01:02:43.850
the basilica and you can see how beautifully this is cited right near the sea.

993
01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:47.940
Again,
we're dealing with a port here,
port city here.
You can see the apps is,

994
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:49.800
you can see the preserve columns.

995
01:02:49.801 --> 01:02:53.960
You can see the wedge shape section of shops here.
Uh,
and uh,

996
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:58.970
you can see again that the basilica has many of its columns better preserved

997
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:03.980
than those in the forum.
We see them here.
Uh,

998
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:07.350
we can get a much better sense of what the basilica looked like in antiquity.

999
01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:11.820
In fact,
this is much better preserved than the Basilica Olivia in Rome.

1000
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.760
We see the,
and we see the difference in the materials.

1001
01:03:14.761 --> 01:03:19.500
The pink granite from Egypt used here as well.
Uh,
the Corinthian,

1002
01:03:19.501 --> 01:03:22.200
in this case,
Corinthian capitals rather than the Po.

1003
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:26.130
The Lotus leaf capital's a sandstone for the wall.

1004
01:03:26.131 --> 01:03:31.131
So this combination of local stone and especially imported marbles for this

1005
01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:35.290
structure.
Here's a restored view of the interior,
uh,

1006
01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:37.680
where we can see it was two storied originally,

1007
01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:41.580
just like the Basilica Olympian Rome,
like the basilica opion Rome,

1008
01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:46.490
a flat ceiling with a co,
a coffered ceiling.
As you can see above.
Uh,

1009
01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.550
and,
uh,
we can also see the niches have coughing in them.

1010
01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:54.390
Very interesting decoration,
use of columns on two tiers,

1011
01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:56.790
no structural purpose whatsoever.

1012
01:03:56.970 --> 01:03:59.580
Decorative only projecting into our space,

1013
01:03:59.581 --> 01:04:04.560
creating that in and out undulating movement.
And then a very unusual motif,

1014
01:04:04.561 --> 01:04:06.450
architectural motif in the center.

1015
01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:10.770
I show you here the south apps where we can see the pink granite once again,

1016
01:04:10.771 --> 01:04:15.771
preserve a ionic capitals in this particular case for that niche.

1017
01:04:15.901 --> 01:04:20.440
And then these very heavily decorated pilasters on either side,
uh,

1018
01:04:20.530 --> 01:04:24.270
and in the center of the niche,
these very tall columns.

1019
01:04:24.271 --> 01:04:27.750
This is very interesting because it seems to have had no purpose whatsoever.

1020
01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:32.960
Then just to stand there and look good to colossal columns on tall basis,

1021
01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:38.340
uh,
with Corinthian capitals and then a lintel on top of those.
Uh,

1022
01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:42.030
and then,
uh,
Griffin's uh,
and then another lintel on the top.

1023
01:04:42.031 --> 01:04:45.300
What was the purpose of this?
Did it have some kind of religious purpose?

1024
01:04:45.301 --> 01:04:47.370
While this is a civic structure,
so unlikely,

1025
01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.100
it's just a decoration among other decorations,

1026
01:04:50.101 --> 01:04:54.900
but using architectural elements in toto,
the peers are very,

1027
01:04:54.901 --> 01:04:56.730
very interesting.
They're eaten away.

1028
01:04:56.731 --> 01:05:01.710
D materialized by their sculpture as you can see here,
light and dark,
uh,

1029
01:05:01.711 --> 01:05:05.160
accentuated.
And if you look at the details of them,

1030
01:05:05.161 --> 01:05:09.420
you will see that one of them are a couple of them have scenes of the uh,

1031
01:05:09.421 --> 01:05:11.340
of the 12 labors of Hercules.

1032
01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:14.180
Remember this was a building that was completed by Caracalla.

1033
01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:16.040
Is it a stretch to say,
uh,

1034
01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:20.920
that Caracalla a or might have wanted to have her Kuli and imagery here as he

1035
01:05:20.921 --> 01:05:25.921
did in the baths of Caracalla or the benefactor who helped us build this.

1036
01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:30.070
Might have had that in mind as well to make that connection might be far
fetched,

1037
01:05:30.071 --> 01:05:34.030
but certainly something worth thinking about and to more details of that

1038
01:05:34.031 --> 01:05:38.260
decoration here I want to mention just in passing,
uh,

1039
01:05:38.261 --> 01:05:40.000
the arch of Septimius severities.

1040
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:43.120
It's more work of sculpture than it is an architecture and it has a lot of

1041
01:05:43.121 --> 01:05:46.240
figural scenes that are interesting for their iconography.

1042
01:05:46.241 --> 01:05:50.290
But I just want to make passing reference to it because it is the one building

1043
01:05:50.291 --> 01:05:54.790
that I mentioned that we do believe was put up in two oh three a and ready for

1044
01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:59.770
Septimius his visit to the city.
It also is interesting because it is,

1045
01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:00.540
it is,

1046
01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:04.900
it was made at the same time as the arch in Rome,

1047
01:06:04.901 --> 01:06:09.580
the Parthian arch in Rome,
203,
eight d and also celebrates,
uh,

1048
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:13.060
Septimius saveras his victories over the Parthians.

1049
01:06:13.061 --> 01:06:17.170
That's exactly what it celebrates in the scenes are alluded to in the figural

1050
01:06:17.171 --> 01:06:18.004
sculpture,

1051
01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:22.900
but it is very different from the arch in Rome because it is a tech trap lot.

1052
01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:26.150
I mentioned the tech trap alum and we went over the paper topics,

1053
01:06:26.151 --> 01:06:27.910
the four sided arch,

1054
01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:31.990
the purpose of which is to span two streets that cross at that,

1055
01:06:31.991 --> 01:06:36.550
that intersect at that particular point so that traffic can go through the arch

1056
01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:40.480
going both ways.
It's really quite ingenious.
And we see the Ted Trap,

1057
01:06:40.481 --> 01:06:43.720
Alon does not,
does not take off in Rome,

1058
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:47.350
but it's very popular in the provinces and we see it here.

1059
01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:51.970
We also see as we look at this structure and it has been,
um,
by the way,

1060
01:06:51.971 --> 01:06:54.810
it had fallen down completely but has been redirected.

1061
01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:56.980
Although the sculpture on it,
uh,
is,

1062
01:06:57.010 --> 01:07:00.010
is casts and the original sculpture in the museum.

1063
01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:04.450
But we do see here something very interesting and that is that they have used

1064
01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.150
the broken triangular pediment here.

1065
01:07:07.151 --> 01:07:12.151
You can see the way the pediment is broken apart and used a used only in part

1066
01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:17.350
here,
which is something we do not see.
Uh,
in,
um,
Roman arch design.

1067
01:07:17.351 --> 01:07:21.010
Here's a view of it from the side where you can get a sense of the drama of

1068
01:07:21.011 --> 01:07:24.940
those broken triangular pediments as well as the way in which this structure was

1069
01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:28.240
completely covered with a sculpture.

1070
01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:32.410
And you can see some of that sculpture also d materializing the arch in a way

1071
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:36.220
very similar to the peers that we saw also in the basilica.

1072
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:41.670
And I just show you too quickly to details of the figural sculpture that we see.

1073
01:07:42.221 --> 01:07:47.080
They're honoring Septimus severities and his two sons in a triumphal chariot at

1074
01:07:47.081 --> 01:07:47.890
the top.

1075
01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:52.890
And then down here below Septimus shaking hands with his elder son Caracalla as

1076
01:07:53.021 --> 01:07:58.021
if giving him a power gave us stands in the center gate is still alive and not

1077
01:07:58.121 --> 01:08:01.780
erased on this monument here.
Uh,
and uh,

1078
01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:05.590
but gave us standing here and then this wonderful image of Julia Domino with her

1079
01:08:05.591 --> 01:08:10.300
fabulous wig,
a standing next to them and looking on a,

1080
01:08:10.301 --> 01:08:11.560
but look at this figure here.

1081
01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:15.710
Who is this Hercules with his club standing right behind the shoulder of

1082
01:08:15.711 --> 01:08:17.180
Caracalla.
So once again,

1083
01:08:17.181 --> 01:08:21.470
this very close association between Cora Koller and his alter ego.

1084
01:08:22.190 --> 01:08:26.740
I want to end today with my favorite building.
And left is Magdna,

1085
01:08:26.741 --> 01:08:31.730
in fact one of my favorite buildings from the entire semester because it's so

1086
01:08:31.731 --> 01:08:32.564
unique.

1087
01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:38.170
This is the so called hunting baths at Leptos Magnar they date to the late

1088
01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:41.960
second to uh,
early third century.

1089
01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:46.790
And I show you an accident metric view from ward Perkins are very well preserved

1090
01:08:46.791 --> 01:08:48.770
and I'll show you,
show them to you in a moment.

1091
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:52.160
This bath is interesting in all kinds of ways,

1092
01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:56.600
but it's interesting primarily because it's a private bath,
not a public bath.

1093
01:08:56.601 --> 01:09:00.800
We've looked at so many public buses semester.
What do I mean by a private bath?

1094
01:09:00.801 --> 01:09:02.060
Not One individual.

1095
01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:06.830
I suppose one could call Hadrian's bads in his villa private and that they were

1096
01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:11.600
for his private villa.
Uh,
but,
but here a private bath within a city,

1097
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:15.710
uh,
a private bed,
not for a single individual,
but a group of individuals,

1098
01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:18.830
a guild of men whose job,

1099
01:09:18.850 --> 01:09:23.600
whose profession we believe it was to collect animals,

1100
01:09:23.601 --> 01:09:27.350
wild animals in the wilds of Africa,
and uh,

1101
01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:30.270
send them to Italy.
That was their business.

1102
01:09:30.271 --> 01:09:35.271
Send them to feed in a sense the amphitheaters of Rome and the rest of Italy.

1103
01:09:36.441 --> 01:09:39.950
That was their job.
They probably make quite a fortune doing that.

1104
01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:43.910
And they got together and built for themselves is wonderful bath,

1105
01:09:43.911 --> 01:09:47.120
which you're going to see right near the sea where they could kick back and

1106
01:09:47.121 --> 01:09:51.560
relax and hang out with each other.
And what a place it was a,

1107
01:09:51.561 --> 01:09:53.210
and what's interesting about it is,

1108
01:09:53.211 --> 01:09:57.960
although we have seen that concrete was not used extensively in leftist Mondo,

1109
01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:02.480
it is used for this building and this building is much more innovative for that

1110
01:10:02.481 --> 01:10:05.120
reason.
Then most of the other structures we've seen,

1111
01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:08.030
even those that honors Septum,
you saveras like the arch,

1112
01:10:08.031 --> 01:10:11.840
like the forum and like the basilica.
What do I mean by innovative?

1113
01:10:11.841 --> 01:10:15.740
You can see the way in which,
uh,
concrete has been used here to its utmost.

1114
01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:19.490
You'll enter into the structure.
The forecourt is an octagon.

1115
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:23.780
The entrance vestibule is an octagon for the entrance vestibule.

1116
01:10:23.781 --> 01:10:25.160
You go into the tip of Dorian,

1117
01:10:25.161 --> 01:10:28.710
which you can see has a segmented Doma kind of Pumpkin don't,
uh,

1118
01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:33.260
influenced by those earlier ones of Hadrian into the Caldari him over here,

1119
01:10:33.261 --> 01:10:35.880
which is large and barrel vaulted,
the frigate Dory.

1120
01:10:35.881 --> 01:10:40.520
I'm also barrel vaulted here as you can see,
but what makes these,

1121
01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:45.890
these rooms particularly exciting architecturally and different than anything

1122
01:10:46.461 --> 01:10:51.080
we've seen in fact unique is that not only can we see the shapes of these vaults

1123
01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:54.440
on the concrete bolts on the inside when we stand here,

1124
01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:59.660
but also from the outside,
the shapes are visible from the outside as well.

1125
01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:03.110
You can see from the outside that this was a barrel vaulted rooms.

1126
01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:07.280
You can see from the outside that this was a barrel vaulted room and you can see

1127
01:11:07.281 --> 01:11:10.890
from the outside that this one had a segmented dome.
Uh,

1128
01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:14.100
we haven't seen that in other architecture.
Yes,

1129
01:11:14.101 --> 01:11:15.630
you can get a little glimmer of it.

1130
01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.590
When you look at the frigging Daria of the great imperial Baz in Rome,

1131
01:11:19.591 --> 01:11:22.470
you didn't get a sense of the groin vaults from,
from the outside,

1132
01:11:22.471 --> 01:11:25.670
sort of a but not in the way that you can hear.

1133
01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.180
This is very revolutionary,
very different,
uh,
and uh,

1134
01:11:30.210 --> 01:11:32.520
very special to this particular building.

1135
01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:36.540
And I'll show you two last images where you can see that also from the outside,

1136
01:11:36.541 --> 01:11:37.710
this one in black and white.

1137
01:11:37.711 --> 01:11:41.820
And you can see the massing of these geometric forms from the outside,

1138
01:11:41.821 --> 01:11:45.780
which make very clear what lies inside.
Very clear,

1139
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:49.710
the member,
the Pantheon with,
it's surprised you standing outside.

1140
01:11:49.711 --> 01:11:53.730
It looks like a typical Greek Greek temple.
You walk inside,
wow,
it's a,

1141
01:11:53.731 --> 01:11:55.590
it's a Roman interior here.

1142
01:11:55.591 --> 01:11:59.850
It's inside and outside are brought together in a way that we haven't seen

1143
01:11:59.851 --> 01:12:02.880
before.
When you stand at the outside of this building and look at it,

1144
01:12:02.881 --> 01:12:07.110
you can tell what those shapes are like on the inside in a way that we have not

1145
01:12:07.111 --> 01:12:10.770
seen before.
A truly revolutionary building.

1146
01:12:10.771 --> 01:12:15.300
And I show you one last image.
It's faded,
but it's the best I've got.

1147
01:12:15.301 --> 01:12:17.280
And it's a really,
it's a really,
I think,

1148
01:12:17.281 --> 01:12:21.450
very effective image in terms of showing you what these bats look like,

1149
01:12:21.451 --> 01:12:25.800
silhouetted against the sand and the see the barrel vaults,

1150
01:12:25.801 --> 01:12:28.100
the segmented vaults,
all of those,
uh,

1151
01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:31.710
clearly revealed on the outside as they were on the inside.

1152
01:12:31.711 --> 01:12:35.400
A very innovative structure put up,
not by the emperor,

1153
01:12:35.401 --> 01:12:36.930
not by the reigning emperor,

1154
01:12:36.931 --> 01:12:41.550
not by benefactors who wanted to honor the emperor and not part of that great

1155
01:12:41.551 --> 01:12:42.690
Severen renovation,

1156
01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:47.460
but part of the individual hearts and minds of this particular group of men.

1157
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:52.620
And what can I say to end this lecture except for those men in the late second,

1158
01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:57.780
early third century.
A d life was good.
Thank you.
All.
