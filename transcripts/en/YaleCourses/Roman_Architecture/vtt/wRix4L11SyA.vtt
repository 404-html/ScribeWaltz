1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.670
Good morning everybody.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.810
We have talked in the course of the semester many times about the Hellenization

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.920
of Roman architecture,

4
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:15.921
about the impact that Greek architecture had on Roman architecture.

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.830
And we've talked in particular about the to fill Hellenic emperors Augustus and

6
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:27.120
also Hadrian and the kinds of monuments they commissioned during their rain.

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.590
Uh,
that was so clearly based on those in ancient Athens,

8
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.491
Athens,

9
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:37.491
especially if the classical period cradle of civilization and where one,

10
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.150
some when when we're,

11
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.260
we're a scholars often speak of as the birth of democracy.

12
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.660
I want to turn full circle,

13
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:50.661
go full circle here and return to the whole question of Athens by looking at

14
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:56.090
Athens itself.
Because Athens also became a Roman colony.
I,

15
00:00:56.091 --> 00:01:01.091
and you won't be surprised to hear that it was built up under primarily to Roman

16
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:05.020
emperors,
namely Augustus and Hadrian justice.

17
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.070
One would expect the two major fill Hellenic Roman emperors.

18
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.190
I show you a spectacular view of Athens as it looks today.

19
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.020
Uh,
and you can see here,
uh,
that the city of Athens,

20
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.880
uh,
and it's,
uh,
some of it's antiquities extremely well preserved,
uh,

21
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.920
is a city that is located.

22
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:33.880
It's actually a city that's located in planes surrounded by mountains,
uh,

23
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.700
and it also has three major hills is I think you can see from this extraordinary

24
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.560
image.
Uh,
one of those hills of course,
is the famous Acropolis.

25
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.890
And I think by the way,
if one were to make,

26
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:48.720
I don't know how many of you have been to Athens,

27
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:53.721
but if one were to make a list of the 10 places that one really must see at some

28
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:58.740
point during their lives and experience,
Athens is certainly one of them,

29
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:03.300
mainly for the Acropolis,
which you see in the center of this image here.

30
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.430
That's one of the major,
uh,
hills.
The other two are Mount Lee Cabi toss,

31
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:12.630
which you see in the upper most part.
That's actually the highest hill of Athens.

32
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:14.970
And then there's another one called the [inaudible] hill,

33
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:17.910
which we're going to actually talk about today because there's an important

34
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:21.240
monument there.
The Jose on hail or the hill of the muses.

35
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:24.930
It's located off this image right where I'm standing here.

36
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.570
And those three hills,
uh,
as you can see,

37
00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:32.070
rise up in the city of Athens.
And it's not surprising.

38
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:37.071
And the rest of it surrounded essentially by a city that was constructed

39
00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:42.120
primarily after World War II,
mainly residential houses of six,
five,

40
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:45.410
six stories,
residences,
uh,
that are,
uh,

41
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.690
that are mostly white in color as I think you can see here.

42
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.960
But the Acropolis rising up in the center in an amazing way,

43
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.290
uh,
the city of Athens,
um,
we know,
uh,
was,

44
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.150
was founded in the Neolithic period I was found in the Neolithic period.

45
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.820
So it goes way back in the same way that Rome does.

46
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.920
And it's not surprising to see them founding the city of Athens on one of those

47
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:15.940
hills.
And which he'll did,
they pick,
they pick the hill,
that's the flattest,

48
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.460
which makes it easiest to build on.

49
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:21.910
And that is the rock of the Acropolis itself.

50
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.950
So they put their religious structures on the Acropolis.
And then over time,

51
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.150
uh,
the city begins to grow up around the rock of the Acropolis.

52
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:34.990
Now this is very interesting because if you think back to Rome and its

53
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:37.300
beginnings,
you'll recall that Rome too,

54
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:41.260
was founded on a hill because hills can be most readily fortified.

55
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.060
So Rome was founded,

56
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:48.061
you'll recall on essentially on two hills on the Palatine hill by Romulus where

57
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:49.990
he established residences,

58
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.800
but also on the Capitol on hill where they built the temple of Jupiter,

59
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.570
optimist mocks and Ms Capitol Lena.

60
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.360
So that being the religious center of the city,

61
00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:00.790
we see the same sort of thing happening here.
Uh,

62
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.920
the city growing up on the Acropolis.

63
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:07.310
And then we'll see that the meeting in marketplace is down below,
uh,

64
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.390
the in the valley below the Acropolis in the same way that the Roman forum or

65
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:16.930
what became the Roman forum was in the valley beneath the Palatine hill and also

66
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:18.850
the capital line hale in Rome.

67
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:23.851
So very similar beginnings of four briefs as also for Rome.

68
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.540
As you all know,
uh,
Athens thrive,
particularly Greece in general,

69
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.590
thrive particularly in the fifth century BC under Paris,

70
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:37.270
Lees and continued to thrive into the Hellenistic period.

71
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.170
Uh,
but it was an 86 BC that Sala,

72
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.370
the Roman General Sela,
uh,
sacked Athens,

73
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.360
sacked Athens,

74
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:51.361
made Athens a Roman colony and in fact destroyed the walls of the city of

75
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.493
Athens.

76
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.710
So that a very obviously a very major point in the history of Athens when when

77
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:05.821
scholars talk about architecture that was put up by the Romans in Athens during

78
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:07.570
Roman times,

79
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.640
they talk about it as being primarily uninspired and rather derivative.

80
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.590
And you'll find this in your textbook.

81
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:18.490
Ward Perkins talks about how derivative,
uh,

82
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.520
Roman architecture in Greece is of its earlier counterparts that is from

83
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.140
classical and Hellenistic Athens.

84
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.130
And I think he has a point and it's something that we should all think about as

85
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:30.521
a group,

86
00:05:30.521 --> 00:05:34.300
whether we think that the buildings that we look at today are for the most part

87
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:37.570
derivative from the classical and Hellenistic past.

88
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.670
But I think to say only that is to miss the point in part because what we are

89
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:47.671
also going to see as we look at these buildings today is that the extraordinary

90
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:52.030
marbles that come from this part of the world,
Greek marbles,

91
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:54.370
and we'll talk about a number of them today,

92
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:59.360
the quality of those is so high or that it's hard to imagine any building made

93
00:05:59.361 --> 00:05:59.990
out of these.

94
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.990
Not spectacular just for the materials alone and also because the artists and

95
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:11.351
the architects and the artisans who were responsible for carving this marble had

96
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:13.580
been carving it for centuries.

97
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.690
And consequently they were particularly skilled at carbon marble.

98
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:22.400
And so what they produced has great beauty as I think you'll see today.

99
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.420
Uh,
so those two,
again,
a very important point,

100
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:30.380
I believe about the quality of these works of art and we're also going to see

101
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:31.340
works of architecture.

102
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:35.780
We're also going to see that at least two of them in my opinion,

103
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.580
are really distinctive.

104
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.390
A structure is different than anything we've seen before.
Uh,

105
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.350
and I think that you'll find they're quite innovative in their own way.

106
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:50.000
And we will look at,
as I said,
both of those,
um,
today,
uh,

107
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:55.001
the city of Athens began to be excavated by archeologists in the 1930s.

108
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.480
And those excavations,
which were scientific,

109
00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:01.790
very careful scientific excavations,

110
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.090
those excavations combined with information that we have from a writer of the

111
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.500
Greco Roman past,
a man by the name of [inaudible],
p a,

112
00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:15.740
U s a n I a s palisade Aeneas,

113
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.560
who was a Greek of the second century,

114
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:23.561
a d who traveled around Greece and described everything that he saw.

115
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.910
And He created in essence,
a guidebook to the great Greek and Roman antiquities.

116
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.800
The combination of his descriptions from the second century firsthand

117
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:38.801
descriptions of the monuments that stood in the second century along with the

118
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:44.270
scientific excavations of the 1930s.
And since,
uh,

119
00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:48.770
allow us to get an excellent sense of what,
not only what,

120
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.660
as we look at the remains today,

121
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:55.100
not only of what was there is there now and was there once upon a time,

122
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.410
but what these buildings actually were their identities,
uh,
and,
uh,

123
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.910
what their function was in Athens,

124
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.550
either in Greek or in Roman times.

125
00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:09.090
And we will use the information provided by both of those today,
uh,

126
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.780
to allow us to reconstruct the city,

127
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.830
the Roman city in particular.
Now the building,

128
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.510
as you could see from the view of the Acropolis,
uh,

129
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.420
there are a number of Greek structures on the top of the Acropolis and I'll show

130
00:08:23.421 --> 00:08:24.320
them to you later.

131
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.610
These include the great Greek entryway of the fifth century BC,

132
00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:32.060
the so called [inaudible],
the famous Parthenon of course,

133
00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:36.290
the small temple of Athena Nikkei,
uh,
and also the Eric theone,

134
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:39.980
which is the only building we've really discussed in any detail in the course of

135
00:08:39.981 --> 00:08:42.410
this semester of fifth century BC building.

136
00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:47.270
You see it here in an extraordinary view.
Now on the screen,
the Eric Theone,

137
00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:52.271
which we believe was built sometime between about four 21 and 406 BC.

138
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.690
And the reason that it's important is not because it's an incredible example,

139
00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:00.000
a fifth century Greek architecture,

140
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.450
but also because of the buildings up on the Acropolis.

141
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.390
It is the one that seems to have captured the imagination,
uh,
of,
uh,

142
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:13.070
of Augustus and also Hadrian when both of them visited the city of Athens,
uh,

143
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.270
but also of the Romans as a whole.

144
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:18.270
And you'll remember the reason for that is essentially a,

145
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.030
the porch of the maidens,
which you can see so well in this view,
uh,

146
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:28.230
the portrait of the maidens that exerted a very strong impact on a Augustus and

147
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:32.460
Hadrian.
Before I talk a little bit more about the portrait the maidens though,

148
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:33.900
just something about,
uh,

149
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.440
the rest of the construction that you can see as you look at the columns that

150
00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:39.300
they are of the ionic order,

151
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.660
a particularly attractive and elegant version of the ionic order with the ionic

152
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:47.530
capitals,
with they're very attractive volumes.
Uh,

153
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.340
you can also see the materials that are used here.

154
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:52.860
What you can see is what's used for the foundations.

155
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.050
That material is called Poor Oss,

156
00:09:55.051 --> 00:10:00.051
p o r o s porous use for the foundations of the Eric theone and also many other

157
00:10:00.781 --> 00:10:04.930
of the buildings that we'll look at today.
And then,
uh,
most out,

158
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.280
most importantly,
the most of the building,

159
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:13.230
the walls and the columns are made out of pentelic marble,

160
00:10:13.231 --> 00:10:16.950
p,
e,
n,
a,
t,
e,
l,
I,
C,
pentelic marble,

161
00:10:16.951 --> 00:10:19.200
which is from Mt.
Penn Telecon in Greece,

162
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.020
and is the marble that is used most often for,
uh,

163
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.200
for buildings in Athens,

164
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:29.340
both in Greek times and also enrollment times as we shall see today.

165
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.420
And it's characterized by being gleaming white,

166
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:38.170
really blindingly white as one looks at it in the very bright,
uh,

167
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.640
Greek son against the Blue Sky,
uh,

168
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.600
with regard to the courtyard and porch,
the porch of the maidens,

169
00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:47.220
very famous portrait of the maidens.

170
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.200
You'll recall that both Augustus and Hadrian visited Athens.

171
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:56.910
They both saw this monument.
The Eric theone had fallen into disrepair,

172
00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.860
uh,
by the age of Augustus.

173
00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:03.861
And Augustus was so admiring of this porch that he made the decision to have his

174
00:11:04.051 --> 00:11:09.051
own architects and artisans come to Athens to repair the porch.

175
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.190
Uh,
and they not only repaired the maidens themselves,
but also replaced one.

176
00:11:14.191 --> 00:11:17.070
One was in such bad shape.
I think it was the one in the back,
right?

177
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:22.230
It was in such bad shape,
uh,
that they,
uh,
restored that one entirely.

178
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.690
When they were there looking at those maintenance,
restoring them.
Uh,

179
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:31.650
they were so taken by them that they made plaster casts of those and they

180
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:33.060
brought them back to Rome.

181
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:37.680
And you'll recall that they were used in Rome as the models,
uh,

182
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.970
for,
uh,
maidens that were put up.
Here's,
here's a view of course,

183
00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:45.020
of those on the Acropolis from the front.
Uh,

184
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.800
they made reduced scale copies for the forum of Augustus in Rome.

185
00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:53.770
The second story of the forum of Augustus as you'll,
uh,

186
00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:57.380
and then down here you'll be reminded of the chorionic heads,
uh,

187
00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.420
also based on those of the Eric theone in this case to scale,

188
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:06.450
same scale as those in Athens use to line the Chronopolis of Hadrian's villa at

189
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:09.790
Tivoli.
So both emperors,
again,

190
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:14.791
Augustus and Hadrian very admiring of these works of art and wanted copies of

191
00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:20.560
them for,
in Augustus's case,
a public structure in Rome,
in Hadrian's case,

192
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:22.570
a private villa at Tivoli.

193
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:27.140
And we even believe that heroic Atticus and the tomb that he made for Ani

194
00:12:27.141 --> 00:12:31.810
Radilla in Rome,
that brick tomb,
the second century id on the via Apia,

195
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.260
uh,

196
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.730
there were two female figures that were found near excavated near that tomb and

197
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:40.330
it has been suggested that they too may belong to that tomb.

198
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.240
And while they are variations rather than copies,

199
00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:47.780
you can see that they too owe their origins to the choreography.

200
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.900
So this building,
the Eric Theone,
uh,

201
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:56.070
cast a spell on Augustus in Hadrian and was widely imitated in Rome.

202
00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:00.730
What we're going to see today is that this building continued to have a very

203
00:13:00.731 --> 00:13:05.410
strong impact also on the buildings that these same emperors Augustus in Hadrian

204
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.840
put up in Athens itself.

205
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.490
Before we look at Athens,
I want to take a very short,
uh,

206
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.730
short trip to another city,
uh,

207
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.940
the city of Elusiveness,
e l e u s,
I s,

208
00:13:21.941 --> 00:13:24.040
the city of elusive in Greece,

209
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:29.230
a because I want to make one more point about the [inaudible] and about the

210
00:13:29.231 --> 00:13:34.231
important exchange that we believe was going on between Rome and Athens already

211
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.640
in the late says Arion period.
And into the age of Augustus.

212
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.100
Augustus is sending his architects,
uh,

213
00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:44.800
but we think we think they are going back and forth.

214
00:13:44.801 --> 00:13:47.300
And that there is an important exchange of,
uh,

215
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:52.090
building techniques as well as architectural ideas that is happening between

216
00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:55.510
Rome and Greece in the age of Augustus,
a looseness.

217
00:13:55.511 --> 00:13:58.240
And you see what it looks like today,
uh,
is a,

218
00:13:58.241 --> 00:14:03.241
is a hilly town that is located not too far from Athens.

219
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:10.170
And it was particularly popular in the Greek period because are particularly

220
00:14:11.891 --> 00:14:13.820
important in the Greek period,
uh,

221
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.470
because it had a sanctuary of the goddess Demeter,

222
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:22.750
the goddess Demeter and the goddess Demeter are surrounding her was this very

223
00:14:22.751 --> 00:14:24.490
important mystery religion.

224
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:29.490
The so called Elliot Eleusinian mysteries after Hallucis Eleusinian mysteries,

225
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.330
uh,
that took place here.

226
00:14:31.331 --> 00:14:36.331
And people came from far and wide to partake of those Eleusinian mysteries.

227
00:14:36.341 --> 00:14:41.341
And so the city was built up in classical and Hellenistic Greek times.

228
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.130
It also remained important,
uh,

229
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:49.140
in the time of Caesar and into the time of Augustus and a DC and actually into

230
00:14:49.841 --> 00:14:54.841
the the and second centuries a d and over time decisions were made to add to the

231
00:14:56.841 --> 00:15:01.841
sanctuary of Demeter by the Roman emperors and generals and also at the s and

232
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.910
using of course the service of their only architects,
architects from Rome,

233
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.260
but working in concert with those in Greece.
And one of the,

234
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.520
one of the decisions that they made was to provide the sanctuary of Demeter with

235
00:15:16.521 --> 00:15:21.320
two additional gateways and inner gateway and an outer gateway.

236
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.700
The outer gateway,

237
00:15:22.701 --> 00:15:25.940
which is the larger of the two was put up in the second century,

238
00:15:25.941 --> 00:15:29.630
a by the and nine emperors.
But the earlier one,

239
00:15:29.631 --> 00:15:34.631
the inner inner or smaller gateway was put up already in 50 BC.

240
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:39.380
So,
uh,
at the late Republican period put up in 50 BC.

241
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:44.510
And uh,
there are some remains of it enough that we can come up with quite good

242
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.490
reconstructions of what it looked like.

243
00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:50.750
And I want to show you those fairly quickly in passing just because they

244
00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:55.751
underscore this important connection that is going on between Rome and Greece.

245
00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:01.070
In this period.
We see,
uh,
one,
one side.

246
00:16:01.071 --> 00:16:05.400
This gateway actually has two sides and we see one side of it here,
uh,

247
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:09.380
with columns and a quite traditional pediment above the triglycerides.

248
00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:14.390
And met a ps that you see here have representations of sheaves of wheat and what

249
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:18.810
are called Cysteine,
c,
I.
S,
t,
a,
e,
which are baskets.
Uh,

250
00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:20.930
both of which have to do with the Elo,

251
00:16:20.931 --> 00:16:23.990
Sydney and mysteries and the worship of Demeter.

252
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.090
But what's most interesting for us,

253
00:16:26.091 --> 00:16:28.940
and it may be a little hard for you to make this out and the risk in this

254
00:16:28.941 --> 00:16:29.780
reconstruction,

255
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:33.770
but what's interesting for us are the capitals because the capital's are

256
00:16:33.771 --> 00:16:38.240
examples of the so-called zoomorphic capital's that we've seen before,

257
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.190
capitals in which,
uh,
the upper parts of the bodies of animals,

258
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:43.760
uh,

259
00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.760
take to take the place of the spirals and grow out of the campus leaves.

260
00:16:49.161 --> 00:16:54.161
And I can show you a one was one preserved example from hallucis over here on

261
00:16:54.861 --> 00:16:59.510
the left hand side of the screen made out of pentelic marble.
Uh,

262
00:16:59.511 --> 00:17:01.780
we see it here and you can see the uh,

263
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:06.810
campus leaves and you can see a part of the upper part of a bull that is growing

264
00:17:08.031 --> 00:17:12.140
out of a bull proteome that is growing out of the canvas leaves.

265
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:16.190
That should remind you of something we saw a much earlier in the semester.

266
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.650
Does anyone remember where this capital comes from?

267
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.240
<v 1>I know you all know</v>

268
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:32.180
<v 0>not the forum transitory.
I'm know the forum of Augustus,</v>

269
00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:35.660
the forum of Augustus.
I had these capitals,

270
00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:38.120
some of these capitals that included Pega,

271
00:17:38.121 --> 00:17:41.590
sy growing out of the canvas leaves.

272
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.100
So this suggests to us this whole idea of having animals growing out of the

273
00:17:46.101 --> 00:17:50.220
canvas leaves,
uh,
it,
you know,
roughly not exactly at the same time,

274
00:17:50.221 --> 00:17:54.720
but roughly in the same periods is Aaron peered into the Gustin period suggests

275
00:17:54.721 --> 00:17:59.721
that ideas were floating back and forth between Athens and Rome in the time of

276
00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:04.410
Caesar and in the time of Augustus.
Now,

277
00:18:04.411 --> 00:18:06.450
if we look at the other side of the gate,

278
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.690
we see something that would seem to confirm that even more.

279
00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:11.340
And that is on the other side.

280
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:15.600
[inaudible] replace the columns with their zoomorphic capitals.

281
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.260
These are not,
as you can clearly see,
you see how they have their hands up.

282
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:23.970
They are not based exactly on those of the Eric theone porch.

283
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.040
They are variations of that,
but they are carry out.

284
00:18:27.041 --> 00:18:30.940
Its nonetheless holding the capitals on top of their heads.
Uh,

285
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:36.030
so we are seeing here even in even as grease becomes,
it becomes Roman,

286
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.451
uh,

287
00:18:36.451 --> 00:18:41.451
in this is area period and into the age of Augustus even as grease becomes Roman

288
00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:45.840
will,
it already does as I mentioned to you before,
when Sola Saxon and 86 BC.

289
00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:50.280
So in 50,
it's already a Roman colony.
Uh,
and so we can see the,

290
00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:53.780
these ideas that are,
that are going back and forth,
uh,

291
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.730
between Rome and Greece during this important period.

292
00:18:56.731 --> 00:19:01.650
And we see the power of the [inaudible] even in Greece itself as they are

293
00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:06.150
imitated there as well.
Uh,
from this point on,
for the rest of the lecture,

294
00:19:06.151 --> 00:19:08.930
I do want to concentrate on Athens.
Uh,

295
00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.700
and I want to begin again with the Acropolis.

296
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:16.050
This is actually a very interesting Google earth image of the Acropolis where

297
00:19:16.051 --> 00:19:18.150
you can see as it looks today,

298
00:19:18.151 --> 00:19:22.530
but where you can see super imposed on the current car.
On the Co,

299
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:27.690
the president remains a three d versions of the ancient buildings.

300
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.460
And we can see the ones that I've already mentioned.
Uh,
as you enter over here,

301
00:19:32.461 --> 00:19:37.350
you see the group Greek propylene hub of the fifth century BC,
the entrance gate.

302
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.890
Uh,
you see the Parthenon,
which is the largest building,

303
00:19:40.891 --> 00:19:45.480
a dork building on top of the Acropolis.
And then to it's left eye,

304
00:19:45.481 --> 00:19:48.390
you see the Eric Theone,
uh,
and in the back,

305
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.160
the remains of a museum that,

306
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.650
I mean not the remains a museum or that is in part underground,

307
00:19:55.651 --> 00:19:58.830
which is why it looks so flat that houses the original car,

308
00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:00.630
he audits and a lot of other sculpture.

309
00:20:00.631 --> 00:20:03.800
The ones that you see on the porch today are,

310
00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:08.340
are copies of those originals that are in the museum as well as other sculpture

311
00:20:08.341 --> 00:20:10.170
that was found on the Acropolis.

312
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.010
And you can also see here the Odi on the parolees.
Atticus,

313
00:20:14.011 --> 00:20:19.011
which I have mentioned to you with the Yani concert took place on the slope of

314
00:20:20.431 --> 00:20:23.880
the Acropolis here.
And then you can also see a theater.

315
00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:26.280
You see the theater in this corner right here,

316
00:20:26.281 --> 00:20:30.300
which is interesting because we believe at dates to the neurone Ian period,

317
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:35.400
which is interesting because you'll remember that Nero competed in the Olympic

318
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.280
Games and that he came to Greece to compete in the Olympic Games.

319
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.880
So it's not surprising even though we don't think of him as one of the Great

320
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.590
Phil Hellenic emperor is not surprising to see that.

321
00:20:43.591 --> 00:20:48.160
There was some construction in Greece during the Neronian period.

322
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:53.320
I want to turn to what's interesting actually about what the Romans do in the

323
00:20:53.321 --> 00:20:56.530
age of Augustus when Augustus goes up here himself,

324
00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.990
sends his architects to repair the porch,

325
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:04.230
is a decision is made to build a little shrine to Augustus and to Rome,

326
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.970
to a temple,
to Augustus and Roma,

327
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.920
and they decide to put it in the back left corner,
uh,
of the,
uh,

328
00:21:11.921 --> 00:21:15.010
of the Parthenon.
And you can barely see it there,

329
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.600
but it's a small round building at the upper most part of the Parthenon between

330
00:21:19.601 --> 00:21:23.500
that and the museum.
And I'm going to show it to you in detail in a moment,

331
00:21:23.501 --> 00:21:24.940
and they build that from scratch,

332
00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:30.180
but they also take a pillar that is located right at the beginning of a right in

333
00:21:30.251 --> 00:21:34.420
front of the proper Alayah that was put up in Hellenistic times and they

334
00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.210
transform that into a Roman monument.

335
00:21:37.211 --> 00:21:39.940
And it's those two to those two that I want to turn first.

336
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.460
This is Google earth again.
You can see the Parthenon,

337
00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:46.360
the Eric theone in these three d versions.
Can you see just that little,
you know,

338
00:21:46.361 --> 00:21:49.840
that round circle right next to the edge of the,
uh,

339
00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.710
of the Parthenon that is the temple of Augustus in Roma.

340
00:21:53.711 --> 00:21:58.110
And the fact that it is so small I think is strikingly interesting,
uh,

341
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.230
because it shows that although Augustus was willing to have a building put up to

342
00:22:02.231 --> 00:22:06.070
himself and to Roma on the Greek Acropolis and he,

343
00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.430
so he wanted to make his presence known,
he did it in a very modest,
uh,

344
00:22:10.431 --> 00:22:11.980
and very respectful way.

345
00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.760
It seemed to be you could have built a much larger than he did and he opted not

346
00:22:15.761 --> 00:22:16.610
to do that,
which,

347
00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.340
which tells us something about Augustus and perhaps his reverence for things

348
00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:22.310
Greek.
Uh,

349
00:22:22.311 --> 00:22:27.010
we are looking at two views of what survives of this small round shrine.
Uh,

350
00:22:27.011 --> 00:22:30.160
actually quite a bit.
I mean it's not standing any longer,

351
00:22:30.161 --> 00:22:35.020
but you can see parts of columns and parts of the curved in tablature,

352
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:39.880
curved architrave and,
and some of the other building elements very clearly here,

353
00:22:39.881 --> 00:22:43.810
including one of the capitals.
Again,
it was around structure.

354
00:22:43.811 --> 00:22:46.420
It had nine ionic columns.
It had,

355
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:51.540
it was made entirely out of stone and it had a sloping stone roof.

356
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:56.920
And this restored view shows us exactly what it looked like as well as how small

357
00:22:56.921 --> 00:23:01.750
it was in relationship to the Parthenon,
which absolutely dwarfs it.
And scale,

358
00:23:01.751 --> 00:23:04.240
as you can see in this restored view,
I hear this,

359
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:09.270
the small temple of Augustus enrollment was built sometime after 27 BC and you

360
00:23:11.081 --> 00:23:13.150
see it here,
ionic capitals,
uh,

361
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.470
and then a sloping stone roof.
Uh,

362
00:23:17.471 --> 00:23:19.690
and if I show you the remains again,

363
00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:24.160
where you can see one of those ionic capitals still preserved here.

364
00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:29.460
And we compare that ionic capital to the ionic capitals of the Eric theone in

365
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.880
Athens on the Acropolis.

366
00:23:33.881 --> 00:23:38.200
We see the close resemblance between the two.
And the reason for this,

367
00:23:38.201 --> 00:23:40.930
almost certainly that because Augustus is architects,

368
00:23:40.931 --> 00:23:45.350
we're working on the Eric theone,
we're restoring it,
were repairing it.

369
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.440
They were captivated not just by the car he audits,

370
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:52.100
but also by the rest of the,
uh,
of the structure,

371
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:56.460
by the quality of the Mirabelle,
by the attractiveness of the,
uh,

372
00:23:56.461 --> 00:24:00.750
of the ionic columns with their cat,
with their spiral volumes.

373
00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:01.683
At the top,

374
00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:07.010
and they not surprisingly use those as the model for the capitals that they

375
00:24:07.161 --> 00:24:12.161
carved for the small shrine of the temple of Augustus and Roma.

376
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:17.620
But I think it also shows their reverence for things Greek and their desire to

377
00:24:18.111 --> 00:24:19.960
establish a dialogue,
uh,

378
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:25.150
between the fifth century BC structure and the Roman structure built right after

379
00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.490
Augustus became emperor.

380
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.930
I wanted to mention one other material that is used in the Eric theone.

381
00:24:32.931 --> 00:24:35.210
We talked about the poor us for the foundations,

382
00:24:35.211 --> 00:24:38.960
the pentelic marble for the walls and the columns.
But if you look here,

383
00:24:38.961 --> 00:24:43.961
you'll see the slight blue cast to the marble that is used for the freeze that

384
00:24:44.631 --> 00:24:47.690
is so called Eleusinian marble from that part,

385
00:24:47.691 --> 00:24:52.340
from the elusive area of Greece,
Eleusinian marble with a slightly blue cast,

386
00:24:52.341 --> 00:24:55.370
and that is used in the Eric theone as well.

387
00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:02.030
I mentioned that the,
the temple of Roma and Augustus was put up.

388
00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:05.300
AW was built from scratch.
It was,

389
00:25:05.301 --> 00:25:07.890
there was nothing there before and it was built a new,
uh,

390
00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:09.860
during the Augustan period.
Uh,

391
00:25:09.861 --> 00:25:14.570
but I also noted that there was another monument that we could call a Roman

392
00:25:14.571 --> 00:25:18.160
intervention to the Acropolis.
Uh,
that wasn't,

393
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:21.980
was actually already there,
but was transformed in Roman times.

394
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.970
And I show it to you now.

395
00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:26.300
Here we are making our way with all of these other tourists,
uh,

396
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.750
up to the rock of the,
to the top of the rock of the Acropolis.

397
00:25:29.751 --> 00:25:33.230
We've climbed up the stairway,
which is not at all,
it's not particularly steep.

398
00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.580
We've made our way up.

399
00:25:34.581 --> 00:25:39.080
We're about to enter into the group Greek proper layer of the fifth century BC.

400
00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.940
No,
the doric columns,

401
00:25:40.941 --> 00:25:44.480
the try glyphs and metaphase of fifth century Greek architecture.

402
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:48.770
And we see next to it,
this pillar.
It's a very interesting pillar.

403
00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:53.120
It's very prominent.
It's the first thing you see when you enter the Acropolis.

404
00:25:53.121 --> 00:25:57.970
So it's whoever built this initially wanted to be noticed,
that's for sure.
Uh,

405
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.050
and we know it was a Hellenistic king,

406
00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:05.540
a Hellenistic king by the name of humanities,
e u.
M e n e s human needs.

407
00:26:05.541 --> 00:26:06.890
The second,
uh,

408
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:11.920
who was king of the Hellenistic Greek Kingdom of Pergamon are g,

409
00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:16.060
g a m U M R o,

410
00:26:16.061 --> 00:26:20.660
n with you use the Greek or the Latin spelling.
Pergamon.
Uh,

411
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:21.530
and uh,

412
00:26:21.531 --> 00:26:26.531
he commissioned this monument in 178 BC to honor himself.

413
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:33.590
And you can see that the purpose of the monument was to create this pillar upon

414
00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:36.800
which a statue of him would have been placed.

415
00:26:36.801 --> 00:26:40.160
And I show you the pillar once again here,
and you can see its shape.

416
00:26:40.161 --> 00:26:45.161
It has a stepped base and it tapers at the top and you have to imagine a,

417
00:26:45.511 --> 00:26:47.340
a statue of human needs.

418
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:52.341
The second a Pergamon on the top of this monument in the second century BC.

419
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.860
And it was altered in the first century BC when Marcus Agrippa,

420
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:02.720
the close childhood friend,
confidant,
righthand man of,
uh,

421
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.780
Augusta son in law in fact,
uh,

422
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.630
decided to replace the statute of human needs with one of himself.

423
00:27:09.631 --> 00:27:14.631
So he transforms this Greek Hellenistic monument into and Augustan Monument and

424
00:27:15.271 --> 00:27:17.980
Augustan monument that honors a gripper and a grip.

425
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.850
It's not surprising to see a grip,
a honored in the east.

426
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:23.940
He was involved in eastern military campaigns.

427
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:28.440
And we'll also see that he not only,
uh,
he,
he not only,

428
00:27:28.441 --> 00:27:31.470
and I mentioned this earlier in the semester,
he not only had a building,

429
00:27:31.471 --> 00:27:34.380
he not only re re,
uh,
renovated,
uh,

430
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.890
he not only instituted a building program in Rome,

431
00:27:37.891 --> 00:27:41.490
he was responsible for the so called Bas,
have a grip of that bear.

432
00:27:41.491 --> 00:27:45.270
His name not much is preserved.
So I didn't show those to you.
Uh,

433
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.300
and also,
uh,
a pantheon,

434
00:27:48.301 --> 00:27:51.180
the first pantheon that I did mention the Pantheon,

435
00:27:51.181 --> 00:27:54.600
the grip of belt that's referred to in the inscription that Hadrian,
uh,

436
00:27:54.601 --> 00:27:58.950
placed on the Pantheon.
Marcus a grip of made this building as you'll recall,

437
00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:02.670
the pantheon that we know had a chorionic porch.

438
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.880
So Agrippa in Rome is also carrying the carotid imagery into Rome and his

439
00:28:08.371 --> 00:28:11.010
building,
his building a program.

440
00:28:11.011 --> 00:28:14.550
But he also instituted a building program in Athens as we shall see.

441
00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:15.750
So it's very important.

442
00:28:15.751 --> 00:28:20.670
It was not surprising to see him honored along with Augustus on the Acropolis.

443
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:25.910
And actually in a way that that was much more noticeable to be hit by that

444
00:28:26.071 --> 00:28:30.500
statue of a grip as you climbed the Acropolis and went into the prop Alayah a

445
00:28:30.501 --> 00:28:32.930
must have been very striking indeed.
Uh,

446
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:37.800
this particular structure is made of a different kind of Greek marble called

447
00:28:37.801 --> 00:28:40.860
high nation marvel,
h,
y,
m,
e,
t,
t,

448
00:28:40.861 --> 00:28:44.520
I a n from Mount High Medis [inaudible] marble.

449
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:49.020
You can see a little bit of pentelic here,
but much of it is high mation marble.

450
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:54.810
So the Romans using the Greeks and the Romans using a variety of marbles,

451
00:28:54.811 --> 00:28:57.450
but a variety of marbles that come from Greece itself.

452
00:28:57.451 --> 00:29:02.130
We're not talking about imported marbles from elsewhere in the ancient world.

453
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:07.410
I mentioned already that below the Acropolis was the Greek Agora Ra or the

454
00:29:07.411 --> 00:29:08.850
meeting or marketplace.

455
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:13.110
I showed to you here a view from Google earth of the Greek Agora.

456
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.390
As it looks from the air today,

457
00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.410
you can see it as essentially an open rectangular space.

458
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:23.400
It has colonnades,
uh,
on some of its sides.
One set,

459
00:29:23.401 --> 00:29:27.830
one set was ray erected.
This is a,
um,
a structure,

460
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.330
a covered call,
an aid that comes from the,

461
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:34.740
from the Hellenistic period that was redirected by American archeologists who

462
00:29:34.741 --> 00:29:37.680
were responsible for excavating Jaeger Ra.

463
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.800
They redirected it in part to use as a place to display works art and for

464
00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:44.290
offices and so on.
Uh,
but there were more,

465
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:48.040
it was more than one in Romanesque,
in,
in,
um,

466
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.240
in Greek times.
[inaudible].

467
00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:54.670
This steaua is the counterpart to a Roman Portico covered colonnade,

468
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.670
uh,
but they called them stolen.

469
00:29:56.671 --> 00:29:59.710
So we look at the Steaua here from the Hellenistic period.

470
00:29:59.711 --> 00:30:04.660
There's a classical Greek temple,
the HEPA stay on over here.
Uh,
but,

471
00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.690
uh,
and in the center there was a building,

472
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:11.650
a called the musical that was built by Marcus Agrippa,

473
00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.230
the so called Odeon of a grip,
uh,

474
00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:18.610
that we know quite a bit about and that we're going to look at today.
But again,

475
00:30:18.611 --> 00:30:19.960
what's particularly interesting,

476
00:30:19.961 --> 00:30:24.961
I think is the fact that we see the Greeks building their religious structures

477
00:30:25.001 --> 00:30:28.780
on the Acropolis and then down below the meeting and marketplace.

478
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.680
And you can see the impact that this sort of thinking must have had on the

479
00:30:32.681 --> 00:30:36.940
Romans when they made their own decisions about building Roman forums.

480
00:30:36.941 --> 00:30:40.090
But there are distinct differences and we've talked about them already this

481
00:30:40.091 --> 00:30:44.200
semester between a a Greek Agora and a Roman forum.

482
00:30:44.201 --> 00:30:48.610
What Greek Agora Ra's do not have is that central that that focus of having a

483
00:30:48.611 --> 00:30:53.611
single temple on one end dominating the space in front of it and they're more

484
00:30:54.221 --> 00:30:57.520
square.
Whereas Roman forms,
as we've discussed,

485
00:30:57.521 --> 00:31:02.140
are more rectangular in shape with again,
the temple at the short end.

486
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:07.650
Any of you who've been to Athens know that the Agora Ra is surrounded by an area

487
00:31:08.471 --> 00:31:13.060
of Athens called Placa Pla k Placa a great place,

488
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.590
a fun place to go.

489
00:31:14.591 --> 00:31:19.591
It has been very gentrified in recent years and now has these wonderful pastel

490
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.010
colored,
uh,

491
00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:25.990
restaurants and shops with the ubiquitous white umbrella is just as you see them

492
00:31:25.991 --> 00:31:30.280
in other Mediterranean countries like Italy.
I lived in,

493
00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:34.370
in Athens for two years in the 1970s.
Uh,
and uh,

494
00:31:34.371 --> 00:31:38.800
placa did not look like that then.
Uh,
but it was an incredible place to go.

495
00:31:38.801 --> 00:31:42.430
Then is it still is now if you want to really get into the Greek spirit and

496
00:31:42.431 --> 00:31:46.630
dance on tables and break plates,
you could definitely do that in the 70s,

497
00:31:46.631 --> 00:31:48.400
a little less ubiquitously today,

498
00:31:48.401 --> 00:31:53.350
but there's still places that one can find to sort of play Zorba the Greek in

499
00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:56.290
um,
in placa.
Uh,
here is another view,

500
00:31:56.291 --> 00:31:59.680
a panoramic view showing once again the Agora,

501
00:31:59.681 --> 00:32:04.681
the Greek Agora of Athens as it would've looked as it grew up from the classical

502
00:32:06.401 --> 00:32:07.960
through the Hellenistic period.

503
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:12.190
But the building in question for us is the one that is smack in the middle of

504
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:15.460
the Greek temple and of the Hellenistic Steaua over here.

505
00:32:15.461 --> 00:32:20.350
And that is this music hall or Odi on of a grip up,
uh,
which was put up,

506
00:32:20.351 --> 00:32:23.290
we believe in around 15 BC.

507
00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:27.160
And it's to that structure that I want to turn now.
And this,
this building,

508
00:32:27.161 --> 00:32:28.540
this Oh,
on which a grip,

509
00:32:28.541 --> 00:32:33.040
a commission to himself is very important to us in large part because it

510
00:32:33.041 --> 00:32:38.041
demonstrates that ideas were not only flowing from Greece to Rome,

511
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.700
as we've already discussed today and in the past,

512
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.220
but from Italy to Greece.

513
00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:48.110
And this is a prime example of that because if we look at this accident metric

514
00:32:48.111 --> 00:32:53.111
view of the [inaudible] of a grip as designed for a gripper and 15 BC,

515
00:32:53.241 --> 00:32:56.000
and this is in Ward Perkins,
if we look at that,

516
00:32:56.001 --> 00:33:01.001
we will see that the plan of the Dion of Agrippa is exam is based very closely

517
00:33:02.511 --> 00:33:07.310
on an Odi on that we've already seen this semester,
the Odi on of palm pay.

518
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:10.520
You'll see it here from the air next to the theater of Pompei.

519
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.930
You'll remember that the Odi on a pay data to 80 to 70 BC,

520
00:33:14.931 --> 00:33:19.730
it was quite early.
Bill,
just after the Romans made Pompei pay into a colony.

521
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:24.020
And it is that exact plan that is used here.
So clearly,
again,

522
00:33:24.021 --> 00:33:28.520
an important exchange going on of ideas of architects.
Uh,

523
00:33:28.521 --> 00:33:32.920
between Greece and Rome in the Augustan period.
And,
uh,

524
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:36.380
in this case,
using a,
an Italian plan,

525
00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:40.580
a plan from Italy,
uh,
as the basis for a structure in Greece.

526
00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.380
We see that it follows in the May,

527
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:45.560
it follows all the features of the palm pay in structure.

528
00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:50.750
The semicircular orchestra,
the cabi divided into Kunae,

529
00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.000
a stage front here,
uh,

530
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:58.120
pilasters on a tall pilasters on some of the walls and open steaua on this wall.

531
00:34:00.261 --> 00:34:04.250
Over here you can see two sets of columns and in a row and an outer row,

532
00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:09.290
we know that the spectators entered the structure through this porch when they

533
00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:11.780
were coming to a musical recital.

534
00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.910
And over here there was another entrance way that was used by the part,

535
00:34:16.911 --> 00:34:20.390
by the musicians and also by visiting dignitaries.

536
00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:25.040
This was a smaller entrance way that was made up of a small temple front with a

537
00:34:25.041 --> 00:34:30.020
pediment,
uh,
and a doric columns,
uh,
here.
And,
uh,

538
00:34:30.021 --> 00:34:34.490
we can also see tall pilasters on the outside of this structure.

539
00:34:34.491 --> 00:34:37.510
And of course,
this building as all,
uh,
oh,

540
00:34:37.511 --> 00:34:40.850
dia was roofed in antiquity for the acoustics.

541
00:34:40.851 --> 00:34:44.720
And the one in palm pay was of course also roofed,

542
00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:49.400
another view across section of the,
uh,

543
00:34:49.401 --> 00:34:52.610
of the Odeon of a gripper.
You can see it here,

544
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.800
which shows you the same sort of thing.

545
00:34:54.801 --> 00:34:57.530
The tall pilasters on the outside of the structure,

546
00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:01.940
the entrance way through this steaua,
uh,
for the,
uh,

547
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.540
for the spectators,
the other entrance way over here,

548
00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:09.500
the smaller entrance way into that part of the structure.

549
00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.340
All very well shown.
And maybe in this may even be better,

550
00:35:13.341 --> 00:35:17.870
this model of the Odi on have a grip of where we can see what it looked like

551
00:35:17.871 --> 00:35:20.180
from the outside.
We're looking at the northern end,

552
00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:24.540
which is the end where we have that small and prince way,
uh,
with the um,

553
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.310
with very simple temple like,
uh,
in,
in appearance,
uh,

554
00:35:28.311 --> 00:35:33.110
we can see a series of columns engaged into the wall down here than the very

555
00:35:33.111 --> 00:35:37.830
tall pilasters with windows,
uh,
between them,
uh,
quite conventional building.
Uh,

556
00:35:37.831 --> 00:35:38.521
but one again,

557
00:35:38.521 --> 00:35:41.910
clearly base and this is the most important point that one can make about it

558
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:45.810
clearly based on,
uh,
an earlier model in Italy.

559
00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:51.350
The capitols are interesting.
You remember the Stowe is that I the two open,
uh,

560
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:55.590
colonnades that I showed you as one stop,
one wall at one side of the building,

561
00:35:55.591 --> 00:35:58.590
the inner one and the outer one.
Uh,
the,
um,

562
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:03.240
I'm going to forget which way the outer,
the outer one,
I believe.
No,

563
00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:06.060
the outer one I think is the,
they're two different orders.

564
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:09.810
One of them is Corinthian as you can see here.
I think that's the outer,

565
00:36:09.811 --> 00:36:11.490
but I may have that backwards.
Uh,

566
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:16.450
the one of them had Corinthian capitals and you see those here,
uh,
with the,
uh,

567
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:18.750
narrow,
the elegant volume.

568
00:36:18.751 --> 00:36:23.100
It's growing out of the elegant spirals growing out of the canvas leaves.

569
00:36:23.101 --> 00:36:27.630
And the other is of this type A,
a type that we have seen before,

570
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:32.720
but not frequently where we have lotus leaves growing out of the canvas leaves.

571
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:37.410
Uh,
and that of course is a kind of capital that we mentioned is inspired by

572
00:36:37.411 --> 00:36:41.460
capitols in Egypt and was used also much later in,

573
00:36:41.461 --> 00:36:45.490
much later times at the forum at leftest Maga,

574
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:50.460
the Sephora and forum at leftest magma.
So a type of,
of,
um,

575
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:55.590
of capital that is a key characteristic of Egypt that turns up here.

576
00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:00.860
So it's another example of the way in which these architects and patrons are

577
00:37:01.471 --> 00:37:06.130
looking at models from all over the world,
not only the Odi on,
uh,

578
00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.730
in palm pay,
uh,

579
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:12.770
but also structures from Egypt and combining those motifs in a very,

580
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:16.860
in a new,
in a new way,
in a very fertile mix.
As you can see

581
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.550
with regard to the later history of the Odi on have a grip on over the years,

582
00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.770
students sometimes have asked me,
I haven't heard,

583
00:37:25.771 --> 00:37:28.410
gotten this question this semester yet,
but,
uh,

584
00:37:28.411 --> 00:37:31.710
students have asked me or have said to me,
professor Kleiner,

585
00:37:31.711 --> 00:37:34.570
you show us in the course of this semester,
uh,

586
00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:38.580
all of these great works of Roman engineering and architecture,

587
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:42.750
the Pantheon and the coliseum,
an aqua ducks and so on and so forth.

588
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:45.210
And everything you do tell us about fires.

589
00:37:45.211 --> 00:37:47.490
It fires sometimes destroy these works of art,

590
00:37:47.491 --> 00:37:50.700
or there were works of architecture or they're destroyed because of other

591
00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:54.570
natural events,
like events of nature,
like earthquakes and so on.

592
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:58.110
But you never tell us,
uh,
about the buildings that failed.

593
00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:02.100
Did where the Roman architects always successful or did they build buildings?

594
00:38:02.101 --> 00:38:06.660
Sometimes it filled out.
Uh,
and so I always use this as an example because yes,

595
00:38:06.661 --> 00:38:10.470
they sometimes did make mistakes and some of their buildings did collapse.

596
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:12.000
And this is one of them,

597
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:16.110
the Odi on of a grip after it was viewed and described by posts.

598
00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:20.010
Sinneas uh,
the roof collapsed,
collapsed entirely.

599
00:38:20.011 --> 00:38:23.950
Now it lasted quite a while,
uh,
from,
um,
from,
uh,

600
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:27.720
the time of Augustus to the time to the second century of Palestinians.

601
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:28.651
But nonetheless,

602
00:38:28.651 --> 00:38:33.570
the roof collapsed entirely and the roof had to be completely rebuilt.
I,

603
00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.770
and at the same time,

604
00:38:34.771 --> 00:38:39.771
the decided to modernize the northern end of the structure and to add a new

605
00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:45.850
portico,
uh,
to the building.
Uh,
they also changed its use,

606
00:38:45.851 --> 00:38:50.170
by the way,
from an Odi on to a general lecture hall.
Uh,
during that period.

607
00:38:50.171 --> 00:38:53.980
So in 150 a d we see that the,
uh,

608
00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:56.190
that the northern end is completely redundant.

609
00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:00.400
It's interesting to see what they decided to do or they replace that very small

610
00:39:00.401 --> 00:39:04.660
conservative doric entryway with something with a lot more pazazz.

611
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:08.080
As you can see,
a series of,
of male figures.

612
00:39:08.081 --> 00:39:11.890
These are male tritons trit oh,
and s tritons,

613
00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:15.550
which are essentially male mermaids.
Uh,
male tried tones,

614
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:20.580
tightens and are essentially male mermaids on these tall decorated basis as you

615
00:39:21.011 --> 00:39:23.320
can see here.
And their,
their,
uh,

616
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:27.940
their gestures are mirror images of one another or reversed images of one

617
00:39:27.941 --> 00:39:31.540
another,
which creates a certain liveliness to the facade,

618
00:39:31.541 --> 00:39:35.440
to the northern facade that this building did not have before.

619
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:39.730
And that happened again in the mid second century.
And,
and interestingly enough,

620
00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:44.050
uh,
much of what survives today,
uh,
is,
are those tried tons.

621
00:39:44.051 --> 00:39:48.640
You can still see them on their bases here on their tall bases are part of them

622
00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.241
here.

623
00:39:49.241 --> 00:39:53.950
And you can see the relationship of the Odi on of Agrippa in this very good

624
00:39:53.951 --> 00:39:56.650
image to the Acropolis in Athens.

625
00:39:56.651 --> 00:39:59.860
You can see the Eric theone peeping up over there.

626
00:39:59.861 --> 00:40:04.861
You can see the great pedestal that a grip of would have had his statue on right

627
00:40:05.471 --> 00:40:07.570
here.
So I'm very tempted to say,
in fact,

628
00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:10.660
I will say that I don't think that was lost on the designers,

629
00:40:10.661 --> 00:40:14.350
that when they chose this spot for the,
uh,
Oh Deon and a grip,

630
00:40:14.351 --> 00:40:17.020
but they had very much in mind that it could,

631
00:40:17.021 --> 00:40:21.400
would be in one of these interesting architectural dialogues,
uh,
with the,

632
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:26.680
with the pedestal that had the statue of a grip on,
at,

633
00:40:26.681 --> 00:40:29.290
at the entrance way to the Acropolis.

634
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:33.790
I think that was certainly very carefully orchestrated in the same way you'll

635
00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:37.570
remember Julius Caesar and his architects orchestrated a relationship between

636
00:40:37.571 --> 00:40:39.650
the temple of Venus Gannett trucks,
uh,

637
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:43.270
and the temple of Jupiter Omc on the,
uh,

638
00:40:43.271 --> 00:40:47.350
on the Capitoline hill in Rome.
And despite the fact that you see,

639
00:40:47.351 --> 00:40:51.310
when you visit the Agora,
the Greek Agora today,
and look at these statutes,

640
00:40:51.311 --> 00:40:54.400
despite the fact that they are all that stands,
there's a lot.

641
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.130
You will see that there are lots of other remains on the ground.

642
00:40:57.430 --> 00:41:01.210
And with those remains and the excavations that were done by the American

643
00:41:01.211 --> 00:41:04.690
archeologists in the 1930s,
uh,
they are,

644
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:07.450
the reconstruction that we looked at from ward Perkins,

645
00:41:07.451 --> 00:41:11.770
we believe is a very accurate reconstruction of what the ODN of a grip.

646
00:41:11.771 --> 00:41:16.450
I looked like.
I want to look at the Roman ag rob,

647
00:41:16.451 --> 00:41:19.660
because the Romans ed themselves added an Agora to Athens.

648
00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:22.090
If they were going to have a Greek Agora,
they would have a Roman Agora.

649
00:41:22.091 --> 00:41:24.070
We don't know if there was a practical need for it,

650
00:41:24.071 --> 00:41:29.071
but I guess Caesar Augustus wanted to emblazon their name on an aggregate on an

651
00:41:30.671 --> 00:41:32.890
Agora or marketplace in Athens.

652
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:37.360
It was put up again in [inaudible] and started in the [inaudible] area and

653
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:41.620
period and completed by Augustus.
It is right near the Greek Agora.

654
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:46.400
We see a view of adhere a large open rectangular space with a colonnade around

655
00:41:46.401 --> 00:41:48.370
it.
Uh,
in this case,
Stowers,

656
00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:52.250
we would call these Stowers and the Greek context with tobacco and I or ma or

657
00:41:52.251 --> 00:41:54.560
shops at the upper most part,
uh,

658
00:41:54.561 --> 00:41:59.210
and entrance way and elaborate entrance way on the western end and another

659
00:41:59.211 --> 00:42:04.070
entrance way on the,
uh,
on the uh,
eastern end.
But as you can see,

660
00:42:04.071 --> 00:42:05.090
it differs.
It is,

661
00:42:05.091 --> 00:42:09.830
it is done in the mode of a Greek market place because it is more,
well,

662
00:42:09.831 --> 00:42:12.980
it's sort of in between a square and a rectangle here.
It's not quite,

663
00:42:12.981 --> 00:42:17.480
it's not as low as long as a Roman forum and it does not have a,

664
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:20.090
a temple on one short end and that,

665
00:42:20.091 --> 00:42:25.091
so it follows in the mode of Greek Agora Roz rather than a Roman four up the,

666
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:33.320
you can see if you look at Google Earth,
uh,
one can see,
uh,
the forum today,

667
00:42:33.321 --> 00:42:36.700
the Roman,
here's the sto of adults and the Greek Agora Ross.

668
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:40.910
And you can see its proximity to this new Roman Agora that was added.

669
00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:44.060
We're looking at that open space here with the colonnades.

670
00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:48.830
We're looking at the western entrance way as well as the eastern entrance.

671
00:42:48.831 --> 00:42:52.640
Way Up above,
uh,
in this very helpful view.

672
00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:57.740
And this is a view I took from the Acropolis,
looking down on the,

673
00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:59.650
uh,
on the,
uh,

674
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:04.580
Roman Agora raw and showing the back of the western entrance way,

675
00:43:04.581 --> 00:43:06.590
which I'll show you from the front and a moment.

676
00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:10.930
And there you can see placa actually pre gentrification.
Uh,

677
00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.410
it gives you a sense of what,
I mean,

678
00:43:12.411 --> 00:43:15.770
it was really crumbling as you can see with some of the buildings that are

679
00:43:15.771 --> 00:43:19.880
surrounding it.
But nonetheless,
it was fun.
Uh,

680
00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:24.840
so here we go.
Uh,
this is a view of the,
uh,
of the gate.
Uh,

681
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:29.750
it's called the gate of Athena Arcadis's.
You can see on your monument list,
uh,

682
00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:33.950
that is the western gate into the Roman Agora.

683
00:43:33.951 --> 00:43:37.550
We see it here in two views.
And you can see when you look at this building,

684
00:43:37.551 --> 00:43:41.900
you can see what ward Perkins and other others mean when they say that

685
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:44.620
architecture in Greece,

686
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:49.610
a under the row in Athens under the Romans is derivative and uninspired.
Uh,

687
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.970
it's this kind of thing that I believe he's talking about because you can see

688
00:43:52.971 --> 00:43:54.810
how beholden it is too.

689
00:43:55.250 --> 00:44:00.250
Traditional classical Greek architecture in the way in which we see these great

690
00:44:00.441 --> 00:44:05.060
doric columns looking very similar to those of the pro Bellayo or the or the

691
00:44:05.061 --> 00:44:09.870
Parthenon.
You see them here,
you see the triangle of sin,
metaphase,
you see a,

692
00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:14.720
a,
a,
a triangular pediment.
We never see,
we never see the Greeks,

693
00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:18.890
at least the Greeks in the Roman period,
uh,
breaking their pediments,

694
00:44:18.891 --> 00:44:22.490
they always have a complete pediments.
And then that sense,
of course,
very,

695
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:27.050
very conservative approach to architecture during this period.

696
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.950
We know that this,
the gate was begun by Caesar completed by,

697
00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.490
and there's an inscription that tells us that,
uh,
and we believe,

698
00:44:35.491 --> 00:44:37.170
although this is somewhat speculative,

699
00:44:37.171 --> 00:44:41.270
that there may have been a statue or portrait of the,
uh,

700
00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:43.560
some of the grandson of Augustus,

701
00:44:43.561 --> 00:44:48.561
son of a gripper Lucius Caesar in the pediment Illusia Caesar having died in,

702
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:50.760
uh,
in the year two.

703
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:56.390
Here's the view where we see the Roman Agora raw as it looks today,

704
00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.850
the open space,
the columns around it.
Uh,

705
00:44:59.851 --> 00:45:04.050
and you can also see it very curious building that looks very well preserved,

706
00:45:04.051 --> 00:45:06.390
rising up on the eastern end,
uh,

707
00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:11.250
a building in the shape of an octagon a and here's another view of the eastern

708
00:45:11.251 --> 00:45:14.370
end showing that octagonal building more clearly.

709
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:17.820
This is the so called Oral Ogi on of Andronicus,

710
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:22.500
or as it is nicknamed the tower of the winds,
the tower of the winds,

711
00:45:22.501 --> 00:45:25.580
which is easier to remember the tower of the winds.
Uh,

712
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:28.790
it's very controversial in date.
Uh,

713
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:32.760
I dated here to the second half of the first century BC,

714
00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.220
which is when I do believe that it dates,

715
00:45:35.221 --> 00:45:37.200
but there are others who think otherwise.

716
00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:38.790
And I'll tell you about that in a moment.

717
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:41.760
Here's a view that I took from the Acropolis,
uh,

718
00:45:41.761 --> 00:45:46.650
showing the tower of the winds as it looks from up there as well as a closer

719
00:45:46.651 --> 00:45:51.090
view of this amazing structure.
Again,
you can see how well preserved it is.
A,

720
00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:55.800
you can see that it is indeed eight sided.
Uh,
you can see one of the porches,

721
00:45:55.801 --> 00:46:00.720
there are two porches that had temple fronts with tri triangular pediments

722
00:46:00.721 --> 00:46:02.670
columns below.
On those two sides.

723
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:08.340
There was also a staircase of that surrounded the structure.
Uh,
the,

724
00:46:08.341 --> 00:46:11.790
what this was we believe is some kind of a clock tower,

725
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:16.710
a very inventive,
a clock tower.
And,
uh,
although again,

726
00:46:16.711 --> 00:46:21.330
I think it was probably built in the [inaudible] period,

727
00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:26.820
late republic,
uh,
John Camp,
who's an expert on things,

728
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:29.850
Athenian who wrote a book on the archeology of Athens,

729
00:46:29.851 --> 00:46:34.790
who has been excavating the Greek Agora up since the 1970s,
uh,

730
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.280
and is a true expert of architecture in this part of the world.

731
00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.680
He thinks the date is earlier than that.

732
00:46:40.681 --> 00:46:44.130
He dates it to one 50 to 125 BC,

733
00:46:44.131 --> 00:46:48.150
and he brings it into connection with the Ptolemies in Egypt,

734
00:46:48.151 --> 00:46:53.151
the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt because of their great interest in the telling of

735
00:46:53.761 --> 00:46:56.130
time.
Uh,
and,
uh,
and,

736
00:46:56.131 --> 00:47:00.450
and the fact that they did have important connections with Athens during this

737
00:47:00.451 --> 00:47:05.220
period.
I think he has a point.
He could be right.
Uh,
but I would add that,

738
00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:08.220
um,
connections with Egypt were very strong,
uh,

739
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:12.810
in the late republic as well.
I mean,
keep in mind,
uh,
the,
uh,

740
00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:16.050
fair between Julius Caesar and Cleopatra.

741
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:21.080
Keep in mind that we know that statues of Cleopatra and Marc Antony were put on

742
00:47:21.451 --> 00:47:24.000
the Acropolis.
We know that there was a lot of interaction.

743
00:47:24.001 --> 00:47:27.270
Cleopatra herself came to Athens.

744
00:47:27.271 --> 00:47:31.480
So I don't think it's inconceivable that if one wants to connect this to things

745
00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:32.530
Egyptian,
uh,

746
00:47:32.531 --> 00:47:36.700
that one couldn't date it also to the [inaudible] area and period.

747
00:47:36.701 --> 00:47:40.660
But whatever it's date,
it's fascinating in its own right.
Again,

748
00:47:40.661 --> 00:47:42.380
because it's octagonal,
uh,

749
00:47:42.381 --> 00:47:46.510
we've talked about the fact that we don't have octagon is in Rome until the time

750
00:47:46.511 --> 00:47:49.070
of neuro.
Uh,
but we do see them.
Uh,

751
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:52.980
we saw another example also in Leptin is Magdna the market there,
uh,

752
00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:56.850
the Augustan period.
It's interesting to see this form emerging,

753
00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.910
possibly under Ptolemaic influence.
Uh,
we're not sure,
uh,

754
00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:05.911
emerging in the provinces before it seems to emerge in Rome itself.

755
00:48:05.981 --> 00:48:10.330
And this,
this being another example,
here's a view of the monument again,

756
00:48:10.331 --> 00:48:12.310
but also compared to a,

757
00:48:12.311 --> 00:48:15.340
an engraving done by Stuart and Revet,

758
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:19.150
s t u a r t and r e v e t t Stewart.

759
00:48:19.151 --> 00:48:23.440
And revet who made drawings of monuments that were in better shape and Athens in

760
00:48:23.441 --> 00:48:26.260
the 18th century.
Uh,
and what this tells us,

761
00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:30.760
besides showing us what the porch looked like,
a,
and you can see it well here,

762
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:35.590
it also shows us that there was a weather vane on the top that would have,

763
00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:39.280
would have gone in the direction of the prevailing winds.

764
00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:43.240
And the reason that we call this the tower of the winds is not only because of

765
00:48:43.241 --> 00:48:44.830
that weather vane,
that one stood there,

766
00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:48.370
but also because of the depictions of male,
uh,

767
00:48:48.371 --> 00:48:52.450
personifications of the winds on all eight sides of the structure.

768
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:55.840
And those are extremely well preserved.
As you can see here,

769
00:48:55.841 --> 00:48:58.600
a freeze of these male wins.

770
00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:03.370
And if you look carefully at the Stuart and revet drawing,
you also see,
uh,
the,

771
00:49:03.371 --> 00:49:07.390
that there was a sun dial on all eight sides of the monument.
So it's purpose,

772
00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:11.660
needless to say,
to tell time the capitals,
uh,

773
00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.170
from form those porches are these days,

774
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:19.150
Lotus leaves growing out of a cantus leaf.
So another Egyptian touch here,
uh,

775
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.670
this looking back to Egypt,

776
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:24.640
Egypt type capital's using them here,

777
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:29.580
the same kind of capitals that we noted turned up much later,
uh,
at the,
uh,

778
00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:32.560
Severin a forum in leftist Magdna,

779
00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:37.860
a detail of those winds and here a better detail of at least one of them to show

780
00:49:38.501 --> 00:49:40.480
you what they look like close up.

781
00:49:40.481 --> 00:49:45.400
And each one of them has a different attribute which has led scholars obviously

782
00:49:45.401 --> 00:49:49.050
to speculate about which particular wind,
when,

783
00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:53.010
which of the cardinal points of the compass,
which wind.
Uh,
they were,
uh,

784
00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.840
in actuality we won't get into those arguments here,

785
00:49:55.841 --> 00:50:00.130
but there's been a lot of time spent by scholars and trying to sort that out.

786
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.950
What is also interesting is the interior of the building,

787
00:50:02.951 --> 00:50:07.750
which is also extremely well preserved.
And you can see here all in stone,
uh,

788
00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:10.810
the way in which the octagon becomes a dome.
Uh,

789
00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:15.340
and it has done extremely well.
Uh,
and I mean this is,

790
00:50:15.341 --> 00:50:20.341
this goes way beyond any kind of stone dome that we see either in a trust skin

791
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:25.540
or Roman architecture in Italy.
Uh,
and it shows us,
once again,

792
00:50:25.541 --> 00:50:26.980
it underscores more.

793
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:32.230
Anything else I could show you the talent of these particular architects who had

794
00:50:33.441 --> 00:50:36.890
been carving this Greek stone for centuries.
Uh,

795
00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:41.730
the way in which they are able to make this transition from October tag and

796
00:50:41.731 --> 00:50:45.890
we'll shape to a regular dome here is extraordinary.

797
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:50.750
They did not need concrete,
uh,
to create a great dome in this wonderful,

798
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:55.740
uh,
structure.
The Oral Ogi on event chronicus where the tower of the winds,
uh,
in,

799
00:50:55.741 --> 00:50:57.290
uh,
in Athens.

800
00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:01.670
The other great Phil Hellenic emperor was of course Hadrian.

801
00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:06.700
We know Hadrian came to Athens on three occasions and we know the exact dates of

802
00:51:07.011 --> 00:51:09.110
his visits.
One 20 for the first visit,

803
00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:13.100
one 24 to 125 Hadrian was in Athens.

804
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:18.370
He came another time in one 28 and he came a third time and one 31 to one 32.

805
00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:23.870
And all the buildings that are now going to show you a date to roughly to the

806
00:51:23.871 --> 00:51:28.610
times of those three visits.
Uh,
the first one you see in an engraving here,

807
00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:30.590
uh,
this was an aqueduct,

808
00:51:30.591 --> 00:51:35.360
when Adrian came to Athens for the first time in one 24 to one 25.

809
00:51:35.361 --> 00:51:39.770
He said,
we need to supply water to the people of Athens.
Uh,

810
00:51:39.771 --> 00:51:41.930
and so he said,
he said,
uh,

811
00:51:41.931 --> 00:51:45.870
he said his architects at work to build an aqueduct for Athens.
Uh,

812
00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:49.820
they created a reservoir on Mount Lee Cabi toss that high,

813
00:51:49.821 --> 00:51:54.290
the highest mountain in Athens,
a reservoir.
And then on the side,

814
00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:58.870
one of the sides of the mountain facing the city,
uh,
they had,
uh,
a,

815
00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:01.940
they built a kind of a structure,
uh,

816
00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:07.020
that kind of a bridge that in part carried that water in to the city.

817
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.940
Uh,
it no longer survives or a couple of bases from it.
That's it.
Uh,

818
00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:16.560
but we do fortunately have engravings,
uh,

819
00:52:16.561 --> 00:52:20.040
that were made when it was in better shape when part of it's still stood.
Uh,

820
00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:23.510
and we see one of those engravings here and what we can see right off

821
00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:30.440
ionic capitals,
ionic capitals,
clearly based on those of the Eric theone.

822
00:52:30.441 --> 00:52:33.590
So the Eric theone still a beacon for architects,

823
00:52:33.591 --> 00:52:35.780
still a monument to be emulated,

824
00:52:35.810 --> 00:52:39.350
emulated in the time of Hadrian as it was under Augustus.

825
00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:43.100
We see an inscription and then we see something quite extraordinary.

826
00:52:43.101 --> 00:52:47.420
If we look very closely above the right hand,
ionic capital,

827
00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:51.610
we see the beginning of an RQ weighted lentil,
straight lentil,

828
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:56.000
the beginning of an Rqi Asian.
So what does that tell us?
That tells us clearly,

829
00:52:56.001 --> 00:53:01.001
and here's a Stewart and revet drawing a of that element when it was in better

830
00:53:01.491 --> 00:53:02.670
shape.
Again,
uh,

831
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:07.430
a straight lintel and RQ weighted Lindell with an inscription mentioning Hadrian

832
00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:12.640
that is the same kind of RQ weighted lintel that we saw in to activity at the

833
00:53:12.891 --> 00:53:17.891
Canopius that we saw in emphasis at the temple of Hadrian in emphasis showing

834
00:53:19.731 --> 00:53:22.400
that this particular motif is RQ weighted Lindell.

835
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:24.710
Very much associated with Hadrian.

836
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:30.080
I says this is a Hadria Anik building essentially and used not just in Italy,

837
00:53:30.241 --> 00:53:33.090
but elsewhere in the Roman world.
So again,
these,

838
00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:37.010
these exchanges of ideas and motifs and artists and architects,
uh,

839
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:41.640
during the Adriatic period,
as was the case under Augustus.
Over here.

840
00:53:41.641 --> 00:53:46.470
We're looking again from Google earth at the Roman Agora next to it,

841
00:53:46.471 --> 00:53:50.650
a library of Hadrian,
a library that bears Hadrian's name,
ah,

842
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:54.330
that was also put up in Athens during the Adriatic periods,

843
00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:59.331
specifically in 132 a d connected to the last visit that Hadrian made to Athens.

844
00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:03.510
Uh,
we can see that it is a great,

845
00:54:03.511 --> 00:54:08.511
a large open rectangular space with a the library itself at the upper most part

846
00:54:09.391 --> 00:54:13.320
and then a,
a facade that has project and columns.

847
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.630
And I'll show that to you better in a moment.

848
00:54:15.631 --> 00:54:18.790
Here's a view I took again from the Acropolis,
uh,

849
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:23.040
showing that open rectangular space.
As it looks today,

850
00:54:23.041 --> 00:54:25.230
there's some later buildings built into it.

851
00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:28.200
And here we're looking at the back wall of the facade,

852
00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:32.220
which we'll see has projecting columns on it.
Ah,

853
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:37.230
here's a plan of the library of Hadrian of one 32 here on the right hand side of

854
00:54:37.231 --> 00:54:38.064
the screen.

855
00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:44.040
And you should be struck immediately as you look at this plan with its open

856
00:54:44.041 --> 00:54:47.950
rectangular space with its with its,
um,

857
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:52.980
a pool here in the center with the columns going all the way around with an

858
00:54:52.981 --> 00:54:57.981
entrance way in the front with projecting columns on that facade with a series

859
00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:04.310
of niches that are alternating a segmental and rectangular,

860
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:05.940
uh,
with again,

861
00:55:05.941 --> 00:55:10.680
the library located in that upper most part with other rooms forming a kind of

862
00:55:10.681 --> 00:55:15.360
wing on either side.
This should remind you without any question of this.

863
00:55:15.361 --> 00:55:20.310
And what is this Sam?

864
00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:27.540
The forum pacas a forum of piece of the temple and pockets of Vespasian in Rome.

865
00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:31.780
Uh,
so once again,
and it is a clear,
clear duplicate,

866
00:55:31.781 --> 00:55:35.860
even though this is a library and this is a temple or a forum,

867
00:55:35.861 --> 00:55:39.010
although we talked about the fact that we weren't absolutely sure how this was

868
00:55:39.011 --> 00:55:43.660
used at may have been used as a kind of museum in Rome for the spoils and other

869
00:55:43.661 --> 00:55:47.860
works of art.
Uh,
that Vespasian.
And the Flavian it's wanted to display.

870
00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:52.360
But once again we are looking that they influenced does not flow only from

871
00:55:52.361 --> 00:55:55.660
Greece to Rome,
but from Italy to Greece.

872
00:55:55.661 --> 00:56:00.220
And in this case they are also using as a model for the library of Hadrian and

873
00:56:00.221 --> 00:56:03.530
important building type in Rome.
They're using it,
you know,

874
00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:05.560
perhaps for it in a different way.
Uh,

875
00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:10.620
but nonetheless they are using almost that exact plan for this second century

876
00:56:10.631 --> 00:56:14.170
building.
And I show you here a model of the library of Hadrian,

877
00:56:14.171 --> 00:56:17.440
an Athens where we see that it was planted with greenery.

878
00:56:17.441 --> 00:56:19.390
The library was located in the back.

879
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:22.960
There was a fairly conventional and France way.

880
00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:27.130
I'm looking like a typical Greek temple.
Uh,
but then these columns,

881
00:56:27.131 --> 00:56:31.540
that project in front of the wall was statuary on top looking very much like the

882
00:56:31.541 --> 00:56:32.950
forum transitory IOM,

883
00:56:32.951 --> 00:56:36.830
which you'll remember bordered the foreign Pakistan Roman.

884
00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:40.420
That probably was also something that they were looking at a,

885
00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:44.470
and here creating this is as far as the Greeks go to creating one of these

886
00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:49.070
undulating walls with the projecting and receiving elements.
It's not,
it's,

887
00:56:49.071 --> 00:56:51.760
it's still fairly conservative,
but nonetheless,

888
00:56:51.761 --> 00:56:55.840
they've injected a little motion here using the traditional vocabulary of

889
00:56:55.841 --> 00:57:00.640
architecture.
And here we see a I view of the wall of that facade,

890
00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:03.150
of what survives of it today.
Uh,

891
00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:08.220
the wall is made out of white pentelic marble and the columns are made of a

892
00:57:08.651 --> 00:57:10.840
slightly,
I don't know if you can see it from where you sit,

893
00:57:10.841 --> 00:57:15.760
but a slightly greenish tinge marble that comes from a place called Ingres

894
00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:19.720
called Cara Stars,
k A.
R.
Y.
S.
T.
O.
S.
So again,

895
00:57:19.721 --> 00:57:23.920
this interest in varied marbles but varied marbles that come only from the very

896
00:57:23.921 --> 00:57:27.460
rich quarries that Greece has a four,

897
00:57:27.461 --> 00:57:31.830
they did not have to go anywhere else to get a high quality marble and to get

898
00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:35.200
marble of a wide,
wide variety of colors.

899
00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:41.840
I want to turn now to a structure that has one of the most complicated building

900
00:57:42.731 --> 00:57:46.910
histories of any building I've shown you in the course of the semester.
Uh,

901
00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:49.240
and I'll run through that relatively quickly.

902
00:57:49.241 --> 00:57:53.950
This is the temple of Olympian Zeus,
the so called Olympia.
He on a,

903
00:57:53.951 --> 00:57:58.951
that was put up or that was dedicated by Hadrian in the year 131 to 132 on the

904
00:58:00.491 --> 00:58:05.080
tie on the occasion of his third visit to Athens.
Uh,

905
00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:07.150
but it had again,
a very long building history.

906
00:58:07.151 --> 00:58:10.630
It goes back to the archaic Greek period when it was begun.

907
00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.560
It was begun by the so called Peisistratos.

908
00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:15.610
I put these words on your monument list for you.

909
00:58:15.611 --> 00:58:18.280
The sister who were Athenian tyrants,

910
00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:22.960
they began to build it in the archaic period as a Doric temple.

911
00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:26.320
Uh,
it was,
the construction was stopped.
However,

912
00:58:26.321 --> 00:58:29.470
at the end of the sixth century BC in 510,

913
00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:32.930
it was resumed in the Hellenistic period,
uh,

914
00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:38.080
in 174 BC when Antiochus Epiphanes and his name is also on the monument and list

915
00:58:39.911 --> 00:58:43.200
Antiochus Epiphanes a king of Syria,
uh,

916
00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:47.830
decided to employ a Roman architect by the name of Kusudi Ious,

917
00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:52.180
also on your monument list to finish the building.
A Roman architect.

918
00:58:52.181 --> 00:58:55.810
That's interesting that we see a Greek Hellenistic rule or hiring a Roman

919
00:58:55.811 --> 00:59:00.480
architects speaks to that exchange.
Again that is going on.
Uh,

920
00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:05.140
he Kusudi is,
decides to use the Corinthian order,

921
00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:10.180
the Corinthian order,
uh,
and he finishes it up to the architrave,

922
00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:14.290
the building up to the architrave,
uh,
and,
um,

923
00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:19.510
when Antiochus dies and one 64,
uh,
the,

924
00:59:19.511 --> 00:59:21.740
that's where he's up to,
that's where that one 64,

925
00:59:21.741 --> 00:59:25.520
they built the building up through the architrave using the Corinthian order,

926
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:29.930
Sola Saks,
Saks,
Athens,
and 86 BC.

927
00:59:29.931 --> 00:59:31.520
And you'll remember what Sola does.

928
00:59:31.521 --> 00:59:36.521
This is that very temple with the 55 foot tall columns that solar eyes and says,

929
00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:38.300
I want those.

930
00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:43.660
And he brings several of those back to Rome to be used in his renovation of the

931
00:59:46.371 --> 00:59:50.920
temple of Jupiter.
Oh,
MC,
those very columns.
Uh,

932
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.620
it was,

933
00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:55.550
it was the introduction of those Corinthian columns and capital's to Rome that

934
00:59:55.551 --> 00:59:59.090
made that the most popular capitol in Rome.

935
00:59:59.150 --> 01:00:03.890
And in the Roman Empire.
As we've seen,
Augustus wanted to complete the structure.

936
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:07.280
He did not do so,
and it was left to Hadrian to finish it.

937
01:00:07.281 --> 01:00:12.281
And Hadrian finished it according to Kusudi as his plan in one 31 to one 32.

938
01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:18.200
Uh,
and what Hadrian did was,
uh,
was,
was,
uh,
put in this structure,

939
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.070
a statues of himself and the Zeus,
Zeus,

940
01:00:22.071 --> 01:00:27.071
the Greek equivalent to Jupiter statues of Hadrian in one part of the structure

941
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:31.940
as to a Zeus and the other part of the structure and tons and tons,

942
01:00:31.941 --> 01:00:33.350
lots and lots of statutes,

943
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:38.530
additional statues of Hadrian outside the temple in the court yard.

944
01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:43.820
Uh,
and,
uh,
you see that you see this temple here as it,
as it,

945
01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:48.170
as finished by Hadrian as it would've looked in the Adriatic period.

946
01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:52.790
You can see that like a typical Greek temple as opposed to a Roman temple.

947
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.930
It does not have a facade orientation.
It has two entrance ways.

948
01:00:56.931 --> 01:01:01.280
One with the statue of Hadrian,
one with a statue of Zeus,

949
01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:04.770
and that it has columns,
and then circle the entire monument,

950
01:01:04.771 --> 01:01:08.870
a peripheral colonnade as well as the staircase that goes all the way around.

951
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:12.080
So a typical Greek temple,
one 31 to one 32.

952
01:01:12.081 --> 01:01:16.100
It's the same time that we see the temple of Venus and Roma going up in Rome.

953
01:01:16.101 --> 01:01:20.380
What I described as a Greek import.
Hadrian is responsible for both.
Uh,

954
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:24.860
and so we see again this important interchange between the two at this

955
01:01:24.861 --> 01:01:25.970
particular time,

956
01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:31.400
a view of what survives of the Olympian.
It's columns,

957
01:01:31.401 --> 01:01:34.670
it's Corinthian columns.
You can see the small people wandering around.

958
01:01:34.671 --> 01:01:39.200
So this is a very large uh,
structure,
uh,
that I took from the Acropolis.

959
01:01:39.201 --> 01:01:39.861
Once again,

960
01:01:39.861 --> 01:01:44.861
here's a wonderful Google earth version of the Olympian and this combination of

961
01:01:45.411 --> 01:01:49.700
what it looks like today with sort of this three d imaging that makes it look

962
01:01:49.701 --> 01:01:51.410
also like it looked in antiquity.

963
01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:55.940
Here you see some of the columns of the Olympia on the ones that still survived.

964
01:01:55.941 --> 01:01:59.330
They are incredibly large and incredibly handsome.

965
01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:02.270
And I think when you look at the high quality of the carving,

966
01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:07.480
you are struck as I am at why the Romans decided the Corinthian order was the

967
01:02:08.241 --> 01:02:10.700
order for them when they saw these,

968
01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:15.320
these exact columns on the temple of Jupiter,
optimist,
Maximus,

969
01:02:15.321 --> 01:02:16.760
capitol leanness and Rome.

970
01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:20.670
When Hadrian made his visit to Athens in the,

971
01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:23.040
in the last visit to Athens and the one thirties,

972
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:28.590
the city busily benefactors busily got together to put up an arch that would be

973
01:02:28.591 --> 01:02:32.130
ready for Hadrian when he arrived and that he could parade through.

974
01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:34.350
And that is the so called arch of Hadrian,

975
01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:37.020
which you see here in a view of what it looks like today.

976
01:02:37.021 --> 01:02:40.980
And in the Stewart and revet drawing on the right hand side of the screen,
again,

977
01:02:40.981 --> 01:02:42.300
a quite conservative arch,

978
01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:46.230
very simple single arcuate occupation in the center.

979
01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:50.400
Pilasters done in,
uh,
with Corinthian order,
uh,

980
01:02:50.401 --> 01:02:53.820
columns would have been added here.
A second story with a pediment,

981
01:02:53.821 --> 01:02:57.690
no split pediment here.
Uh,
we see a straight,
you know,
conservative,

982
01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:02.880
a pediment here and the Stuart and revet drawing tells us that in antiquity

983
01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:08.300
there was a marble slab that was located in the center of that pedigree of that,

984
01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:14.160
of that an addict.
In the second story,
and we know there were statues,

985
01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:18.510
inscriptions,
tell us if there was statues on both sides of this.

986
01:03:18.511 --> 01:03:22.500
And the statutes are very interesting because on the side that faced the ancient

987
01:03:22.501 --> 01:03:26.760
Greek city,
there was a statute of Theseus and an inscription that said,

988
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:31.650
this is Athens,
the city of Theseus.
And on the other side,

989
01:03:31.651 --> 01:03:36.360
of course,
ace,
they put up in order to pay obese since two,
our honor,

990
01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:39.330
uh,
Hadrian and to try to extract favors from him,

991
01:03:39.331 --> 01:03:43.860
undoubtedly they put up a statue to Hadrian on the other side.

992
01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:48.750
And that inscription says,
uh,
this is the city of Hadrian,

993
01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:53.580
not the city of Theseus.
I,

994
01:03:53.581 --> 01:03:58.410
the last monument that I want to show you is a monument that is near and dear to

995
01:03:58.411 --> 01:04:02.970
my own heart because in the two years that I lived in Athens,
in the 1970s,

996
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:06.060
I was working on a book on this particular monument.

997
01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:10.950
The monument doesn't date to the Augustan period and it doesn't date to the

998
01:04:10.951 --> 01:04:13.410
Adriatic period,
which makes it all the more interesting.

999
01:04:13.411 --> 01:04:18.411
It dates to the time of Trajan and it has nothing to do with either of those two

1000
01:04:18.511 --> 01:04:21.630
emperors,
but with a man whose name is a mouthful.

1001
01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:26.190
And that is Gaius Julius Antiochus,
Epiphanes Phillip Papa's.

1002
01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:30.180
You don't have to remember all of that.
Uh,
I like to call him uncle Phil.

1003
01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:31.650
You can call him uncle Phil.

1004
01:04:31.651 --> 01:04:36.310
That's the easier way to refer to Gaius Julius Antiochus Epiphanes Phillip

1005
01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:38.490
Papa's,
uh,
nonetheless,
uh,

1006
01:04:38.491 --> 01:04:42.930
he was a very interesting man and we know a lot about his bio.
Uh,

1007
01:04:42.931 --> 01:04:47.430
we know,
for example,
that he was the son of a king of coma gene,

1008
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:52.080
a Hellenistic kingdom in the eastern part of the empire in ancient Anatolia.

1009
01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:56.730
Uh,
what is now Turkey.
He was a son of that,
uh,
King of,
uh,

1010
01:04:56.731 --> 01:05:00.360
of a coma gene,
c,
O,
m,
m,
a,
G,
e,
n,
e.

1011
01:05:00.361 --> 01:05:04.840
And that his relatives had been kings for some time.
Uh,

1012
01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:08.550
but he was unfortunate,
although he was slated to become king himself.

1013
01:05:08.551 --> 01:05:13.551
He was unfortunate that Vespasian the Roman Emperor Vespasian conquered Colma

1014
01:05:13.681 --> 01:05:18.010
gene made it a Roman colony depose the Kings,
uh,
and,
uh,
you know,

1015
01:05:18.011 --> 01:05:20.110
became ruler himself in a sense.

1016
01:05:20.111 --> 01:05:24.790
And so Phillip pop is because of the Romans never became king of coma.
Gene.

1017
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:30.130
He seems to have made the best of it,
uh,
by,
uh,
by making his way to Rome,

1018
01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:30.550
uh,

1019
01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:35.550
using his influence and his high station as a deposed king to finagle for

1020
01:05:35.891 --> 01:05:40.450
himself,
uh,
a position as sue fact console in Rome.

1021
01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:44.680
What was a sue fact console?
A Suffolk console was kind of a console in waiting.

1022
01:05:44.681 --> 01:05:48.640
By that,
I mean that if one of the regular console's couldn't do his job,

1023
01:05:48.641 --> 01:05:51.520
the Suffolk console could be brought in as a substitute.

1024
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:55.900
So Phillip Papa's could sort of stand and wait and hope that someone got sick

1025
01:05:55.901 --> 01:05:57.330
and he could come in or I've got,
you know,

1026
01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:02.360
was in war involved in military campaign and he would be called in to take his

1027
01:06:03.011 --> 01:06:07.540
place.
So he hangs around Rome for a while,
uh,
and then he eventually goes back,

1028
01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:09.400
goes to Athens,
he moves to Athens,

1029
01:06:09.401 --> 01:06:11.830
he's honored with all kinds of titles and Athens.

1030
01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:17.160
And he eventually ends up being dying in Athens and being buried in Athens.

1031
01:06:18.030 --> 01:06:18.890
Uh,
and,
uh,

1032
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:23.080
I tomb gets put up in his honor between one 14 and one 16.

1033
01:06:23.081 --> 01:06:27.340
And we know the precise date because of an inscription on the monument,

1034
01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:31.030
there's still surviving monument that makes reference to some of Trajan is

1035
01:06:31.031 --> 01:06:35.290
titles,
titles that Trajan held between one 14 and one 16,

1036
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:38.290
but does not include titles that he got after that.

1037
01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:43.290
So we know that it was put up between one 14 and one 16 and we're going to see

1038
01:06:43.751 --> 01:06:45.730
that it features a freeze,
uh,

1039
01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:48.670
depicting Phillip Aarp is at the high point of his life.

1040
01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:52.860
His pro cassis console rs is consular procession.

1041
01:06:53.090 --> 01:06:55.570
And when he was made a console in Rome,

1042
01:06:56.020 --> 01:07:00.010
I show you a view from the air where you see once again the Acropolis and the

1043
01:07:00.011 --> 01:07:04.960
relationship of the Acropolis to the Moose.
They on hill,
the hill of the muses.

1044
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:09.340
Now what's most extraordinary is that there is only one ancient monument on the

1045
01:07:09.341 --> 01:07:12.640
Moosejaw on hill,
and that is the monument of Uncle Phil.

1046
01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:17.590
We are standing on the Acropolis.
Uh,
we are.
Look this,
I love this picture.

1047
01:07:17.591 --> 01:07:20.860
I took this picture of myself and I'm very proud of it because it just happens

1048
01:07:20.861 --> 01:07:21.311
to work,

1049
01:07:21.311 --> 01:07:24.640
especially because these two guys happened to be standing there taking pictures

1050
01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:28.990
of the Odeon uh,
of roadies.
Attic is here,
but we're standing here,

1051
01:07:28.991 --> 01:07:33.700
we're looking back toward the Moosejaw on hill and you can see not quite at the

1052
01:07:33.701 --> 01:07:37.420
apex,
but almost near the apex apex,
the monument,

1053
01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:41.500
the sole monument that stands on this hill,
the monument of Uncle Phil.

1054
01:07:41.501 --> 01:07:43.180
How did he rate,
uh,

1055
01:07:43.210 --> 01:07:47.110
to be able to get the so monument on one of the three major hills?

1056
01:07:47.111 --> 01:07:50.920
You can see it in his marble.
You can see it popping up until like marble.

1057
01:07:50.921 --> 01:07:54.850
You can see it popping up almost near the apex of the hill.

1058
01:07:56.020 --> 01:08:00.190
If we look at this site plan,
you will see that it is sited.
Exactly.

1059
01:08:00.191 --> 01:08:04.780
You see it here on the top of the hill of the muses cited exactly in

1060
01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:06.370
relationship to the Acropolis.

1061
01:08:06.371 --> 01:08:10.950
Lined up with what building the Eric Theone,
the Eric Theone,

1062
01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:14.620
this building that was so revered by the Romans.

1063
01:08:14.621 --> 01:08:18.740
It's lined up exactly with an at mid point between the proper layer and the

1064
01:08:18.741 --> 01:08:21.970
Parthenon.
Exactly on the uh,

1065
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:23.840
Eric theone and this is the view here.

1066
01:08:23.841 --> 01:08:27.650
We are standing right in front of Uncle Phil's monument looking back at the

1067
01:08:27.651 --> 01:08:30.470
Acropolis.
Even if you don't,
if you don't want to go see uncle Phil,

1068
01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:33.050
which I hope you will if you're an Athens,
visit him for me.

1069
01:08:33.450 --> 01:08:37.010
I hope that you will stay at the very least you want to stand there with your

1070
01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:39.770
back to Phil's monument and look at the Acropolis.

1071
01:08:39.771 --> 01:08:43.400
You get one of the best views of the Acropolis from the Moosejaw on hill.

1072
01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:48.640
You see it here and your view is lined up exactly with the Eric theone.

1073
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:52.370
Now why is uncle Phil buried on this hill?
Uh,

1074
01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:54.280
this is interesting because if you think back to,

1075
01:08:54.281 --> 01:08:57.050
to market texture that we've looked at in the course of this semester,

1076
01:08:57.051 --> 01:09:00.980
we didn't see people buried on hills.
The Romans don't vary.
People on hills,

1077
01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:04.970
they bury people on flat ground outside the walls of the city and they're

1078
01:09:04.971 --> 01:09:09.800
necropolis is every tune we've seen was on flat essentially on flatland.

1079
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:14.420
Why is uncle Phil built buried in a tomb near the apex of the hill?

1080
01:09:14.810 --> 01:09:18.470
While as I was writing this book,
I looked back to his own ancestors,
uh,

1081
01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:22.040
two people in this part of the world,
uh,
to,
uh,

1082
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:26.540
a group of dynamics in a place called Nimrah dog,
also in Anatolia.

1083
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:31.640
And I show you one of their WellPreserved tombs here.
Uh,
and you can see,
uh,

1084
01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:35.350
that,
uh,
the tomb is built not quite,

1085
01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:40.400
not at the apex of the hill,
but on the slope of the hill.
Uh,
in this case,
not,

1086
01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:44.830
not as close as uncle Phil's is to the apex,
but moving on that,
uh,

1087
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:47.480
moving up on that slope toward the apex.

1088
01:09:47.481 --> 01:09:51.350
And if you look very carefully at this monument,
you will see among the remains,

1089
01:09:51.351 --> 01:09:56.351
some seated statues of the dynamics of a red dog of this part of this,

1090
01:09:57.350 --> 01:10:00.560
this area,
uh,
that Phillip Papa's also comes from.

1091
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:04.880
This is the Phillip Papa's monument on the lefthand side of the screen as it

1092
01:10:04.881 --> 01:10:08.630
looks today,
made out of pentelic marble,
beautifully carved.

1093
01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:13.280
It is a kind of a tower tomb with a plain base,
a curved,

1094
01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:18.140
a second story that has the scene of Phillip Papas and the chariot and the time

1095
01:10:18.141 --> 01:10:22.160
of his constantly procession.
And then,
uh,
some statues in niches,

1096
01:10:22.170 --> 01:10:26.390
seated statues looking very much like those of numbered dog up above.

1097
01:10:26.391 --> 01:10:30.500
We think it's Phillip Papas and self with a bare chest headless in the center of

1098
01:10:30.501 --> 01:10:34.460
figure at a Toga over here.
And certainly a another figure flanking him,

1099
01:10:34.461 --> 01:10:37.880
another male seated figure on the right hand side of the screen.

1100
01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:41.120
Why do I show you the arch of Titus in connection to this?

1101
01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:45.210
Because we know that Phillip,
Papa's his father and uncle,
uh,

1102
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:50.290
participated in the Jewish wars on the side of the Flavian emperors in order to

1103
01:10:50.301 --> 01:10:54.260
gain,
even though they'd been deposed,
they wanted to gain favor with them.
Uh,

1104
01:10:54.261 --> 01:10:56.240
and when Phillip Papa's went to Rome,

1105
01:10:56.241 --> 01:11:00.320
this is a monument that he would have seen this monument that demission put up

1106
01:11:00.321 --> 01:11:05.180
two of those Jewish wars that his father and his uncle had participated in on

1107
01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:09.080
the Veolia with that representation of Titus in a chariot.

1108
01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.130
And I think there's no question,
and I present this in the book as a theory,

1109
01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:18.170
that the precast is constant Alaras Phillip op is closely based on the triumphal

1110
01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:23.160
scene of,
uh,
of,
of Titus.

1111
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:27.450
And perhaps it's no coincidence we don't have too many pentelic marble buildings

1112
01:11:27.451 --> 01:11:31.770
in Rome.
The arch of Titus is made out of Greek pentelic marble.

1113
01:11:31.771 --> 01:11:33.960
Is that a coincidence?
I don't think so.

1114
01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:37.560
Here's a restored view of the monument of Phillip Papa's as it would've looked

1115
01:11:37.561 --> 01:11:40.950
in antiquity,
the base,
the concealer procession,

1116
01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:44.740
the statue of Uncle Phil in the center of the inscription to the left,

1117
01:11:44.741 --> 01:11:49.741
to the the pilaster that survives with the inscription making reference to trade

1118
01:11:50.151 --> 01:11:53.510
ins,
titles that allow us to date it.
Uh,
and then,
uh,

1119
01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.570
probably a missing attic with an inscription at the upper most part.

1120
01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:02.630
This view and this view over here shows you some graffiti that fortunately since

1121
01:12:02.631 --> 01:12:05.310
it's been erased,
I show you the interior of the,

1122
01:12:05.311 --> 01:12:08.550
or what survives of the back wall.
That would have been the burial chamber.

1123
01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:11.490
Here's a restored view showing that burial chamber,

1124
01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:15.930
the Sarcophagus of Phillip Papa's where his remains would have been placed,

1125
01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:20.931
a statue of him on a console that still survives and then columns and f and a

1126
01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:26.130
straight lintel that formed what we call a Nice Goss and a I s,
k,
O,

1127
01:12:26.131 --> 01:12:28.740
s which served as a kind of shrine,
uh,

1128
01:12:28.741 --> 01:12:30.960
to honor him on the inside of the monument.

1129
01:12:30.961 --> 01:12:35.270
And if we look at this cross section of the tomb,
which was which,

1130
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:38.400
which are in my book,
we see the sarcophagus,

1131
01:12:38.401 --> 01:12:42.690
we see the statue of Phil and we see the way in which it is lined up with the

1132
01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:46.190
representations of Phillip op is on the outside in his chest,

1133
01:12:46.191 --> 01:12:51.191
kind of midway between the scene of him in his chariot and the scene of him with

1134
01:12:51.871 --> 01:12:54.990
the newt within,
with the bare chest and heroic nudity.

1135
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:59.970
So during his lifetime in the consular per session after death up above,

1136
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.630
so honored three times in three statues on this monument.

1137
01:13:03.810 --> 01:13:06.720
Here's a view of some of the figures that accompany him.

1138
01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:10.680
They're wearing Roman togas because the scene is taking place in Rome.

1139
01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:15.440
That's where the constant or procession is.
They're carrying,
uh,
foss gaze,

1140
01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:17.850
like the body guards do for an emperor.

1141
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:22.230
And that to a shows the relationship of this to the arch of Titus.

1142
01:13:22.410 --> 01:13:26.970
Here we see the scene of the arch of Titus triumph and the scene of Phillip

1143
01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:27.803
Papa's triumph.
Uh,

1144
01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:32.040
clearly the one on the right in my mind based on the one on the left,

1145
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.480
if you look at details of the chariot and you see a Nice Goss,

1146
01:13:36.481 --> 01:13:41.481
again decorating the chariot and Nice Gos that has a figure of none other than

1147
01:13:41.581 --> 01:13:45.720
Hercules,
we can see him wearing the holding a club.
So once again,

1148
01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:50.400
just like car color,
we see in this case earlier,
uh,
uh,

1149
01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:53.880
uh,
Phillip pop is associating himself with Hercules.

1150
01:13:54.090 --> 01:13:57.900
If we look at a detail of his head,
which is fortunately not that well preserved,

1151
01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:01.560
we see that he is bearded.
We see he wears a raid crown.

1152
01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:06.240
So although he is represented in this constant of procession,
his kingly what he,

1153
01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:10.950
that he might've been a king is referred to,
but also,
uh,
his triumph over death.

1154
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:14.090
If we look at sculpture from Nim were dog.
Uh,

1155
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:17.950
we see once again this interesting reliefs and there's more than one of these,

1156
01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:22.330
of dynastic number dog shaking hands with Hercules,
with his club,

1157
01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.130
and wearing a raid crown.

1158
01:14:24.131 --> 01:14:29.131
So this is another one of these wonderful examples of this fertile mix that one

1159
01:14:29.141 --> 01:14:32.920
gets so often in provincial Roman art where you see a,

1160
01:14:32.921 --> 01:14:35.920
a monument clearly based in part on Roman precedents,

1161
01:14:35.921 --> 01:14:40.020
but also based on the bio of this particular man and,

1162
01:14:40.050 --> 01:14:45.050
and more local precedents to see a scene of a Phillip Papa's in the upper most,

1163
01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:47.283
uh,

1164
01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:51.970
the upper most area showing him in heroic nudity.

1165
01:14:51.970 --> 01:14:55.660
And the last image that I want to show you is just to make the point that

1166
01:14:55.661 --> 01:14:56.980
interestingly enough,

1167
01:14:57.300 --> 01:15:01.750
this monument was put up by Phillip pop is a sister,

1168
01:15:01.751 --> 01:15:04.960
a woman by the name of Belle Billa,
Bal B,
I.

1169
01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.010
L l a and Bell Billa.
I mean,

1170
01:15:07.011 --> 01:15:10.240
I sh I wanted to make this point because we have seen so few examples.

1171
01:15:10.241 --> 01:15:11.380
It's not that there were none,

1172
01:15:11.381 --> 01:15:15.500
but they were small in comparison to those of men that vary.

1173
01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:20.440
There are many fewer women,
uh,
seem to have put up monuments than men.

1174
01:15:20.441 --> 01:15:24.670
But the examples that we have are very interesting indeed.
Uh,
and in this case,

1175
01:15:24.671 --> 01:15:27.960
we know that the tomb was put up by Bell Bella,

1176
01:15:27.961 --> 01:15:32.260
a woman who became very friendly with Sabina wife of Hadrian.
In fact,

1177
01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:36.820
the three of them travel together to Egypt to themes,
uh,

1178
01:15:36.821 --> 01:15:40.300
to see the Colossi of Memnon,
which I show you up there.

1179
01:15:40.301 --> 01:15:44.300
And Bell bill leaves an inscription when she goes that she was there.
Uh,

1180
01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:47.200
so she tells us that.
So a very,
just to close today,

1181
01:15:47.201 --> 01:15:51.880
a very interesting example of an extraordinary,
a tomb in Athens,

1182
01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:55.330
but one that was built by a woman.

1183
01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:59.140
And I think that's a great way to end on this beautiful Thursday.

1184
01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:00.790
Thank you all.
