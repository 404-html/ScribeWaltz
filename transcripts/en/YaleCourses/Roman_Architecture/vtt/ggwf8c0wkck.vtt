1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.970
Good morning everybody.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.470
This is the last lecture in Roman architecture and I think it's appropriate that

3
00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:12.090
I delivered this last lecture,

4
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:17.091
which I call Rome of Constantine and new Rome on Rome's birthday.

5
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.120
Indeed,
this is Rome's birthday today,

6
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.970
April 21st,

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.970
2009 Rome was born as you'll recall on the 21st of April in 753 BC,

8
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.440
which means that Rome is 2,762 years old today and since birthdays are often

9
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.770
celebrated with cake and ice cream.

10
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.850
I should make good today on the promise that I made to you at the very beginning

11
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:48.750
of the semester,

12
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.460
which is that sometime in the course of the semester I would recommend for ice

13
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:58.461
cream places to you for Gelato Rias in Rome to you and I've only recommended to,

14
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.430
I recommended Tracy [inaudible] and our [inaudible] rep and I recommended the

15
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:09.990
della Paloma that is located near the Pantheon so I haven't there two more to go

16
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.220
and it seemed on Rome's birthday this was the perfect thing to to begin the

17
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:14.880
lecture with.

18
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.880
And that is to round the circle a and make you aware of the two other best ice

19
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:21.750
cream places in Rome.

20
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.960
And I show you here on the left hand side of the screen,
uh,

21
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.850
Joe Ladies and on the right hand side of the scene,
son crispy,
no,

22
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:31.530
and note the birthday balloons.

23
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.810
And that I'm enjoying myself very much on Rome's birthday,
uh,
today.
Uh,

24
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:38.880
but just so that you know where these are,
you know,

25
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:42.840
Rome so well by now that I think I can give you directions that are going to

26
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:45.180
make sense to you.
So you have,

27
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.910
you are in the core of ancient Rome.

28
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.450
You've just been to visit the Coliseum and the Roman forum.

29
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:53.370
Maybe you've been up on the Capitoline hill,

30
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.460
you're exploring the Victor Emmanuel monument.

31
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:59.310
And so with your back to the Victor Emmanuel monument,

32
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:01.830
look straight ahead and you see the Corso,

33
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.760
the so called Corso the street of the race course race courses,

34
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.260
or the race course,
uh,
where the pope's,
by the way used to race their horses.

35
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.640
Uh,
you stand with your facing the course.
So you walk down the course.

36
00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:18.360
So you're on your way in this regard toward the Piatsa Dysphonia,

37
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:21.600
the Spanish steps.
But before you get to the Spanish steps,

38
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:24.680
you're going to notice a one the only,
uh,

39
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.080
the only a department store in Rome,
Rena Shane Day.

40
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:30.990
That's why it's a good landmark.
Rena,
shame day on the right,

41
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.650
you take a left and you're going to see the column of Marcus and release,

42
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:36.840
which is a column we didn't look at this semester.

43
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:39.150
But as based on the column of Trajan,

44
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.890
you take a look at the column of Marcus and really as you continue into the next

45
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:44.431
Piatsa,

46
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:48.960
which is the Piatsa Montagey Tortilla with a great obelisk and the center and a

47
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:51.120
government building and a couple of hotels,

48
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.500
you stay on the right and you go down that next small street and you hit Joe

49
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.710
Levy,
which in my opinion,
is the single best ice cream place in Rome.

50
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.840
So if you're in Rome and not to be missed,

51
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:06.010
it has the best fruit flavors in the city of Rome.
In fact,
anywhere in Italy,
uh,

52
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.790
that I know of.
And the second one that I mentioned to you,

53
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:14.350
his son Crespino son Crespino,
is near the Trevi Fountain in Rome.

54
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:17.470
So you're gonna go to the Trevi fountain in any case.
Uh,

55
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:20.840
and all you need to do when you're facing the Trevi fountain is to go,

56
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.160
go about two blocks away from the Trevi fountain and you will hit some crispy.

57
00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:31.810
No,
it has a smaller selection of flavors,
but everything is very,
very good there.

58
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:32.261
In fact,

59
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:37.000
they've been such a success that they have expanded and opened another one near

60
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:41.710
the Pantheon.
Uh,
so again,
back to the pantheon down that small street,

61
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:43.780
I already gave you the directions to Della Palma.

62
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.740
You go beyond della Paul and me.
You take a left and you'll hit the second son.

63
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:50.770
Crespino so,
uh,
very important to,
uh,

64
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.030
to share this with you again before the term is up and in honor of Rome's

65
00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:58.660
birthday.
Also of course when you're at Sun Crespino,

66
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.370
don't forget the Trevi Fountain and you probably all know the tradition that

67
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:06.610
when you go and visit the Trevi Fountain,
which is always very crowded,

68
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:10.300
this is actually a small crowd compared to what's usually there after you've

69
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.720
looked at it and enjoyed it for its own sake.

70
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:16.450
And for architecture obviously have a much later period.

71
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:20.110
But I think one you can see is very closely based on a lot of things that we've

72
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:23.260
been looking at this semester.
After you've looked at it,

73
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.320
and people usually do this right before they leave Rome,

74
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:30.070
you go up to the fountain,
bring a coin can be,
it can be an,
you know,

75
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:33.340
an American coin or Italian coin or any coin for that matter.

76
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.500
You stand in front of the Trevi Fountain with your back to the Trevi fountain.

77
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.890
You take a coin,
you throw it over your shoulder,
that to make sure it gets,

78
00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:45.460
it goes into the water and not on the side,
but throw it into the water.

79
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:49.330
And that will ensure that you will get to return to Rome someday.

80
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:54.320
So don't forget to do that as well.
We spoke on the,

81
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.180
in the last lecture,
uh,

82
00:04:56.181 --> 00:05:01.181
about the tetrarchy about Diocletian and his formation of the tetrarchy,

83
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.150
uh,
and his attempt to bring stability back to Rome and to the empire and how

84
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:09.890
successful he was.
Indeed.
A,

85
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.320
we also talked about the fact that Diocletian and the other tetrarchy we're

86
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.430
responsible for some important building projects.
In fact,
building,

87
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.300
bringing architecture back to Rome,
uh,

88
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.220
in a way that had it had been missing in the third century.

89
00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:29.221
Ady and I mentioned in particular that Diocletian was interested both in public

90
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:31.690
and in private architecture.

91
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.160
And I remind you of an example of public architecture that we looked at last

92
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:37.860
time on the top left.
Uh,

93
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.040
the so called five column monument or descendible monument or Tetrarch,

94
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:47.041
if monument that Diocletian erected in the Roman forum to honor himself,

95
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.350
uh,
and honor his formation of the tetrarchy and his relationship to Jupiter.

96
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.670
You'll remember the five columns for a,

97
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.280
with the tech parks imaged on the top and the front,

98
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.780
the one of Jupiter behind that this was located behind the roster or the

99
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:05.570
speakers platform.
In the Roman forum.

100
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.430
We also talked about the fact that Diocletian was interested again in private

101
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:13.460
architecture,
that he built a palace for himself,

102
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:18.461
a place that he hoped to retire to in on the Dalmatian coast where he was born

103
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.220
at a place called split.
And I remind you of it here,

104
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.950
a restored view showing you what it looked like.

105
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.400
That it was essentially a fortified camp,
uh,

106
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.670
designed like a Roman cost from,

107
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.890
with walls and towers and a very distinctive octagonal Maza Liam that was

108
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:42.450
located across from the temple of Jupiter.
So again,
is connected,

109
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.700
connecting himself to Jupiter,
honoring Jupiter as the honors himself.

110
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.840
And I also showed you an example of the portraiture of the tetrarchy.

111
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.410
We talked about the all for one and one for all philosophy,

112
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.600
how they stuck together not only in life,

113
00:06:56.601 --> 00:07:00.650
but in their portraits and they depicted themselves or they had themselves

114
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:04.070
depicted as this foursome in large part.

115
00:07:04.071 --> 00:07:08.690
Again to underscore the fact that all four of them were coequal emperors,
uh,

116
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.230
that all four of them are almost coequal them for will remember that there were

117
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:16.700
all gousty and Caesars of some had the slight upper hand,
but for the most part,

118
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:20.360
they work together now represented as a whole.
Uh,

119
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.180
and they're represented in very similar way to one another.

120
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:27.050
And we talked about the use of geometric forms,
the abstraction,

121
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.420
the solidity of these portraits that I suggested mirrors this new stability that

122
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:36.980
Diocletian and the tetrarchy have brought,
uh,
to Rome and to the empire.

123
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:38.810
And we saw that those same qualities,

124
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:42.630
that interest in geometry and obstruction and solidity,
uh,

125
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.770
were characteristic also of Tetra archaic architecture.

126
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:48.160
And we're going to see some of those features,
uh,

127
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.580
continuing on in the buildings that we're going to be looking at today.

128
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.270
Diocletian uh,

129
00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:00.450
a stepdown retired voluntarily on the 1st of May in 305.

130
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.610
And the,
uh,

131
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.390
Maximilian his co Augustus stepped down as well.

132
00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:13.391
And the two Caesars were elevated to our gousty and two new Caesars were chosen.

133
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.570
But without the strong presence of Diocletian,

134
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.600
the tetrarchy fell apart and Rome and the empire where once again plunged into

135
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.510
civil war,
the two main claimants,

136
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:31.511
four imperial power that came out of this civil war where Max [inaudible],

137
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.661
Max Sanchez,

138
00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:37.661
who was the son of Maximilian and Constantine Constantine,

139
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:39.800
who eventually became Constantine,

140
00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:44.750
the Great Constantine who was the son of [inaudible] as Cloris and these two

141
00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:45.470
men,

142
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:50.470
Constantine and Max inches ward with one another for imperial power.

143
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.980
And they went against one another in one of the most famous battles of all,

144
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.840
in fact,
the battle that is as well known,

145
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:00.750
if not even more well known than the battle of Actium.

146
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:04.110
And this is the battle of the mill vion bridge,

147
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.240
the battle of the mill vion bridge,

148
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.420
which took place in 312 a d,

149
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:14.810
and it was at that epic making battle that Constantine was victorious over Max

150
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:20.640
inches,
that Constantine became sole emperor of Rome.

151
00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.950
So a move away from the tetrarchy and the placement of power in the hands of one

152
00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:27.450
man.
Once again,

153
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:32.460
Constantine becomes sole emperor of Rome and it was at that same battle,

154
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:34.020
the battle of the Milby and bridge,

155
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:38.190
and one of the reasons that it's such an important battle in historical terms is

156
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:42.360
the fact that it was at that battle of the mill vion bridge that Constantine was

157
00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:45.060
said to have seen the vision of the cross,

158
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.000
the vision of the process that helped him to be victorious,

159
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.650
the vision of the cross,

160
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.680
that that eventually led him to convert to Christianity,

161
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:56.790
which he did on his back and his deathbed.

162
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.760
He was baptized a Christian on his deathbed.

163
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.290
One of the most interesting things that we'll talk about today and about the

164
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.330
architecture under Constantine,

165
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:11.100
the great is that we will see because he w he began as a pagan emperor and ended

166
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:13.770
his life as a Christian emperor.
He has in a sense,

167
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:18.420
one foot in the pagan past and the other foot in the Christian future and we're

168
00:10:18.421 --> 00:10:22.530
going to see that reflected in the architecture that he commissioned.

169
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.420
As we look at that today,
a few coins of Constantine,

170
00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:32.421
which I think will help set the stage for this one foot in the past and one foot

171
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:37.560
in the future.
That is going to be the light motif of today's lecture.

172
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.060
I show you on the lefthand side of the screen,
a coin of Constantine.

173
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:45.720
When he first began his rise to power,
it was probably,
uh,

174
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.900
struck in around 306 a d.

175
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.240
And it's an interesting coin because if you remember,

176
00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:52.500
I didn't bring it back to show you,

177
00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:56.040
but if you remember the coin of Diocletian that I showed you,

178
00:10:56.041 --> 00:11:00.030
you'll recall that he was represented in a very similar fashion.

179
00:11:00.031 --> 00:11:04.440
It's the sort of bearded blockhead style,
as I call it,
for the tetrarchy,

180
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.250
a very cubic image,
a short military hairstyle,

181
00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:13.251
closely cropped a and a short beard that adheres very closely to the shape of

182
00:11:13.681 --> 00:11:15.530
the face,
uh,
and the,

183
00:11:15.531 --> 00:11:19.530
the face in mast itself with cubic geometric forms.

184
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:24.050
So we see Constantine in his very early portrait trying to look like a trek

185
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.170
tetrarch trying to look like his father and status core is trying to look like

186
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:33.171
Diocletian trying to fit in before he figures out the way that's going to enable

187
00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:33.660
him.

188
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:38.660
In fact to become emperor for sole emperor of Rome after he defeats Maxentius at

189
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:41.250
the battle of the Milby and bridge,

190
00:11:41.251 --> 00:11:45.630
we see the greatest transformation in the history of Roman portraiture and the

191
00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:48.930
history of self imaging by emperors,
by people in power.

192
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.770
And that is this transformation that I can show you from this early coin of

193
00:11:52.771 --> 00:11:54.460
three six to a coin.

194
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:58.930
The dates after the battle of the mill and bridge and that also represents

195
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:03.370
Constantine and what you see has happened to your has cons is Constantine has

196
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:04.510
shaved off his beard,

197
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.900
he has lost about 20 years of age and he is shown with an entirely different

198
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:14.620
hairstyle,
not the,
not the short military hairstyle that he wore,

199
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.310
a because he wanted to likened himself to his father and to Diocletian,

200
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.520
but an entirely new hairstyle.

201
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:24.760
But one for any of you who know your Roman portraiture or remember the portraits

202
00:12:24.761 --> 00:12:27.700
that I showed you,
fleetingly of Augustus and the Julio Claudine's,

203
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:32.940
he is wearing a cap of hair that is very similar to a fuller cap of hair with a

204
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.840
comma shape blocks over his bar had growing long on the nape of his neck that is

205
00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:40.870
characteristic of Augustus and also of Trajan.

206
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:45.700
He's in fact a neo Augustus in this image with a neo Trey Janick hairstyle.

207
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.370
Why?
Because he is at sole emperor.

208
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:53.370
He has made the decision that he wants to now ally himself not with the Tetra

209
00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.500
Arcs,
which are of the past at this point,
but rather with the,

210
00:12:56.501 --> 00:13:00.130
with the great emperors of the past with Augustus,
with Trajan.

211
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.710
And as we'll see also with Hadrian and with Marcus a released.

212
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.450
And we can see that very important break here and we'll see it also in

213
00:13:07.451 --> 00:13:08.910
architecture.
Uh,

214
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.540
another coin down here representing a Constantine,
uh,
with a,

215
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.940
with a bunch of Pagan Regalia.

216
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.870
We see him as so many of the emperors earlier,

217
00:13:19.871 --> 00:13:24.610
emperors of Rome depicted along with a patron.
God,
in this case,
the God,

218
00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:28.810
Helios,
the god of the Sun.
Uh,
and you can see Constantine in the foreground,

219
00:13:28.811 --> 00:13:33.190
Helios in the background,
a Helios represented with the raid crown.

220
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:37.030
And that's why we know it's him silhouetted right behind the emperor.

221
00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.540
The emperor is shown,
is warlike with military costume,
his spear,

222
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.470
and then a shield over here.
And if we look closely at the shield,

223
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:49.180
will see the depiction of someone in a chariot,
uh,
led by four horses coming.

224
00:13:49.181 --> 00:13:53.920
It's represented frontally.
It's the solar cherry at the solar chariot of Helios.

225
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:58.270
So a coin that is very much in the usual pagan tradition where we see

226
00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:03.190
Constantine associating himself with,
uh,
with,
with the pagan past,
uh,

227
00:14:03.191 --> 00:14:07.240
and uh,
and with a pagan God in this case,
Helios.

228
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.740
This coin,
however,

229
00:14:08.741 --> 00:14:13.741
that was also made after the battle of the Milby and bridge shows us a very

230
00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:17.320
different Constantine.
It's an interesting frontal portrait,

231
00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:22.240
which is rare on a Roman coins.
Uh,
he is still shown as the warrior.

232
00:14:22.241 --> 00:14:26.050
He's in military costume.
He has,
he's holding the reins of his horse.

233
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:30.020
He was also depicted nicely in this portrait on this coin.
Uh,

234
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.340
if you look very closely at his shield,

235
00:14:32.341 --> 00:14:36.670
you will actually see that it still is decorated with a pagan symbol with the

236
00:14:36.671 --> 00:14:40.360
she wolf suckling Romulus and Remus.
But look up here,

237
00:14:40.361 --> 00:14:44.980
the sector that he carries is not the usual septor or spear that we see in pagan

238
00:14:44.981 --> 00:14:45.431
imagery,

239
00:14:45.431 --> 00:14:50.230
but I a cross sector across sector and I don't know if you can see it from where

240
00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:51.870
you sit.
He wears a,

241
00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.900
a medallion on the top of his very elaborate help helmet with plumage and so on

242
00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:01.580
a medallion that has the Chi Rho,
c h,

243
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:06.230
I o Dash r h o,
the Chi Rho,
which was the Christian monogram.

244
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.830
So we see him in this image,
not as the great pagan warrior,

245
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.950
but as the new Christian preset crusader.

246
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.480
So a very important change,
uh,
from paganism to Christianity.

247
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.070
Then as I mentioned already,

248
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:23.240
we will see also reflected in Constantine's architecture.

249
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:28.180
Constantine,
uh,
learned a lot though from the tech trucks.

250
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.820
And one of the things that he continued on,
uh,

251
00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.680
was to build a great public architecture,

252
00:15:33.681 --> 00:15:38.000
public architecture for the benefit of the Roman populace at large.

253
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:43.300
He follows the lead of Diocletian in this regard and adds another very large

254
00:15:44.211 --> 00:15:46.220
imperial bath to Rome.

255
00:15:46.221 --> 00:15:50.270
And I show you a plan of that imperial bath here at bears,
his name,

256
00:15:50.271 --> 00:15:55.271
the bads of Constantine and dates to 320 and it is located in Rome.

257
00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:01.040
Uh,
it is located on the queer knowl hill,
the queer and Phil Hill.

258
00:16:01.041 --> 00:16:06.041
And that should ring a bell for all of you because you'll remember it was Trajan

259
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:06.561
Trajan.

260
00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:11.060
And remember Constantine is imaging himself as a neo Augustus with a neo Trey

261
00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.150
Janick hairstyle Trajan who built,
who had the,

262
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:19.170
a much a good part of the queer and it'll help cut back to make way for his

263
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:24.311
forum and then placed his markets on part of what remained of the queer and mill

264
00:16:24.831 --> 00:16:29.310
hill.
So the queer and all hell was,
was associated in everybody's mind,
uh,

265
00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:33.470
with Trajan.
Constantine wanted to associate himself with Trajan.

266
00:16:33.471 --> 00:16:37.940
So when he decides where to place is a new bath structure,

267
00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:41.030
he chooses the queer and all hell.
This is not coincidentally,

268
00:16:41.031 --> 00:16:43.520
it was very deliberative on his part.

269
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.200
He builds it in a manner that is completely consistent with imperial,

270
00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.150
a bath architecture in Rome,

271
00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:54.230
the imperial bath type of architecture in Rome that we've already studied from

272
00:16:54.231 --> 00:16:58.730
the time of Titus up through the time of Diocletian,
the,
uh,

273
00:16:58.731 --> 00:17:01.970
the bags on the queer and hill are no longer preserved,

274
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.060
but we fortunately have some drawings that were made,
uh,

275
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:09.530
by the famous architect Andrea Palladio,
uh,
p a,

276
00:17:09.531 --> 00:17:12.560
l l a d I o undrip Lado who,
uh,

277
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:15.920
who drew it when it was in better shape and has,

278
00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.940
and his drawings of the bads of Constantine allow us to see exactly what these

279
00:17:21.231 --> 00:17:25.670
bats were like in their hay day.
Uh,
and we can see,

280
00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:30.660
although plot it Palladio's drawing concentrates on the bathing block.
Uh,

281
00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.130
you can see that he also includes down here and it's probably that this is all

282
00:17:34.131 --> 00:17:37.460
that remained of this particular part of the bath and Palladio's time.

283
00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.480
You can see he includes down here the Great Hemi cycle that we've seen in so

284
00:17:41.481 --> 00:17:46.160
many of these bands that are part of that precinct that surrounds the bath,

285
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:51.370
the bath block.
So this suggests to us,
and I think very convincingly,
ah,

286
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:55.200
that this bath is bathing block was also placed in one of these very large

287
00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:59.790
precincts that had all the seminar and lecture rooms and libraries around the

288
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:04.290
perimeter of it and that this was lined with seats and probably use too for

289
00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:09.291
people to watch athletic contests or perhaps even a plays of other kinds.

290
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.610
The bathing block,
again,

291
00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:15.810
we can see conforms extremely well to the other bats that we've looked at to the

292
00:18:15.811 --> 00:18:18.570
baths of Caracalla and Diocletian.
For example,

293
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:23.820
with a natap deo rectangular in shape with a frigate Doriam that is also

294
00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:26.730
rectangular and has three a triple groin vault.

295
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:30.510
As you can see designated in Palladio's drawing and down here.

296
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:34.200
This is a reinterpretation by the way of Palladio's drawing from Ward Perkins.

297
00:18:34.201 --> 00:18:37.980
This plan that you see on the screen now,
a tip Darian over here,

298
00:18:37.981 --> 00:18:41.730
that's something somewhat more unusual in shape.
Then then we,

299
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.570
then we tend to see where we have a series of Lobes,

300
00:18:45.571 --> 00:18:50.330
four lobes in fact that have been,
that have expanded the space almost.
Well,
it's,

301
00:18:50.331 --> 00:18:55.170
it's sort of a circle trying to become an oval,
I suppose.
Uh,
but,
uh,
you can see,

302
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:55.740
uh,

303
00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:00.740
the way in which they have expanded and we call that kind of a space quadro low

304
00:19:01.831 --> 00:19:04.800
bait quadrilles debate.
Uh,
and we see that here.

305
00:19:04.801 --> 00:19:08.850
And then we also see this is most interesting how the call Darian is treated

306
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.400
because as you've seen in the baths that we've looked at,

307
00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:12.810
the imperial bats that we've looked at,

308
00:19:12.811 --> 00:19:16.590
if there's any room that's different in each of these,
it's the caldarium.

309
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.730
You'll recall that Diocletian had moved to a rectangular called Darian with

310
00:19:20.731 --> 00:19:25.260
radiating alcoves but Constantine and his architects move back to the circular

311
00:19:25.261 --> 00:19:30.261
called rem that we saw in the baths of Caracalla uses the same sort of scheme

312
00:19:31.621 --> 00:19:33.900
here with three radiating alcoves,

313
00:19:33.901 --> 00:19:38.901
all of those screened from the outer space with columns a and the rest of the

314
00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:41.490
structure around these,

315
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:46.040
these main rooms of the bathing block that are related to one another axial

316
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.080
axially.
We see the other rooms symmetrically disposed.

317
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:53.760
One other important point to make about the caldarium is that we see that it to

318
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.990
corresponds to a development that we've already begun to see in some of the

319
00:19:57.991 --> 00:20:00.690
other buildings that we looked at,
especially in the last lecture.

320
00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.880
And that is this move away from the Oculus for round domed buildings.

321
00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:07.110
This round,

322
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:11.510
this call arm does not have an Oculus as so many call Daria did in the past

323
00:20:11.511 --> 00:20:12.860
thing back to the,
uh,

324
00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:17.130
well or so many bathing rooms did think back to the frigging Daria and pom pay,

325
00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:21.180
for example,
with their Oculus,
the Oculus is no longer used here.

326
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:25.710
And instead we see windows in the base of the Dome that are very similar to the

327
00:20:25.711 --> 00:20:28.590
windows that we saw in a couple of tetrarch buildings.

328
00:20:28.591 --> 00:20:32.550
We're going to see it elsewhere today and I'll reiterate that point then.

329
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.640
Constantine,
like so many Roman emperors before him,
uh,

330
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:42.630
did complete buildings that had been begun by his predecessors.

331
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.870
Uh,
and he did this,
uh,
for,
uh,
some of the tech,
including father,

332
00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.350
not surprisingly,
can stand just Cloris.

333
00:20:50.351 --> 00:20:54.970
We know that can stand just Cloris had chosen as his capital a as the city of

334
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:59.950
trickier the city of [inaudible] in,
uh,
what was goal but was,
uh,

335
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.090
but,
but now is Germany.
Uh,

336
00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:07.220
and I show you the location of tree or this is a map showing the locations of,

337
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.720
as we've discussed so many times this term of many of the,

338
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.640
of all of the places that we've looked at in the western empire.
Uh,

339
00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.220
and you can see the French cities that we looked at,

340
00:21:18.221 --> 00:21:22.690
just less time and goal and then up there a trader in what is now Germany

341
00:21:22.691 --> 00:21:26.140
located near the modern city of Cologne.
Uh,

342
00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:31.141
this was the chosen capital for can stand just Cloris even before Constancia is

343
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.790
Cloris began to build a palace for himself at Tria as the other tech drugs had

344
00:21:36.791 --> 00:21:39.720
done elsewhere in the Roman provinces.
Uh,

345
00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.350
there was quite a bit of building activity going on with regard to one project

346
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:47.470
in trior in the third century.
And not surprisingly,

347
00:21:47.471 --> 00:21:52.270
that too was a defensive wall that part of the empire was being attacked on a

348
00:21:52.271 --> 00:21:57.220
regular basis by a Germanic tribes.
By the Franks and by the all Amani,

349
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.900
uh,
we're coming in wrecking havoc in that part of the world.
Uh,

350
00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.910
and a decision was taken and not surprisingly in 275 and 276 cause you'll

351
00:22:06.911 --> 00:22:10.720
remember that's exactly when the really enrolls were dedicated in Rome,

352
00:22:10.721 --> 00:22:15.721
275 a to build a major wall in this part of the empire as well.

353
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.240
And we have some part of that wall still preserved,

354
00:22:22.241 --> 00:22:26.080
especially a gate in that wall called the Porta Negro,

355
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.860
which I show you here on the right hand side of the screen in the port in Negro,

356
00:22:29.861 --> 00:22:33.270
which although the walls were begun in the two seventies,

357
00:22:33.271 --> 00:22:35.710
so the walls date primarily in the third century,

358
00:22:35.711 --> 00:22:40.711
this particular gate was not added to the walls until the early fourth century.

359
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.270
D during the time of Constancia is Cloris.
Uh,

360
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:49.270
and Constantine completes,
uh,
this,
uh,

361
00:22:49.271 --> 00:22:51.970
this gateway in the,
those bads.

362
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:57.210
If we compare the gate at the port a Negro and trior to the gate that we looked

363
00:22:57.281 --> 00:23:01.570
at from the really end walls is so called Puerto Apia that does date to around

364
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:06.960
275 and you see it again in this restored view from Ward Perkins on the left

365
00:23:06.961 --> 00:23:08.170
hand side of the screen,

366
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.880
you will see the close resemblance of the port a Negro to the port,

367
00:23:11.881 --> 00:23:13.000
the majority in Rome.

368
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
By that I mean both of them have to RQ to RQ weighted entrance ways.

369
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.190
Both of them have round towers.
As you can see here.
Uh,

370
00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:27.190
both of them have a RQ weighted RQ,
weighted windows,
uh,

371
00:23:27.191 --> 00:23:31.540
or blind windows.
As you can see in the case of the port a Negro,

372
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.250
they have columns between them,
which is not the case in the poor to Apia.

373
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.620
The main difference between the two,

374
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:43.990
between these two content between these two is that the Porta Apia in Rome,

375
00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.520
you'll recall was out of concrete faced with brick,
uh,

376
00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.820
the most contemporary building material.

377
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.940
Whereas you can clearly see by looking at the port a Negro that the port in

378
00:23:53.941 --> 00:23:57.470
Negro is made out of stone,
out of cut stone construction,

379
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.450
extremely old fashioned at this particular time.
Uh,

380
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:05.990
but I think it is very likely that they wanted by choosing this for this

381
00:24:05.991 --> 00:24:08.280
particular part of the world.
And it is,
uh,

382
00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.830
it is this cut stone construction is local stone.
By choosing this,

383
00:24:12.831 --> 00:24:15.460
they wanted to reassert a,

384
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.090
a relationship between the early fourth century ID and earlier Rome and

385
00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:22.250
especially earlier Roman imperial power.

386
00:24:22.251 --> 00:24:27.020
The very symbols of Roman power buildings like the theater of Marcel is,

387
00:24:27.021 --> 00:24:29.630
and especially the Colosseum in Rome,

388
00:24:29.631 --> 00:24:34.400
we've talked about that as the icon of Rome.
It's ability to impress and to all.

389
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:39.410
And I think they wanted to take advantage of that kind of awe inspiring,
uh,

390
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:44.600
rhetoric,
uh,
you know,
a visual rhetoric that such a choice could make.

391
00:24:44.601 --> 00:24:47.930
And I think it's an example of the fact,
you know,

392
00:24:47.931 --> 00:24:52.931
just as Constantine reaches back to emperors like Trajan to Augustus to

393
00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:58.160
associate himself with in his portraiture.
I think that,
uh,

394
00:24:58.161 --> 00:24:59.560
that there was a,

395
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:04.720
they had reason to look back to some of the great buildings of the Roman past,

396
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.950
uh,
two and to use that,

397
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:10.460
that kind of visual imagery to reassert that Rome,

398
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.220
despite the fact that they were being attacked by barbarians,

399
00:25:13.221 --> 00:25:14.960
all was well in Rome.

400
00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:19.460
Paul continued to be well in the Capitol as well as on the frontiers.

401
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:23.330
And this kind of image I think worked,
uh,
in that regard.
Well,

402
00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:26.840
one hopes that that will,
they thought it would work at any rate in that regard,

403
00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.240
even into the early fourth century.

404
00:25:29.241 --> 00:25:33.590
A D is another view at the same view of the port a Negro.

405
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:38.300
And I compare it also to a detail from the porter majority in Rome,

406
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.550
which you'll recall was built by Claudius.

407
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:44.360
There is an interesting resemblance between the two and many scholars have

408
00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:48.710
called attention to that because the stone of the port of Negro is not as

409
00:25:48.711 --> 00:25:52.580
smoothed over as the stone of the Colosseum or the theater of Marcellus.

410
00:25:52.581 --> 00:25:54.740
It's left in a much more rough state,

411
00:25:54.741 --> 00:25:59.741
a rough state that reminds one of the rustic dicated masonry of Claudius has

412
00:25:59.951 --> 00:26:04.520
poured a majority.
But remember that in the case of the port,
the majority,

413
00:26:04.521 --> 00:26:06.340
there was a deliberate,
uh,

414
00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:11.300
the deliberate disjunction between the rustication masonry and the finished

415
00:26:11.301 --> 00:26:15.890
masonry,
the finished capitals,
and also the finished,
uh,
pediments above.

416
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:20.360
And we talked about the fact that we believe that that has a lot to do with a

417
00:26:20.361 --> 00:26:24.020
particular personality and antiquarian interest.

418
00:26:24.021 --> 00:26:29.021
And Claudius who liked the intellectual exercise and idea of playing off one

419
00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:32.450
against the other.
We don't see that same combination here.

420
00:26:32.451 --> 00:26:36.440
We don't see the rough and the,
and the finished,
uh,
in the case of the port,

421
00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.270
the port of Negro and treer.
And it has been suggested and I think correctly,

422
00:26:41.271 --> 00:26:43.040
so that the reason that the,

423
00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.590
and need where looks the way it does is not the deliberate,

424
00:26:46.591 --> 00:26:51.540
the way the port of majority is,
but rather because it really was unfinished.

425
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.290
It would,
the blocks were never fully smoothed over,
but it,

426
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.310
but it makes it very attractive appearance even still today,
despite that,

427
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:05.720
Constantine,
uh,
so Constantine completed this gateway,
uh,

428
00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:10.250
but he also completed the palace that had been begun by his father can stand,

429
00:27:10.251 --> 00:27:14.430
is Flores had begun a palace and tree or the palace had a very large and

430
00:27:14.431 --> 00:27:17.610
impressive bath building as a piece of it.
Uh,

431
00:27:17.611 --> 00:27:21.340
and it also had this building that is usually referred to today as the

432
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.040
[inaudible] Palatino or the basilica,
the Allah Palatine or the basilica.

433
00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:28.650
We're not exactly sure how it was used in the palace,

434
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.540
but possibly in the same way that the basilica was in the,
uh,

435
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:38.630
in the palace of Domitian Domitian on the Palatine hill as a place where he

436
00:27:38.851 --> 00:27:42.360
could sit and try cases himself.

437
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.430
It may have been used in the same fashion here and I can show you it's extremely

438
00:27:47.431 --> 00:27:52.050
WellPreserved at dates to 300 to 310 a d again,

439
00:27:52.051 --> 00:27:56.790
part of the palace of Constancia is Cloris completed by Constantine.

440
00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:00.870
We see a plan and a restored view from Ward Perkins now on the screen.

441
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.950
And if you look at the plan,
uh,
you will see that in the main,

442
00:28:04.951 --> 00:28:09.120
it follows the Basilican plan that we've become so accustomed to a great open

443
00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:14.121
rectangular space within apps on one end and with all attention drawn toward

444
00:28:14.701 --> 00:28:19.290
that apps.
Uh,
so in that sense,
again,
one foot in the pagan past,

445
00:28:19.291 --> 00:28:22.320
it looks back to basilicas of an earlier date,

446
00:28:22.321 --> 00:28:25.830
be they the one in dimensions palace or,
uh,
or,

447
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:30.870
or the forum of Trajan in Rome.
But there are some differences here.
Uh,

448
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.890
one of them is the fact that you can see that there are no columns inside the

449
00:28:34.891 --> 00:28:36.450
cellar.
That's interesting.

450
00:28:36.451 --> 00:28:41.340
And it is in keeping with the tetrarchy aesthetic that we've already described

451
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.320
for the Korea,
for example,
with that,

452
00:28:43.321 --> 00:28:48.321
that that a box like a box like open space inside a without any columnar

453
00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.950
decoration at all,
no columns in here,

454
00:28:52.951 --> 00:28:56.490
stark geometric abstract and the tetrarch manner.

455
00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:01.540
But they have placed columns on the outside of the basilica in a,

456
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.840
in,
uh,
in a,
in a kind of courtyard on either side,
uh,
columns,
uh,

457
00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:09.540
that you can see here,
which is a very interesting and unusual,
uh,

458
00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.850
and in fact unique,
uh,
approach.

459
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.750
You can also see there's a transverse Carter,
uh,

460
00:29:15.751 --> 00:29:20.340
over here and that are trends verse entrance,
vestibule,

461
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.770
transverse vestibule,
entrance vestibule,

462
00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:27.660
which is unusual in which we don't see in Roman and typical Roman basilican

463
00:29:27.661 --> 00:29:31.560
architecture.
We call that a Narthex and a r,
t h,
e x.

464
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.890
And this edition of the Narthex here,
this,

465
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:40.050
this transverse a vestibule is interesting because it is going to become the

466
00:29:40.051 --> 00:29:42.310
basis for most church architecture,

467
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:47.530
both from the Tom Basilican church architecture in the time of Constantine

468
00:29:47.531 --> 00:29:49.450
because Constantine does found all,

469
00:29:49.451 --> 00:29:52.930
it does build old Saint Peter's and other churches in Rome,
uh,

470
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:55.600
and others follow suit.
So this,
those are the,

471
00:29:55.601 --> 00:29:59.670
so getting one foot in the pagan past one in the Christian future on the left

472
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.880
hand side of the screen,
the restored view of the exterior,
uh,

473
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:06.760
shows not only those low lying,
uh,
columnar,
uh,
courtyards,

474
00:30:06.761 --> 00:30:10.090
but also that there were railings on two stories.
Uh,

475
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:14.470
it does show you as well.
And the building is made out of solid brick.
Uh,

476
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.950
it does show you as well the rounded windows,
the arched windows,

477
00:30:17.951 --> 00:30:19.260
which we have seen,
uh,

478
00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.290
the round top windows which we have seen have become customary for tetrarchy

479
00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:28.320
architecture as well as a very interesting use of projecting elements that are

480
00:30:29.351 --> 00:30:31.990
very simple.
They look almost like pilasters,

481
00:30:31.991 --> 00:30:36.060
but they're not pilasters there a simplified abstract version of pilasters.

482
00:30:36.061 --> 00:30:36.760
So this,

483
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:41.760
this paring down of the elements that is so consistent with the tetrarchy ethos.

484
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.530
Here's a view of the outlet Palatino as it looks today.
Uh,
again,

485
00:30:47.531 --> 00:30:51.040
it is extremely well preserved as you can see,
uh,

486
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:55.810
but it does no longer has its outer courtyard and it no longer has its railings.

487
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.700
Uh,
but the rest is there.

488
00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:01.300
You can see these wonderful round headed windows and how large they are.

489
00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:06.300
We've talked about the ability of architects to dematerialize the wall at this

490
00:31:06.341 --> 00:31:11.200
point in time and the way in which they have opened it up with very large

491
00:31:11.201 --> 00:31:11.591
windows.

492
00:31:11.591 --> 00:31:15.730
And you can see what I was describing just before these molded elements that

493
00:31:15.731 --> 00:31:17.830
project out into our space.

494
00:31:17.831 --> 00:31:22.831
They kind of look like they're made to conjure up pilasters but they don't have

495
00:31:22.991 --> 00:31:26.580
any capitals and they don't have any basis there in my mind,

496
00:31:26.581 --> 00:31:29.470
a kind of abstract version,
uh,
of what,
uh,

497
00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:32.630
of a pilaster and they're very effective I think.
Uh,

498
00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:37.060
in terms of the aesthetic appeal of this particular building

499
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:42.940
while the basilica at the palace at Tria,

500
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.830
the palace of Constantia is Cloris at trickier is so clearly based on earlier

501
00:31:47.831 --> 00:31:52.540
Roman basilican architecture.
It looks to the future.
And we,

502
00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.850
if we look around Rome,
uh,
in,
in,

503
00:31:54.851 --> 00:31:59.851
in the years following the construction of buildings like the Owlet Palatino,

504
00:32:00.011 --> 00:32:04.330
we see lots of early churches.
I show you the Church of Santa Sabina,

505
00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.270
Sab Ina Santa Sabina in Rome,

506
00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.430
which dates to 425.

507
00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:14.420
And so the fifth century a d and I think you can see how similar it is,
uh,

508
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:18.910
to the,
uh,
to the owl Palatino,
the basilican form,

509
00:32:18.911 --> 00:32:21.750
the apse at the end,
the very large,
uh,

510
00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:26.590
rounded round top windows that we see in the basilica at Tria,

511
00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:31.540
the interior of the,
uh,
Al Apella.
Tina is also very well preserved.

512
00:32:31.541 --> 00:32:32.560
You see a view of it here.

513
00:32:32.561 --> 00:32:36.460
It has been transformed not surprisingly into a church in later times.

514
00:32:36.461 --> 00:32:38.920
It's a perfect space for that.
Uh,

515
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.820
and I think it's well worth comparing it to the interior of the Korea that we

516
00:32:43.821 --> 00:32:46.860
looked at last time.
Because again,
it shows a,

517
00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.340
a vision of the tetrarchy.

518
00:32:49.341 --> 00:32:53.090
A vision of that is consistent from Rome to the provinces.

519
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.410
This whole idea of pairing things down to their basics of creating a box like

520
00:32:57.411 --> 00:33:01.700
shape,
no columnar architecture whatsoever.
A very sparse,

521
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:06.260
the decorated rectangular space with a flat ceiling and with round headed

522
00:33:06.261 --> 00:33:08.960
windows.
We see the same concept here.

523
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.690
Here they placed the round headed windows on two stories,

524
00:33:11.691 --> 00:33:16.691
which is open the building up even more and create an allowed light to flow into

525
00:33:17.211 --> 00:33:19.700
it.
No columnar decoration whatsoever.

526
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:24.850
The scheme of two rows of round headed windows in the niche as well.

527
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.030
Also opening it up,
dematerializing it,

528
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:33.040
allowing light to stream into the building in what is a very spiritual way and

529
00:33:33.801 --> 00:33:33.981
again,

530
00:33:33.981 --> 00:33:38.981
not at all surprising that it would be transformed in later times into a church.

531
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:45.380
Once again,
one foot in the pagan past one in the Christian future.

532
00:33:45.381 --> 00:33:46.700
I show you a restored view.

533
00:33:46.701 --> 00:33:50.750
We've looked at it before of the Basilica Olympia in Rome,

534
00:33:50.751 --> 00:33:53.930
part of the forum of Trajan.
It's that kind of thing,

535
00:33:53.931 --> 00:33:58.931
that kind of Basilican plan that lies beyond behind the design of the basilica

536
00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:04.510
at,
uh,
at the palace of Constancia is Cloris and tree or,
uh,

537
00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.400
but it also looks forward to others.

538
00:34:07.401 --> 00:34:09.560
I show you here the Interior Santa Sabina.

539
00:34:09.561 --> 00:34:12.500
This might not have been the best to choose because you can see the columns have

540
00:34:12.501 --> 00:34:15.440
been reintroduced in the interior of Santa Sabina.

541
00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:19.460
But if you think those columns away and just look at the way in which the apps

542
00:34:19.461 --> 00:34:21.350
is designed with the rounded windows,

543
00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:24.200
the same rounded windows in the upper story up here,

544
00:34:24.201 --> 00:34:28.880
I think that you can see how much it owes a to buildings like the outlaw

545
00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:29.923
Palatino

546
00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.260
a domed roof,
excuse me,

547
00:34:36.261 --> 00:34:40.880
round the round dome building type.
Just like the Basilican type,
uh,

548
00:34:40.881 --> 00:34:44.900
was to be very important in the constant Tinian period.
Uh,

549
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.220
and also in later times.
Uh,
and I show you,

550
00:34:49.221 --> 00:34:53.720
I remind you of some of the important domed rooms that we've looked at in the

551
00:34:53.721 --> 00:34:58.721
course of this semester at the frigate Doriam at the stobby and Baz upon pay at

552
00:34:59.691 --> 00:35:04.610
the temple of Mercury from the spa at via the so called Temple of Mercury,

553
00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:05.670
the uh,

554
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:10.670
the octagonal room of Nero's Domus area and the Dome of the Pantheon here on the

555
00:35:12.231 --> 00:35:16.310
far right there is no more important form in Roman architecture.

556
00:35:16.311 --> 00:35:21.130
Then the Dome Groom,
very characteristic of the Romans,
uh,
and uh,

557
00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:21.460
a,

558
00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:26.460
a special gift that they passed on a to posterity as you well know.

559
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:30.350
And this,
this type of building began to be explored,

560
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:33.980
continued to be explored in the constant Tinian period.

561
00:35:33.981 --> 00:35:36.770
I could show you several examples,
but I've chosen,
uh,

562
00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.030
to show you just one of those.

563
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.830
And it's the one that you now see on the screen and plan a plan from Ward

564
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:44.340
Perkins.

565
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:48.870
This is the so called Temple of Minerva Medica in Rome,

566
00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:52.920
a,
it's not a temple at all,
at dates to the early fourth century,

567
00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:57.660
a d it's not a temple,
but what it was was a pavilion in the garden.

568
00:35:57.661 --> 00:36:01.570
We know that an emperor of the third century,
a d,
uh,

569
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:05.580
by the name of Galley Anus,
g a,
l,
l,
I,
e,
n,

570
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.880
u s godliness,
uh,

571
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:12.890
was responsible for building some imperial gardens in the third century ID.

572
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.550
So this was another actually,
you know,

573
00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:19.530
actually this was another project that did happen in the third century,

574
00:36:19.531 --> 00:36:21.570
a day,
the building of some imperial gardens,

575
00:36:21.571 --> 00:36:25.940
but the enjoyment of the emperors and of the imperial family.
Uh,

576
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:30.480
and it was in these gardens that were created in the third century that this

577
00:36:30.481 --> 00:36:35.070
pavilion was added during the constant Tinian period in the early fourth

578
00:36:35.071 --> 00:36:35.671
century,

579
00:36:35.671 --> 00:36:40.671
a d and I show you a plan of that temple that so called Temple of Minerva

580
00:36:41.371 --> 00:36:46.320
medical,
or this pavilion in the,
uh,
the so called Lice Sydney and lic.

581
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.120
I,
l.
I,
c.
I,
n.

582
00:36:48.121 --> 00:36:53.100
I a n the Lice Sinthian gardens as a commissioned by a galley anus,

583
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:55.440
the lice Indian gardens.
And we see it here.

584
00:36:55.441 --> 00:36:59.400
And it's very interesting because although it clearly I said it's a building

585
00:36:59.401 --> 00:37:03.180
made out of concrete faced with brick and although it clearly is based on some

586
00:37:03.181 --> 00:37:04.830
of the buildings that I just showed you,

587
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:09.840
the round of the typical round structure with Oculus,
the frigging Daria,

588
00:37:09.841 --> 00:37:14.370
the spa,
the octagonal room,
and the Pantheon,
uh,

589
00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:18.260
you can see that the architects of this period was still able to innovate,
uh,

590
00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:22.590
and have gone further by creating,
not around building,

591
00:37:22.591 --> 00:37:26.160
although at first it looks round or an octagonal building,

592
00:37:26.161 --> 00:37:30.380
but a decagon all building a 10 sided building.
Uh,

593
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:33.780
and you can see 10,
you can see radiating apps is nine.

594
00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:38.040
And then the entrance way over here.
Uh,
so 10 sided structure.

595
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:43.140
If you look very carefully at the plan,
you will notice though that the,
um,

596
00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:47.790
that the upper most apps,
the one that is located directly across from the,

597
00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:52.740
from the entrance way as a tiny bit larger than the others.

598
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.090
Uh,
so that gives the building a little bit,

599
00:37:57.091 --> 00:38:00.150
even though it's around building a little bit of a,

600
00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:04.080
of a longitudinal access,
which is very interesting,

601
00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:08.630
is the incorporation of the longitudinal axis into a round structure.
Uh,

602
00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:13.620
you can also see the way in which the radiating apps is the two on either side

603
00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.710
left and right,
are screened by columns,
uh,

604
00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:20.040
in a way that we've also become accustomed to.
Uh,

605
00:38:20.041 --> 00:38:23.070
and I believe that those columns,
yes,

606
00:38:23.071 --> 00:38:27.570
I'm pretty sure that those columns have a triple occupation up above.

607
00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.030
Uh,
so that,
yeah,
you can see that in plan.

608
00:38:30.031 --> 00:38:34.530
A typical triple occupation above,
uh,

609
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:37.450
that we've seen also is characteristic of,

610
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:42.760
of late Roman architecture.
Not only in the Po,
the private sphere is,

611
00:38:42.761 --> 00:38:45.910
this is,
but also in the more public sphere.
Uh,

612
00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:48.370
but going back to that longitudinal axis,

613
00:38:48.371 --> 00:38:51.280
look also at the entrance vestibule.

614
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:55.260
This is another one of these north Texas.
This pross,
uh,

615
00:38:55.270 --> 00:39:00.070
this transverse vestibule in this case with apps is on either end that is

616
00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:02.570
characteristic of these,
uh,
uh,

617
00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:07.170
these early fourth century Aidy,
Roman Pagan,
Roman buildings.
Uh,

618
00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.750
but it's going to become a hallmark of Christian architecture,

619
00:39:10.751 --> 00:39:14.920
not only basilican architecture that is churches in the form of Basilicas,

620
00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:20.050
but a small,
uh,
religious structures,
uh,
in that are done,

621
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.330
that are circular in general plan.

622
00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:26.840
So a very interesting plan in that regard and a very innovative plan,
uh,

623
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:31.150
in the early fourth century.
A d the building is still preserved.

624
00:39:31.151 --> 00:39:34.140
I can show it to you.
Uh,
it dates of Sec,

625
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.330
I can show you the outside as well as some details of the inside of the building

626
00:39:37.331 --> 00:39:41.920
as you see here.
Uh,
this,
it was made out of concrete,
faced with brick.

627
00:39:41.921 --> 00:39:43.150
As I mentioned before,

628
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:47.720
we are looking at the interior up toward the dome.
Uh,

629
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:52.270
you can see something very interesting here,
which is the addition of ribbed,

630
00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:56.950
uh,
of bricks to create ribs in the dome.
To give it a,

631
00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.780
something of a sense of a segmented dome,
which is,
uh,

632
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:05.800
a building technique that we see sometimes in late Roman architecture.
Uh,

633
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.860
and you can also see,
although it looks like it has an Oculus,

634
00:40:08.861 --> 00:40:11.620
that's just because the most of the roof is falling in.

635
00:40:11.621 --> 00:40:14.020
It did not have an oculus.
Instead,

636
00:40:14.021 --> 00:40:19.021
the lighting was provided through these round headed windows that we see very

637
00:40:19.661 --> 00:40:23.710
large rounded windows at the base of the dome.
So again,

638
00:40:23.711 --> 00:40:28.711
this move away in late antiquity from the Oculus to using these very large

639
00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:32.410
rounded windows to light the interior of the building.

640
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:37.090
And this is a view of the so called Temple of nerve a Medica as it looks today

641
00:40:37.091 --> 00:40:41.230
from the outside where you can see those same round headed buildings where you

642
00:40:41.231 --> 00:40:44.560
can see those same sort of peers I've been,

643
00:40:44.561 --> 00:40:49.180
are not so different from the ones that we saw at trior used rather than,
uh,

644
00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:51.940
columns,
uh,
to decorate the structure.

645
00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:57.100
A large round had a doorway down here.
You can see the scale.

646
00:40:57.101 --> 00:41:01.810
This is a pretty big pavilion in a garden you can see at scale in relationship

647
00:41:01.811 --> 00:41:03.520
to the cars that surround it.

648
00:41:03.521 --> 00:41:08.521
So continued innovation in round architecture under Constantine,

649
00:41:09.251 --> 00:41:13.750
the great,
uh,
and a building type that is going to have a long history,

650
00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:18.720
uh,
in the medieval period and the Byzantine period and well beyond.
Uh,

651
00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:23.770
I show you just one example of the impact that it had on later church

652
00:41:23.771 --> 00:41:28.510
architecture.
This is the Church of San Vitali,
very famous church in Ravenna,

653
00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:32.110
Italy.
That was,
uh,
that,
that honors,
uh,

654
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.060
Justinian and the famous Justinian and Theodora.

655
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:37.700
It was built in the sixth century a d.

656
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:42.590
And I think you can see by looking at a view of the exterior of plan and also a

657
00:41:42.591 --> 00:41:44.210
view of the interior,
uh,

658
00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:49.211
how important architectural experiments under the Romans were four buildings

659
00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:53.480
like this,
the massing of the outside,
the geometry,

660
00:41:53.481 --> 00:41:56.870
the interest in geometry is simple forms,
rounded windows.

661
00:41:56.871 --> 00:42:01.871
So similar to the aesthetic that we saw on the Korea or in the basilica at Tria,

662
00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:06.380
the plan above,
in this case,
uh,
an octagon,

663
00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:11.360
a with a central area with radiating [inaudible] very similar to the sorts of

664
00:42:11.361 --> 00:42:13.460
things that we see not just in the dome is salary,

665
00:42:13.461 --> 00:42:15.920
but also in the temple of Minerva Medica.

666
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:20.660
And you can see the Narthex here just as we saw it in the temple of Minerva

667
00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:24.260
Medica.
Uh,
and you can see in this view of the interior,
for example,

668
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:28.520
the triple r arches on top of the two columns.

669
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:32.750
All of these motifs taken over clearly from Roman architecture,

670
00:42:32.751 --> 00:42:37.751
ancient Roman architecture and exploited in the medieval and Byzantine periods.

671
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:44.360
The single most important building that I am going to show you today,

672
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:47.480
uh,
is the one that I want to turn to now.

673
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:52.510
And this is the so called a basilica Nova or the basilica of Maxentius

674
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:54.590
Constantine.

675
00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:59.590
I can't overemphasize the significance of this import of this incredible

676
00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:01.720
building.
Uh,

677
00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:06.770
it is a building that demonstrates to us that Constantine not only completed

678
00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.650
commissions that had been begun by his father,

679
00:43:09.651 --> 00:43:13.820
such as the palace at Trivia and the Porta Negro,
uh,

680
00:43:13.821 --> 00:43:16.490
but also by other tech products.

681
00:43:16.491 --> 00:43:19.460
And in this case by his rival Maxentius.

682
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.220
We know that this building was begun by Max inches,

683
00:43:22.221 --> 00:43:27.221
which is why it is sometimes referred to as the basilica of Maxentius Dash

684
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:30.050
Constantine,
or more easily the Basilica Nova.

685
00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:35.030
It was begun by Max inches in 306,

686
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:40.510
a d when Constantine was victorious over Max Sanchez at the battle of the mill

687
00:43:41.571 --> 00:43:46.130
vion bridge.
He took it over and he completed it in his own name.

688
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:51.120
Uh,
the,
so hence the basilica of Maxentius Constantine or again,

689
00:43:51.121 --> 00:43:55.310
more more easily the Basilica Nova.
Now let me show you where it is.

690
00:43:55.311 --> 00:43:56.360
And by so doing,

691
00:43:56.361 --> 00:44:00.740
it takes us back to a Google earth image that we've looked at time and again in

692
00:44:00.741 --> 00:44:01.730
the course of the semester.

693
00:44:01.731 --> 00:44:04.470
And I suppose in the last lecture it's very appropriate,
uh,

694
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:07.720
to go back to this particular aerial view,
uh,

695
00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:11.270
to remind ourselves of everything we've covered in the center of Rome.

696
00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.740
Just reminding you.
Of course,
the,
uh,
the circus maximus up here,

697
00:44:15.741 --> 00:44:17.000
the Palatine hill,

698
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:22.030
originally with the Hudson Romulus and later with the palace of Demission,

699
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:24.580
uh,
the,
the,
uh,

700
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:28.580
Capitol Line Hill over here as we designed by Michelangelo,

701
00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.520
the wedding cake of Victor Emmanuel down here,

702
00:44:32.521 --> 00:44:37.290
the via De 40 and periodically,
the imperial fora with the forum of Trajan.
Uh,

703
00:44:37.291 --> 00:44:40.620
the area that was built up by Diocletian,

704
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:43.580
or one of the areas is the area over here,
uh,

705
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:48.360
which is where we see the Korea,
which was restored by Diocletian.

706
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.810
And also,
uh,

707
00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:54.720
the five column monument are located on this side closest to the capital line

708
00:44:54.721 --> 00:44:55.410
hill.

709
00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:59.550
But Max sensuous was particularly interested in the area of the upper most area,

710
00:44:59.551 --> 00:45:03.900
closer to the coliseum.
If you look right under the coliseum,

711
00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:07.140
you can see the remains of the temple of Venus and Roma,

712
00:45:07.141 --> 00:45:11.360
which we looked at earlier in the semester,
a temple of Venus and Roma.

713
00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:14.700
That was the Greek import that Hadrian,
uh,
built,
uh,

714
00:45:14.701 --> 00:45:19.020
and may have designed himself in Rome.
And it was that,

715
00:45:19.021 --> 00:45:22.240
and I mentioned this at the time,
but you may have forgotten by now,
uh,

716
00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.790
that at the time that,
that Max sent,

717
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:27.490
that the building burned down in a fire.

718
00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:30.480
I remember that fire of two 83 that destroyed the,

719
00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:35.460
the destroyed the Korea also destroyed part of the temple of Venus and Roma.

720
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:38.660
And it was rebuilt by Max,
sensuous,
by Max,

721
00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:43.770
just by the tetrarch Max senses he built,
he rebuilt,
uh,
the,

722
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:48.250
uh,
the temple of Venus and Roma,
and do recall the niche that is well preserved,

723
00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.590
uh,
with his rebuilding.

724
00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:54.980
So it is not surprising to see him choosing the location right next store right

725
00:45:55.111 --> 00:46:00.111
underneath the temple of Venus in Roma for his Basilica Nova in Rome when it

726
00:46:01.141 --> 00:46:04.920
begins to be built and it's still is preserved on that site.
Today,

727
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.420
I show you a panorama,
uh,

728
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:11.370
that includes the Basilica Nova and you see it right here and you can see how

729
00:46:11.371 --> 00:46:15.540
very large a building it is.
And they're only essentially three barrel vaults.

730
00:46:15.541 --> 00:46:18.630
A small part of the building still preserved.
Uh,

731
00:46:18.631 --> 00:46:22.590
but it gives you a sense of its scale when you compare it to some of the other

732
00:46:22.591 --> 00:46:25.860
structures here.
Uh,
but you can see many that we've studied.

733
00:46:25.861 --> 00:46:28.170
You can see the temple of and Tinnitus and Faustina.

734
00:46:28.171 --> 00:46:30.660
You can see the arch of September is severity.

735
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:35.310
So you can see the Korea over here.
You can see the top,
you Laurium,
uh,

736
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.890
and the,
uh,
the Michelangelo,
uh,

737
00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:41.430
Pr Palazzo that was built into that.

738
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:44.250
You can see the victor of manual monument over there.

739
00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.980
And you can see on this side the arch of Titus,

740
00:46:46.981 --> 00:46:50.070
the remains of the temple of Venus and Roma and so on.

741
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.970
So a very large building in the midst of an area that [inaudible] was

742
00:46:53.971 --> 00:46:58.290
particularly interested in restoring.
Here's a view of the,

743
00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:02.820
of the Basilica Nova as it looks today.
It's taken from the side,

744
00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:07.010
the other side that with the,
with ones back to the Palatine Hill.
Uh,

745
00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:10.530
and we can see here that it is a building made out of brick.

746
00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.740
It is it out of concrete.
Excuse me.
Faced with brick,

747
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:19.400
we can see that the artists are better than ever at d materializing the

748
00:47:19.711 --> 00:47:23.580
architects and designers better than ever at d materializing the wall.

749
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:28.530
They have used very large round headed windows here on two stories.

750
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:33.820
There's more window,
then there's wall.
That's how good they become at,
um,
at,

751
00:47:33.821 --> 00:47:37.270
at manipulating the brick face,
concrete medium.

752
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:39.850
You see it in this wall over here as well.

753
00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:44.920
And you see these three giant barrel vaults was soaring vaults are very

754
00:47:44.921 --> 00:47:48.280
impressive work of architecture.

755
00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:51.150
Let me show you a restored view,
uh,

756
00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:55.120
of what the Basilica Nova would have looked like in its heyday.

757
00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:59.680
And then let me say a little bit more about what happens when Constantine takes

758
00:47:59.681 --> 00:48:02.710
over a construction of this particular building.

759
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:04.840
This restored view is very,

760
00:48:04.841 --> 00:48:08.500
very interesting because it shows us that although this building was used

761
00:48:08.501 --> 00:48:13.250
without question as a basilica,
that was its purpose of basilica.
Uh,

762
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:18.270
we will see that it is unlike we see here that is unlike any basilica that we

763
00:48:18.461 --> 00:48:22.720
have seen in the course of the semester.
And I wonder as you look at this,

764
00:48:22.721 --> 00:48:26.340
whether you can tell me if it's not,
it's not built like a customer per se.

765
00:48:26.341 --> 00:48:30.370
It doesn't look like the Basilica Olympia in Roma doesn't look like the basilica

766
00:48:30.371 --> 00:48:33.790
at trigger,
but it does look like what other kind of building

767
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:39.170
that we've seen time and again in the course of the semester.

768
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:43.040
Look at the vaulting,
look at the barrel vaults on either side,

769
00:48:43.041 --> 00:48:45.350
look at the shape of the windows in the upper tier.

770
00:48:45.351 --> 00:48:50.351
Look at the shape of the exterior of the building that is created by the choice

771
00:48:50.361 --> 00:48:52.220
of vaulting.
What does this look like

772
00:48:55.430 --> 00:49:00.320
if not a basilica?
Someone said a market.

773
00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:04.880
Yes,
which,
yes,
who said bad structure?
That's the answer.

774
00:49:04.881 --> 00:49:09.710
Which part of a of a typical Roman imperial bath does this look like?

775
00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:12.470
The frigate Darian,

776
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:17.530
the frigging door and the freezer door and the great large rectangular space

777
00:49:18.531 --> 00:49:23.531
with a triple groin vaulted roof with windows that are usually divided into

778
00:49:23.991 --> 00:49:26.630
three parts on the upper most part.

779
00:49:26.631 --> 00:49:29.450
And then buttressed by great barrel vaulted chambers.

780
00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:33.860
This is a basilica that is built in the form of a frigging Doriam.

781
00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.620
That's an awfully creative thing to do.
It shows us,

782
00:49:36.621 --> 00:49:40.970
once again this interest in the interchangeability of form that you can take a

783
00:49:40.971 --> 00:49:45.440
plan that was used for one kind of building and use it for another as they have

784
00:49:45.441 --> 00:49:50.441
done so effectively here using a frigging Dari and plan for a basilica,

785
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:51.350
uh,

786
00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:56.350
and capitalizing on that to make it work in this environment as well.

787
00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:00.410
So some very creative minds,
I think at work in the time of Max inches.

788
00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:04.090
And in the time of Constantine when the building was first designed for

789
00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:04.880
[inaudible],

790
00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:09.520
the idea was to have the entrance way on the uh,

791
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:12.500
eastern part of the building,
the eastern part of the building,

792
00:50:12.501 --> 00:50:17.060
the part of the building that faces the Colosseum and uh,

793
00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:22.120
to enter into it that way and to have the main apps be over here on,

794
00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:23.480
uh,

795
00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:28.480
the western end of the structure to give it a focus and the kind of focus one

796
00:50:29.541 --> 00:50:33.110
would have seen in a typical Frigidaire ium as well as in a typical basilica.

797
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:37.700
Constantine comes in and takes it over and decides he wants to change the

798
00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:42.530
orientation.
He wants the entrance way not to be closest to the Colosseum,

799
00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:47.690
uh,
but rather to the Roman forum and to the sacred way.
And to the Veolia,

800
00:50:47.691 --> 00:50:52.490
which is on the part on which this was built to the arch of Titus and he and he,

801
00:50:52.491 --> 00:50:57.491
and he instructs his architects to change the orientation from an east west

802
00:50:57.621 --> 00:51:02.420
orientation to a north south orientation and to place the entrance way on the

803
00:51:02.421 --> 00:51:04.820
forum side on the south.

804
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:07.940
You also instructs them to put four columns here.

805
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:10.400
And these columns are made out of porphyry,

806
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:14.930
that purplish stone that's quarried in Egypt and that was used so extensively

807
00:51:14.931 --> 00:51:19.280
for tetrarch it art to torque portraiture.
We see that here.

808
00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:23.990
Then he's very tempted to change the orientation of the niche to instead of,

809
00:51:23.991 --> 00:51:25.880
to put his portrait is Max [inaudible].

810
00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:29.870
Max Engines intended to put his portrait in this his own partner that is of Max

811
00:51:29.871 --> 00:51:31.980
inches in this apps.
Uh,

812
00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:37.090
Constantine was probably attempted to put his own portrait in this apps over

813
00:51:37.821 --> 00:51:41.060
here on the northern side so that it would be the first thing that you saw when

814
00:51:41.061 --> 00:51:41.894
you came in.

815
00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:46.730
But he resisted that temptation and decided to leave or to place a seated

816
00:51:46.731 --> 00:51:51.500
portrait of himself in this niche.
Leave it where Maxentius intended it.

817
00:51:51.501 --> 00:51:55.130
So you would have to enter the building and take an abrupt left,
uh,

818
00:51:55.131 --> 00:51:58.910
to see that statue.
But we think we're not absolutely sure.

819
00:51:58.911 --> 00:52:02.840
We think he may also have put another statute of themselves,
in this case,

820
00:52:02.841 --> 00:52:05.690
a standing statue in this niche.
But as we'll see,

821
00:52:05.691 --> 00:52:09.820
there are lots of niches in the wall of the,
of the northern end.
Uh,

822
00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:13.610
and we think that there were statues of all of his lieutenants are the

823
00:52:13.611 --> 00:52:16.800
lieutenants that had helped him when his great battle,
uh,

824
00:52:16.801 --> 00:52:21.620
at the Milby and bridge that we're located in this niche.
So,
and he,

825
00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:24.860
so he may have been shown,
they're surrounded by his most,

826
00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:28.220
his most worthy and his most loyal lieutenants.

827
00:52:28.221 --> 00:52:32.120
And then another statue of him seated in the niche over here.

828
00:52:32.121 --> 00:52:36.680
So we see him again.
The most important thing is he shifts the orientation,

829
00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:39.470
another restored view,
which perhaps in color,

830
00:52:39.471 --> 00:52:43.160
which perhaps gives you a better sense of the majesty of this particular

831
00:52:43.161 --> 00:52:45.860
building in its time.
Uh,
the entrance,

832
00:52:45.861 --> 00:52:49.010
the constant Tinian entrance way through the porphyry columns,

833
00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:52.520
through the doorways into the main body of the structure,

834
00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:57.680
the same kind of marble pavements with a Maroon and green and white,

835
00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:02.480
uh,
that we've seen in so many other buildings use tier marble revetment on the

836
00:53:02.481 --> 00:53:03.314
wall.

837
00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:07.010
You can get a sense of the groin vaults and the way in which they were probably

838
00:53:07.011 --> 00:53:10.820
also decorated either with painting.
And stucco or maybe even mosaic,

839
00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:15.260
the great coffered ceilings of the barrel vaults and look at the way in which

840
00:53:15.261 --> 00:53:17.150
they've created a lateral,

841
00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:20.690
a entrance arched entrance ways in each of these peers,
uh,

842
00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:24.910
to create a greater flow of space just as you would see in a typical frigging

843
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.880
eum.
Uh,
and then again,

844
00:53:26.881 --> 00:53:31.140
this opening up of this very impressive opening up of the walls with these

845
00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:36.141
exceedingly large around headed windows that allow again light to stream into

846
00:53:37.051 --> 00:53:41.940
the structure,
a real tour de force of Roman architecture.
In my opinion,

847
00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:46.890
one of the greatest buildings ever built,
uh,
by Roman architects.

848
00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:51.360
Believe it or not,
we have the portrait of Constantine us still preserved.

849
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:53.970
And I can show it to your,
at least bits and pieces of it,

850
00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:57.330
a fairly significant number of bits and pieces,
including the head,

851
00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:59.100
which I show you here,

852
00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:04.140
which is now on view in the courtyard of the Conservatory Palace.
One of the,

853
00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:08.910
uh,
one of the palaces on the Capitoline hill that belongs to the capital on

854
00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:13.950
museums.
We see Constantine here and you can see how similar he is too,

855
00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:18.951
that a transformed portrait that showed him as a neo Augustus with a neo Trey

856
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:24.230
Janick hairstyle beardless very clean shave and a very large eyes,

857
00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:28.590
but very much in the mode of the earlier emperors,

858
00:54:28.591 --> 00:54:30.600
Augustus and uh,

859
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:34.230
and Trajan rather than in the mode of the tetrarchy.

860
00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:37.890
And yet a very abstract geometric image,

861
00:54:37.891 --> 00:54:42.180
very much in keeping with tetrarch and constant Tinian art in that regard.

862
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.550
And truly colossal in scale.

863
00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:49.350
We have a lot of the body parts that are also preserved in that same courtyard

864
00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:50.670
from this same statue,

865
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.960
including the Shin of the leg from the knee down the knee itself,

866
00:54:54.961 --> 00:54:59.961
and the way in which the knee is depicted tells us that the knee was bent and

867
00:55:00.511 --> 00:55:01.261
the consequently,

868
00:55:01.261 --> 00:55:05.610
this did indeed come from a seated statue of Constantine,

869
00:55:05.611 --> 00:55:09.030
that statue that would have been in that left hand niche.
Uh,

870
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:14.090
we also see the famous hand from the statue as well as part of an arm.

871
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:19.050
And the arm is very impressive because if you look at it carefully,

872
00:55:19.051 --> 00:55:23.280
you will see that the musculature is very clearly delineated.
Uh,

873
00:55:23.281 --> 00:55:27.780
and you can even see the veins of the arms showing through the skin,

874
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:32.790
which shows you how adept artists still were,
uh,
during this time period.

875
00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:37.530
These are right out in the courtyard of the Conservatory Palace.
Uh,
everybody,

876
00:55:37.531 --> 00:55:37.980
this heart,

877
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.940
there's no tourists with a camera who goes by here without taking a photograph

878
00:55:41.941 --> 00:55:46.620
in front of it,
including yours.
Truly,
I've done that.
I'm absolutely incapable.

879
00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:51.650
I decide I'm totally incapable of going into this Piatsa and not taking a

880
00:55:51.871 --> 00:55:55.370
picture either of whoever I'm with or them of me.
Uh,

881
00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.810
and I have tons of these from,
you know,

882
00:55:57.811 --> 00:56:01.950
years and years of posing in front of this is a pretty good Mediterranean Tan,

883
00:56:01.951 --> 00:56:05.700
I must say.
And this not,
uh,
but,
but,
you know,
posing with these,

884
00:56:05.701 --> 00:56:10.320
with these hands and,
uh,
and feet and so on.
This is my son Alex,

885
00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:15.420
posing on the foot.
Uh,
as you can see here.
Uh,

886
00:56:15.421 --> 00:56:19.510
so you know,
one,
one can't,
can't,
and you can,
you can only imagine.
I mean,
I,

887
00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:22.800
I imitate the exact gesture up there and this image,

888
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:27.310
but you can only imagine the kinds of photographs that are taken in front of

889
00:56:27.311 --> 00:56:31.840
that hand.
Uh,
and um,
uh,
you know,
as,
as Toro tourist after,

890
00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:34.580
if you can find these actually on,
if you go on Google images,

891
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:39.460
you can find them quite readily out there.
Um,
so,
uh,

892
00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:42.670
if you do go,
this isn't one of those other places and I hope if any,

893
00:56:42.671 --> 00:56:45.070
have you traveled there and feel the,
uh,

894
00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:47.830
the [inaudible] and inspiration,

895
00:56:47.831 --> 00:56:51.370
so moves you to take a picture of yourself and send it to me.
I'd love to see it.

896
00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:52.331
At any rate,

897
00:56:52.331 --> 00:56:55.450
if you put all of those pieces together and they're actually two feet preserved,

898
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.300
two feet,
the Shin,
the knee part of the chest,

899
00:56:58.301 --> 00:57:00.220
which we also have that arm that I showed you,

900
00:57:00.221 --> 00:57:04.630
the hand and the infamous hand and the head of Constantine,

901
00:57:04.631 --> 00:57:09.130
this is what you get a seat.
It statute 30 feet tall.
You've got a big building,

902
00:57:09.131 --> 00:57:11.650
you need a big statue,
30 feet tall,
uh,

903
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:14.560
that sat in the main niche,

904
00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:19.590
that niche to the left as you entered into the basilica of Maxentius Constantine

905
00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:24.310
from the Roman forum.
Here's another picture of me,

906
00:57:24.311 --> 00:57:26.590
although you can barely see me,
this was taken.

907
00:57:26.591 --> 00:57:30.490
It's amazing that I was able to take this picture at one point with no one else

908
00:57:30.491 --> 00:57:33.340
in it,
uh,
because the forum is usually so crowded.

909
00:57:33.341 --> 00:57:38.341
But here I am standing with my back to us looking at the Basilica Nova and uh,

910
00:57:39.911 --> 00:57:44.911
you can see how vast the great barrel vaults of the Basilica Nova are.

911
00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:50.730
There are scholars who argue that Roman architecture declined in late antiquity

912
00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:54.880
and not only architecture,
but painting and sculpture as well.

913
00:57:54.881 --> 00:57:56.560
And one could make an argument.

914
00:57:56.561 --> 00:58:00.220
I believe that Roman painting and sculpture did decline.

915
00:58:00.221 --> 00:58:04.390
I'm not saying I necessarily agree that they did because art can sometimes

916
00:58:04.391 --> 00:58:05.330
change,
uh,

917
00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:09.280
for reasons that have to do with trying to articulate a different message than

918
00:58:09.281 --> 00:58:11.020
you've tried to articulate before.

919
00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.600
And a new style may be more appropriate for that.

920
00:58:13.601 --> 00:58:16.360
Then the style that you've been using up to that point.

921
00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:19.960
So I think it's a very complex matter when you think about whether it style,

922
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:22.930
whether,
whether aren't declines or not,
but I,

923
00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:25.960
but I will go so far as to say without going into it in great detail,

924
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:28.960
although I'll say a little bit more about it momentarily when we look at the

925
00:58:28.961 --> 00:58:32.980
arch of Constantine,
but without saying whether I believe that Roman art,

926
00:58:32.981 --> 00:58:34.570
a sculpture or a painting declines.

927
00:58:34.571 --> 00:58:39.571
I want to say categorically that I do not believe a that Roman architecture

928
00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:43.300
declines.
And I think a building like this is a case in point,

929
00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:46.720
this in my opinion is again one of the greatest buildings.

930
00:58:46.721 --> 00:58:48.220
If you compare this to the coliseum,

931
00:58:48.221 --> 00:58:51.780
if you compare this even to this sacred Pantheon,
uh,

932
00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:55.210
if you compare this to some of the bath buildings that we've talked about,

933
00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:58.570
as impressive as they are,
I think this takes its place.

934
00:58:58.570 --> 00:59:03.100
The Basilica Nova takes its place among the most impressive works of

935
00:59:03.101 --> 00:59:06.220
architecture that were left to us by the Romans.

936
00:59:06.221 --> 00:59:09.550
And I think you can see what I mean just by looking at this image.

937
00:59:09.551 --> 00:59:14.530
Because to still be able to create these kinds of soaring vaults out of

938
00:59:14.531 --> 00:59:16.810
concrete,
to face them with brick,

939
00:59:16.811 --> 00:59:21.811
to create a windows that are large enough to essentially dematerialize the wall

940
00:59:21.951 --> 00:59:26.690
and the building still stands,
uh,
and still stands today.
The soaring vaults,

941
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:31.850
those soaring rib bolts or groin vaults that we see in the center of the space

942
00:59:31.851 --> 00:59:36.500
to do that at this kind of scale is an incredible architectural feat.

943
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:41.300
I don't think there's any way that one can say that architecture declines during

944
00:59:41.301 --> 00:59:43.460
this period when,
when looks at a building like this.

945
00:59:43.461 --> 00:59:46.320
And also keep in mind how creative they've been,

946
00:59:46.321 --> 00:59:50.520
that at this point in time they've decided,
uh,
to,
to create a bill,

947
00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:55.700
a basilica in the form of a frigging Darian from atypical imperial bath.

948
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:57.890
That's a very creative thing to do.

949
00:59:57.891 --> 01:00:01.310
And I think it couldn't have happened were it not that architect,

950
01:00:01.311 --> 01:00:04.460
the creative juices were not continuing to flow,
uh,

951
01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:09.490
for architects and artisans working on major projects like these in the time of

952
01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:11.330
Constantine the great,

953
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:16.850
I want to turn from the Basilica Nova to the arch of Constantine,

954
01:00:16.851 --> 01:00:21.740
which is the last ancient monument that I'm going to show you this semester.

955
01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:22.460
Uh,

956
01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:27.460
the arch of Constantine was constructed by Constantine to celebrate his victory

957
01:00:27.951 --> 01:00:31.600
over Max Sanchez at the battle of the melody and bridge.
We big,

958
01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:34.970
we think it was begun in 312,

959
01:00:34.971 --> 01:00:38.360
a d and completed in 315.

960
01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.280
And uh,

961
01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:45.310
it is also possible some scholars have suggested that it's conceivable that Max

962
01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.300
Sanchez may have begun this too,

963
01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:52.010
in the same way that he began the Basilica Nova and that Constantine took it

964
01:00:52.011 --> 01:00:54.710
over when he,
uh,
when he,

965
01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:59.150
when he was victorious over Max inches at the battle of the Milby bridge.

966
01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:02.030
We don't know which is the case,
whether he,

967
01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:04.950
it was begun by Mac centers and finished by Constantine,

968
01:01:04.951 --> 01:01:06.890
or whether Constantine began at himself.

969
01:01:06.891 --> 01:01:10.640
I'm more likely to favor the latter that Constantine began at himself,

970
01:01:10.641 --> 01:01:11.480
but we do not know.

971
01:01:11.481 --> 01:01:14.840
And it's something that you should be aware of that particular controversy,

972
01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:20.110
but it's certainly dates to this time period to roughly between 312 and 315 id.

973
01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:24.170
One of the reasons that we believe,
I mean,

974
01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:27.610
one of the reasons that the incontrovertible reason that we know,
uh,

975
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:31.430
that the building was completed by constantly busy inscription tells us it's a

976
01:01:31.431 --> 01:01:35.910
constant Tinian building.
Uh,
but also there are phrases here that depict,
uh,

977
01:01:35.911 --> 01:01:40.190
the battle of the mill vion bridge and other battles from that war.
Uh,

978
01:01:40.191 --> 01:01:44.240
and show us,
of course,
Constantine victorious in those scenes.

979
01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:46.370
It is a triple bade arch,

980
01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:50.780
a very similar in that regard to the arch of Septum you severity and the Roman

981
01:01:50.781 --> 01:01:51.140
forum.

982
01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:55.340
And I don't think there's any question that the general format of it is based on

983
01:01:55.341 --> 01:01:58.640
the arch of Septimius bears in the Roman forum.
It too,

984
01:01:58.641 --> 01:02:01.700
like the arch of Septum Musa severity is covered with sculpture,

985
01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.530
a veritable billboard advertising,
uh,

986
01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:08.990
the achievements of Constantine in,
uh,
this important battle.

987
01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:14.120
And overall,
uh,
but we see that of course,
instead of the,
uh,
the,

988
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:15.050
the panels,

989
01:02:15.051 --> 01:02:20.040
the excerpts as I described them from the columns of Trajan or really us that we

990
01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:23.050
see on the Septum,
the arch of September,

991
01:02:23.051 --> 01:02:26.940
you subareas we see very different kind of sculptural decoration here.

992
01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.130
It does cover the entire arch.

993
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:34.370
And it's interesting primarily because some of it is constant Tinian the parts

994
01:02:34.591 --> 01:02:38.040
that are constant Tinian that were carved during the fourth century are the

995
01:02:38.041 --> 01:02:42.210
spandrels with the victories.
Uh,
the spandrels with the river.

996
01:02:42.211 --> 01:02:46.350
God's very much like the arch of Trajan it Ben event though the great the freeze

997
01:02:46.351 --> 01:02:51.000
that in circles,
the all sides of the monument,
you can see that freeze here.

998
01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:56.340
Uh,
the pedestals of the columns were also carved in the constant Tinian period.

999
01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:56.831
Uh,

1000
01:02:56.831 --> 01:03:01.831
and there are two round Dalles to round frames on either short side of the

1001
01:03:02.011 --> 01:03:07.011
constant Tinian monument that were also done during the constant Tinian period.

1002
01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:11.430
But what's particularly interesting is the fact that all the rest of the

1003
01:03:11.431 --> 01:03:15.180
sculpture a was cobbled together from earlier monuments,

1004
01:03:15.181 --> 01:03:19.080
and it won't surprise you to hear that they were the monuments of the emperor

1005
01:03:19.081 --> 01:03:23.130
Trajan,
the Emperor Hadrian and the emperor of Marcus Aurelius,

1006
01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:28.160
all the men whom Constantine considered the great emperors of the second

1007
01:03:28.381 --> 01:03:28.921
century,

1008
01:03:28.921 --> 01:03:33.921
a d the emperors of the Second Century d with whom he most wanted to connect

1009
01:03:34.471 --> 01:03:35.910
himself.
He read,

1010
01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:40.260
he inserts a sculpture from their monuments into this monument.

1011
01:03:40.261 --> 01:03:44.700
We don't know whether these were monuments that had fallen into disrepair and

1012
01:03:44.701 --> 01:03:46.040
we're lying in shambles,
you know,

1013
01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:51.050
around the city or whether he actually deliberately took apart earlier monuments

1014
01:03:51.691 --> 01:03:54.000
to extract from them.

1015
01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:58.440
The fragments that he wanted also very interesting is the fact that in all of

1016
01:03:58.441 --> 01:04:02.610
these scenes,
uh,
the scenes that are used from earlier monuments,

1017
01:04:02.611 --> 01:04:07.611
he replaces the heads of Trajan Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius with his own

1018
01:04:07.741 --> 01:04:12.450
portrait.
So he in a sense becomes them,
uh,
in this arch.

1019
01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:13.920
I,

1020
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.850
let me show you quickly a diagram which will give you perhaps a better sense of

1021
01:04:17.851 --> 01:04:19.800
all of this.
The tray Janick.

1022
01:04:19.801 --> 01:04:24.060
The material from the tray Janick period includes statues of donations that come

1023
01:04:24.061 --> 01:04:26.670
from the forum of Trajan in Rome,

1024
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:31.910
as well as from two patch panels for panels in fact too that are located on the

1025
01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:36.951
central bay on either side and two that are located on the sides on the attic.

1026
01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.670
In both cases.
Hadrian the round,

1027
01:04:40.671 --> 01:04:44.730
Dell's eight of them on the two long sides of the arch belong to some lost

1028
01:04:44.731 --> 01:04:47.550
hunting monument of Hadrian.
Uh,
the panels,

1029
01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:51.840
the vertical panels that you see in the attic come from an art to lost arch of

1030
01:04:51.841 --> 01:04:56.670
Marcus and real.
Yes.
And as I've already described,
the bases,

1031
01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.130
the spandrels,
uh,

1032
01:04:58.230 --> 01:05:02.670
and the freeze all belonged to the constant Tinian period.

1033
01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.670
I want to show you those very,
very quickly,
uh,

1034
01:05:05.671 --> 01:05:10.671
a panel on the left hand side from the forum of Trajan representing Trajan,

1035
01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:15.120
uh,
returning to Rome after his victory over the dations.

1036
01:05:15.121 --> 01:05:19.420
We think this was a pedestal or a base podium,
uh,

1037
01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:22.180
for the temple,
the Temple of Divine Trajan.

1038
01:05:22.181 --> 01:05:25.210
That was at the end of the forum and built by Hadrian.

1039
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:28.330
We see a couple of the dations over here,
uh,

1040
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:32.350
that come from the arch of the forum of Trajan,

1041
01:05:32.351 --> 01:05:35.890
the second story and the main part of the forum.
And Ben here,

1042
01:05:35.891 --> 01:05:40.120
these vertical panels that we believe come from a law starch and Marcus and

1043
01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:42.070
release.
Here we see that one,

1044
01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:45.970
a part of the constant Tinian freeze with Constantine seeded.

1045
01:05:45.971 --> 01:05:50.290
Now headless in the center here we see the round belts from a lost hunting

1046
01:05:50.291 --> 01:05:54.670
monument.
We believe of Hadrian.
Uh,
you can see a,
a deadline.

1047
01:05:54.671 --> 01:05:57.730
For example,
lying here.
Hadrian has returned from the hunt,

1048
01:05:57.970 --> 01:06:02.970
but the head of Hadrian recarved as ahead of Constantine and another scene over

1049
01:06:03.131 --> 01:06:06.700
here,
a sacrifice to Hercules,
uh,

1050
01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:10.810
as to who is floating in the upper most part of Bob.
But again,

1051
01:06:10.811 --> 01:06:15.040
the main thing for us is just that this comes from a Hadr Yannick monument is

1052
01:06:15.041 --> 01:06:20.041
reused here so that Constantine can associate himself with these great emperors

1053
01:06:20.321 --> 01:06:21.550
of the fourth century.

1054
01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:26.290
Another detail showing you the dations from the forum of Trajan as well as these

1055
01:06:26.291 --> 01:06:31.291
panels from this lost arch of Marcus really is probably originally dating to the

1056
01:06:31.541 --> 01:06:36.090
one seventies to one 80 had
a,

1057
01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:41.200
the what you see here are the spandrels with victories and a victory in the base

1058
01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:45.070
victories triumphant over a barbarian who kneels at her feet.

1059
01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:46.750
And if you look at these scenes,

1060
01:06:47.050 --> 01:06:50.890
if you look at these very carefully and you compare them to the little bit of

1061
01:06:50.891 --> 01:06:53.560
Roman sculpture that we've looked at in the course of the semester,

1062
01:06:53.561 --> 01:06:55.540
think of the our pockets for example.

1063
01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:00.790
When you think back to that and you look at these figures,
one could,
one could,

1064
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:06.130
uh,
agree with the contention that this is not as good as it once was.

1065
01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.960
If you look at this figure of the Doughy,
uh,
season boy,

1066
01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:14.560
boy who's representing a season down here or this figure of the victory who was

1067
01:07:14.561 --> 01:07:19.030
not depicted a with the same finesse that we see the victory writing on the

1068
01:07:19.031 --> 01:07:23.170
shield on the column of Trajan,
I think a case can be made,
uh,

1069
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:28.270
that this is not as as well rendered as it was once upon a time.

1070
01:07:28.451 --> 01:07:31.930
You can see that in the river God and you can definitely see it in this scene

1071
01:07:31.931 --> 01:07:36.740
here.
This is a scene from the constant Tinian freeze,
uh,
depicting the,
um,

1072
01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:40.540
depicting the siege of the city of Verona.

1073
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:44.110
Very similar to that siege scene we saw on the column of Trajan with the

1074
01:07:44.111 --> 01:07:47.680
battering Ram.
And I think you can see as you look at these figures,

1075
01:07:47.681 --> 01:07:52.130
they are much more awkward in their emotions.
Look at these three over here.
Uh,

1076
01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:53.590
with the shields and the spheres,

1077
01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:57.250
they are exactly the same as if they were stamped out of a cookie cutter.

1078
01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:02.110
You don't see the artist taking the time to create distinction between them.

1079
01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:06.580
As you would see on the south freeze,
for example,
of the Arra pacas again,

1080
01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:08.870
there may be a,
there's a different visit,
different,

1081
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:12.790
they have the different thoughts behind this of what they're trying to achieve.

1082
01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:17.690
And it may be that this different style better for what they've been trying to

1083
01:08:17.691 --> 01:08:20.220
achieve.
We've talked about this move toward,
uh,

1084
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:25.010
toward abstraction and toward a geometry and so on.
But,

1085
01:08:25.011 --> 01:08:28.910
so I,
I'm,
it's not that I'm talking about this in a denigrating way.

1086
01:08:28.911 --> 01:08:33.580
I'm saying that it could be chosen for a different reason.
Tu Tu Tu,

1087
01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:36.530
Tu Tu.
It helps them,

1088
01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.400
it helps them present their case in a better way.
But I don't,

1089
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:45.290
I think it's undeniable that it isn't as fine in quality as what we saw before.

1090
01:08:45.690 --> 01:08:46.610
And we see here,

1091
01:08:46.611 --> 01:08:51.611
this scene of Constantine on the roster and the Roman forum addressing the

1092
01:08:51.831 --> 01:08:54.740
people.
He's got the five column monument behind him.

1093
01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:58.340
But look at these statutes on either side seeded statutes.

1094
01:08:58.341 --> 01:09:02.210
We can identify them by their portraits of Hadrian and,
uh,

1095
01:09:02.211 --> 01:09:03.380
Marcus or release,

1096
01:09:03.381 --> 01:09:07.310
which I think demonstrates without any question head of Constantine is gone.

1097
01:09:07.311 --> 01:09:11.030
But he would have been represented with his neo Trey Jana care style in the

1098
01:09:11.031 --> 01:09:16.031
center flanked by Marcus Aurelius and by Hadrian I think that suggest without

1099
01:09:16.551 --> 01:09:21.410
question again that he is deliberately that he has taken these bits and pieces

1100
01:09:21.411 --> 01:09:26.411
of sculpture from other monuments in order to underscore his relationship to

1101
01:09:26.631 --> 01:09:29.360
these great leaders of the pagan past.

1102
01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:31.780
And I want a quote from Bernard Berenson,

1103
01:09:31.790 --> 01:09:35.510
the great art art historian in a book that he wrote called the arch of

1104
01:09:35.511 --> 01:09:40.511
Constantine or the decline of form in 1954 and I quote him as we look at another

1105
01:09:41.871 --> 01:09:43.970
detail from the constant Tinian freeze.

1106
01:09:43.971 --> 01:09:48.890
These stunted bodies are swathed in heavy blankets or covered with scanty

1107
01:09:48.891 --> 01:09:49.724
shifts,

1108
01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:54.860
both with the folds of the drapery as unfunctional as helplessly chiseled as

1109
01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:59.100
ever,
European art sank two in its darkest agent.

1110
01:09:59.101 --> 01:10:03.710
So that is,
that is a very damning,
a point of view.

1111
01:10:03.711 --> 01:10:06.980
Visa Vi this sculpture.
But again,
I think a case can be made,

1112
01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:10.780
but I'd like to say here today that I don't think the same.

1113
01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:11.930
They want to underscore that.

1114
01:10:11.931 --> 01:10:14.930
I don't think the same case can be made for architecture.

1115
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.600
When you look at the buildings that we looked at today,

1116
01:10:17.601 --> 01:10:22.440
the basilica at the Palace of Constancia is Cloris,
uh,

1117
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:24.050
finished by Constantine.

1118
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:28.310
I think you will agree with me that this is a great building and a great

1119
01:10:28.311 --> 01:10:32.030
building.
Again,
rooted in the past looking to the future.
Uh,

1120
01:10:32.031 --> 01:10:35.960
when you look at something like the Tour de Scabby,
which we looked at last time,

1121
01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:38.930
a tomb that is based on the Pantheon in Rome,

1122
01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:43.190
but has the innovation of the porthole windows that we talked about,

1123
01:10:43.191 --> 01:10:47.570
architects still innovating,
still looking to the past,
but still an innovating,

1124
01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:48.171
uh,

1125
01:10:48.171 --> 01:10:53.171
the great baths of Diocletian on the left and of Constantine that we looked at

1126
01:10:53.781 --> 01:10:57.200
today.
Huge baths and the imperial tradition,

1127
01:10:57.201 --> 01:11:01.580
not very different from the bas of Trajan or the baths of Caracalla still is

1128
01:11:01.581 --> 01:11:05.300
great.
They could still build it this scale and they continue to innovate,

1129
01:11:05.301 --> 01:11:10.010
exploring new forms for the call.
Darian in each of these cases,

1130
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:14.670
the Minerva Medica that we talked about today.
Yes.

1131
01:11:14.671 --> 01:11:18.660
And the tradition of round buildings in traditions of the explorations of

1132
01:11:18.661 --> 01:11:22.870
Hadrian at his villa or rebellious on the Palatine Hill.
Uh,

1133
01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:26.820
but about of a grand scale and with new innovations,

1134
01:11:26.821 --> 01:11:29.160
the placement of those windows,

1135
01:11:29.161 --> 01:11:33.240
those rounded windows at the base of the Dome rather than the Oculus,

1136
01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:34.740
the use of a decagon,

1137
01:11:34.741 --> 01:11:39.540
we'll plan innovative new things that haven't happened before.

1138
01:11:39.541 --> 01:11:41.340
So they are looking to the past.

1139
01:11:41.341 --> 01:11:45.900
They are building as well as they usually build a and they are continuing to add

1140
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:50.490
new things.
When we look at,
in fact,
I'm reminded as I think about this,

1141
01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:54.210
a of the two round bells that were put up that were added to the Archie that

1142
01:11:54.211 --> 01:11:55.044
were put up in the,

1143
01:11:55.260 --> 01:12:00.000
that were made in the constant Tinian period for the arch of Constantine.

1144
01:12:00.001 --> 01:12:04.990
And I showed them to you here,
Luna in her,
in her,
in her chariot.
Uh,

1145
01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:10.220
the moon descending a cupid by her side and the personification of the ocean

1146
01:12:12.091 --> 01:12:16.510
Oceana's down below Luna descending and on the other side,
Apollo,

1147
01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:21.560
the Sun God ass ending from the ocean has chariot is going up towards the sky.

1148
01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:26.510
The puto.
The cupid leads the way with a torch just as every,

1149
01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:31.520
just as the moon descends and the sunrise is a civilizations and eras end and

1150
01:12:32.011 --> 01:12:35.340
other civilizations come to take their place.

1151
01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:40.610
And what happened at the very end of ancient Rome is that Constantine founds a

1152
01:12:40.801 --> 01:12:41.551
new capital.

1153
01:12:41.551 --> 01:12:46.050
He founds the city of Constantinople as the capital of the Roman Empire.

1154
01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.230
He does that in 324 a d.

1155
01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:53.900
And he dedicates it,
uh,
as the,
uh,

1156
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:58.860
he dedicates this new city of Constantinople to the god of the Christians on the

1157
01:12:58.861 --> 01:13:01.860
11th of May in 330,

1158
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:04.410
a d 330,
80.

1159
01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:07.650
So Constantinople becomes the new capital,

1160
01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:11.010
replaces Rome as the capital of the Roman Empire.

1161
01:13:11.190 --> 01:13:16.170
This may not have sounded so amazing at the start because we've already seen the

1162
01:13:16.171 --> 01:13:18.480
tech talks creating all kinds of new capitals.

1163
01:13:18.481 --> 01:13:22.890
The creation of a new capital wasn't that bizarre at this particular point in

1164
01:13:22.891 --> 01:13:23.550
time,

1165
01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:27.540
but he went on to decorate it with all kinds of buildings that look very much

1166
01:13:27.541 --> 01:13:30.270
like those in Rome.
And in retrospect,

1167
01:13:30.271 --> 01:13:35.271
we know that that move of the capital from Rome to Constantinople signaled the

1168
01:13:35.311 --> 01:13:37.920
death of Rome at that particular point in time.

1169
01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:42.680
And not to be resuscitated again until essentially the renaissance.
Uh,

1170
01:13:42.690 --> 01:13:47.010
if we look at some of the buildings that survived though from Constantinople,

1171
01:13:47.011 --> 01:13:50.820
we will see that they are based so very closely on those of Rome.

1172
01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:55.140
The hippodrome,
the sculpture at the base of the obelisk,

1173
01:13:55.141 --> 01:13:58.590
the aqueducts of Constantinople.
And of course,

1174
01:13:58.591 --> 01:14:03.240
especially the famous mosque of I is Sophia,
which you see on the left,

1175
01:14:03.241 --> 01:14:08.241
which would have been inconceivable without the architectural innovations of the

1176
01:14:08.401 --> 01:14:09.234
Pantheon.

1177
01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:14.040
So although we see that the capital from Rome to Constantinople,
uh,

1178
01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:19.000
that roams Rome's history at this point lies in the future when it's going to be

1179
01:14:19.001 --> 01:14:20.530
revived in the renaissance,

1180
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:23.780
it's going to be looked at again in the baroque period,
uh,

1181
01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.040
and into the time of muscle.
And even today,
I,

1182
01:14:27.041 --> 01:14:31.240
one Roman architecture remains so influential,
but although,

1183
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:35.140
but although again,
the argument can be made that sculpture and painting decline,

1184
01:14:35.141 --> 01:14:39.940
I think that architecture did not.
And the lessons that the Roman architects,

1185
01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:42.280
uh,
provided,
uh,

1186
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:46.140
have lasted the test of time that they were passed on.
These,

1187
01:14:46.150 --> 01:14:50.320
these architectural wonders were passed on to the Middle Ages in the west to

1188
01:14:50.321 --> 01:14:53.170
Byzantium in the eastern part of the empire.

1189
01:14:53.171 --> 01:14:57.640
The Bay continue to be operative in the renaissance in the Baroque period,

1190
01:14:57.641 --> 01:15:02.080
in the time when Mussolini in the time of Richard Meyer,
indeed today.
Uh,

1191
01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:07.081
and I believe that they will continue to be significant for anyone designing

1192
01:15:07.511 --> 01:15:08.110
buildings.

1193
01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:13.110
They will provide an inspiration for at least the next 2,672 years.

1194
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:15.971
Thank you very,

1195
01:15:15.971 --> 01:15:20.971
very much this semester for joining me on what has been in his special adventure

1196
01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:26.560
this semester.
And,
uh,
I,
I again,
want to thank you for that.
And,
um,

1197
01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:32.570
