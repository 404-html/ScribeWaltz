1
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.850
Good morning everybody.

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.650
We will be returning the exams on Thursday.

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.970
They're being graded now and we'll return them to you on Thursday and I've

4
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:14.530
always found a found in the past that uh,

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.260
having once we finished the midterm exam and all of you have had a chance to go

6
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.840
back over the material mastered,

7
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:26.841
it is the ideal time to begin to talk about a selection of a paper topic,

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.720
a term paper topic and I'm going to concentrate on that particular issue in

9
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:34.531
today's class.

10
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:39.531
The choice of a paper topic right before spring break is also a good time to

11
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:44.250
begin thinking about this because there are a lucky few of you in here who are

12
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:48.600
actually going to Rome for spring break and there are others that are heading

13
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:51.690
home to California,
pops possibly near Malibu,

14
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:56.590
might have a chance to go to the Getty museum in Malibu,
which is based on a,

15
00:00:56.591 --> 00:01:01.500
a,
an important villa at ancient Roman villa at Herculaneum as well as other

16
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:05.400
travels that may give you some ideas about potential paper topics.

17
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.400
And don't underestimate just the experience of architecture of any period in

18
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:15.100
terms of inspiring you as you go to whatever city you're headed toward,
a or,

19
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.940
or even whatever small town you're headed toward.

20
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.390
Looking at what's around you can be a stimulation,
uh,

21
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.650
to making a selection on a paper topic.
Uh,

22
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.530
so I want to go over that with you today.
Also,

23
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:33.531
I'm going to show you some magnificent parts of the Roman Empire as a prelude to

24
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:38.550
what we'll be doing when we get back after spring break.
And that is,

25
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.990
although we'll spend,

26
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:44.940
we'll do one lecture on Hadrian and the Pantheon and Hadrian's Villa Tivoli and

27
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:49.650
one on a at colony in Italy,
namely Ostia,
uh,
the port of Rome.

28
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.000
From that point on,

29
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:54.870
we'll make our way around the rest of the Roman Empire will go to North Africa.

30
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:59.160
We'll go to Jordan.
I will go to the other parts of the Middle East.
Uh,

31
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:03.530
we'll go to France and Spain.
So we'll be spending spring,
uh,

32
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.380
going around the Roman Empire to mix to some extraordinary spots.

33
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:11.190
And I think by introducing you to some of those today,
uh,

34
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.850
with visa vi the paper topics,
we'll get you in the mood.

35
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:19.851
I hope for that kind of a whirlwind tour that we're going to take in the second

36
00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:24.150
half of the semester.
I'd like to spend the rest of the time,

37
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:26.220
again showing you some magnificent places,

38
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:30.960
giving you a sense of the three options for the paper topics and specific

39
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:35.190
monuments and sights that I hope you'll think you'll consider as possibilities

40
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:37.170
for your paper.
And again,
as I mentioned,

41
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:42.171
it's also a good chance for us to begin to experience the provinces of the Roman

42
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.760
Empire.
Obviously I've chosen,
uh,
topics that are ones that for the most part,

43
00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:49.320
there's one or two exceptions,

44
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.670
but for the most part are not topics that I'm going to be going over in class.

45
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.170
Uh,

46
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.170
so to give you an opportunity to look into a part of the world that we may not

47
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.030
cover in class,
uh,
but also to be able to,
um,

48
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.250
to use what you have learned about Roman buildings in general to decipher a

49
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.570
buildings that you haven't yet seen before.
The first of these,
well,
the first,

50
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:16.360
the first option,
there are three options as I mentioned before.

51
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:21.250
And option one is a straight forward research paper that is comparable obviously

52
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:24.370
to research papers that you've done.
Not only another art history courses,

53
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:29.200
but in other history courses and other whatever courses,
even science courses,

54
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:33.820
a straight research paper in which you have a topic that you do a considerable

55
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:38.420
amount of reading on,
a focused reading on that particular topic.
And,
um,

56
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.130
I give you a bibliography for all of these.
And by the way,
all of these,

57
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:46.630
pretty much all of these Biblia graphical sources are on reserve in the art and

58
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.660
architecture library for this course with a group this size.
Uh,

59
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.700
obviously if a number of you choose the same topic,

60
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.240
I don't want a situation and whoever the early bird catches the worm,

61
00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:02.380
whoever gets the book out of sterling has it and nobody else can get to it.

62
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:05.740
So I have put the books on reserve for this course.

63
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:09.790
I know that creates other challenges because you can't take it home with you
but,

64
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.560
and it means you do need to share,

65
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:15.070
but it will mean that it will be there for you in the library.

66
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:18.400
And in some instances they're a second copies at the university.
So again,

67
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:21.290
in that sense,
the early bird can catch the worm if,

68
00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:25.600
if there is a second or third copy that can be checked out.
So I do urge you,

69
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:28.690
if you have a pretty good sense of what it is that you may want to work on and

70
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.590
want to pick up a book or two before you leave for spring break,
uh,

71
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.260
the next couple of days would be the time to do that.

72
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.400
So the first topic,
so under research paper,

73
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:42.910
get a straightforward research paper in which you do some reading.

74
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:47.560
You do some looking,
you think about this monument,
you think about its uh,
its,
it,

75
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.240
its own special characteristics as well as where it fits into and the evolution

76
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.510
of Roman architecture and one hopes of course that you'll do both a synthetic

77
00:04:57.611 --> 00:05:01.270
once you've done your reading and your research that you will present the,

78
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.240
the work this work of architecture synthetically.
Uh,

79
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.590
but at the same time I hope that you will have a thesis that there will be

80
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:12.640
something that you will come up with on your own.
Uh,
a major point,

81
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:16.480
the major focus that you'll want to have and that you'll want to make and that

82
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:20.710
you want to use the paper toward arguing some thesis of your own.

83
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:24.610
Even though for the most part it will be a synthesis of,
of what you read,

84
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:26.800
what's understood and a placement of it.

85
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.030
Since you now know Rome itself particularly well,
if you choose a topic of a,

86
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.640
of a building or a group of buildings that are outside Rome,

87
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.960
the relationship of what's going on,
on the periphery to what has,

88
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.490
what is going on in the center and the relationship up center to periphery.

89
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.620
So the first topic I give you under a research paper is the Roman city of

90
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:49.570
Corinth.
This which is in Greece.

91
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.440
This would be a good paper topic for the classicists among you.

92
00:05:53.441 --> 00:05:54.960
And I know there are some,
uh,

93
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.980
anyone who's into who's fairly well steeped in Greek culture,
uh,

94
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.070
as well as Roman culture and civilization who might want to look back at,

95
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.360
at a Greek city,

96
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:10.361
a city that was already a very built up under the Greeks as early as the archaic

97
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.890
period.
This is a view,
for example,
of the Greek Greek archaic,

98
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.400
uh,
temple at Corinth.
So a Greek city,

99
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:23.690
a very well developed Greek city that is eventually taken over by the Romans.

100
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:26.450
And the Romans remake it,
uh,
in the Roman manner.

101
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:31.451
They add a typical Roman buildings to it create a kind of mini Rome in Greece.

102
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:35.900
But it's interesting to see the way in which those new buildings blend with

103
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:37.670
those that were built there earlier.

104
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.980
I also mentioned here not only the archaic,
uh,

105
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.520
temple at Corinth,
but also the so called isthmus at Corinth.

106
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:50.270
You might remember from our conversation about Julius Caesar and the

107
00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:51.680
architecture that he built,

108
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:56.681
that Julius Caesar was the one who built a canal at the isthmus of Corinth and

109
00:06:57.711 --> 00:07:02.060
the canal that is still visible and use used at Corinth today.
What you see,

110
00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:05.030
an excellent view of on the lefthand side of the screen,
uh,

111
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:10.031
is essentially the same a canal that was built initially or began initially by

112
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.020
Julius Caesar.

113
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.580
So that gives you some sense of a Roman addition to the scene.

114
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.470
And I show you just one other example.

115
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:22.910
There are quite a number of buildings preserve from Corinth,
Roman buildings.
Uh,

116
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:25.880
so one could do it for a paper like this.

117
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:30.320
One could do an overview of the Roman city,
all the pieces of the Roman city,

118
00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:31.880
how the urban fabric worked.

119
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.750
Or You could choose one or two buildings it at Corinth that Roman Corinth to

120
00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:38.420
concentrate on.
I show you,
for example,

121
00:07:38.421 --> 00:07:41.960
a view of the remains of the Roman baths at Corinth.

122
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.880
And what's interesting about these,

123
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:47.960
and you can pick this out on your own already just by looking at this one view.

124
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.280
What's interesting about these is although they look back to Roman bath

125
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:54.710
architecture in Italy,
uh,

126
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:59.630
you can see that this bath is made entirely of cut stone construction,
uh,

127
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.400
which is quite different from either the small bags we saw at Pompei pay,

128
00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:07.550
the stop being baths or the forum beds or the later imperial baths.

129
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.660
The baths of Titus,
for example,
that we've already explored,
uh,

130
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.040
where concrete construction was used here.
Stone was used.
Why was stone use?

131
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:20.690
Because there was a very long tradition already begun in Greece from the archaic

132
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:25.010
period through the classical period to the Hellenistic period of using stone for

133
00:08:25.011 --> 00:08:29.090
architecture and the architects in this particularly particular part of the

134
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:32.800
world.
Because stone was so readily available and is at,

135
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:37.820
especially marble,
but other kinds of stone as well,
so readily available.
Uh,

136
00:08:37.821 --> 00:08:42.800
and because the,
the,
uh,
architects and designers in this part of the world,

137
00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:45.530
we're so skilled at carving stone,

138
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.640
it was natural for them to use good stone in their construction.

139
00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:54.641
So we see that they are not seduced by a concrete domes and the like don't use

140
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.140
concrete in their architecture,
which you're going to see not only today,

141
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:02.020
but in the future,
uh,
is really an Italian phenomenon.
Uh,

142
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.360
concrete is picked up very sparingly in the Roman provinces.

143
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:10.800
Stone construction tends to be the norm for the most part.
Uh,

144
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.880
and we see that at corn.
So the whole question of building materials,
uh,

145
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:18.230
becomes very important,
but one would ask oneself of one looked at the bas,

146
00:09:18.231 --> 00:09:22.910
at Corinth for example,
what is the plan like?
How similar is it to the small,
uh,

147
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.570
bad's that we saw at palm pay?
How similar is it to,
uh,

148
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:31.150
the imperial bath of building that we saw,
the symmetrical and axial,
uh,

149
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.710
uh,
imperial Beth building that we saw,
for example,

150
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.860
under tight is what kinds of materials was it made out?

151
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:40.890
What is the layout of rooms,
the men too sections,
women's sections,
I mean,

152
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:45.630
all the obvious questions that you would want to put a to this particular

153
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.020
structure.
Also in the eastern part of the empire,
uh,

154
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:54.280
a,
uh,
the city of Ephesus in,
uh,

155
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.590
what was ancient Asia,

156
00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:00.650
Asia minor modern took Turkey on the western coast of Turkey and extraordinary

157
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:06.650
place.
It too,
had a very long history,
uh,
not only,
uh,
uh,

158
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.170
historical and cultural and political,
uh,

159
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.990
but also in terms of its architecture.

160
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.680
A built up already in the Greek period just as Greece itself was a,

161
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.920
and the,
one of the most famous temples at ethicists,
uh,

162
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.460
was the temple of Artemis at Ephesus.
Uh,

163
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.170
and I show you a coin of that temple here.

164
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:33.000
It was renowned worldwide and pilgrims came from all over the Hellenistic and

165
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:34.620
Roman world to see it.

166
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:39.120
And I show you a representation on this coin of what the temple of Artemis in

167
00:10:39.121 --> 00:10:40.920
emphasis looked like.
A,

168
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:44.310
and you can see here that it had eight columns across the front.

169
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:46.620
They were ionic columns at least at one point.

170
00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:51.390
It was rebuilt over a number of years and that got changed over time.
Uh,

171
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:55.890
but we see it here with its ionic columns with its pedimento decoration and with

172
00:10:55.891 --> 00:10:57.510
the columns,
uh,

173
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.720
spread out in the center in order to reveal the cult statue of Artemis.

174
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.710
And what a statue.
It was a,
I show it to you,
a copy of it,

175
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.060
very well endowed Artemis as you can see here on the left hand side of the

176
00:11:12.061 --> 00:11:12.391
screen.

177
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:16.500
And there are tons and tons of copies of these and this is one of those that

178
00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:21.501
gives us a very good sense of what this cult statue of Artemis in this famous

179
00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:26.730
temple look like.
And you can see that she's had a very long afterlife.
It's,

180
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.810
it's very tempting to use her in all kinds of later ways.

181
00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:35.811
And as you can see in this wonderful view of the villa desk day at Tivoli in

182
00:11:36.511 --> 00:11:40.890
Italy,
which is very close to Hadrian's villa at Tivoli,
a renaissance,

183
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.250
uh,
uh,

184
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.860
area with lots of fountains and so on.

185
00:11:46.861 --> 00:11:51.720
And you can see how they've taken the Artemis or Diana of Ephesus a and made her

186
00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:56.721
into a fountain a so she comes up in all kinds of later context.

187
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.140
As you can see with regard to the Roman city,
uh,

188
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.800
the city of the Roman city of emphasis is extremely well preserved.

189
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.550
Uh,
it's one of the best preserved Roman cities today.
You know,

190
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:13.060
up there with places like palm pay and Herculaneum.

191
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.940
But as you can see from two buildings from emphasis,

192
00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:20.230
it is very different from either Pompei or Herculaneum.

193
00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:22.520
It is essentially a marble city.
Uh,

194
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:27.130
and it's another example of the fact that in Greece and in Asia minor,
uh,

195
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:32.160
marble construction and using the traditional language of architecture as

196
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:33.370
developed by the Greeks,

197
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:38.150
columns and pediments and walls and the roofs that they support,
uh,

198
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:42.880
remains,
uh,
the way of going about construction.
Uh,
and I show you here,

199
00:12:42.881 --> 00:12:43.870
for example,

200
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:48.930
the very well preserved a arch of Augustus at Ephesus,

201
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.910
which gives you the sense,
uh,
of,
of uh,

202
00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.350
of the kind of stone construction that was used for that.

203
00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.580
And perhaps more interesting is the shrine that I show you over the Shriner,

204
00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:04.930
the temple that I show you here on the right,
which is the temple of Hadrian,

205
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:09.790
the emperor Hadrian at emphasis that was put up in honor of Hadrian's,

206
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:13.180
a very small temple,
more a shrine a.

207
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:17.200
And what's interesting about it is again,
that it is made out of stone.
I mean,

208
00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:20.830
think of this in relationship to the pet.
We haven't looked at it,

209
00:13:20.831 --> 00:13:24.280
but I know it's a building you all know well,
the Pantheon in Rome,

210
00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:26.940
which of course is a,
uh,
is,

211
00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:31.941
is one of the greatest concrete buildings the Romans produced or is the greatest

212
00:13:32.381 --> 00:13:34.120
concrete building the Romans produced.

213
00:13:34.121 --> 00:13:38.590
If you compare that with its very large scale with its concrete construction to

214
00:13:38.591 --> 00:13:39.041
this,

215
00:13:39.041 --> 00:13:44.041
you get a very good sense of the difference between Rome and emphasis in the

216
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:46.720
Adriatic period.
This is again,
a very small building.

217
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.890
You can see it's made entirely of stone.
Uh,
it has columns,

218
00:13:50.891 --> 00:13:54.640
it has pilasters,
uh,
it is very highly decorated,
in fact,

219
00:13:54.641 --> 00:13:57.430
almost overly ornate with that decoration,

220
00:13:57.431 --> 00:14:00.490
almost d materializing the architectural members.

221
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.330
And you can also see a motif that we have seen before in painting,

222
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.910
but never before in built architecture.

223
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.450
And that is a straight lintel and then an arcuate,

224
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.070
the occupation of the lintel and then the straight lintel again.
Uh,

225
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:19.120
and that is housed in a pediment or at least part of the pediment.

226
00:14:19.481 --> 00:14:24.460
We can't tell,
but you can see on both sides,
the pediment begins to,

227
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.030
uh,
to rise.
Uh,
uh,
but it's not completed.
Now,

228
00:14:28.031 --> 00:14:31.780
whether it's just broken off or whether it was what we would call a partial or

229
00:14:31.781 --> 00:14:35.170
broken triangular pediment we're not absolutely certain.

230
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.850
My guess is it was a broken triangular pediment.

231
00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:42.460
So we have this RQ weighted lintel emerging from the broken triangular pediment.

232
00:14:42.461 --> 00:14:47.461
We're going to see that this motif of straight RQ weighted lintel very popular

233
00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:50.580
in the Adriatic period and even brought to Italy,
uh,

234
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:54.230
from experiments in the east.
But again,
we saw this in painting,

235
00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:57.780
we saw this in that painting that was on the midterm,
the uh,

236
00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.280
cubic Yalom 16,
uh,
for example,
already in pain.

237
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.860
Now we see it in built architecture,
but we,

238
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:08.630
what we see in the eastern part of the empire is the way in which architects use

239
00:15:08.631 --> 00:15:13.631
the traditional language of Greek architecture columns pediments lintels and do

240
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:16.190
something entirely different with them.

241
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:20.660
And it's very different from built architecture in Rome of the same period.

242
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:24.860
Now the building that I recommend,
if you want to work on emphasis,

243
00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:26.180
there are other possibilities.
I mean,

244
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:28.370
you could work on that temple of Hadrian for example,

245
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:33.140
but the one that I think it has the richest opportunities for and outstanding

246
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.760
paper and an interesting paper as well.
An interesting research,
um,
uh,

247
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.650
adventure,
uh,
is the,
um,

248
00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.630
library of calcis in Ephesus.
Your students,

249
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:48.410
you spend a lot of time,
my hope in libraries.
Uh,

250
00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:49.850
and so you have a sense of,

251
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.390
of sterling and the way it works if you're not always online.

252
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.570
Instead of going to the library these days,
which is a temptation that,

253
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.880
that even I fall into the trap of on a fairly regular basis.
Uh,
but,

254
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:02.571
um,
you know,

255
00:16:02.571 --> 00:16:06.410
using the Internet instead of taking that extra step to get to the library.

256
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:08.810
But I really urge,
it's very important for this topic.

257
00:16:08.811 --> 00:16:12.050
You will not find for this these papers you will not find,

258
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.370
you will find a lot of interesting things on the Internet and I really do urge

259
00:16:16.371 --> 00:16:17.240
you to use it.

260
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:21.740
But at the same time you will find that you really do need to go to the library

261
00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:22.730
and get,
uh,

262
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:27.110
get out of variety of books to help you do a good job on this paper,

263
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:28.740
the library of Calcis,
uh,

264
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.120
because of your general interest in libraries and because of the fact that we

265
00:16:32.121 --> 00:16:36.350
haven't been able to talk in this course about libraries in the ancient world,

266
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.040
the most famous of which of course was the library at Alexandria,

267
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:44.900
a upon all which all other ancient libraries appeared to have tried.

268
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.960
It appeared to have measured a themselves.

269
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.550
But we see lots of libraries in Rome and around Italy.
And around the empire,

270
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.380
a Greek and Latin libraries,

271
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.650
libraries that are either part of private villas.

272
00:16:57.651 --> 00:17:01.130
Sometimes we'll see that at Hadrian's villa for example,
uh,

273
00:17:01.131 --> 00:17:06.110
or in fora like Trojans forum,
which we'll look at on Thursday.
Uh,

274
00:17:06.111 --> 00:17:11.060
but also a large enterprises that serve to city such as this one.

275
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.570
This is the library of calcis in uh,
emphasis.

276
00:17:14.571 --> 00:17:16.850
It is called after calcis because Kelsey,

277
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:22.080
a man by the name of Kelsea's Cel sus was the patron of this particular library

278
00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.820
that bears his name.
Uh,

279
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:28.880
he was the benefactor who wanted to splash his own name on this,
uh,

280
00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:29.990
on this library.

281
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:34.640
The purpose of the library being a library for everybody who lived in,
uh,

282
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:38.150
in emphasis.
We see a plan.
These are both from Ward Perkins,

283
00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:41.690
a plan a and also restored view of the interior.

284
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.470
In the plan you see it's inside,
it's a rectangular space with a niche,

285
00:17:45.471 --> 00:17:46.880
with columns in that niche,

286
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:52.150
columns around the perimeter of room and then columns as well as a staircase on

287
00:17:52.651 --> 00:17:55.200
the front of the structure.
In this restored view,

288
00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:59.290
you get a better sense of what it would've looked like in,
in,
inside.
Uh,

289
00:17:59.291 --> 00:18:00.450
you see that niche here.

290
00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:05.120
You can see now that it's a two story niche with columns on two stories and with

291
00:18:05.121 --> 00:18:10.050
a semi dome with coffers at the top.
And then a series of tears,

292
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.920
uh,
with,
uh,
with um,
rectangular,
uh,

293
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.890
storage areas here with shelves where they placed this member,
there was scrolls,

294
00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:20.411
not books.

295
00:18:20.411 --> 00:18:25.411
So they piled the scrolls on the shelves and then each of these rectangular

296
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.730
areas had a wooden door that would cover,

297
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:33.500
we would close and keep those scrolls protected unless,
uh,

298
00:18:33.501 --> 00:18:37.270
and someone wanted to check them out or consult them,
uh,

299
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.760
or whatever we see.
It also had a flat roof with a coffered ceiling.

300
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.590
Now what's also very interesting about this library and essentially unique is

301
00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:49.330
that Kelsey is not only wanted to give this,
uh,

302
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:53.250
as as a benefaction to his city for the public good.

303
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:57.570
He decided he also wanted it to serve as his tomb.
Now I've told you that,

304
00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.890
that people made strange choices.
Visa vi their last resting places,

305
00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:05.730
and Kelsey's decided that he wanted to be buried in his library.

306
00:19:05.731 --> 00:19:08.610
So he provided beneath that central niche,

307
00:19:08.611 --> 00:19:12.810
there was a burial chamber and he was indeed a buried in his library.

308
00:19:12.811 --> 00:19:16.320
So this is not only a library,
it's also a tomb,
which again,

309
00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:20.760
makes it a particularly interesting topic.
I believe it had fallen.

310
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.820
The building had fallen down and about in the 1970s it was still on the ground

311
00:19:26.941 --> 00:19:29.820
in bits and pieces.
In more recent decades,

312
00:19:29.821 --> 00:19:32.910
they have taken those pieces that were,
there were tons of them,

313
00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:36.090
hundreds and hundreds of pieces.
And the authorities,

314
00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:39.030
the archeological authorities have put this building back together,

315
00:19:39.031 --> 00:19:41.720
but they put it back together with its own,
you know,

316
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:46.380
with its own architectural members and so on.
And this is what you see today.

317
00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:50.610
If you go to emphasis,
it's an extraordinary structure.
Uh,

318
00:19:50.611 --> 00:19:52.920
you can see that it's entirely made out of marble.

319
00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:57.360
This is the facade of the library of Kelsey's.
It's entirely made out of marble.

320
00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.940
We can see that it is two tiered,
uh,
with columns.
Uh,

321
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.830
supporting straight lintels down below.
And then in the upper tier,
uh,

322
00:20:04.831 --> 00:20:09.750
combination of,
of arched,
uh,
uh,
and,
uh,
of,
of,

323
00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:10.584
um,

324
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:15.590
RQ weighted pediments and rectangular pediments up above to give it some

325
00:20:16.081 --> 00:20:19.920
variety.
And you'll also see something very interesting here,

326
00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:24.921
which is although the architect has used the traditional language of Greek

327
00:20:25.081 --> 00:20:27.720
architecture columns and pediments and the like,

328
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:32.340
which is very traditional when you compare it to the sorts of concrete buildings

329
00:20:32.341 --> 00:20:34.150
going up in Rome,
uh,

330
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:38.630
but at the same time has injected motion into this facade,
uh,

331
00:20:38.631 --> 00:20:42.600
by having a series of projecting bays,
receiving base,

332
00:20:42.601 --> 00:20:46.720
projecting bay receding bay,
creating a kind of undulating,
uh,

333
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.210
in out effect across the facade.

334
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.850
And then has done something quite interesting,

335
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:55.000
which is to place the columns in the second tier,

336
00:20:55.001 --> 00:20:57.760
not immediately above those in the lower tier,

337
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.890
but straddling the spaces in between them above the receding bays rather than

338
00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:03.970
the projecting bays,

339
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:09.180
which injects still more a motion into the upper part of the structure in

340
00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:14.560
contrast to the lower part.
Uh,
so you can,
and you can see also the,

341
00:21:14.561 --> 00:21:19.300
the again,
a marble construction here,
very gated marble used for the columns.

342
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.800
Uh,
so very much a marble building and marble,

343
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:27.990
a very high quality marble was more readily accessible,
uh,

344
00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.930
in Greece and an Asia minor than anywhere else in the Roman world.

345
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.090
This is another wonderful view.

346
00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:38.890
We're standing below looking up from the first tier to the second tier of the

347
00:21:38.891 --> 00:21:42.730
library of calcis.
And as you look at this,
you probably are thinking,
hey,

348
00:21:42.731 --> 00:21:46.660
architectural cages at the top of fourth style Roman wall painting.

349
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:51.580
We've seen this before,
but only in painting,
we haven't seen anything like it.

350
00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:56.500
The closest we got is our look at the forum transitory and more the forum of

351
00:21:56.501 --> 00:22:00.040
Nerva in Rome where I showed you those columns,

352
00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:02.160
that project out of the wall,
uh,

353
00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.260
and have projecting and tablatures and that kind of in and out of fact.

354
00:22:05.261 --> 00:22:09.220
I said that was the first example in Rome of what we might call borough,

355
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:10.750
the Baroque trend,
uh,

356
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:15.850
in Roman architecture where this witness motion is injected into the facade,

357
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:21.310
but we see this very naturally in Asia minor over and over again.
We see it here.

358
00:22:21.311 --> 00:22:26.080
So an example of something and build architecture that we've seen earlier in

359
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.560
painted architecture,
uh,
and which is going to have,
is we'll see,

360
00:22:29.561 --> 00:22:33.190
I have an entire lecture on the Baroque Architecture Roman antiquity,

361
00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:38.510
where we look at a series of buildings around the provinces that all make use of

362
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.490
traditional vocabulary,
but use it in a very vibrant way,

363
00:22:42.491 --> 00:22:45.850
as you can see here.
And then there is,
as you probably already noticed,

364
00:22:45.851 --> 00:22:50.410
statutes that are placed in the niches on the facade.
In this case of two women.

365
00:22:50.411 --> 00:22:53.620
I mean,
the interesting question for anyone working at who are these,
uh,

366
00:22:53.621 --> 00:22:55.850
their names are given or they're there,

367
00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:00.170
they have inscriptions down below identification in Greek.
Uh,

368
00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:04.180
and you can also see with these details how elaborate these were,

369
00:23:04.181 --> 00:23:08.230
how they just like in the shrine and the temple of Hadrian and emphasis the use

370
00:23:08.231 --> 00:23:09.740
of decoration.
Uh,

371
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.740
covers almost every available space and helps to not only decorate or ornament,

372
00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:18.610
but d materialize the architectural elements.
Something again,

373
00:23:18.611 --> 00:23:21.370
we saw on painting third style Roman painting.

374
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.240
Here we see it and on the Aarp Ahca.
So we have seen it in architecture here.

375
00:23:25.241 --> 00:23:27.910
We see it in architecture in the western empire.

376
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:33.030
Another very interesting city and issue,
uh,
is uh,

377
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:38.040
in the Roman city of Jericho or Jerash in what is today,

378
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.510
Jordan.
Uh,
I show you,

379
00:23:40.511 --> 00:23:44.170
we will look at a couple of buildings in Jordan later in the term,

380
00:23:44.171 --> 00:23:46.670
but not at this particular one.

381
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:52.060
I show you a plan of what the Roman city of Gera Gerrish looked like and where

382
00:23:54.621 --> 00:23:56.420
the Roman buildings were located.

383
00:23:56.421 --> 00:24:01.040
You can pick out all the obvious components of a miniature Rome.

384
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.480
You see a hippodrome,
for example,
over here with its hairpin shape.

385
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:10.580
There was an arch of Hadrian over here.
Uh,
there was,

386
00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:13.400
there were two theaters,
the north theater over here,

387
00:24:13.401 --> 00:24:17.120
and there's another theater somewhere there,
the south theater up there.

388
00:24:17.121 --> 00:24:17.960
And you can see that,

389
00:24:17.961 --> 00:24:22.550
that they conform to the shape of a typical Roman theater.

390
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:27.050
Uh,
you also see there was a temple artimus here as well.

391
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:31.940
There are a couple of to trap salons we haven't seen to trap a lawns in Rome.

392
00:24:31.941 --> 00:24:35.900
And in fact the Romans didn't build tech trap Alonzo in the city.
Uh,

393
00:24:35.901 --> 00:24:40.901
Ted Trap Alon is a four sided arch that is made specifically to span two streets

394
00:24:43.071 --> 00:24:47.600
so that you can go through the arch and the arch is right over the intersection

395
00:24:47.601 --> 00:24:49.370
of those two streets so that you can draw,

396
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.200
you can drive your cart or walk right through.
Uh,

397
00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.750
the arch on either street,
either of the two streets,

398
00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:01.520
these to trap a were very popular in the eastern part of the empire.

399
00:25:01.521 --> 00:25:02.450
Will see a number of,

400
00:25:02.451 --> 00:25:06.890
we'll see if a couple of them today and others in the course of the term.

401
00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:11.970
And you see that here and for anybody interested both in Jerash and into trap

402
00:25:12.891 --> 00:25:17.840
Alonzo.
I recommend,
I'm not going over this specific references here,

403
00:25:17.841 --> 00:25:20.000
but if you don't,
you probably didn't bring this today,

404
00:25:20.001 --> 00:25:24.950
but on the web portal you will find bibliography for each one of these topics.

405
00:25:24.951 --> 00:25:28.520
And again,
as I mentioned,
most of these are on reserve for the course.

406
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:33.470
I recommend in particular the book by William McDonald called the architecture

407
00:25:33.471 --> 00:25:35.960
of the Roman Empire volume to,
uh,

408
00:25:35.961 --> 00:25:39.800
in which he focuses specifically anyone working on one of the cities in the
east.

409
00:25:39.801 --> 00:25:44.660
And Eastern provinces will find this book very valuable because he,
he,

410
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.560
uh,
in very poetic language,
uh,
he is able to conjure up a,

411
00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.450
the way in which these cities were planned,
the way in which these buildings,
uh,

412
00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:58.040
interacted with the streets of the city.
Uh,
and um,
and,

413
00:25:58.041 --> 00:26:02.990
and,
and the,
the kind of,
um,
vistas and visual,
visual,

414
00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:07.250
uh,
kind of views that were,
that were,
um,

415
00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:12.020
that were carefully orchestrated by the designers of these cities as well as the

416
00:26:12.021 --> 00:26:15.560
ways in which they wanted to move people around those cities.

417
00:26:15.561 --> 00:26:20.390
I think you'll find that book,
uh,
particularly valuable.
Now,
what's,

418
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:22.280
uh,
let me just go back for a moment.

419
00:26:22.281 --> 00:26:26.210
I just want to show you that plan one more time because eventually I am going to

420
00:26:26.211 --> 00:26:27.210
show you,
uh,

421
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:31.880
the forum of Jaris of what you see is located right over here.
Uh,

422
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:36.560
and the shape of that forum is particularly interesting as we shall see just a

423
00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:41.270
couple of buildings from uh,
Jaris,
uh,
on the left hand side of the screen,

424
00:26:41.271 --> 00:26:45.810
the arch of Hadrian,
which you can once again stone construction here,

425
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.650
uh,
with um,
large projecting columns,

426
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.540
niches on the second story,
contrast between larger order and smaller order.

427
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.740
Here we again see projecting columns with projecting and tablature,

428
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.760
but then a pediment,
uh,
that is recessed.
So again,

429
00:27:02.761 --> 00:27:06.510
this playing around with the traditional language of architecture in a way the

430
00:27:06.511 --> 00:27:10.860
Greeks themselves would not have done.
Uh,
same happens up here.

431
00:27:10.861 --> 00:27:15.120
You have project look tall projecting columns with a triangular pediment,

432
00:27:15.121 --> 00:27:20.070
but a triangular pediment that is made up of projecting wings on either side.

433
00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:24.420
And then the central part of the pediment is,
is,
is,
uh,

434
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.690
is uh,
placed in depth here,

435
00:27:27.691 --> 00:27:32.691
a view of the fountain or the Nim Fam of the city of Jericho where you can see

436
00:27:33.391 --> 00:27:36.480
again the use just as the library of Kelsey's,

437
00:27:36.481 --> 00:27:41.400
the use of columns in this case sets of columns that are placed one on top of

438
00:27:41.401 --> 00:27:45.000
the other.
And two tiers.
There would have been a columnar display here,

439
00:27:45.001 --> 00:27:50.001
probably certainly also in two stories on the interior of this building.

440
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.090
Now this is the,

441
00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:55.230
this is the part of Jared Jared said that I think is most interesting and that

442
00:27:55.231 --> 00:27:58.770
is that it has an oval forum,

443
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.890
an Oval Forum,
a forum in an oval shape.

444
00:28:01.891 --> 00:28:05.910
Now we've seen ovals before for amphitheater architecture,

445
00:28:05.911 --> 00:28:09.000
the elliptical plan of an amphitheater,
but we have not seen,

446
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:11.820
and we've seen octagonal rooms and we've seen round rooms,

447
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:16.650
but we have not seen the Romans in Italy use,
uh,
the,
uh,
the,
um,

448
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:20.970
the oval a for anything other than amphitheater architecture.

449
00:28:20.971 --> 00:28:25.971
And yet we see here this wonderful forum and Jarrod said that consists of an

450
00:28:27.151 --> 00:28:27.690
oval,

451
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:32.490
which is defined essentially by a series of columns on a curve.

452
00:28:32.491 --> 00:28:34.050
So placing of Colin's flanks,

453
00:28:34.051 --> 00:28:38.790
placing of the traditional language of Greek architecture along a curve,

454
00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:42.840
um,
which we've seen before.
We saw that at Palestrina,
uh,
for example,

455
00:28:42.841 --> 00:28:45.600
but we see it,
uh,
here with this oval shape.

456
00:28:45.601 --> 00:28:49.740
And the other thing that you see in this view that is so interesting is the fact

457
00:28:49.741 --> 00:28:50.550
that many,

458
00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:55.550
most of the streets in the cities in the eastern provinces are colonated

459
00:28:55.951 --> 00:28:59.130
streets.
Our streets that have columns all along them.

460
00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.820
We never ever see this in Italy.

461
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:06.120
There is no ancient Roman,

462
00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:09.600
a town in Italy that has a colonated street.

463
00:29:09.601 --> 00:29:13.260
So we begin to see these interesting differences,
uh,

464
00:29:13.261 --> 00:29:16.110
between Rome and the province is why is this,

465
00:29:16.111 --> 00:29:19.500
I mean it's interesting to ask ourselves why this might be.
I think again,

466
00:29:19.501 --> 00:29:23.490
it probably has to do with the fact that there was a long tradition and in

467
00:29:23.491 --> 00:29:27.360
Greece and in Asia minor for a Greek architecture,

468
00:29:27.361 --> 00:29:32.361
Greek architecture made out of stone using columns for the most part.

469
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:36.490
Uh,
and uh,
that was something that they were used to.
They liked it,
uh,

470
00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.670
and they continued it on,
but they beget,

471
00:29:38.671 --> 00:29:40.740
but they began to do it in a different way.
I'm,

472
00:29:40.741 --> 00:29:42.580
the Greeks would never have built a,

473
00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:47.530
an oval oval meeting or mar marketplace.
Uh,
but here we see the oval.

474
00:29:47.531 --> 00:29:51.430
So this combination of the idea of the oval probably from amphitheater

475
00:29:51.431 --> 00:29:55.600
architecture combined with the traditional language,

476
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.350
traditional vocabulary of Greek marble architecture.

477
00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:05.910
Another extraordinary site is the site of Paul Myra,

478
00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:10.780
uh,
which is in PA L P A,
l m,
Y,
r a,

479
00:30:10.781 --> 00:30:13.230
which is in modern Syria.
Uh,

480
00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:18.290
and I show you a view of the ancient remains of Palmyra as they look today.

481
00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.580
And you can immediately see that pal Myra,

482
00:30:21.581 --> 00:30:25.600
just like Jaris a has colonated streets.
Here's the street.

483
00:30:25.601 --> 00:30:27.220
You can see all of the columns,
uh,

484
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:32.230
along it as well as a series of large buildings that are part of the Roman

485
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:39.160
structures that were added to the city of Palmyra in Roman times.

486
00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:44.500
Here's an example of one.
This is a stone arch,
uh,
at Pell Myra.

487
00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:49.510
And you can see that the stone arch has been made part of that colonated street

488
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:55.070
and the columns that lead up to it create a very interesting vista toward the

489
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.480
arch.
And then you can see this is very interesting.

490
00:30:58.481 --> 00:31:01.510
We also see this quite commonly in the eastern part of the empire.

491
00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.220
Not only do they have columns,

492
00:31:03.221 --> 00:31:08.070
but they placed brackets on those columns that project out from them.
Uh,

493
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:12.040
and those brackets were meant to help hold honorific statuary.

494
00:31:12.041 --> 00:31:17.041
So statues of some of the famous people of the city or magistrates or whatever

495
00:31:17.531 --> 00:31:22.180
of the city of a Roman Pell Myra.
I mentioned a ted trap,

496
00:31:22.181 --> 00:31:26.350
Alanna foresighted arch that would span two streets.

497
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:31.450
We see one of those here are very well preserved to trap alon in Pell Myra.

498
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.250
And you see that at once again,

499
00:31:33.251 --> 00:31:37.810
they don't use the traditional language of architecture made out of stone with

500
00:31:37.811 --> 00:31:42.811
columns supporting straight lentils that serve and placed on a stone bases.

501
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:48.510
As you can see here that serve as the four a sides of that to trap along.

502
00:31:48.971 --> 00:31:53.290
There would have been some roof on top of this of some sort or maybe not.

503
00:31:53.291 --> 00:31:56.740
That's I forgotten whether that was the forgotten what people think about this

504
00:31:56.741 --> 00:32:00.010
particular arch,
whether there was,
some of them have,
uh,

505
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.750
have roofs and some of them do not.

506
00:32:01.751 --> 00:32:05.590
I don't actually recall what the case is with this one.
Uh,
but it gives you,

507
00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:05.891
again,

508
00:32:05.891 --> 00:32:10.891
a very good idea of this to travel on arch that was so popular in the eastern

509
00:32:11.291 --> 00:32:12.190
part of the empire.

510
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:17.290
But the building again in Pal Myra that I think is by far the most intriguing

511
00:32:17.291 --> 00:32:22.291
and makes a perfect paper topic because one can try to decode a what,

512
00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:27.070
which aspects of this are Roman and which aspects of this are local.

513
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.980
And that's essentially the name of the game when you tried,

514
00:32:29.981 --> 00:32:34.690
when you go out into the Roman provinces to try to determine what it is,

515
00:32:34.691 --> 00:32:38.530
you know,
what in what ways has the,
uh,
has what's going on in the capitol,

516
00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:43.650
had impact on what's happening in the provinces and what local traditions are so

517
00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:48.791
strong that they continue to exist and even resurface in some of these

518
00:32:49.101 --> 00:32:52.190
buildings.
It's usually a coming together of both of those elements,

519
00:32:52.191 --> 00:32:56.720
elements from Rome and local elements and the way in which those coexist and

520
00:32:56.721 --> 00:33:01.670
ended up,
uh,
creating an entirely different architectural phenomenon,

521
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:06.230
which is what we see in this building here.
This is called the temple of Bell,

522
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:10.490
B e l at Palmyra,
again in modern Syria.

523
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:14.240
And you say to yourself,
well,
who is bell?
Uh,
well,

524
00:33:14.241 --> 00:33:19.160
bell is a God and that that tells you something already.
Bell is a local God.

525
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.430
Uh,
so this is not a temple to Jupiter or to the cat or to Jupiter,

526
00:33:22.431 --> 00:33:26.420
Juno and Manurewa.
This is a temple to bell.
So that already tells us something,

527
00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.170
uh,
about,
uh,
this structure when it,

528
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:33.680
as it goes up in Rome that they are as it goes up in Palmyra during Roman Times

529
00:33:33.681 --> 00:33:38.600
that they are interested in commemorating and honoring,
uh,
a local God.

530
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.840
If we look at the plan,
and maybe you can help me here with this,

531
00:33:41.841 --> 00:33:45.970
if we look at the plan a and we think back to what we know,
uh,

532
00:33:45.971 --> 00:33:50.210
of typical Greek that trust skin and Roman temple architecture,

533
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.750
we should be struck by this plan.
What,
what is it that strikes us?

534
00:33:53.751 --> 00:33:56.750
What elements strike us about this particular plant?

535
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:06.180
<v 1>Yup.
The,</v>

536
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:08.880
the porch,

537
00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:11.910
the staircase,

538
00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.220
<v 0>the PA,
the podium.
You mean the podium,
the podium.</v>

539
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:21.460
The podium goes all the way around and the columns go all the way around and you

540
00:34:24.711 --> 00:34:28.550
can see in this restored view,
the staircase,

541
00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:32.660
it goes all the way around.
So the podium,
the staircase,

542
00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:36.050
and the columns which are freestanding as you can see here,

543
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:37.460
go all the way around.

544
00:34:37.461 --> 00:34:42.440
So that is characteristic of what kind of temple architecture,
Greek,

545
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:46.490
Greek temple architecture.
However,

546
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.680
what else do we see that's curious?

547
00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:52.370
This is not entirely a Greek temple type.
It's,
Yup.

548
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:57.143
<v 1>The seller</v>

549
00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:01.860
<v 0>Sella is here.
We have a single seller,
we have a staircase</v>

550
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.060
on what an additional staircase on one side,
uh,

551
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:10.560
which leads into the seller from the side,
not from the end,

552
00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:14.400
but as we usually say,
you know,
usually enter from one end,
one short end,

553
00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.050
and you have the apps or,
or the,
um,

554
00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:21.450
the place where the God statue was kept on the other side.

555
00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.550
But here we see a staircase,

556
00:35:23.551 --> 00:35:26.100
it's placed in the center and it isn't even quite in the center.

557
00:35:26.101 --> 00:35:30.600
It's actually slightly off center on one of the long sides of the temple,

558
00:35:30.601 --> 00:35:33.240
which we have never seen before.
Uh,

559
00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.810
so we have this interesting location of the stack of the other,

560
00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:42.060
but also this combination of a staircase that goes all the way around in the

561
00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:42.894
Greek manner,

562
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:47.940
but then a kind of facade orientation by the placement of an additional

563
00:35:47.941 --> 00:35:52.800
staircase on one side of the monument.
So very schizophrenia,

564
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.620
a building in that regard.
And the list goes on and on.

565
00:35:55.621 --> 00:35:59.550
Let's look at the restored view.
What do we see here that's curious?

566
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.823
<v 1>Anyone</v>

567
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:08.463
we have

568
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:13.460
<v 0>Paul columns with capital's look at the doorway.
Can you see,</v>

569
00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.470
I don't know how clear it is to you from where you sit,

570
00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:19.130
what's happening above the doorway.
We have additional,

571
00:36:19.131 --> 00:36:23.660
we have the upper part of the,
of the column and the Capitol truncated,

572
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:28.460
placed on top of the doorway.
That strange.
How are we meant to read that?

573
00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.550
Exactly.
We've never seen that before.
And look at the top,

574
00:36:31.551 --> 00:36:35.480
we have crenelations on the top of the monument.
Uh,

575
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:39.970
and at the very top we have some kind of a deck up there.
Uh,
that must,

576
00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:45.070
that may have been used for something having to do with the worship of bell.

577
00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:50.400
Uh,
so one asks one.
So we see this interesting combination of Greek,
uh,

578
00:36:50.401 --> 00:36:52.430
the influence of Greek temple architecture,

579
00:36:52.431 --> 00:36:56.040
Roman temple architecture and local practice.
Uh,

580
00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:59.480
and so one would want to ask one's self and one would try to find out what one

581
00:36:59.481 --> 00:37:02.030
could about the worship of bell and about their,

582
00:37:02.031 --> 00:37:05.450
whether there were any earlier temples of bell here and whether any of these

583
00:37:05.451 --> 00:37:08.960
features have to do with local,
uh,
a local practice.

584
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:12.770
The building still stands,
are part of it.
Uh,
and you can see it here.

585
00:37:12.771 --> 00:37:14.350
Here you see that doorway,
uh,

586
00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.910
that we were looking at just before some of the columns.

587
00:37:16.911 --> 00:37:19.600
And you can see the kind of very,
uh,

588
00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:24.290
nice honey colored a stone out of which the temple of belt was made.

589
00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.540
Another terrific topic.

590
00:37:26.541 --> 00:37:31.541
And for anybody who lives on the west coast and is going home to the La area,

591
00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:36.500
a four break,
uh,
if you,
you probably have already been to the Getty museum,

592
00:37:36.501 --> 00:37:40.070
it could go again,
but if you have never been,
it's an extraordinary,

593
00:37:40.071 --> 00:37:42.570
this would be a perfect time to go.
Uh,

594
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:46.580
the villa of the Papiri in Herculaneum Avila.
Uh,

595
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.760
comparable to some of the villas that we've looked at this semester,

596
00:37:49.761 --> 00:37:54.600
whether it's bus go Trey Causey or the village Ovis on Coppery,
uh,

597
00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:57.500
a very important villa in Campania,
uh,

598
00:37:57.501 --> 00:38:02.220
of the early Roman period.
Uh,
the villa up a period of,

599
00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:03.140
of,

600
00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:07.730
of the Papiri is so called because of papayas fragments that were found there.

601
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:11.060
The owner of this particular villa had his own library.

602
00:38:11.061 --> 00:38:14.780
We're back to libraries again.
And I,
by the way,
on the bibliography,

603
00:38:14.781 --> 00:38:19.781
there's a particularly good book by Lionel case in c a s s o n on the libraries

604
00:38:21.801 --> 00:38:25.370
of the ancient world that anybody who works either on emphasis or this will

605
00:38:25.371 --> 00:38:27.220
probably want to take a look at.
Uh,

606
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:32.230
he has his own library here and there were scrolls from that library,

607
00:38:32.541 --> 00:38:36.040
especially from one specific author that were found there.
Uh,

608
00:38:36.041 --> 00:38:41.041
and it is because of those papayas fragments that the villa got its name,

609
00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:45.460
the villa of the Papiri in Herculaneum.
Uh,

610
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:50.200
the excavations excavations were done some time ago of this villa.

611
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:53.980
Uh,
the a plan was drawn of the villa at that particular time,

612
00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:58.960
but the excavators found that noxious gases were starting to be emitted from the

613
00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:01.990
ground and there was a great,
it was a health hazard.

614
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.320
And so after they unearthed it,
after they drew it,

615
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:09.430
they covered it back over again.
And it's only been in very recent years.

616
00:39:09.431 --> 00:39:11.860
That excavation has again began on this site.

617
00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:16.630
And I show you a couple of views of the excavation that is currently underway

618
00:39:16.631 --> 00:39:21.040
that is once again revealing some of the original walls as well as some of the

619
00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:24.160
stucco and paintings of the original villa.

620
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:29.200
Now what's particularly interesting and where the Getty Museum comes in is John

621
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.230
Paul Getty,
when he designed his,
his villa at Malibu,

622
00:39:32.231 --> 00:39:35.000
which serves of course as a museum of antiquities,
uh,

623
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:39.490
when he was building that he used,
uh,
the villa of the Papiri as a model.

624
00:39:39.491 --> 00:39:41.470
And I mean,
as an exact model,

625
00:39:41.471 --> 00:39:45.720
he really duplicated quite a precisely the bill of the [inaudible].

626
00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:49.810
This is the plan of the Ville of the Papiri as it was drawn when it was

627
00:39:49.811 --> 00:39:52.270
originally excavated.
And you can see,

628
00:39:52.271 --> 00:39:54.130
I guess if the of the structures we looked at,

629
00:39:54.131 --> 00:39:57.710
it's probably most like the house of Lorraine Teper Tina's,

630
00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:58.810
where you'll remember this,

631
00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:03.580
a small amount of space given to the House on two stories and most of it given

632
00:40:03.581 --> 00:40:08.010
to a large garden.
We see the same idea here where we have a,

633
00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:12.430
and you could see it better over here where we have a one area around a court

634
00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.950
that has living spaces on the second story.

635
00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.670
And then the rest of the villa is taken up in this case by a huge,

636
00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.540
hugely long pool,
uh,

637
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:24.370
that has statuary and the like around it.
Now,

638
00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:27.650
John Paul Getty decided again to use,
uh,

639
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:31.780
this Ville of the period as the model for the Getty villa.
Uh,

640
00:40:31.781 --> 00:40:36.070
and this is actually the Getty villa that you're looking at here from the error,

641
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:39.100
a painting of the Getty villa that you see from the air here.

642
00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:44.310
And you can see that it is almost exactly the same and plan as the actual villa

643
00:40:44.381 --> 00:40:47.920
of the Papiri.
So going to the Getty villa,

644
00:40:47.921 --> 00:40:51.700
and this is of course a view of that long pool.
At the Getty villa,

645
00:40:51.701 --> 00:40:56.110
going to the Getty villa is like going back in time to the Ville of the Papiri.

646
00:40:56.111 --> 00:41:00.400
And I know a lot of people think this is sort of Disneyland in Malibu or Roman

647
00:41:00.401 --> 00:41:04.270
version of Disneyland.
Yes,
to a certain extent.

648
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:09.250
But the truth of the matter is you will get a better sense of what a Roman villa

649
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:14.230
looked like.
Enrollment antiquity from going and looking at the Getty villa.

650
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:18.180
Then you will get from going and looking at the villa of the mysteries at palm

651
00:41:18.181 --> 00:41:23.181
pay only because they have restored it because it is in such good condition and

652
00:41:23.531 --> 00:41:28.270
because they have added to it the kind of plants that would have been used
there,

653
00:41:28.271 --> 00:41:32.050
the paintings are in good shape.
They've placed statuary,

654
00:41:32.051 --> 00:41:35.670
actual copies of the ancient statuary that would have been at the bill of that.

655
00:41:35.671 --> 00:41:39.200
The period cause hundreds of statues from the Ville of the preparer have

656
00:41:39.201 --> 00:41:43.640
survived.
Uh,
and uh,
they have,
you can see them all at the Getty.

657
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:46.910
I'm going to show you a few views of this because I think it's such an

658
00:41:46.911 --> 00:41:48.050
interesting topic.
I mean,

659
00:41:48.051 --> 00:41:52.370
I think one could write a very interesting paper on the original villa as seen

660
00:41:52.371 --> 00:41:55.360
through the eyes of the Getty Museum.
Uh,

661
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:59.180
for those of you who have either been there or have not been or have never been

662
00:41:59.181 --> 00:42:03.410
there,
just a few views.
The entrance way into the villa today,

663
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:05.240
one of the ramps they have,

664
00:42:05.241 --> 00:42:08.030
just if you saw this a few years ago and haven't been back,

665
00:42:08.031 --> 00:42:11.740
they have made some additions in the last several years,
uh,

666
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:15.410
including their version of a theater.
Uh,

667
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:17.240
and you can see it here in ancient theater,

668
00:42:17.241 --> 00:42:21.160
which you can see here with the caveat with the coup nay or wedge shaped

669
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:24.320
sections of seats to very good restaurants up above.
Uh,

670
00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.710
and then this is a view standing up on the top of the coffee,

671
00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:31.550
of looking down toward the orchestra,
toward the stage building,

672
00:42:31.551 --> 00:42:34.910
which is of course,
part of the Getty villa itself.
Uh,
and uh,

673
00:42:34.911 --> 00:42:38.030
you see also that the,
it's very accurate.
I mean,
it looks,

674
00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.680
it looks a little too new,

675
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:44.310
but it's very accurate and that they have even used here.
Uh,
the,
uh,

676
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:48.260
typical columns with the white top and the red bottom,
uh,
that we saw.

677
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:53.290
So characteristic of a architecture in palm pay and also in Herculaneum and a

678
00:42:54.711 --> 00:42:57.180
view of another pool with some famous,
uh,

679
00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.250
copies of some famous bronze dancers from Herculaneum.

680
00:43:01.251 --> 00:43:03.020
I'll show you the originals in a moment.

681
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:07.130
This is the Getty's version of first style Roman wall painting,
uh,

682
00:43:07.131 --> 00:43:11.840
along the walls.
Uh,
as you can see here,
it's not quite the same,
but nonetheless,

683
00:43:11.841 --> 00:43:15.920
it conjures up a what one of these walls would have looked like if you had it.

684
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:16.401
Uh,
you know,

685
00:43:16.401 --> 00:43:20.990
all the way along your corridor and they have second style Roman wall painting

686
00:43:20.991 --> 00:43:24.440
as well.
And these of course base,
they,
they look mostly at the villa,

687
00:43:24.441 --> 00:43:27.320
but when it came to the paintings,
they certainly used other models.
And you,

688
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:31.460
if you walk around the villa,
you'll be able to,
oh yeah.
That comes from the um,

689
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:32.630
the,
um,
this is a very,

690
00:43:32.631 --> 00:43:37.631
our apoc is like a motif with the garland on the columns and so on here.

691
00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:41.900
So second,
a style wall painting.
In this particular case.

692
00:43:41.901 --> 00:43:45.560
Here's another example of second style wall painting at the Getty where they

693
00:43:45.561 --> 00:43:50.561
have wonderfully incorporated the door and two of the windows into this second

694
00:43:50.811 --> 00:43:54.040
style scheme.
As you can see here.
Uh,

695
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:58.220
and here we were dealing with um,
an atrium in the Getty museum,

696
00:43:58.221 --> 00:43:59.570
which is based I think on,

697
00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:03.980
on a building that I'm sure you all know know and learned for the exam,

698
00:44:03.981 --> 00:44:06.980
which is which,
which house?
The Atrium of which house,

699
00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.510
<v 1>which
Betty</v>

700
00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:15.100
<v 0>I think Betty,
what about this second story up here?</v>

701
00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:17.770
Sam [inaudible] Sam night,

702
00:44:17.771 --> 00:44:22.060
the Sam Night House with its second story in the low Jah.
Uh,
and then with its,

703
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:26.290
with its improving them and it's comp bluebeam.
I'm,
this is,
this is a,

704
00:44:26.291 --> 00:44:30.240
this is really good stuff.
And then here,
here you see a view of one of the pools,

705
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:35.070
uh,
looking through the doors here,
they would've had the wooden door jams.

706
00:44:35.071 --> 00:44:37.530
We saw those in Herculaneum preserved,
uh,

707
00:44:37.531 --> 00:44:40.350
through that to the pool with the dancing women and men.

708
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:44.400
At the very end you see a fountain that is based exactly on the large fountain.

709
00:44:44.401 --> 00:44:47.610
I showed it to you earlier this term.
At palm pay.
Uh,

710
00:44:47.611 --> 00:44:51.810
and here this whole concept of Vista Panorama from one part of the house to

711
00:44:51.811 --> 00:44:56.310
another taking advantage of light streaming through the comp pluvial onto the

712
00:44:56.311 --> 00:45:01.080
pool.
Reflections in that pool statuary.
I mean this really conjures up,
as I said,

713
00:45:01.081 --> 00:45:02.640
better uh,
than anything.

714
00:45:02.641 --> 00:45:06.570
I can show you what an ancient Roman villa actually looked like.

715
00:45:06.571 --> 00:45:10.560
There are rooms like this at the Getty with marble incrustation that is very

716
00:45:10.561 --> 00:45:15.561
much like both marble incrustation we've seen and also like for style Roman wall

717
00:45:15.721 --> 00:45:16.990
painting,
uh,

718
00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:22.100
areas like this where you can see again the columns surrounding the garden with

719
00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:26.760
a rooms on the second story,
paintings for style paintings on the wall,

720
00:45:26.761 --> 00:45:29.640
statuary in the center and all of this,

721
00:45:29.641 --> 00:45:32.970
again based on the actual statuary that was found,
a great,

722
00:45:32.971 --> 00:45:37.920
a huge collection of statutes at this particular owner had that are now on view

723
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:42.150
and the archeological museum in Naples where copied a for this here.

724
00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:46.500
And then just another view showing that they too at the Getty Villa Malibu,

725
00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:51.600
we're very cognizant of the siding of the structure,
placing it on a cliff,

726
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:55.080
you know,
so that you can have a beautiful panorama,
uh,
down from there.

727
00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:59.160
Very much in line with the way the Romans cited their buildings.

728
00:45:59.161 --> 00:46:02.290
And then just quickly,
just to give you a sense of how compelling,
uh,

729
00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:05.340
some of the sculpture is from here.
These are the originals.

730
00:46:05.341 --> 00:46:10.080
This is the head of an original athlete or gladiatorial figure,

731
00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.440
uh,
from Herculaneum.
And you can see how vivid it is,

732
00:46:13.441 --> 00:46:14.790
especially it's done in bronze,

733
00:46:14.791 --> 00:46:18.990
but especially with the inlaid eyes that were customary for statues of this
type.

734
00:46:18.991 --> 00:46:23.910
This has got to be the best hair,
uh,
in Roman art.
I love this one,

735
00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:24.950
a fantastic fan,

736
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:29.950
fantastically dramatic photo of this particular head that also comes from the

737
00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:34.120
villa at the ability of the Papiri.
And here are dancing ladies.

738
00:46:34.121 --> 00:46:38.460
These are the original versions of the dancing women that would have surrounded

739
00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:41.850
a,
a pool in the actual villa at Herculaneum,

740
00:46:41.851 --> 00:46:46.170
extremely well preserved and in every possible posture.

741
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:50.490
As you can see here.
Uh,
if bill the architecture is your thing,

742
00:46:50.491 --> 00:46:55.460
but you're not interested in the Getty or in or in Herculaneum,
but are,

743
00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:59.370
uh,
an anglophile and want to do something in England.
I've got two topic,

744
00:46:59.371 --> 00:47:02.130
two British topics.
We're not going to look at Roman art in Britain.

745
00:47:02.131 --> 00:47:06.900
So for any of you who are particularly interested in art in the British isles
is,

746
00:47:06.901 --> 00:47:10.830
might be a good topic for you.
I have both a villa and a bath.

747
00:47:10.831 --> 00:47:14.400
This is the Roman villa at Fishburne and Sussex,
England.

748
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:17.670
It's a model of what that villa would have looked like.

749
00:47:17.671 --> 00:47:21.570
And you can see that it has a lot in common with the template pockets in Rome

750
00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:25.980
with it's great rectangular space.
And one of the buildings push back against it.

751
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.460
Uh,

752
00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.680
but one of the questions one would ask for this is for any buildings that were

753
00:47:29.681 --> 00:47:32.650
done somewhere other than Rome,
what is based in,

754
00:47:32.651 --> 00:47:36.450
how close is this to what's going on in Rome contemporaneously?
Uh,

755
00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:41.230
and what is different?
What has to do with local practice?
Uh,
if one visits the,

756
00:47:41.231 --> 00:47:46.130
um,
fish born villa today,
you can still see the mosaic floors,
uh,

757
00:47:46.131 --> 00:47:49.120
that are WellPreserved here.
Uh,
and you can also,

758
00:47:49.121 --> 00:47:54.070
here's the detail of one of them,
which is touted as the,
um,
the older,

759
00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:55.630
the oldest to be seen,

760
00:47:55.631 --> 00:47:59.930
the earliest to be seen anywhere in Britain as you can see from the label.
Uh,

761
00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:04.910
and you can even see it at the,
uh,
fish born villa for example,
a private bath,
uh,

762
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.270
with the hypo costs.

763
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:11.280
So clearly the impact of Rome is clear here and they even have a such a such

764
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:17.500
element's preserved as these roof tiles that you can see here on the right hand

765
00:48:17.501 --> 00:48:21.790
side.
Another British topic,
a is the Roman bath and bath.

766
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:27.190
I'll quite soulless.
Now in Avon,
England,
this is a view of a magnet,

767
00:48:27.191 --> 00:48:30.310
the magnificent city of bath itself as it looks today.

768
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:35.670
And here's a view of what a part of what is preserved of the Roman bath at bath,

769
00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:40.660
the water as green as the Tiber,
as you can see in this view.

770
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.170
Uh,
but this is part of the bath structure.
And again,

771
00:48:44.171 --> 00:48:46.360
what one would ask oneself is,
and there are,

772
00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:50.710
there's enough there that plans plans of what this Beth would have looked like a

773
00:48:50.711 --> 00:48:53.960
exist and one would ask oneself,
you know,
what,
what is this?
What,
what,

774
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:58.390
how does this compare to bas that we saw in Italy?
What is it,
you know,

775
00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:02.830
how does it compare to the bath that Pompei the forum bas or they stop being

776
00:49:02.831 --> 00:49:06.880
best to the imperial bath architecture of Titus,

777
00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:12.030
similar kinds of rooms.
What is the construction technique?
Who was this useful?

778
00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.130
Who did this belong to?
Who put this up and,
and what,

779
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:20.290
what part did it play in the social and cultural environment of the city?

780
00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:23.110
Uh,
and have acquired soulist in ancient Roman times,

781
00:49:23.111 --> 00:49:26.950
another view of that where you can see some of the stone construction.

782
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:31.490
And then once again,
a very WellPreserved hypo cost,
uh,
at,
uh,

783
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:35.800
the,
uh,
at the bath and bath as well as a very interesting,
uh,

784
00:49:35.801 --> 00:49:39.790
brick arch that you can see here.
So the whole question of technology,

785
00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:42.700
what kind of technology is used in buildings?

786
00:49:42.701 --> 00:49:46.600
Like this is an intriguing question.
Another great topic.

787
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:49.810
If you want to make your way to the Middle East to Masada.
Uh,

788
00:49:49.811 --> 00:49:54.100
this is the famous cliff at Masada.
I don't know how many of you have climbed.

789
00:49:54.101 --> 00:49:57.910
How many of you have climbed Masada?
Anyone climb this out?
A couple of you.
I did.

790
00:49:57.911 --> 00:50:01.640
You go on the snake path
saying you're sober.

791
00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.240
I didn't go on this eye and I was there a long time ago,

792
00:50:04.241 --> 00:50:08.440
so I should have gone on this path,
but I didn't.
I went on the cable cars.

793
00:50:08.441 --> 00:50:11.600
So here,
you know,
this is what you do when you go and you take the easy way out.

794
00:50:11.601 --> 00:50:13.410
Just take the cable car up.
Uh,

795
00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:16.540
but you can get some good pictures of other cable cars as well as of the

796
00:50:16.541 --> 00:50:17.890
mountain as you make your way.

797
00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:21.360
The thing to do is definitely to take the snake path,
uh,

798
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:25.270
up to the top of the peak of Masada,

799
00:50:25.271 --> 00:50:29.720
which is steeped in history as we know.
The particular aspect,
uh,

800
00:50:29.721 --> 00:50:34.440
that would be at issue here,
uh,
would be to look at the,
uh,

801
00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:38.300
Herod's Palace,
the Great Herod who about whom much is known,

802
00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:43.160
very interesting historical per character who was around in the first century

803
00:50:43.161 --> 00:50:45.830
BC,
the time of Julius Caesar and Cleopatra.

804
00:50:45.831 --> 00:50:48.230
And so on his palace at Massada,

805
00:50:48.231 --> 00:50:52.670
which was built on the top of the peak is particularly interesting given its

806
00:50:52.671 --> 00:50:56.720
date.
It's roughly contemporary to the sorts of things we saw going on in Italy,

807
00:50:56.721 --> 00:51:01.440
had Palestrina and at Tivoli,
the,
uh,
the,
the um,
the,
the,
the,

808
00:51:01.441 --> 00:51:06.170
the placement of,
of nutcase,
the pouring of concrete on a tiered hillside,

809
00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:10.430
uh,
in this case use of different materials as you can see here.

810
00:51:10.431 --> 00:51:13.900
But two views of what the Palace of,
uh,

811
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:18.230
Herod on Masada would have looked like.
Again,
a tiered structure,
multi,

812
00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:22.850
multi tiered structure through roughly three tiers.
So the question here is,

813
00:51:22.851 --> 00:51:25.580
you know,
what did he have in mind?
Why did he put it here?

814
00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:30.560
Why did he choose to represent it as a kind of cascading structure from top to

815
00:51:30.561 --> 00:51:34.970
bottom?
How does it compare to Palestrina and Tivoli?
Uh,
what is it made of?

816
00:51:34.971 --> 00:51:38.450
Is it made of concrete or is it made of something else?
And why,
uh,

817
00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:39.500
in each instance,

818
00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:43.670
what kind of architectural elements are used in this particular case?

819
00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.500
And if I show you a couple of details,

820
00:51:45.501 --> 00:51:49.430
you will see that Rome is not too far away in the sense that once again we see a

821
00:51:49.431 --> 00:51:54.431
hypercar system being used to heat the floor of this particular room in Herod's

822
00:51:54.521 --> 00:51:56.690
Palace.
Was this a bath or was this something else?

823
00:51:56.691 --> 00:52:01.340
Remember we saw the hypo cost also used to heat the floor of the missions,

824
00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:04.340
um,
dining room in his palace in Rome.

825
00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:07.280
And then over here look wall painting,

826
00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:12.200
very similar to what we see in Italy,
uh,
at roughly the same time.

827
00:52:12.201 --> 00:52:14.650
This is again,
BC.
So we're talking about,
uh,

828
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:19.310
first and especially second style Roman wall painting or the transition between

829
00:52:19.311 --> 00:52:22.640
first and second style Roman wall painting tombs.

830
00:52:22.641 --> 00:52:26.360
We've seen tombs are particularly interesting as a topic because they're so

831
00:52:26.361 --> 00:52:30.590
varied and have so much to do with the particular patrons who commissioned them.

832
00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:34.670
I showed you fleetingly,
the two tombs streets at palm pay,

833
00:52:34.671 --> 00:52:38.190
the via De supple Gri and the via new Chera.
Uh,

834
00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.630
and I told you that we would concentrate instead on tombs in Rome,

835
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:45.560
but they make a very interesting paper topic for someone who'd like to think

836
00:52:45.561 --> 00:52:49.040
further about palm pay.
And to think about the variety of tool,

837
00:52:49.041 --> 00:52:54.041
market texture in Pompei that varies from house tombs that look like houses to

838
00:52:54.261 --> 00:52:59.261
tombs that have columns in the second story was statues interspersed among them,

839
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.060
uh,
to uh,

840
00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:05.210
tombs that again have a niche in the center with statuary,

841
00:53:05.211 --> 00:53:09.140
unfortunately headless here,
but it PR prescript preserved inscriptions.

842
00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:13.100
So if you want to get into who these people were,
what we know about them,

843
00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.350
a kind of cultural study,
you could do that.

844
00:53:15.351 --> 00:53:19.100
And this is my favorite tomb on the via new and palm pay because it should

845
00:53:19.101 --> 00:53:22.980
remind you of something we saw earlier when we looked at Roman to marketecture.

846
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:26.880
What was that?
The columbaria,
the column Barton,

847
00:53:26.881 --> 00:53:31.881
the Bgr Codine but you'll remember that scheme of placing niches on a wall was

848
00:53:32.101 --> 00:53:36.120
for subterranean to architecture in Rome.

849
00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:39.000
And here we see it's,
it's just a great idea.
I mean,

850
00:53:39.001 --> 00:53:42.690
they took the idea of the columbarium and they slapped it on the front,

851
00:53:42.691 --> 00:53:46.530
on the facade of a tomb.
So you see two tiers here of niches,

852
00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:51.650
same kind of portraits that we saw or earns that we saw in the Venia codine comp

853
00:53:51.911 --> 00:53:53.820
columbaria and brought above ground,

854
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:57.730
same kind of inscriptions in front of each of them and made into a,

855
00:53:57.790 --> 00:54:02.790
the facade of this very interesting facade of a two a on the via new Chera in

856
00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:07.710
Pompei residential architecture in the Roman provinces,

857
00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:12.711
the houses in France at a place called a Vasovagal Algoma men Bozzio Volcom to

858
00:54:14.131 --> 00:54:19.020
your arm in antiquity.
Uh,
the,
uh,
the,
the French tout this as,

859
00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.650
uh,
the French Pompei.

860
00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:26.730
It is far from the French Pompei unfortunately because it doesn't have all of

861
00:54:26.731 --> 00:54:30.930
those public buildings.
It doesn't have an amphitheater or theater or,
oh,

862
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:35.280
Deon or you know,
so on and so forth.
But it does have some interesting houses.

863
00:54:35.281 --> 00:54:38.550
The houses are not as well preserved as those in Pompei.
Uh,

864
00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:42.330
but it's interesting to look at them.
This is a model of one of them,
uh,

865
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:46.800
showing the same sort of elements that we've seen in Italy.
The,
uh,
Paris.
Dot.

866
00:54:46.801 --> 00:54:50.940
This is the hellenized don't mistype Paris dial cord over here,
uh,

867
00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:54.270
the [inaudible] of the Atrium over here.
So it gives you,

868
00:54:54.271 --> 00:54:58.950
and then down on this end,
a colonnade with a pool in front of it.

869
00:54:58.951 --> 00:55:03.420
So in a very similar to the kinds of things that we saw in palm pay,
uh,

870
00:55:03.421 --> 00:55:07.710
this is a view of some of the,
of the ancient houses as they look today.

871
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:11.860
And as they make,
as they make up part of the modern town,
uh,

872
00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:16.290
that surrounds them in amazing on the whole men,
you can see that they're not,

873
00:55:16.291 --> 00:55:18.090
they're preserved only,
you know,
Melanie,

874
00:55:18.091 --> 00:55:20.340
the foundation's essentially are preserved,

875
00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:24.180
but enough of them are to give us a very good sense of the plans,

876
00:55:24.181 --> 00:55:26.010
the architectural plans of these.

877
00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:30.510
And it can be interesting to look at these in connection to what we have from

878
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:35.460
Pompei and to see how they stack up and whether they are different in any way

879
00:55:35.461 --> 00:55:39.900
because of the fact that they were put up and what was ancient goal and not in

880
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.801
Italy.

881
00:55:40.801 --> 00:55:45.801
And here a a a view of one of the peristyle courts of one of those as well as

882
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:50.970
um,
a mosaic.
And if you look at the what remains of the wall painting,

883
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:55.320
you can see that that is completely consistent with what's going on in Italy.

884
00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:58.830
At the same time.
Option two,

885
00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:00.780
I'm not going to go into in any detail,

886
00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:04.290
but you'll see when you look on the website for option two,

887
00:56:04.291 --> 00:56:05.930
that that's called selective building.

888
00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:09.450
Select a theme if there is nothing here that you liked,

889
00:56:09.451 --> 00:56:11.840
but you do want to do a research paper.
Uh,

890
00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:15.720
and there is some building that you've seen on your travels that we haven't

891
00:56:15.721 --> 00:56:19.350
talked about in this course or even a building that we have talked about in this

892
00:56:19.351 --> 00:56:24.220
course,
but talked about in a few minutes time that you would like to a paper on.

893
00:56:24.221 --> 00:56:27.180
For some reason you may do that.
Uh,

894
00:56:27.181 --> 00:56:29.620
and you would do it in the same way that you do the first one.

895
00:56:29.621 --> 00:56:30.790
It would be a research paper.

896
00:56:30.791 --> 00:56:34.340
You do re you will need to get permission from me to chew.

897
00:56:34.341 --> 00:56:36.190
You know which one you choose.

898
00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:40.150
You can do this either directly to me by email or by the teaching fellows.

899
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:42.020
You could go to them and uh,
they,

900
00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:45.790
they will likely be able to be my surrogate surrogate if the idea is good and if

901
00:56:45.791 --> 00:56:46.900
they have any concerns,

902
00:56:46.901 --> 00:56:50.290
they will let me know and we'll talk about it and we'll let you know would only

903
00:56:50.291 --> 00:56:54.160
be the reason I want you to come to us is just because if we think that there's

904
00:56:54.161 --> 00:56:57.060
absolutely no,
you know,
there's nothing to read on it.
It won't,

905
00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:00.580
it's going to be very hard for you to do.
We want you to alert you to that.

906
00:57:00.581 --> 00:57:03.340
We want to make sure you choose something where there's a lot of,

907
00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:06.390
a lot to think about and a lot to do.
Um,

908
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:10.480
that will be a fruitful experience for you.
So that's option two.

909
00:57:10.481 --> 00:57:14.830
And then option three is by far,
oh,
I forgot one.
I'm sorry.

910
00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:18.190
Very quickly.
The last topic,
under number one,

911
00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:22.540
the a tower tombs at Pal Myra.
We already talked about Palmyra in Syria.

912
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:27.460
You see that these tombs here,
a very distinctive,
these tall tower like tombs,

913
00:57:27.461 --> 00:57:30.570
which is why they're called tower tombs.
Here's one of them here,

914
00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:35.410
made out of local stone,
very stark.
Uh,
usually with,

915
00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:35.621
uh,

916
00:57:35.621 --> 00:57:40.270
a niche in the center that sometimes has a representation of a deceased member

917
00:57:40.271 --> 00:57:42.880
of the family lying on a bed.
Uh,

918
00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:47.650
and here are the interior of one of these very ornate coffered ceiling with

919
00:57:47.651 --> 00:57:50.680
paintings,
with portrait paintings and the top,

920
00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:54.100
and then a series of niches where you see a poor,

921
00:57:54.101 --> 00:57:58.480
either single portraits or group portraits of members of the same family.

922
00:57:58.481 --> 00:58:02.470
Sort of like what we saw on the outside of tombs on the,
via Apia in this case,

923
00:58:02.471 --> 00:58:03.580
on the inside of tombs.

924
00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:07.270
This would be an interesting topic for someone who would also like to use to go

925
00:58:07.271 --> 00:58:10.770
actually look at something at the yellow art gallery because we have,
uh,

926
00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:15.370
some of the portraits that come from these pal Myreen tombs in the Yale Art

927
00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:20.170
Gallery.
I show you one example of one of those here.
The last topic,

928
00:58:20.171 --> 00:58:23.860
my favorite by far,
and I really urge this is a tremendous amount of fun.

929
00:58:23.861 --> 00:58:28.510
So I really urge as many of you as possible,
who would like to be truly creative,

930
00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:33.270
uh,
to choose this topic.
It's design your own Roman city.
Uh,

931
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.590
you're an architect,
a city planner,

932
00:58:35.591 --> 00:58:38.140
you're competing for the major commission of your lifetime.

933
00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:43.320
I'll let you read the rest of that on the website of a colony of 10,000 people.

934
00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.870
You can build this anywhere in the Roman world that you want a,

935
00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:51.340
so if there's a particular place you've enjoyed vacationing and you want to put

936
00:58:51.341 --> 00:58:54.690
it there because you know that place,
well,
that's fine.
Uh,

937
00:58:54.691 --> 00:58:57.130
and you can almost do anything that you want to do.

938
00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:02.130
You can be as creative and as Zany as you want to be as you do this.
Uh,

939
00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:06.430
the only thing that I ask,
and you do need to do a paper along with this as well,

940
00:59:06.431 --> 00:59:09.790
which is a paper that you'll see from the,

941
00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:13.390
so they can need to be drawings which are either hand drawn or computer

942
00:59:13.391 --> 00:59:17.080
generated.
Uh,
that would usually include the city plan itself,

943
00:59:17.081 --> 00:59:20.820
although it doesn't have to and as selection of building.

944
00:59:20.821 --> 00:59:22.550
So it's going to take you some time to do.

945
00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:26.360
Obviously if you're skilled at drawing or you're an architecture major,

946
00:59:26.361 --> 00:59:29.030
you're going to be able to do this more readily than someone else.

947
00:59:29.031 --> 00:59:31.010
But I just want to urge those.
You don't have,
we have,

948
00:59:31.011 --> 00:59:33.560
we had one project with basically with stick figures one time.

949
00:59:33.561 --> 00:59:37.580
That was really fantastic.
So I mean,
even if your drawing skills are not great,

950
00:59:37.581 --> 00:59:42.230
it's the ideas that will we be impressed by great drawings.
You Bet we will.
But,

951
00:59:42.231 --> 00:59:47.030
but I don't want to discourage anyone for whom drawing is not your forte because

952
00:59:47.031 --> 00:59:51.710
I think it's really the ideas that count the creativity that counts,
uh,

953
00:59:51.711 --> 00:59:55.280
here.
Uh,
but you can choose any,
any location.
Oh,

954
00:59:55.281 --> 00:59:57.860
I mentioned that there's a paper that has described the colony,

955
00:59:57.861 --> 01:00:01.100
the reason for its construction,
giving,
giving it's name and again,

956
01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:05.450
be very creative here.
Uh,
it's date,
its location,
Italy or the provinces.

957
01:00:05.451 --> 01:00:08.120
You can pretty much put anything you want in these cities.

958
01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.510
But in that paper you have to explain why.
For example,

959
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:16.750
if you were to build a town in Asia minor and it were to be filled with concrete

960
01:00:17.571 --> 01:00:19.640
buildings,
which none of these towns were,

961
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:24.830
you have to explain why this particular town is filled with concrete buildings

962
01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.240
and,
and,
and you can come up with is crazy and explanation of that as possible.

963
01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:32.240
In fact,
the crazier the better.
Uh,
but,
but,
uh,

964
01:00:32.241 --> 01:00:35.810
you need to explain something like that so that we understand that,
you know,

965
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:39.320
there was no concrete architecture in this part of the world,
but this,

966
01:00:39.321 --> 01:00:43.490
this particular town is special because of the following reasons.

967
01:00:43.491 --> 01:00:45.920
So I think you can see how your creative juices can flow.

968
01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:47.840
I just want to show you very quickly in the,

969
01:00:47.841 --> 01:00:52.100
in the five or six minutes that remain a series of these that were done by

970
01:00:52.101 --> 01:00:54.040
students over time just to serve as that.

971
01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:58.010
I hope they won't be intimidating but rather to serve as an inspiration there a

972
01:00:58.011 --> 01:01:01.100
couple of them along the way that were done by students of architecture that are

973
01:01:01.101 --> 01:01:04.460
particularly good in terms of the drawings but others,

974
01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:07.070
others you'll see are quite simple and I want to show you,

975
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:10.850
so to not be intimidated by this particular topic,

976
01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:14.810
this is a wonderful acidity that someone created a on a harbor,

977
01:01:14.811 --> 01:01:15.860
you can see the docs,

978
01:01:15.861 --> 01:01:19.280
you can also see the port authority that has been added here as well as the

979
01:01:19.281 --> 01:01:23.690
warehouses.
There's some misspellings like Conoco July over here,
uh,

980
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.430
living in Bas,
I guess after Olivia.

981
01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:29.270
But look at this wonderful forum where we have a temple pushed up against one of

982
01:01:29.271 --> 01:01:30.080
the back walls.

983
01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.020
For some reason there's a touch trap alon in the middle of the forum,

984
01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:37.400
which kind of works for this street,
but I'm not exactly sure where it goes here,

985
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.010
but it's an interesting motif.
And then this market,

986
01:01:40.011 --> 01:01:41.690
this would have infesting circular and market,

987
01:01:41.691 --> 01:01:46.310
that kind of projects on one side creating a very interesting shape.

988
01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:49.310
Uh,
it gives you some idea,
but I've been a very regular plan.

989
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:51.230
As you can see for this particular city.

990
01:01:51.350 --> 01:01:54.470
This was done by a graduate student actually in the architecture school is a

991
01:01:54.471 --> 01:01:58.370
very extraordinary drawings and it was a huge plant.
Uh,
but,

992
01:01:58.371 --> 01:02:00.680
but just to show you again how creative it was,

993
01:02:00.681 --> 01:02:05.190
the city of Altos after Mars old tour of course.
Uh,
and you can see,
uh,

994
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:09.830
some wonderful motifs in a and a and a and you know,
all of them identified here,

995
01:02:09.831 --> 01:02:12.950
this large temple I to trap along.

996
01:02:12.951 --> 01:02:16.910
There's always a fascination with to trap Alonzo and this project,
uh,

997
01:02:16.911 --> 01:02:21.610
some other structures over here including a marketplace at seven,
but I love it.

998
01:02:21.611 --> 01:02:25.770
Six the Korea.
You never see a round Korea,
but this is a round Korea,

999
01:02:25.771 --> 01:02:29.490
which is absolutely terrific.
Uh,
opening off the basilica,

1000
01:02:29.491 --> 01:02:30.330
which you see over here,

1001
01:02:30.331 --> 01:02:35.230
which is very closely based on Basilican architecture of the tray Janick period

1002
01:02:35.231 --> 01:02:39.210
and into the seven period.
It's an interesting wedge shape.
Shops over here.

1003
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:42.720
So again,
it gives you some sense of what's possible.

1004
01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:47.760
This is not by an architecture student,
but a very,
another one of these port,
uh,

1005
01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:51.690
port,
uh,
cities,
uh,
that has a,
I the love this,
the sunken theater.

1006
01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:55.290
You can see the sunken theater that goes right into the sea over here on this

1007
01:02:55.291 --> 01:02:58.770
side,
but as well as the port,
you can see this was a Flavian.
So again,

1008
01:02:58.771 --> 01:03:02.910
you got to decide where you want to put it,
which period,
the Flavian a period.

1009
01:03:02.911 --> 01:03:07.620
So a Flavi and port city.
Uh,
this I a another one also,

1010
01:03:07.621 --> 01:03:12.030
I think from that same project where you can see the Flavian basilica,

1011
01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:16.050
I Aye,
a capitalism with a temple to Jupiter,
Juno and Minerva.

1012
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:20.350
And then Titus is honored over here with his statue and a couple of victory

1013
01:03:20.351 --> 01:03:24.980
statues.
Uh,
one on either side.
Again,
I think from the same project,
uh,

1014
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:29.910
this is the city itself where you can see it has an amphitheater.
Uh,

1015
01:03:29.911 --> 01:03:33.680
it has a basilica on a forum and it also has a colonated courtyard,

1016
01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:37.500
a colonated street.
If you build a colonated street in a town in Italy,

1017
01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:41.010
you got to explain why this is the only colonated street in the,

1018
01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.240
in a town in Italy.
If you put it in the east,
it's,
it's obvious same,

1019
01:03:45.241 --> 01:03:49.890
same project.
I think again,
the should be the tear,
my tt and the library.

1020
01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.790
But I love this because the person has identified the stone,
you know,

1021
01:03:53.791 --> 01:03:57.540
in the amphitheater here,
a stone has been important from all over the world,

1022
01:03:57.541 --> 01:03:59.780
from Syria and from emphasis,
uh,

1023
01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:03.540
to be used in this particular structure and arch.
Again,

1024
01:04:03.541 --> 01:04:07.110
I think also this was a very ambitious project in arch from that same project

1025
01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:11.640
with a victory at the top and an inscription.
Uh,
and then this,

1026
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:14.760
the victory gate again with the amphitheater in the background.

1027
01:04:14.761 --> 01:04:16.890
This was something simpler but interesting.

1028
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:21.480
A small fountain composite capitals,
coffered misspelled apps,

1029
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:26.010
a philosopher pose of Titus scalped pool,
uh,
with the triple basin.

1030
01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:30.930
This one very simple and very derivative in a way,
but I love this one.
Anyway.
Uh,

1031
01:04:30.931 --> 01:04:35.220
this house plan shows us that the person was basing it on which house it was

1032
01:04:35.221 --> 01:04:37.350
actually on the exam.
Although you didn't see the plan

1033
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:44.910
how's of the mosaic atrium,
because remember the up at the top,
the entrance way,

1034
01:04:44.911 --> 01:04:49.830
the Atrium and the Ecos at the far end in the form of a basilica.
So,
you know,

1035
01:04:49.831 --> 01:04:52.350
very derivative plan.
But I just love this touch.

1036
01:04:52.351 --> 01:04:53.790
There's just this touch did it for me.

1037
01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:58.470
Sticking those two palm trees in the center of the,
uh,
of the,

1038
01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:02.580
of the Paris Dell court was great and I forget again exactly where this town
was,

1039
01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:04.830
but it had something to do with that particular,
you know,

1040
01:05:04.831 --> 01:05:08.130
the kinds of flora and fauna of that particular part of the world.

1041
01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:11.620
This was another wonderful bond,
a big city plan,
a huge,
you know,

1042
01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:15.000
huge piece of Oak tag,
uh,
with the entire city,

1043
01:05:15.001 --> 01:05:19.410
a city of the seven period Rivera's with buildings,
honor,

1044
01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:23.380
honoring him and his son car call up,
for example.
But,
uh,
this one,

1045
01:05:23.381 --> 01:05:24.790
because if Timmy is severities,

1046
01:05:24.791 --> 01:05:29.200
his wife was particularly interested in astrological signs and used to tell him

1047
01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:33.880
each day what his day was going to be like based on those signs.
Uh,
the student,

1048
01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:35.930
uh,
incorporated,
um,
uh,

1049
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:39.970
elements of the mithratic mysteries and those astrological signs,

1050
01:05:39.971 --> 01:05:42.640
as you can see here in many of these buildings,
uh,

1051
01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:45.970
in Mithraic garden and so on and so forth,
which was really wonderful.

1052
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:51.040
This was great.
This was someone who made a book,
a book,
uh,
and,
uh,
included in,

1053
01:05:51.041 --> 01:05:52.420
it was kind of a treasure map,
you know,

1054
01:05:52.421 --> 01:05:57.350
that included a preamble to where this city was and interspersed within this and

1055
01:05:57.390 --> 01:06:01.630
we made,
was made to look very old as if it was just discovered,
uh,
by,
uh,

1056
01:06:01.631 --> 01:06:05.710
you know,
by Harrison Ford himself.
Uh,
and,
and we see,

1057
01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:10.030
we see the,
these wonderful plans interspersed with the text.

1058
01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:16.080
Then this a small,
simple house again with some wonderful wall paintings of,

1059
01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:20.530
I guess the third style.
And this my absolute favorites still to this day.

1060
01:06:20.531 --> 01:06:22.810
This was done very well.

1061
01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:27.840
I probably in the early eighties when I began teaching a version of this course

1062
01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:31.440
in the early eighties by a student,
uh,
who,
um,

1063
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:35.580
is Petrus Greenberg IOUs,
Peter Greenberg,
uh,
who,
uh,

1064
01:06:35.610 --> 01:06:39.760
who presented his project in the form of a scroll.
He knew very well.

1065
01:06:39.761 --> 01:06:41.860
There were no books at this time.
There were scrolls.

1066
01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.990
And so he presented this long scroll.

1067
01:06:43.991 --> 01:06:48.580
I can't even imagine how long this text took him to write on this scroll,

1068
01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:51.280
but it was a long scroll and it came and it was,
you know,

1069
01:06:51.281 --> 01:06:54.460
was tied up with a what nice ribbon and so on and so forth.

1070
01:06:54.461 --> 01:06:59.260
And you unfurled it and it had the text all about his town.
And,
uh,
you know,
he,

1071
01:06:59.261 --> 01:07:02.140
he was the architect,
if I remember correctly,
the designer,

1072
01:07:02.141 --> 01:07:05.980
and he was presenting his case to the emperor or to the empress and like,

1073
01:07:05.981 --> 01:07:10.610
you know,
me,
uh,
so he was presenting his,
he was presenting his case,
um,

1074
01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:14.080
to me about this city that he wanted to build and was I going to give him

1075
01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:15.070
permission to build it?

1076
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:19.420
So interspersed with this text where these wonderful drawings of what he had in

1077
01:07:19.421 --> 01:07:22.150
mind.
So,
I mean,
there are so many ways,
is one of many,

1078
01:07:22.151 --> 01:07:25.780
many wonderful ones that I've gotten.
I hope this will be inspirational to you.

1079
01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:30.040
Uh,
I can't say have a great break quite yet because we have class on Thursday.

1080
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:32.440
Uh,
but I know you're all looking forward to it,

1081
01:07:32.441 --> 01:07:35.530
and I hope that your travels can in some way,
uh,
include,

1082
01:07:35.531 --> 01:07:38.260
even if you're just going to the beach in Cannes cone,

1083
01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:42.580
I hope it can include in some way some thinking about buildings and about this

1084
01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:43.720
project.
Thank you.
