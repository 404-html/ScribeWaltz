1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.070
Good morning everyone.
We are finally there.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.600
We're finally at the coliseum,
the very icon of Rome.

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.950
And because I think of the coliseum is a very icon of Rome.

4
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:18.000
I've called today's lecture,
the creation of an icon,

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.960
the Coliseum and contemporary architecture in Rome.

6
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.540
But before we discuss the coliseum,
I want to say a few words,

7
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.460
a few more words about neuro,
the last of the Julio,
Claudia and emperors.

8
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:34.500
And I show you a portrait of Nero here.

9
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.890
Ensconced in his dome is our area with the fourth style wall of fabulous behind

10
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:42.444
him.

11
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.200
And I wanted to just say [inaudible] and bring your attention to the fact that

12
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:51.201
it really is quite amazing that we have the names of so many of Nero's artists

13
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:55.680
and architects and that can only attest to the fact that he must have gathered

14
00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:58.920
around him truly the greatest artists of the day,

15
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.680
artists whose accomplishments were so suburb,
uh,

16
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.870
that their names have been recorded for posterity at a time when very few

17
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.890
artists and architects names are recorded.

18
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.900
And I just want to remind you of that group.
Uh,

19
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.560
think of course of the painter of Nero,

20
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:21.450
the man who was responsible for painting the third style walls of Nero's Domus

21
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.040
area,
fabulous himself.
Uh,

22
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.170
and who also appears to have been the innovator of the fourth style of Roman

23
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:32.700
wall painting.
There was also Xena Doris,

24
00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:35.640
who was the most famous bronze caster of his day,

25
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:40.641
a Greek artist of great renown whom neuro hired to make his colossal statue,

26
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:43.360
the colossal statue,

27
00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:48.361
125 feet tall out of bronze that depicted neuro in the guise of the sun,

28
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:51.270
God,
Saul,

29
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.380
and a statue that was referred to as the colossus.

30
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.810
And lastly,
but not least,

31
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.840
by any stretch of the imagination with the two architects of Nero Severus and

32
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.110
Keller Roman architects,
we believe Severus Keller,

33
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:12.111
who were responsible for the Domus aurea itself for all the architectural

34
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:16.530
innovations and experimentations at the dome,
Miss Our area.
Uh,

35
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:21.531
and it was they who we believe we're the creators of the remarkable octagonal

36
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:24.120
room.
As I mentioned last time,

37
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:28.440
probably the most extraordinary room we've seen thus far this semester,

38
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:33.060
and one that's going to have lasting impact on later Roman buildings.

39
00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:36.390
And complexes.
So the octagonal room.

40
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:38.970
And also I mentioned to you other things in the villa,

41
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:43.590
including a banqueting hall with a revolving ceilings.
So these men,

42
00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:46.740
also great architectural innovators.

43
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.180
So when Nero is forced to commit suicide in 68,

44
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:54.780
we have to ask ourselves what happened to those artists?

45
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:59.770
What happened to those innovations after the day after Nero was discredited?

46
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.270
And I mentioned also last time that when Nero was,

47
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.190
was committed suicide,
when he was discredited,
he received an official dom,

48
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:13.330
not too Memoria I from the Senate,
uh,
damnation of his memory,

49
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:17.710
which meant that his portraits,
uh,
could not,
could be.

50
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.640
And we're encouraged to be destroyed.
And the same with his buildings.

51
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.540
So what is going to happen to the evolution of Roman architecture when one of

52
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:26.920
its greatest patrons,

53
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.160
someone who encouraged the greatest architects and artists of the day,
uh,

54
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.860
when he and his memory are annihilated and his buildings are destroyed,

55
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.710
what is going to happen to architectural innovation?

56
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:43.180
That's the main question we need to ask ourselves today as we look at the

57
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:46.120
buildings that were commissioned by his successors,

58
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:51.040
by members of the Flavian Dynasty.
Vespasian Titus and ultimately demission.

59
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.050
We'll talk about Vespasian today,

60
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:57.130
a bit on Titus and then more on Titus and demission on Tuesday.

61
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:59.220
What happens to these innovations,
uh,

62
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.550
when they begin to take over and when they begin to commission buildings and

63
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:05.260
we're going to see it's mixed,

64
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:09.330
we're going to see a certain move back toward a conservative,
uh,
vision.
Uh,

65
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.670
but we're also going to see that narrows innovations live on.

66
00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:15.520
And that's the most exciting piece of,

67
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:19.510
of this particular Flavian puzzle as we shall see.

68
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.670
So we see again,
neuro here.
Uh,
and when Nero,

69
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.450
when Nero died in 68,
a d,
uh,

70
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:32.020
what happened was not only that he received a dumb not to your Memoria,

71
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.720
but there were no other Julio.
Claudius is to succeed.

72
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:39.721
Him and Rome and the empire were plunged once again into a very serious civil

73
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:44.590
war,
a civil war that was as,
uh,
as profound,

74
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.090
profoundly,

75
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.190
profoundly troubling as the civil war that had followed Caesar's death.

76
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.440
Uh,
and,
uh,
Caesar's death is Caesar's death as you know,
in 44 BC.

77
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.770
And what emerged after the civil war or during the civil war was a one of the

78
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:06.490
most complicated,
uh,
and difficult years in Rome's history.

79
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:11.440
The year 68 to 69 during which Rome had four emperors,

80
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:15.340
not coal emperors as Rome to have much later in its history,

81
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.090
but competing emperors in very quick succession,

82
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:21.820
some of them holding onto power for only a few months.

83
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.720
These men were a ball ba Gal ba,

84
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.050
whose portrait you see on a coin in the upper left,

85
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.390
a bell boy who becomes emperor right after Nero's death.

86
00:05:32.391 --> 00:05:35.150
And you can see him in a no nonsense,
uh,
uh,

87
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.410
realistic portrait on that coin in the upper left.

88
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.300
He is succeeded very soon after by a man by the name of Ortho,
O,
t,
h.

89
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.141
O.
A.

90
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:49.141
You see him on the gold coin on the right Ortho who saw Nero as a soul mate and

91
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:54.190
had himself rendered very much with the neurosurgeon hairstyle as you can see.

92
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.270
And then third,
uh,
a man by the name of the telly is v I,
t,
e,
l,

93
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:00.350
l,
I,
U s,

94
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.060
but Tullius who seems to have had more chins than any other and for in the

95
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:09.350
history of Rome,
as you can see him,
this wonderful portrait now in Copenhagen.

96
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.480
And then ultimately Vespasian ves,
p a,
s I a n Vespasian,

97
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:15.080
uh,

98
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.080
who was the only one of these four who was able to hold onto power long enough

99
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.270
to create a new dynasty,

100
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.530
a new dynasty that he called after his family name,
Flavio.

101
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:31.460
This was his family name,
the so called Flavian Dynasty.

102
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.680
And the fortune was on his side because he had two sons to succeed him,

103
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.360
Titus and demission.
Uh,
and because he had two sons to succeed him,

104
00:06:41.361 --> 00:06:43.870
he was able to,
uh,
create a,

105
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.890
a quite successful dynasty as we shall see,
that had a lasting power.

106
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:52.100
So this is our second main imperial dynasty,

107
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:57.101
the Flavian Dynasty as opposed to the Augustan and Julio,

108
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.040
Claudia Dynasty.

109
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.040
Now Vespasian came to power in a civil war and like Augustus before him.

110
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:07.520
He recognized that although coming to power in the civil war could give you the

111
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:11.360
authority that you needed to govern.
It didn't give you the legitimacy.

112
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:15.980
It was very important in the eyes of the Romans to have had an important foreign

113
00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:18.860
victory to give your dynasty legitimacy.

114
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.210
Augustus came to power after his civil war with Marc Antony.
Uh,

115
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.170
but he looked to his victory over the Parthians in the eastern part of the

116
00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:31.640
Empire to give his reign legitimacy.
Vespasian does the same thing.

117
00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:35.030
He comes to power and the civil war,
he beats back other Romans.

118
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.780
So he has to look elsewhere for legitimacy.
And he also looks east.
Uh,

119
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.230
he looks specifically to Judea,

120
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.560
a antisense his son in his son Titus in a to do war against Jerusalem.

121
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.800
And Titus was victorious in the early Seventies.

122
00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:56.801
Aidy in this very important Jewish war that I'll have more to say about later

123
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.350
today.
And also,
uh,
especially on Tuesday.

124
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:06.200
So the space and also a con is a,
is a,
with his son,

125
00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:08.510
Titus is a victor and a foreign war.

126
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.020
And that becomes the basis of their right to rule.

127
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:15.170
And we'll see references to those Jewish wars in their art.

128
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.540
Even in our conversation today.
I also want to say with regard to Vespasian,

129
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:25.310
not only was he a,
uh,
a great military strategist,

130
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.630
uh,
but he also seems to have been an extremely shrewd politician.

131
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.950
Someone who recognized that you could use architecture in the service of

132
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:38.090
ideology.
And that's in fact what we're going to see him doing today.

133
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:41.660
And he starts this from the very beginning of his reign.

134
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.050
I go back here too,
and we'll look at it a number of times a day.

135
00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:48.500
It really is going to loom large in our,
in,
in today's discussion,

136
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:53.710
the site plan of Nero's don't miss our area that we looked at last time.

137
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.160
And you'll remember the location of the bold and house of Neuro up,

138
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.380
uh,
on the Espolon Hill.

139
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.520
The only part of it that's still survives the so called eschalon wing,

140
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:09.650
which you can see there and hear the great artificial lake,
uh,

141
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.670
the colossus buys and Doris located over there.
Uh,
and,

142
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.390
uh,
and you can see the way those are deployed,
uh,

143
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.800
in that 300 to 350,
uh,
area area,

144
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:25.630
that acres of area that,
uh,
that,
uh,

145
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.360
Nero had his architects build up.
Claudius,
excuse me,

146
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:35.460
Vespasian as he thinks about how to move forward with architecture and to begin

147
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:36.720
to commission buildings.

148
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.130
The first thing that strikes him very wisely is he does not want to associate

149
00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:42.420
himself with Nero.
In fact,

150
00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:47.040
he wants to disassociate himself with Nero who is now been damned,

151
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.150
but he looks back at the Julio Claudius and he recognizes that there is some

152
00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:53.870
merit in linking himself with them.
Uh,

153
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.120
and quite specifically with Claudius,
who was the,

154
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.080
it was the best after,

155
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.210
in addition to Augustus was the best of the more recent lot.

156
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.600
And Claudius was made into a god at his death.

157
00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:11.601
So he looks to Claudius and he notices the fact that there is a temple of

158
00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:17.871
Claudius that was begun on this very property by Claudia says wife.

159
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.780
Uh,
his last wife Ag.
We're Pina.
The younger,

160
00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:25.830
the woman with the poison mushrooms ag repeating to the younger who also you'll

161
00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:29.280
recall was the mother of neuro and Agra Pina.

162
00:10:29.281 --> 00:10:34.281
The younger had begun after Claudius is death and divinization a temple in honor

163
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.790
of Claudius Nero who had no,

164
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.630
no particular affection for his mother.
And his,
you'll remember had her murdered,

165
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.800
uh,
decided that he didn't want any part of her building project either and,

166
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.150
and put a stop to it,

167
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:53.151
especially when he decided that he had other plans for this particular area of

168
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:58.230
Rome.
Uh,
namely to build his pleasure palace.
So neuro stops construction.

169
00:10:58.231 --> 00:10:59.640
He doesn't destroy the building,

170
00:10:59.641 --> 00:11:03.240
but he stopped construction on it and just leaves it as it is.

171
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.440
The light bulb goes on for Vespasian investigation says to himself,

172
00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:11.730
the best way that I can use architecture to make a connection to make a link

173
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.860
between myself and the Julio,
Claudia Ans especially Claudius,

174
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.460
is to finish the temple of Claudius.

175
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.570
That Agora peanut began.
And that's exactly what he sets out to do.

176
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.630
And he does this at the very beginning of his reign.

177
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:30.780
We give a date of had a 72,

178
00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:35.700
the so called Temple of divine Claudius or at as as it is often referred to the

179
00:11:35.701 --> 00:11:36.880
Claudine,
um,
uh,

180
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:41.050
in Rome and you see again the location of that Claudia,

181
00:11:41.051 --> 00:11:42.150
a numb right here.

182
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.860
Now all that survives of this building today is its platform and I'm going to

183
00:11:46.861 --> 00:11:51.861
show you some details of that platform in a moment of a tall great platform like

184
00:11:51.991 --> 00:11:52.890
the platforms of the,

185
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:58.090
that we looked at earlier this semester upon which the temple rested.

186
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.930
All that survives is,
is that is part of that platform.

187
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:07.030
And what I show you first here is a restored view,
uh,

188
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:11.590
that comes from the Ward Perkins Textbook where you can get a very good sense of

189
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:13.420
what this platform look like.

190
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.680
It was a two storied platform as I think you can see very well.

191
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.750
It had barrel vaulted chambers,

192
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:23.830
it was made out of concrete barrel vaulted chambers made out of concrete.

193
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:29.020
And then on the front there were doorways at the bottom and windows on the

194
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:32.230
second tier.
And the facing the concrete,

195
00:12:32.231 --> 00:12:36.940
the facing for the concrete was travertine cut stone travertine,

196
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:40.510
which should immediately ring a bell because you'll remember that it was cut

197
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:45.511
stone travertine that was also used for Claudius is harbor at Portas,

198
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.170
uh,
and also for the port of majority in Rome.

199
00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:54.810
And you'll remember also the intriguing combination of,

200
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:55.711
of rust,

201
00:12:55.711 --> 00:13:00.711
dicated masonry and smooth masonry for those to Claudia and buildings.

202
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.070
The same is true here.

203
00:13:03.071 --> 00:13:07.330
So when Agra [inaudible] made a decision to put up a building honoring her

204
00:13:07.331 --> 00:13:11.800
husband after his death,
a temple that would be to him as a deepest,

205
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.480
she turns back to the style that he himself seems to have favored this

206
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:21.481
combination of rustication and finished masonry to use for that building.

207
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:25.240
And I think this underscores the point that I made last time.

208
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.850
This choice of style a of this Russ dicated Mason restyle,
uh,

209
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.680
is not something that happened by happenstance.

210
00:13:32.681 --> 00:13:35.200
It is likely because of Claudius,

211
00:13:35.201 --> 00:13:40.060
his own predilection as a patron so that when add repeat decided how would be,

212
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.850
how it would be best to honor him.
Architecturally,

213
00:13:42.851 --> 00:13:47.140
she wanted to honor him in the style that he himself liked.
Uh,

214
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.450
so she uses again,
this,
this combination of Rustic,

215
00:13:50.451 --> 00:13:54.230
hated and finished masonry.
I can show you again,
uh,

216
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:58.150
some preserve sections of the,
uh,

217
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.530
of the podium of the temple of divine Claudius that will make this even clearer.

218
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.740
Uh,
before I do.
And you see it on the right hand side of the screen.

219
00:14:05.741 --> 00:14:10.180
Just to remind you at the left of some of the great podia that we looked at

220
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.940
earlier this semester,
and since the exam is coming up,

221
00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:16.390
there's no time like the present to see if you know your stuff because then he

222
00:14:16.391 --> 00:14:20.500
can anyone identify this podium here on the left hand side of the screen?

223
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:26.590
Wendy
excellent.

224
00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:31.000
The sanctuary of Jupiter anchor at terror Cina that's the podium.

225
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.810
And you'll remember what was characteristic of it is that it was made out of

226
00:14:34.811 --> 00:14:37.550
concrete.
It was faced with opus and heritage.

227
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.640
It had travertine at the corners and over the arches and it had lateral arches

228
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:46.300
as well as others to allow the free flow of space.

229
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:51.190
So this idea of these great concrete podiums that served as the base for

230
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:56.120
sanctuaries.
It's the same idea here we see again,
a,
a,

231
00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:01.160
uh,
a podium that also has arches as you can see.

232
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.960
And then on the front of those arches,
in this case,
a great pilasters.

233
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.680
Uh,
and,
and if you look at those polarities very carefully,
and again,

234
00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:12.770
it's done out of travertine in this case,
when you look at those,

235
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.000
those very carefully,
you see,
uh,

236
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.830
something very interesting here that makes these slightly different from the

237
00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:21.620
other two that we saw.
Uh,
because you see,

238
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.900
you can see that the capital is finished.

239
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.080
You can see the upper part of the pilaster.
And then if you look very,

240
00:15:27.081 --> 00:15:29.870
and then below that,
of course you see these ruts dicated blocks.

241
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.410
But if you look at the,
uh,
the,
at the,

242
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.010
in between each of those rustic,
hated blogs very carefully,

243
00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:39.710
and I'll show you a better image in a moment where you can see this even more

244
00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:40.544
clearly.

245
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:45.580
You will see that part of the pilaster emerges in between each of those rust

246
00:15:46.401 --> 00:15:48.950
dicated blocks giving us even more.

247
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:53.510
The sense that that finished pilaster is somehow inside,

248
00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:54.920
uh,
the,
uh,

249
00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:59.940
is inside the rustic hated blocks waiting to emerge in a very interesting way.

250
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:01.550
We could,

251
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:06.500
we could psychoanalyze a Claudius we talked about his past and how he was not,

252
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.891
you know,

253
00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:11.180
he was ignored as a child and he was shunted aside and because he stammered and

254
00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:14.690
so on,
you know,
one could go very far and say that's Claudia's,
you know,

255
00:16:14.691 --> 00:16:18.800
waiting inside to,
to,
to be,
to emerge sometime does it,

256
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:23.450
there's like a cocoon that allows the butterfly to emerge at some point later in

257
00:16:23.451 --> 00:16:27.200
life.
Uh,
we could,
we could try that.
I don't know whether you would buy that,

258
00:16:27.201 --> 00:16:30.410
but I mean,
it's one way in which one can think about this sort of thing.

259
00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:32.060
But clearly,
whatever it meant,

260
00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.360
if it was just to point to his antiquarian interest,

261
00:16:35.361 --> 00:16:39.500
his interest in a more old fashioned stone construction at this particular
point,

262
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.390
uh,
it does seem to have something to do with the particular personality,

263
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.140
uh,
of this particular patron.
I,

264
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.970
here's another here's just comparing,
uh,
the,
uh,
the bay,

265
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:56.480
the podium of the Claudia and numb to the port majority in Rome.

266
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.780
Just to remind you of the rusty [inaudible] columns there,

267
00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:04.280
the rust dicated drums of these engaged columns.
And then at the upper most part,

268
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.650
uh,

269
00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:09.550
the way in which the upper part of the column and the Capitol are,

270
00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:13.310
are dressed smooth,
uh,
and,
uh,
seemed to emerge.

271
00:17:13.311 --> 00:17:17.960
And that's when I first made that point about the likelihood that the column

272
00:17:17.961 --> 00:17:22.550
that we're supposed to read.
This is the column completed inside,
just waiting,
uh,

273
00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.970
to,
uh,
to break free.
Uh,
and we see the same thing,

274
00:17:25.971 --> 00:17:28.070
but a further elaboration of that here.

275
00:17:28.071 --> 00:17:32.600
And I think you can see that much better in this particular detail where you can

276
00:17:32.601 --> 00:17:37.220
again see the entire Pilaster,
uh,
behind the rest.
[inaudible] masonry.

277
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.210
Uh,
you see the,
the,
uh,
the finish capitol,

278
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.760
the finished and tablature up above,

279
00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:48.650
and then you can make out the entire,
uh,
the entire pier all the way,

280
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:53.680
the polestar all the way down to the base and then super imposed or so it seems

281
00:17:53.761 --> 00:17:58.500
it's not really super imposes just carved a in this way,
but in between those,

282
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.750
these rust dicated blocks,
again,

283
00:18:00.751 --> 00:18:05.070
giving me at least the sense that the Polestar is done inside,

284
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:06.280
it's just waiting,
uh,

285
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:11.360
somehow for it's debut out of this travertine block.

286
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.620
Now what about the rest of the complex?
Uh,
we don't know exactly,

287
00:18:16.621 --> 00:18:21.450
but we have some general sense that it is quite likely that it was similar to

288
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.350
the,
um,
the sanctuaries that we looked at earlier.

289
00:18:25.351 --> 00:18:30.150
The sanctuary of Jupiter Ang,
sir at terror Cheena and Hercules at Tivoli.

290
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:30.841
And in fact,

291
00:18:30.841 --> 00:18:34.530
we do have some fragments of this on what is called the Marble Plan of Rome.

292
00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:38.430
I've referred to that before,
the so called Forma Orbis form,

293
00:18:38.431 --> 00:18:41.160
Orbis for RMA,
a new word,U ,
R,

294
00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:44.010
B I s the forma orbis,

295
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:48.560
which was a marble plan of Rome that was made in the early third century,
a,
uh,

296
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.530
which was housed in a building that I'm going to show you later today.
Uh,

297
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:56.310
and there are fragments of this structure there that give us a sense of what it

298
00:18:56.311 --> 00:18:59.520
looked like.
And then in antiquity,
so we would have had the podium,

299
00:18:59.521 --> 00:19:00.600
it's misread stored here.

300
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.950
You have to imagine the two tiers that we just looked at before,

301
00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.470
not this sort of thing.
Uh,

302
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:10.170
but those beneath a serving as the podium or the decoration of the podium and

303
00:19:10.171 --> 00:19:15.090
then above a large rectangular space with a temple pushed not quite to the edge

304
00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:15.841
of the back wall,

305
00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:20.841
but one of toward one of the walls dominating the space in front of it.

306
00:19:20.971 --> 00:19:23.850
As you can see,
we don't know exactly what that temple looked like,

307
00:19:23.851 --> 00:19:28.170
but it was probably a fairly conventional temple on the order of so many that

308
00:19:28.171 --> 00:19:31.500
we've looked at this semester.
What's interesting about this,

309
00:19:31.501 --> 00:19:36.180
it's different from the other sanctuaries that we saw is that in the rectangular

310
00:19:36.181 --> 00:19:38.840
space above,
they seem to have planted a,

311
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.480
a lot of bushes as you can see here.
And that becomes very,

312
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:47.540
very popular way of decorating a these kinds of complex is in the Flavian

313
00:19:48.511 --> 00:19:51.570
period.
We'll see another example later today,

314
00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.250
the greatest,
the most famous,
uh,

315
00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:01.340
building that was put up by Vespasian in the Flavian period was the so called

316
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:04.250
Colosseum,
uh,

317
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:09.260
which he began in the year 70 d so contemporaneous to the,

318
00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:13.150
uh,
to the construction of the Claudia [inaudible].
Uh,

319
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.800
but it wasn't finished until after his death.
He died in [inaudible] 79.

320
00:20:16.801 --> 00:20:19.470
He was emperor for nine years,
died of natural causes.

321
00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:24.300
It wasn't completed until his son Titus became emperor and Titus completed it

322
00:20:24.301 --> 00:20:28.670
and dedicated it.
In the year 80,
we see,
uh,

323
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:33.710
a view of the coliseum from above a Google earth image of the coliseum from

324
00:20:34.951 --> 00:20:35.700
above.

325
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.080
It was a very large amphitheater that could hold 50,000 people.

326
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.990
It was made of concrete as we shall see.

327
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.710
And this aerial view is very helpful because it shows its relations,

328
00:20:46.711 --> 00:20:50.500
shows its scale,
its size.
Uh,
it shows that in Rome today,

329
00:20:50.501 --> 00:20:54.250
it serves as a kind of giant traffic circle.
As you can see here,

330
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:58.690
the Romans love the coliseum because it is an icon of their civilization,

331
00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:02.800
but at the same time they hate it and they're always saying would,
would,
did it,

332
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.060
we could just get rid of it so the traffic would be smoother,
uh,

333
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.480
in this part of Rome.
And in fact,
there was a scheme a number of years ago now,

334
00:21:10.481 --> 00:21:15.130
probably several decades ago by now,
there was,
um,
a Texan,
uh,

335
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.270
who,

336
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:21.270
who was actually interested in buying the coliseum and bringing it to Texas,

337
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:26.200
uh,
to display on his ranch.
Uh,
and,
uh,
fortunately,

338
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:28.550
I mean that Italy gave us some thought to that.
Uh,

339
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:32.910
but they decided obviously that they were not going to part with the coliseum.

340
00:21:32.911 --> 00:21:36.940
And fortunately it has stayed intact and I don't think the Romans would have

341
00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:38.890
been too happy about that at the end of the day,

342
00:21:38.891 --> 00:21:42.010
despite the fact that they curse it out on a fairly regular basis.

343
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.720
But we see it here and it's useful view because it shows it in conjunction to so

344
00:21:46.721 --> 00:21:50.770
many of the other buildings and complexes we've been talking about thus far.

345
00:21:50.771 --> 00:21:55.030
This semester we're looking back from at toward the later arch of Constantine

346
00:21:55.031 --> 00:21:56.740
that we'll look at at the very end of the course,

347
00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.600
the Palatine hill in the upper left,
uh,

348
00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:04.570
the Roman forum beginning over here with the temple of Venus and Roma that was

349
00:22:04.571 --> 00:22:08.410
done in the second century.
We'll talk about that also later here.

350
00:22:08.411 --> 00:22:11.110
The great via day Florian periodically,
uh,

351
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:16.090
designed at the behest of my Salini and on the right side of course,

352
00:22:16.091 --> 00:22:20.360
the imperial fora with the forum of Julius Caesar and the Forum of Augustus,
uh,

353
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.550
that we have also looked at this semester.
Uh,

354
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:29.370
so here,
here you see it here and then I'm going to show you,
uh,

355
00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.101
once again,

356
00:22:30.101 --> 00:22:34.930
the site plan of Nero because it's important to know one of the most important

357
00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:39.640
things to know about this monument is where it was cited and where it was cited

358
00:22:39.641 --> 00:22:44.641
shows us again how incredibly shrewd Vespasian was when it came to establishing

359
00:22:45.911 --> 00:22:47.110
a political agenda.

360
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:51.910
And when it came to trying to court the favor of the public,
uh,

361
00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.420
he decided to raise,
and we,
I mentioned this before,

362
00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:59.530
he raised to the ground Nero's Domus our area destroyed it,

363
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.610
destroyed it despite the fact that it had been done by these great architects,

364
00:23:03.611 --> 00:23:06.230
despite the fact that it had,
was revolving ceilings,

365
00:23:06.231 --> 00:23:09.700
would have been a really cool place for him to live himself.
Think about it.
Uh,

366
00:23:09.701 --> 00:23:11.320
he and his dynasty,
uh,

367
00:23:11.321 --> 00:23:15.730
but he decided to raise it to the ground for political reasons to discredit Nero

368
00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.970
and,
and he hoped to gain favor with the populous.

369
00:23:18.971 --> 00:23:22.990
And what he did smartly was to say,
what am I going to do with this property?

370
00:23:22.991 --> 00:23:26.800
I'm going to return this property to the Roman people.

371
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.100
I'm going to build on it.
Something that they would really like to have.

372
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:35.310
So what he does is he fills in the artificial lake and he uses the area on which

373
00:23:36.551 --> 00:23:39.170
the artificial lake was originally,
uh,

374
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.280
located to build the coliseum.

375
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:47.340
He puts the coliseum right on the location of the artificial lake.

376
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.040
And the message is clear.
What did the Roman people want?
More than anything else.

377
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:55.100
They wanted another,
and they wanted an amphitheater where they could go.

378
00:23:55.101 --> 00:24:00.050
A large amphitheater were 50,000 of them could pack in and watch animal and

379
00:24:00.051 --> 00:24:01.520
gladiatorial combat.

380
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:05.270
There is no better way to gain favor with the Roman populace.

381
00:24:05.271 --> 00:24:09.770
And to build a building like this and to build it on top of Nero's pleasurable

382
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.820
artificial lake,

383
00:24:10.821 --> 00:24:15.821
pleasurable only for himself was a huge coup on the part of this Bayesian.

384
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:20.750
And we see that happening here and right in proximity to the temple of divine

385
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:25.820
Claudius.
Notice the fact also that the,
the location of the Coliseum,

386
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.800
very close to the colossus,

387
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:32.790
the name of the Colosseum was really the Flavian amphitheater,
uh,

388
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:37.400
after the family name Flavius the Flavian amphitheater.

389
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.300
That's how it was known in antiquity,
but it has to be,

390
00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.880
it came quickly to be known as the coliseum,

391
00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.540
not because of its colossal scale,
which is what most people think,

392
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:52.440
but because of the colossus,
because of the statue,
uh,
of,
uh,

393
00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.280
of Xena,
Doris that stood nearby.
And by the way,

394
00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:00.400
the other thing that Vespasian did was to have the features of Nero raced on

395
00:25:00.621 --> 00:25:05.510
that portrait and,
uh,
to make them into the more generic features of the sun.
God,

396
00:25:05.511 --> 00:25:10.490
Saul himself.
So the statute continued to stand,
but it was fixed up.
Uh,

397
00:25:10.491 --> 00:25:15.250
it was redone,
remade a so that it would look like Saul and not like neuro.
Uh,

398
00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.440
but again,
the coliseum takes its name from that.
So if you are in any,

399
00:25:18.441 --> 00:25:22.970
we used to have a coliseum here in new haven,
uh,
but it,
it,
if,

400
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.350
if you are in the future in any arenas that are called coliseums,

401
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.120
you'll know that that name,

402
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.670
it goes back to the Colossus of neuro colossus of Saul.
Uh,

403
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:36.050
not to the coliseum itself.
Ultimately,

404
00:25:36.051 --> 00:25:37.880
although I think those who named those arenas,

405
00:25:37.881 --> 00:25:42.860
we're obviously thinking about the Colosseum in Rome.
So the location of this,

406
00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.400
of the coliseum,
extremely important and,

407
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:50.180
and a political statement on this patient's part and we see them,
this man,

408
00:25:50.181 --> 00:25:55.181
this emperor of Rome Vespasian very cleverly using architecture to,

409
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.320
uh,
to,
uh,
to,
uh,

410
00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.680
further his own personal and political agenda.

411
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:07.360
This view also this plan cross section and a axonometric view that all come from

412
00:26:08.541 --> 00:26:13.010
ward Perkins are also very helpful in us getting a sense of this building.

413
00:26:13.011 --> 00:26:17.300
And I think you can see very quickly,
uh,
that like all other amphitheaters,

414
00:26:17.301 --> 00:26:22.190
it had an oval or elliptical plan.
Uh,
it was built up with concrete,

415
00:26:22.191 --> 00:26:26.390
a series of barrel and annular volts.
Uh,
and those,

416
00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:31.560
that elliptical plan included essentially radiating a barrel vaults that barrel

417
00:26:32.661 --> 00:26:37.661
vaulted ramps and passageways and a series of annular volted carters that

418
00:26:38.541 --> 00:26:43.440
provide lateral circulation and that are a buttressed by the thrust of the

419
00:26:43.441 --> 00:26:44.220
seating.

420
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:49.220
So it's a scheme that we know already from the amphitheater Pompei we know it

421
00:26:50.011 --> 00:26:53.570
also particularly well from the theater of Marcellus enrollment.

422
00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.120
Theater of Marcellus in Rome was just down the street practically.

423
00:26:57.121 --> 00:27:01.030
I'll show you an aerial view later to show you its proximity to the coliseum.

424
00:27:01.031 --> 00:27:04.910
It's not right next to it,
but it's within striking distance.
And uh,

425
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.780
it clearly the experiments,

426
00:27:06.781 --> 00:27:09.810
the architectural experiments and the Augustan period at the theater of

427
00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:14.811
Marcellus were very important in terms of this particular design.

428
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:17.610
It basically follows the same general scheme.

429
00:27:17.611 --> 00:27:20.520
The major difference of course is that since the theater of Marcellus was a

430
00:27:20.521 --> 00:27:23.190
theater,
it was semicircular and plan.

431
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:28.110
Whereas amphitheater architecture is always elliptical in plan and that is the

432
00:27:28.111 --> 00:27:31.410
case also for the coliseum.

433
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:37.290
If we look at the,
I mentioned that there are annular vaulted Carter's,

434
00:27:37.291 --> 00:27:42.000
we're looking at the card or on the first floor of the coliseum and you can see

435
00:27:42.001 --> 00:27:44.910
very quickly that it is of course made of concrete.

436
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.180
How else would you get these annual or bolts that you see here?

437
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:52.110
They're very well preserved.
They're easy to study and you can see that those,

438
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:56.410
those uh,
annular vaults rest on great stone piers,

439
00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:01.290
these stone piers made out of travertine.
Again,

440
00:28:01.291 --> 00:28:02.490
you can see that,
uh,

441
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:07.410
extremely well in this particular view on the set.

442
00:28:07.411 --> 00:28:09.990
That's the first floor on the second floor.
However,

443
00:28:09.991 --> 00:28:14.991
we see something entirely innovative and that is the introduction of a new form

444
00:28:16.081 --> 00:28:18.670
of vault that we haven't seen before.
Uh,

445
00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:22.400
this is the so called groin or ripped vault,
uh,

446
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:27.330
spelled exactly as you think it would be.
G,
R o I n groin vault or the rib bald.

447
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.441
And you get when you,

448
00:28:28.441 --> 00:28:33.330
when you take two barrel vaults and make them intersect the angles that you get,

449
00:28:33.331 --> 00:28:36.300
create a this kind of groin vault.

450
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:41.070
And I show you a diagram here which makes that clear I think to you.

451
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:46.400
And then a view of the second story Carter is to show you these are actual groin

452
00:28:46.891 --> 00:28:51.240
vaults,
these rib bolts that you see here,
which are very interesting and,
and add,

453
00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:55.170
add something I think,
uh,
to these structures.

454
00:28:55.171 --> 00:28:56.280
And they become very,

455
00:28:56.281 --> 00:28:59.550
very popular after they begin to be used in the Flavian period.

456
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.210
They become very popular.
And we'll see,
uh,

457
00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:06.780
the proliferation of growing vaults from this time on.
So we talked,

458
00:29:06.781 --> 00:29:10.200
I talked at the beginning about what,
you know,
what,
what is concerned,
what,
what,

459
00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:11.243
what is,

460
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:16.230
are the innovations of Nero's a domus salary a continued under the Flavian.

461
00:29:16.231 --> 00:29:21.120
So we know that they,
the architects of Nero did not use groin vaults,

462
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.330
but they were very interested in the free flow of space.

463
00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:29.040
And that interest in the free flow of space continues here as does

464
00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:33.930
experimentation with concrete and we see it in the use of these groin vaults on

465
00:29:33.931 --> 00:29:37.410
the second story of the Colosseum in Rome.

466
00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.470
When you visit the Colosseum in Rome today,

467
00:29:40.471 --> 00:29:44.590
you'll note that it does seem quite stripped bare unfortunately.
Uh,

468
00:29:44.591 --> 00:29:48.250
but it's important for you to be aware of the fact that it too was highly

469
00:29:48.251 --> 00:29:51.100
decorated as so many other Roman buildings.

470
00:29:51.101 --> 00:29:55.540
And we do have engravings that were made grievings and paintings that were made,

471
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:55.960
uh,

472
00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.960
when the coliseum was in better condition and when some of that stucco and

473
00:30:01.211 --> 00:30:03.220
painted decorations still existed.

474
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:07.750
And I show you two drawings here that give you some sense of that and you can

475
00:30:07.751 --> 00:30:11.390
see that all the surface was covered with stucco.
Uh,

476
00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.940
and then with figural decoration,
all of which was painted both the,
uh,
the,

477
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.350
the vaults themselves,
as you can see above.
And,
uh,
the carters,

478
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:21.310
all of that,

479
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:25.630
a very elaborately decorated in ancient Roman times.

480
00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.820
This is obviously an exterior view of the Colosseum in Rome.

481
00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.880
The exterior of the building is actually quite well preserved.

482
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.540
And I think as you gaze at it,

483
00:30:35.541 --> 00:30:40.541
and you certainly are struck by the similarity of the scheme to the scheme of

484
00:30:40.571 --> 00:30:44.560
the theater of Marcellus in Rome.
Uh,
in this case,

485
00:30:44.561 --> 00:30:47.050
the theater of Marcellus appears to have had three stories,

486
00:30:47.051 --> 00:30:51.280
only two of which are currently preserved.
This had four stories,

487
00:30:51.281 --> 00:30:56.110
four tiers,
as you can see here.
Uh,
again,
the structure itself is concrete.

488
00:30:56.111 --> 00:30:59.830
The facing is travertine.
We see these great arches,

489
00:30:59.831 --> 00:31:03.820
these great arcades just as we saw them in the theater of Marcellus.

490
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:08.440
And then also just like the scheme of the theater of Marcellus columns that are

491
00:31:08.441 --> 00:31:12.940
placed in between those arches on the first three stories,

492
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.630
uh,
the columns in between those arches on the first three stories,

493
00:31:16.631 --> 00:31:21.631
just as the theater of Marcellus have no structural purpose whatsoever.

494
00:31:22.721 --> 00:31:27.490
They do not hold the building up as they would have in a Greek or a trust skin

495
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.500
context.
They are,

496
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.140
the building is held up by the barrel and the annular,

497
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:37.600
the barrel and annual or bolts that are made out of concrete.
Uh,
so these,

498
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.200
these columns have no structural purpose whatsoever,

499
00:31:41.201 --> 00:31:45.820
and they are here essentially as the icing on the cake as ornamentation or

500
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:50.770
decoration,
but ornamentation or decoration that has certain meaning to it,

501
00:31:50.771 --> 00:31:55.690
a meaning that certainly conjures up ancient Greece because you can see here

502
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.500
that they have used all the Greek orders,
the doric order,

503
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:03.220
the ionic order in the second story,
the Corinthian order.

504
00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:06.700
All of these are engaged columns,
the Corinthian order in the third story.

505
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.910
And then in the fourth story we see they use pilasters.

506
00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:13.540
These are Corinthian pilasters once again.

507
00:32:13.541 --> 00:32:18.541
So doric ionic Corinthian Corinthian again at the upper most part columns that

508
00:32:18.971 --> 00:32:22.720
have no structure that are used here as pure decoration,

509
00:32:22.721 --> 00:32:26.320
but decoration that again has an ideological connection.

510
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:31.960
At the very top,
you can see the detail of the pilasters between them.

511
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:36.380
You see some travertine who's me blocks,
uh,

512
00:32:36.381 --> 00:32:39.200
that are,
uh,
brackets it stick out on.

513
00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.530
Those were to support the wooden poles that you'll remember from our

514
00:32:42.531 --> 00:32:45.550
conversation about the amphitheater at Pompei,
uh,

515
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:49.680
supported the awning that was used,
uh,
when,
uh,

516
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:54.650
there was rain.
Two more views of the exterior of the coliseum,

517
00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.910
little bit closer up where you can see very well here the doric order in the

518
00:32:58.911 --> 00:33:03.650
first story travertine facing the ionic order in the second story.

519
00:33:03.651 --> 00:33:08.651
And then the Corinthian engaged columns here and the Corinthian pilasters.

520
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:09.821
Uh,

521
00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:14.821
and then also the brackets extremely well preserved on the Pantheon,

522
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.390
the Colosseum in Rome.

523
00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:20.930
The interior is a different story entirely.

524
00:33:20.931 --> 00:33:23.870
It is not as well preserved as the exterior.

525
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.210
It is fascinating however to see.

526
00:33:26.211 --> 00:33:30.650
And I think you can tell from this particular view of the interior where we have

527
00:33:30.651 --> 00:33:35.280
so far.
So as always we have so many tourists,
uh,
inside the Colosseum.

528
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:35.860
Uh,

529
00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:40.280
I think they are very useful because they give you a very good sense of scale of

530
00:33:40.281 --> 00:33:43.730
how truly enormous,
uh,
this building is a,

531
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:48.470
they also show you that much of what was once there is no longer there in the

532
00:33:48.471 --> 00:33:51.260
interior of the structure.
As we look down on it,

533
00:33:51.261 --> 00:33:53.630
we can see the elliptical shape of the arena.

534
00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.590
We can see the substructures here,
all native concrete.

535
00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:02.620
The ones that are below the arena itself were used for the storage of props,

536
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.670
uh,

537
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:09.670
but also for the housing of the animals that were brought up for animal combat.

538
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:14.360
There were small k,
there were small and larger cages down here.

539
00:34:14.361 --> 00:34:17.370
And I'm going to show you what those look like in a moment.
Uh,

540
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:22.220
so that's the location of those,
but again,
not in very good condition today.

541
00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:27.440
Uh,
even more striking is the fact that although you can see again,
the,
uh,

542
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:30.040
the concrete substructures for this,

543
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.920
the seats on which the Kavya rested.
If you look very carefully,

544
00:34:33.921 --> 00:34:36.710
you will see there's only a single coonass,
uh,

545
00:34:36.711 --> 00:34:40.550
that is still preserved with a small number of marble,

546
00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:45.530
a marble seats.
The whole thing was she then marble in antiquity,

547
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:50.330
all of the seats would have been marble.
Uh,
only that small section is preserved.

548
00:34:50.331 --> 00:34:52.910
And I can show you another view where we see the same here.

549
00:34:52.911 --> 00:34:54.050
We're looking at that one.

550
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.790
A KUNAE is over here with that one set of marble seats,

551
00:34:58.791 --> 00:35:03.410
the only marble seats that are still preserved in the Colosseum today.

552
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:07.570
Why is that?
You ask yourselves and you might ask me.
Uh,

553
00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:12.610
the reason for that is that the coliseum was used as a marble quarry,

554
00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:18.030
uh,
for,
for,
for,
for practically from the time,
uh,
you know,
I mean not,

555
00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:21.710
not too long after it was built,
but certainly in the post end t period,

556
00:35:21.711 --> 00:35:25.340
it was used very significantly as a marble quarry by whom?

557
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.340
By the great princes.
And even by the pope's,

558
00:35:28.341 --> 00:35:32.660
the popes did not hesitate to plunge the Coliseum for the marble that they

559
00:35:32.661 --> 00:35:37.600
needed for the buildings that they were putting up around Rome at the Colosseum

560
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:41.250
ended up in some extraordinary building.
So it was not for naught,

561
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:46.370
but at the same time,
obviously it,
it changed the face of the interior of the,

562
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.860
of the Colosseum forever as we can see.
So well here,

563
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:56.270
two models of what the substructures would have looked like in the area of the

564
00:35:57.991 --> 00:36:00.920
coliseum where the animals were kept.
Uh,

565
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:04.170
and they had a system of ramps,
uh,

566
00:36:04.171 --> 00:36:07.260
and pulleys that then they took the animals up,

567
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:11.280
either up the ramps or by Pulley,
uh,
from these cages.

568
00:36:11.281 --> 00:36:13.860
You can see they had a metal grills in front of them.

569
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:18.780
Animals with diverse animals kept uh,
down here below and then brought up,

570
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.620
uh,
when needed through openings in the,
uh,
in the flow,

571
00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:27.270
the pavement of the arena.
The arena would have been paved with concrete.

572
00:36:27.271 --> 00:36:30.620
We have other examples of that elsewhere.
I'm going to show you one today.
Uh,

573
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:32.930
and there would have been holes in that,
uh,

574
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.140
by which you could bring the animals up to the arena.

575
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.950
This is a restored view of what the Coliseum would have.

576
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.460
The interior of the Colosseum would have looked like in antiquity.
Uh,

577
00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.210
when a performance,
it was,
uh,
when I,
when I,

578
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.770
the gladiatorial performance was taking place,

579
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:54.030
we see that what they did was they covered over the arena with some kind of

580
00:36:54.031 --> 00:36:57.450
ancient version of astro turf.
Uh,
they planted,

581
00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:02.010
they put trees that fake probably,
I dunno,
real or fake trees,
not sure which,
uh,

582
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.420
props that were,
that took the shape of,
of mountains as you can see here.

583
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:11.040
And then the gladiatorial combat or the animal combat would take place against

584
00:37:11.041 --> 00:37:14.860
that backdrop.
You can also see the street of the seats,
the wet,

585
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:18.650
the coffee of the wedge shape sections of those seats,
the Kootenay,
uh,

586
00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:23.230
the 50,000 people packed in a for this special event.
And then,
uh,

587
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.720
at the upper most part you see the awning or this particular artist's rendition

588
00:37:27.721 --> 00:37:28.291
of the awning.

589
00:37:28.291 --> 00:37:32.040
I think it's very amusing that the artist is rendered it like an Oculus,

590
00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:35.040
which is pretty unlikely that it looked quite like that,

591
00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.640
but I guess that's a very Roman thing to do.
So he did that.
Uh,
but it looks,

592
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:42.780
it looked probably an antiquity quite a bit more like the awning that we saw in

593
00:37:42.781 --> 00:37:44.730
the painting in palm pay,
uh,

594
00:37:44.731 --> 00:37:49.680
that represented a characteristic awning for a Roman amphitheater.

595
00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:51.360
The Coliseum,

596
00:37:51.361 --> 00:37:55.470
extremely famous and its own day continued to be famous in antiquity.

597
00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:59.190
I show you here a coin,

598
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.290
the reverse of a coin of a boy,

599
00:38:01.291 --> 00:38:05.220
emperor by the name of Gordian the third you see Gordian up there,
uh,

600
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:09.780
the reverse of his coin and the third and the early Third Century d showing the

601
00:38:09.781 --> 00:38:11.940
coliseums.
So we certainly know from that,

602
00:38:11.941 --> 00:38:15.420
that it was still in good condition and being used in the third century,

603
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:19.320
we see the outside with it's tears of columns.
We see something,

604
00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.300
an event going on inside.

605
00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:26.250
We see people in the seats and we see those polls that supported the on in here.

606
00:38:26.251 --> 00:38:28.950
And most interestingly,
we see the colossus,

607
00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:34.110
which was clearly still standing also in the third century,
Aad,
the Colossus,

608
00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:34.480
uh,

609
00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:39.480
in which the features had been changed from those of Nero to those of Saul.

610
00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:41.640
Uh,
with the raid crown.
Uh,

611
00:38:41.641 --> 00:38:43.840
it was very easy to do that because as I had mentioned,

612
00:38:43.841 --> 00:38:47.230
neuro had been shown originally himself as saw with the raid crown.

613
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.810
So all they had to do was change the features of the face.

614
00:38:49.811 --> 00:38:52.900
They could leave the crown in that crown,
clearly still a,

615
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:55.830
it's still there in the third century,
a,

616
00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:00.370
but just again as a reminder that the coliseum gets its name from that colossal

617
00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:02.380
statue that stood next door.

618
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.360
And this one last view of the Colosseum.
Uh,

619
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:09.130
this is a model which you have on your monument list,

620
00:39:09.131 --> 00:39:14.131
a model that probably gives you as good an idea as any of what the exterior of

621
00:39:14.561 --> 00:39:18.970
the building looked like in antiquity.
And I use it here to show you two things.

622
00:39:18.971 --> 00:39:22.780
One that we do believe on the second and third stories.

623
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:26.860
There were statues,
statues placed in the niches beneath the arches.

624
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.660
And this also shows you very well the way in which the wooden poles rested on

625
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:36.200
the brackets,
those wooden poles to serve,
to support,
uh,

626
00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.470
the awning of the structure,

627
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.120
anything and everything goes on at the coliseum.

628
00:39:43.121 --> 00:39:47.650
When I started going to the coliseum more years ago than I want to say,
uh,

629
00:39:47.651 --> 00:39:51.580
the Colosseum was very easy to get into.
Popped over there.

630
00:39:51.581 --> 00:39:54.310
You could walk in and was in a flash,
never a problem.

631
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:58.930
It's become one of the greatest tourist sites in Rome.
And in fact,

632
00:39:58.931 --> 00:40:01.630
a warning if you're going to be making your way,
I don't think,

633
00:40:01.631 --> 00:40:04.090
at least one of you mentioned to me spring break trip.
Uh,

634
00:40:04.091 --> 00:40:07.120
but if you're going to be making your way to the coliseum anytime soon or in the

635
00:40:07.121 --> 00:40:10.240
future,
it's actually not a bad idea to go on light.

636
00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:14.430
You can now go online and you can get tickets online for places like the college

637
00:40:14.431 --> 00:40:17.590
and you don't need it for most places.
But for the Vatican,
the Colosseum,

638
00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:18.880
the most popular,

639
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:22.870
it's not a bad idea to get tickets in advance because then you can go on the

640
00:40:22.871 --> 00:40:26.590
short line instead of the line that you're going to have to wait for hours to

641
00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:29.110
get in.
But while you're outside,
there's always something going on.

642
00:40:29.111 --> 00:40:32.440
There's also never used to happen.
But recently,
uh,
the,
uh,

643
00:40:32.441 --> 00:40:34.910
the Romans have gotten smart about,
um,

644
00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:38.830
about realizing that everyone wants a photo op.

645
00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:43.630
And so they supply a host of gladiators outside of the entrance way.

646
00:40:43.631 --> 00:40:46.230
And especially since everyone is online for so many hours a,

647
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.720
you might as well have something to do.
So they,
they stock,
uh,
the stock,

648
00:40:49.721 --> 00:40:50.380
the place with,

649
00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:54.240
with modern gladiators who were more than willing for a certain number of
euro's,

650
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:56.230
uh,
to pose in your pictures.

651
00:40:56.231 --> 00:41:00.220
And you see a young woman here taking her boyfriend or husband,
would whomever,

652
00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:05.200
a picture of him playing the gladiatorial role with this sword.

653
00:41:05.201 --> 00:41:07.120
As you can see,
I know lots of fun.

654
00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:11.440
It's fun just to stand there and watch everybody posing for these extraordinary

655
00:41:11.441 --> 00:41:14.530
pictures.
We saw that in the coliseum,

656
00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:18.640
the substructures were very poorly preserved.

657
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.140
And so I wanted to show you another amphitheater where they are well preserved

658
00:41:23.141 --> 00:41:27.250
so you can get a better sense of what those substructures would have looked like

659
00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:31.090
in antiquity.
And so I take us back to back south.

660
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:36.091
We go down south to Campania once again to a place called pot swollen and pot

661
00:41:36.451 --> 00:41:41.420
swollen is very near to buyer a and near to Naples and near to Pompeii and

662
00:41:41.421 --> 00:41:43.850
Herculaneum and so on.
Uh,

663
00:41:43.851 --> 00:41:48.851
a town that has one of the best preserved Roman amphitheaters in the,

664
00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:50.720
from the ancient Roman world.

665
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:54.400
It dates to the late first century a d a,

666
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:59.210
and I show you a view here of the substructures of the amphitheater,

667
00:41:59.211 --> 00:42:02.960
the Roman amphitheater at putts Wally.
And you can see what I mean.
Uh,

668
00:42:02.961 --> 00:42:07.961
the annual or vaulted Carter's down below WellPreserved as are the,

669
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:09.980
uh,
the uh,
the,
um,

670
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:14.960
cages in which the animals were kept in antiquity.
The,
the gate,

671
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:19.570
the greats are gone.
But,
uh,
the,
uh,
the cages are still there as,

672
00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:23.300
as much of the ceiling and it's actually a fun place to wander through because

673
00:42:23.301 --> 00:42:25.430
the light effects are incredible.

674
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:28.890
The light effects through the openings in that ceiling that we're,

675
00:42:28.891 --> 00:42:31.670
the openings through which the animals were,
uh,

676
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.660
were transported by ramp or by pulley up to the arena.

677
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:40.840
Here's another view where you can also get a great sense of these sub structures

678
00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.480
of the places where the animals were kept,
uh,

679
00:42:43.481 --> 00:42:47.840
and also have those openings in the ceiling that allowed them to be brought up

680
00:42:47.841 --> 00:42:48.440
above.

681
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:52.370
And you can also notice very well here the fact that the construction in this

682
00:42:52.371 --> 00:42:57.371
case late for century Aad is concrete faced with brick faced with brick.

683
00:42:57.771 --> 00:43:02.240
And we talked about another important part of Nero's architectural revolution,

684
00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:02.740
uh,

685
00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:07.250
was the fact that they began to build buildings that were a brick faced concrete

686
00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:07.701
buildings.

687
00:43:07.701 --> 00:43:11.030
We talked about the fact that that had to do with the fire and the decision

688
00:43:11.031 --> 00:43:15.800
taken that brick was more fireproof than stone and they began to use it and we

689
00:43:15.801 --> 00:43:19.430
see it being used here.
So another important architectural rebel,

690
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:25.030
another important facet of Nero's architectural revolution that was not lost

691
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:27.380
with the emperor's death.

692
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:33.250
And here you can see the very well preserved a pavement of the arena done in

693
00:43:33.861 --> 00:43:38.030
concrete with these openings in it at the same openings that you saw just before

694
00:43:38.031 --> 00:43:40.130
from down below,
which the light came.

695
00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:44.960
These are the openings through which props animals,
some of them are very small,

696
00:43:44.961 --> 00:43:47.350
some of them are larger,
would allow,
uh,

697
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:50.120
individually some things to be brought up through them.

698
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:54.770
But you can also see there was a big open area in the center that was also used,

699
00:43:54.771 --> 00:43:57.940
covered over,
uh,
when there was an event.
But,
uh,

700
00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:01.940
that was also there in order to allow a freer flow and,

701
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.920
and allow the attendance to bring the animals up to the top.

702
00:44:06.921 --> 00:44:10.850
So again,
a very well preserved pavement of the arena.

703
00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:13.430
And you can also see in this view that the seats,

704
00:44:13.431 --> 00:44:17.660
the Kavya of the theater at Putts,
Wally also extremely well preserved.

705
00:44:17.661 --> 00:44:21.350
You can't tell here,
uh,
but the division into Kunae the same.

706
00:44:21.351 --> 00:44:25.610
So we look to this amphitheater to give us a better sense of what the interior

707
00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:29.420
of the Colosseum would have looked like in ancient Roman times.

708
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.490
We talked about the,
uh,
temple of divine Claudius.

709
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.500
I remind you of a model of it here again,

710
00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:41.640
and the relationship of that temple of divine Claudius with the temple

711
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:45.390
conventional temple on top of a very tall podium.

712
00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:50.130
The fact that that looked back to the architectural experiments very early on,

713
00:44:50.131 --> 00:44:55.131
second for centuries BC at the sanctuaries of Jupiter anx or at Terra Cina,

714
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:59.520
uh,
and of Hercules,
victor at Tivoli.
Uh,

715
00:44:59.521 --> 00:45:02.490
it was that kind of thing that was being looked back to.

716
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.480
And it's interesting to see that it was that same plan,

717
00:45:06.481 --> 00:45:11.220
that idea of a great open rectangular space with a temple as part of it,

718
00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:11.730
uh,

719
00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:16.020
that was used and what the temple put along one of the longer ends that was used

720
00:45:16.021 --> 00:45:20.160
by Vespasian,
uh,
for his own forum in Rome,

721
00:45:20.161 --> 00:45:22.020
the so called forum pacas.

722
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:26.100
It's sometimes referred to as the Templem pacas because we're not actually sure

723
00:45:26.101 --> 00:45:26.940
how it was used.

724
00:45:26.941 --> 00:45:31.680
We don't think it was actually used as a typical forum with shops and,

725
00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:34.830
and a law court and so on,
but may have been used in a different way,

726
00:45:34.831 --> 00:45:37.740
and I'll speak to that in a moment so we don't quite know what to call it and we

727
00:45:37.741 --> 00:45:42.630
call it either the forum park is or the temple and pockets in order to see its

728
00:45:42.631 --> 00:45:47.610
location.
I show you this,
a view of all of the imperial fora in Rome,

729
00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.170
those fora that line,

730
00:45:49.171 --> 00:45:53.310
the via in the him periodically across from the Roman forum.

731
00:45:53.311 --> 00:45:57.450
We've already looked at,
here's the tail end of,
or a side,

732
00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:02.040
the side of the Roman forum here and right next to it too for that we've already

733
00:46:02.041 --> 00:46:06.840
discussed the forum of Julius Caesar and then the forum of Augustus.

734
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:09.540
Nothing else.
This wasn't there then.
This wasn't there then,

735
00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.400
but Vespasian decides to build a,

736
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:17.040
a forum himself in close proximity to the forum of Augustus.
In fact,

737
00:46:17.041 --> 00:46:21.330
it's interesting to see that it faces the temple is actually on this end.
Uh,

738
00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:24.140
so in a sense it faces the forum of Augustus.

739
00:46:24.141 --> 00:46:29.141
So another smart strategic move on the part of smart political move on the part

740
00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.660
of Vespasian to associate himself,
not just with Claudius,

741
00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:36.450
good emperor who was divinized but also with Augustus,

742
00:46:36.451 --> 00:46:41.400
the founder of the Julio,
Claudia and dynasty and the first emperor of Rome.

743
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:45.510
Uh,
so to build his,
his structure facing that of Augustus.

744
00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:48.350
This is temple facing that of Augustus is a,

745
00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:50.650
but you can see that he wants to outdo Augustus.

746
00:46:50.651 --> 00:46:54.490
So he makes his larger than Augustus is,
uh,

747
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:58.980
this area here that's labeled as the forum of Nerva wasn't a forum at all at

748
00:46:58.981 --> 00:47:03.810
this point.
It was a street called the argillite item,
Ar,
G,

749
00:47:03.811 --> 00:47:07.380
I,
l,
e,
t,
u,
m a,
and that street,

750
00:47:07.381 --> 00:47:09.930
the Rj latum and you can see it labeled up there.

751
00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.660
That street led into a part of Rome,

752
00:47:12.661 --> 00:47:17.370
a residential area of Rome that I preferred to before called the Sabura Suv.

753
00:47:17.371 --> 00:47:22.100
You are Aa.
The subura was again a place where they were a lot of of of,

754
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.300
I've mentioned it again,
we saw there a lot of,

755
00:47:25.301 --> 00:47:28.050
or there were there a lot of apartment houses,

756
00:47:28.051 --> 00:47:32.620
mostly made out of wood rickety apartment houses that were lived in by large

757
00:47:32.621 --> 00:47:34.450
number of people with lesser means.

758
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:38.830
I and there were consequently always fires there and you'll remember that

759
00:47:38.831 --> 00:47:43.780
Augustus is architects had to build that large precinct wall at a pepper reno to

760
00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:46.090
protect the temple of Marzel.

761
00:47:46.091 --> 00:47:49.750
Tore from the fires that used to break out all the time and this Bora.

762
00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.250
So you have to imagine this is a,

763
00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:55.040
as a street in between the forum of Augustus and uh,

764
00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:59.350
Vespasian forum pockets in ancient Roman Times.
Also.

765
00:47:59.351 --> 00:48:01.630
Interesting is again,
the plan,

766
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:04.690
a rectangle with the temple on one end,

767
00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:08.210
a dominating the space in front of it.
Uh,

768
00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:13.250
you can see that there are columns all the way around.
There are,
uh,
these,
um,

769
00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:15.260
a these

770
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:20.970
alcoves that opened off the center space and you can see their screen,
uh,

771
00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:25.300
from that center space also by columns.
Uh,
we know that,
uh,

772
00:48:25.301 --> 00:48:29.830
some exotic materials were used to your marble that was brought from other parts

773
00:48:29.831 --> 00:48:30.341
of the world.

774
00:48:30.341 --> 00:48:35.341
We saw that beginning already under Nero bringing marble from Asia minor and uh,

775
00:48:35.441 --> 00:48:38.470
and Africa and Egypt and so on for his buildings.

776
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.890
That also continues under the Flavian.
So another,
uh,

777
00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:45.820
neronian innovation that remains important.
Uh,
we see it here.

778
00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:48.730
We see red granite columns used for the colonnade.

779
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:53.740
We see yellow columns from,
uh,
Africa used for the columns,

780
00:48:53.741 --> 00:48:57.100
that screen of these alcoves from the larger space.

781
00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.700
And then we see white marble,
uh,
for the rest.

782
00:49:00.701 --> 00:49:05.701
So this combination of imported marbles used for the farm pacas in Rome,

783
00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:10.750
the forum park is no longer survives.
You can't see any of it today.

784
00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:13.030
We do know it's location though.

785
00:49:13.031 --> 00:49:17.680
And we do have a good sense of its plan once again from the so called Forma

786
00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.020
Orbis from this marble map of Rome,
uh,

787
00:49:20.021 --> 00:49:23.890
that has a few fragments of the,
uh,

788
00:49:23.891 --> 00:49:28.570
of the Forum Forum Pacas you can see one fragment tier one fragment here and

789
00:49:28.571 --> 00:49:32.990
then a third fragment up there.
Uh,
and those fragments are enough.
Uh,

790
00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:33.970
when we look at those,

791
00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:38.080
study those and compare those to other buildings to allow a very accurate

792
00:49:38.081 --> 00:49:39.750
reconstruction.
Uh,
it,

793
00:49:39.751 --> 00:49:43.930
it tells us the shape of the temple and it shows us without any question because

794
00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:47.530
one of the fragments includes lots of this,
that this too,
like the cloud.

795
00:49:47.531 --> 00:49:52.120
He ate them in Rome,
had a bushes,
had bushes in as a,
you know,

796
00:49:52.121 --> 00:49:56.960
a kind of garden,
uh,
the decorated the center of the structure.
So bringing,
uh,

797
00:49:56.961 --> 00:50:01.510
the country in a sense,
into the city,
uh,
for these incredible complexes.

798
00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.350
This is a restored view when you see it also on your monument list of what the

799
00:50:05.351 --> 00:50:07.930
forum pacas would have looked like in antiquity,

800
00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:13.150
a quite severe facade as it seems,
uh,
with a number of entrance ways.

801
00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:16.480
The temple pushed up,
in fact,
not only pushed up against the back wall,

802
00:50:16.481 --> 00:50:20.140
but part of the colonnade that flying sit on either side.

803
00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:23.200
You can see the red granite columns.
You can,

804
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:25.810
you can't see the yellow columns that,

805
00:50:25.811 --> 00:50:28.970
that would have been further in a screening.

806
00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:32.720
She alcoves from the colonnade.
You see a,

807
00:50:32.721 --> 00:50:35.570
an altar right in front of the temple.

808
00:50:35.571 --> 00:50:40.240
You see the bushes that were part of the plantings that made this look like a

809
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:44.000
kind of garden,
a complex in front of the temple.

810
00:50:44.001 --> 00:50:46.250
We don't actually know if it was used as a temple.

811
00:50:46.251 --> 00:50:49.800
We have no of divinity that's been associated with it.
Uh,

812
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:54.470
we actually think it may have been used as a museum,
as a museum.

813
00:50:54.471 --> 00:50:58.070
And I'm going to say more about that in a moment.
Here's another reconstruction.

814
00:50:58.071 --> 00:50:59.600
This one is from Ward Perkins.

815
00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:03.320
You can see that it is roughly the same as it is,

816
00:51:03.321 --> 00:51:06.530
the same as the other with one exception.
And that is,

817
00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:09.740
it shows an entrance way that it's made up of three doors.

818
00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:14.590
And I'm a number of columns.
This was thought for a very long time,
uh,
to be the,

819
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:17.390
the,
the,
the case that there was a,
uh,

820
00:51:17.391 --> 00:51:21.770
an elaborate entrance way with columns and projecting and tablatures the sort of

821
00:51:21.771 --> 00:51:24.530
thing that we haven't seen yet in built architecture.

822
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:27.620
But we did see in second style Roman wall painting,

823
00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:31.970
but that idea has been discredited and now people believe it is much more likely

824
00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:33.920
that the facade was very plain.

825
00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:39.130
The reason that this idea came to the fore is that eventually when the argillite

826
00:51:40.021 --> 00:51:45.021
item was filled in with a forum by Titus is seconds by Vespasian second son

827
00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:46.170
demission.
Uh,

828
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:51.390
demission did build a forum that is in part preserved in which we will look at

829
00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:54.180
next week,
I believe.
Uh,

830
00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:59.350
but that forum had on the walls a series of columns with projecting and

831
00:51:59.811 --> 00:52:04.040
tablatures.
So,
and that does still exist now.
We're,
part of it does still exist.

832
00:52:04.041 --> 00:52:07.370
So I think that's what originally gave,
uh,
archeologists,

833
00:52:07.371 --> 00:52:12.170
the idea that that was there before,
uh,
and was part of Vespasian is complex,

834
00:52:12.171 --> 00:52:14.330
but that seems not to have been the case.
And you,

835
00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:19.100
the reconstruction that you have on your monument list is the one that you

836
00:52:19.101 --> 00:52:24.020
should go by.
Let's get back to the whole point about the museum.

837
00:52:24.021 --> 00:52:29.021
Whether this served as a kind of museum in the time of the Flavian emperors,

838
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:33.260
I mentioned the great victory that Titus had over Jerusalem.

839
00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:36.320
A victory,
at least from the Roman point of view,
was great.

840
00:52:36.321 --> 00:52:39.320
Obviously it was not great for Judea because the,
uh,

841
00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:44.350
the area was taken over by the Romans and the famous Jewish temple was

842
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:45.583
destroyed.

843
00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:51.100
And a Titus also did not hesitate to a ramble through the,

844
00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:51.710
uh,

845
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:56.240
with his men were the soldiers go through the temple and pick and choose what he

846
00:52:56.241 --> 00:52:58.520
wanted to bring back to Rome as spoils.

847
00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:02.810
He took the great seven branched candelabra them from the temple.

848
00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:05.810
He took the Ark of the covenant from the Temple.

849
00:53:05.811 --> 00:53:10.250
He took a whole host of other items from the temple and he brought them back to

850
00:53:10.251 --> 00:53:11.480
Rome as trophies.

851
00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:16.780
And we see this famous scene on the arch of Titus and arch that demission put up

852
00:53:17.151 --> 00:53:19.700
in honor of his brother.
And we'll look at that on Tuesday.

853
00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:24.940
The arch of Titus has a scene that depicts the Roman soldiers bringing the seven

854
00:53:25.561 --> 00:53:26.341
branch candle,

855
00:53:26.341 --> 00:53:31.341
labrum and a table with other objects on it from that temple back to Rome and

856
00:53:32.071 --> 00:53:35.070
parading with those through an arch.
Uh,

857
00:53:35.071 --> 00:53:40.071
those spoils we know were placed by Vespasian by his father with whom he shared

858
00:53:41.311 --> 00:53:44.970
a joint triumph,
a because of this victory over Jerusalem.

859
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:49.200
It was placed in the forum pacas once that was built.

860
00:53:49.201 --> 00:53:54.201
So it wasn't part of a place where he could display the spoils of war because of

861
00:53:55.411 --> 00:54:00.070
the fact that the legitimacy that he gained,
uh,
through this conquest,
uh,

862
00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:02.520
was so important to his dynasty,

863
00:54:02.521 --> 00:54:06.810
to the right of his dynasty to rule and to the right of his sons to rule after

864
00:54:06.811 --> 00:54:10.410
him.
So he wants to make that point clear.
But again,

865
00:54:10.411 --> 00:54:12.270
he's very shrewd politically,

866
00:54:12.271 --> 00:54:17.220
and he also wants to make sure that the people have access to this.
He,

867
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:21.180
he wants to remind them.
When Nero was emperor of Rome,
he had,
uh,

868
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.690
things in his villa that he would never have dreamed of sharing with you.

869
00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:29.160
You weren't able to come in and dine there and have pedals and fragrances fall

870
00:54:29.161 --> 00:54:33.240
on you while you dined.
Uh,
you were,
you were not allowed into this space,

871
00:54:33.241 --> 00:54:37.800
but now you can come to the coliseum and you can go to this museum and while

872
00:54:37.801 --> 00:54:38.551
you're in the museum,

873
00:54:38.551 --> 00:54:42.150
you made it might as well look at these great spoils that I captured from

874
00:54:42.151 --> 00:54:46.650
Jerusalem that bring credit to me and legitimacy to my dynasty.

875
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:51.270
He also took what's also interesting and makes this more museum like a,

876
00:54:51.271 --> 00:54:56.271
is that he also took some of the statuary that Nero had stolen from Greece when

877
00:54:56.971 --> 00:54:59.190
he went there to compete in those Olympic Games.

878
00:54:59.191 --> 00:55:02.670
And so on that he had stolen from Greece and elsewhere,
uh,

879
00:55:02.671 --> 00:55:04.260
and put it up in his villa.

880
00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:09.290
He also put those in the museum and opened that collection also to the Roman

881
00:55:09.991 --> 00:55:10.381
people.

882
00:55:10.381 --> 00:55:14.610
And we even know some of the statues that were there that were taken from Nero's

883
00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:18.610
stomas area and put into this museum.
One of them was a famous,
um,

884
00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:23.340
cow,
a cow that had been done by the well known Greek artists.

885
00:55:23.341 --> 00:55:27.210
Mirin and why Ron?
The cow of Myron.
Uh,

886
00:55:27.211 --> 00:55:31.680
and the second was a,
a,
uh,
a,
an image,

887
00:55:31.681 --> 00:55:34.190
a sculpted image.
We're not sure.

888
00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:37.650
I don't think we know whether it was in marble or bronze,
the original,
uh,

889
00:55:37.651 --> 00:55:40.080
but an image of a reclining,
uh,

890
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.640
Nile River who is surrounded by 16 kids were running around,

891
00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:46.620
up and down on top of him and around him.

892
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:51.920
Another famous statue that was in neuros possession that gets put into what

893
00:55:52.261 --> 00:55:55.800
appears to have been a very important museum.

894
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.700
You see here,
uh,
another Google,

895
00:56:02.701 --> 00:56:05.490
an excellent Google earth view,

896
00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:08.850
aerial view of part of the Roman forum.

897
00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:14.120
The Colosseum of course is way over here and we can see the central part or part

898
00:56:15.031 --> 00:56:17.580
of the central part of the forum.

899
00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:20.820
We're looking back toward the Victor Emmanuel monument.

900
00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:24.730
We're looking back toward the competence folio is redesigned by Michelangelo,

901
00:56:24.731 --> 00:56:26.920
the Oval Piatsa.
And in fact,

902
00:56:26.921 --> 00:56:30.970
here we can even see in the upper left the theater of Marcellus.

903
00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:35.120
So you can see that the theater of Marcellus was basically in a diagonal

904
00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:38.260
diagonal dialogue in a sense with the,
uh,

905
00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:41.590
with the coliseum that was located back over here.

906
00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:46.980
The reason that I show this view to you now is to point out also the Tabula

907
00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.600
Arrium,
which we've already looked at the archives.

908
00:56:49.601 --> 00:56:52.510
It's on the back of the Senate Senatorial Palace,

909
00:56:52.511 --> 00:56:55.900
redesigned by Michelangelo A,
but right in front of it,

910
00:56:55.930 --> 00:57:00.930
there was a temple that was put up in honor of Vespasian by at his death by his

911
00:57:02.411 --> 00:57:06.100
son,
Titus.
And then when Titus died,
only a few years later,

912
00:57:06.101 --> 00:57:08.170
also of natural causes,
uh,

913
00:57:08.171 --> 00:57:12.310
his brother Domitian became emperor and demission decided to rededicate the

914
00:57:12.311 --> 00:57:14.950
temple to both of them,
to Titus,
uh,

915
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.980
to a Vespasian and also to Titus.

916
00:57:17.981 --> 00:57:21.840
So it became the temple of the two DB D we,
uh,

917
00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:26.880
because Titus was also divinized at his death and there were statue bases that

918
00:57:27.371 --> 00:57:28.500
were found,
uh,

919
00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:32.560
that stood in front of this temple with inscriptions indicating that they

920
00:57:32.561 --> 00:57:37.561
honored those two individuals and that they were depicted undoubtedly and

921
00:57:37.601 --> 00:57:41.160
statues in front of this temple.
Only,
uh,

922
00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:45.850
three columns of that temple still survived some of the foundations as well.

923
00:57:45.851 --> 00:57:50.720
Of course.
And you can see it in the Roman forum,
uh,
right near the top.
You,

924
00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:53.260
him in Rome.
If you look at it,

925
00:57:53.261 --> 00:57:57.280
you can see that these are Corinthian fluted capital's,
uh,

926
00:57:57.281 --> 00:58:01.000
it was probably a quite conventional temple.
Uh,

927
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:05.560
but you do see that there is a freeze that seems to represent a number of

928
00:58:05.561 --> 00:58:08.300
sacrificial implements,
a,
uh,

929
00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:13.320
a libation dish and a picture and so on and so forth.

930
00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:18.730
A very large chunk of that freeze and end tablature is still preserved today.

931
00:58:18.731 --> 00:58:20.590
It's not with the temple,

932
00:58:20.591 --> 00:58:24.690
but rather in the tabular IOM itself.
Uh,

933
00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:26.410
and I show it to you here.

934
00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:31.810
I'm extremely well preserved section of the decorative frieze of the temple of

935
00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.630
Vespasian,
the Temple of Divine Vespasian in Rome,

936
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:42.190
which you see again dates to around 79 to 81 a d.

937
00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:47.010
And it's very instructive not only in terms of the way in which,
uh,

938
00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:48.760
tightest first and then his brother.

939
00:58:48.761 --> 00:58:53.230
We're thinking of honoring members of their family,
uh,
but also in the,

940
00:58:53.231 --> 00:58:55.370
in the,
uh,
in the,
um,

941
00:58:55.990 --> 00:59:00.310
incredible in how ornamental this is.
I mean that this is,

942
00:59:00.311 --> 00:59:04.990
this is decoration that is more richly textured than any that we've seen thus

943
00:59:04.991 --> 00:59:09.980
far and also more richly undercut.
The artists are beginning to use the drill,
uh,

944
00:59:10.030 --> 00:59:12.390
to create very deep shadows,
uh,

945
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:16.330
among the decorative motifs to make them stand out even more.

946
00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:18.820
And you might remember,
I didn't bring it back to show you,

947
00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:23.360
but you might remember that section that showed you from the forum from the

948
00:59:23.361 --> 00:59:24.320
temple of Venus,

949
00:59:24.321 --> 00:59:28.280
Ghana treks in the forum of Julius Caesar where I mentioned that that had been

950
00:59:28.281 --> 00:59:33.281
restored in the time of demission second son of Vespasian and also in the tray

951
00:59:33.621 --> 00:59:35.200
Janick period.
And that the,

952
00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:40.530
the very deep carving indicated to us that deep carving indicated too is not

953
00:59:41.361 --> 00:59:45.110
only that it had been done later,
uh,
but also the fact that the flavor ones,

954
00:59:45.111 --> 00:59:49.340
we're particularly interested in this very ornamental decoration,

955
00:59:49.341 --> 00:59:52.270
very deeply undercut ornamentation.

956
00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:56.240
And we see that so well here we see also the interest in the variety of motifs,

957
00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:59.960
uh,
in this freeze.
Uh,
and,
and the decorative part of it.

958
00:59:59.961 --> 01:00:03.800
And then the frees itself is very interesting.
If we look at the objects,

959
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:08.630
we see that they are mainly objects that are used in ritual sacrifice.
Uh,

960
01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:12.480
we see the skulls of bulls just as we saw them in the inner precinct of the Arra

961
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.980
pop.
This one on either side,
we see a libation dish,

962
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:20.420
we see an ax over here.
Uh,
that's to knock out the animals.

963
01:00:20.421 --> 01:00:24.440
Here's the a,
the knife to slit the throat of the animals,

964
01:00:24.441 --> 01:00:27.220
the pitcher to pour wine on an altar,

965
01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:32.420
a whip for whatever purpose that had.
Uh,
and then over here a helmet.

966
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:33.500
As you can see.

967
01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:38.420
So all of these implements that were used in a sacrifice regularly used in

968
01:00:38.421 --> 01:00:42.860
sacrifice,
arranged like a still life against a blank background.

969
01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:45.170
And I dunno about you,
but when I look at this,

970
01:00:45.171 --> 01:00:48.020
I am reminded of some of fourth style,

971
01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.340
a Roman wall decoration of the still life paintings that we saw on the third and

972
01:00:52.341 --> 01:00:57.260
the fourth style where you have individual objects against a blank background.

973
01:00:57.630 --> 01:01:00.810
Uh,
and also also the,

974
01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:05.120
the decorative nature of this conjures up some of the decoration that we see,

975
01:01:05.121 --> 01:01:05.931
the perfusion,

976
01:01:05.931 --> 01:01:10.550
the almost overly decorative element of fourth style Roman wall painting.

977
01:01:10.551 --> 01:01:15.140
And since this dates to 79 to 81,
and you'll remember the fourth style,
uh,

978
01:01:15.141 --> 01:01:20.060
is 62 to 79 at pom pay.
But we know that the Ford style continued on.

979
01:01:20.061 --> 01:01:24.560
It was the fourth style that was the most popular style post 79,

980
01:01:24.561 --> 01:01:29.540
obviously not in pom pay but it or Herculaneum but elsewhere in the Roman world.

981
01:01:29.541 --> 01:01:32.090
So this very much in keeping,
we're seeing an architecture,

982
01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:37.100
something very much in keeping visa vi decoration as we see in fourth style

983
01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:38.390
Roman wall painting.

984
01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:44.140
The last monument that I want to show you today is in many respects the most

985
01:01:44.271 --> 01:01:45.104
important.

986
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:48.740
That seems like a strange thing to say because what could be more important than

987
01:01:48.741 --> 01:01:51.860
the icon of Rome?
The Coliseum.
But when we think about it,

988
01:01:51.861 --> 01:01:54.860
the Colosseum was actually a fairly conservative building,
right?

989
01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.770
I mean it goes back to the uh,
the,
the amphitheater,

990
01:01:57.771 --> 01:02:01.310
it Pompei and its general plan and it is quite similar to,

991
01:02:01.311 --> 01:02:04.190
in fact very similar to the theater of Marcellus,

992
01:02:04.191 --> 01:02:06.260
which was done at the time of Augustus.

993
01:02:06.261 --> 01:02:10.220
And Augustus was trying to connect his reign to that appears equally in Athens

994
01:02:10.221 --> 01:02:14.750
and was using stone construction and the coliseum is up stone construction,

995
01:02:14.751 --> 01:02:17.960
although it also of course makes use of,
uh,
of,
of,

996
01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:20.550
of annual annular vaults out of concrete,
uh,

997
01:02:20.551 --> 01:02:24.220
and also integrates with the new groin vaults.
But for,
for,

998
01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:28.410
for all intents and purposes,
a relatively conservative building at this time,

999
01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.390
the Colosseum was the building that I'm now going to show you.

1000
01:02:31.391 --> 01:02:33.010
It was not that way at all.
Uh,

1001
01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:36.630
even though it's a building that is much less well known than the coliseum,

1002
01:02:36.631 --> 01:02:40.110
and it also doesn't exist any longer unfortunately.
And that,

1003
01:02:40.111 --> 01:02:44.490
and those are the baths of Titus,
a very important structure for us.

1004
01:02:44.491 --> 01:02:48.900
The Bas of Titus,
the tear,
my tt,
the bads of Titus,
uh,

1005
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:50.510
that date to Adhd,

1006
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:55.310
right smack in the middle of Titus is brief reign of 79 to 81.
Uh,

1007
01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:59.460
they,
uh,
were put up in Rome and they were put up in Rome.
Not surprisingly,

1008
01:02:59.461 --> 01:03:01.590
you know,
the punt,
you know,
you know the narrative here,

1009
01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:06.510
not surprisingly on that land that had earlier been expropriated by Nero,

1010
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:10.380
another instance of the Flavian emperors giving back to the people.

1011
01:03:10.381 --> 01:03:13.740
You've given them a museum that you've given them a,

1012
01:03:13.741 --> 01:03:17.520
an amphitheater and now you're going to give them a bath next to an
amphitheater.

1013
01:03:17.521 --> 01:03:20.730
The bath is what they wanted most of all place where they could go to bay but

1014
01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:24.660
also hang out with their family and friends.
Uh,
so again,

1015
01:03:24.661 --> 01:03:27.810
giving back to the people what they wanted.
Wise,

1016
01:03:27.811 --> 01:03:32.270
shrewd political move on the part of Vespasian being followed by his equally

1017
01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:33.900
shrewd son Titus.

1018
01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:39.200
The location of the bows of Titus was next to actually what you see here on top

1019
01:03:39.811 --> 01:03:43.260
of the Golden House is actually the plan of a later bath.

1020
01:03:43.261 --> 01:03:46.020
The Bas of the emperor Trajan,
which we'll look at in the future.

1021
01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:50.730
But the smaller bags of Titus were put to the,
um,

1022
01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.820
I believe it was,
yeah,
the west of the,
uh,

1023
01:03:53.821 --> 01:03:56.820
eschalon wing of the Golden House.
Right,
right.

1024
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.140
Just between the bolden house and where you see eschalon written up.

1025
01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:03.810
There was the location of the bads of Titus.

1026
01:04:04.890 --> 01:04:08.370
All that survives or the bads of Titus is what part of one wall,

1027
01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:12.900
a brick faced concrete wall with some engaged columns.
That's all we have.

1028
01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.720
But the building was still standing at two.

1029
01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:20.160
The building was still much better preserved in the 16th century when it was

1030
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:23.190
drawn by a renaissance architects.
Uh,

1031
01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:25.530
most specifically by Andrea Palladio,

1032
01:04:25.531 --> 01:04:27.360
his name I put on the monument lists for you,

1033
01:04:27.361 --> 01:04:32.361
Andrea Palladio drew a very complete plan of it and it is on the basis of that

1034
01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:37.290
plan that modern,
uh,
plans are made of the bads of Titus.

1035
01:04:37.291 --> 01:04:41.430
And I show it to you here and we believe this is a very accurate plan of the

1036
01:04:41.431 --> 01:04:42.420
baths of Titus.

1037
01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:47.040
And I compare it to you for you here with again,

1038
01:04:47.041 --> 01:04:51.660
those of you studying for the midterm.
What's this?

1039
01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:56.670
The stay be bad.
Stop being Baz in palm pay,
second century BC.
Very good.

1040
01:04:57.030 --> 01:05:00.270
Uh,
and we talked about that as a typical,
the typical earlier,

1041
01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:04.860
a bad structure and just a very quick review to remind ourselves of its major

1042
01:05:04.861 --> 01:05:05.910
features.
Uh,

1043
01:05:05.911 --> 01:05:10.320
it had the polestar over here surrounded by columns on three sides,

1044
01:05:10.321 --> 01:05:14.970
the PC now,
or the Natacha swimming pool at the left.
And then most importantly,

1045
01:05:14.971 --> 01:05:19.840
the bathing block on the right side of the structure amend section and a women's

1046
01:05:19.841 --> 01:05:24.070
section with that sequence of rooms.
The uh,
the,
uh,

1047
01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:26.470
the Apo d Terrian where the dressing room,

1048
01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:30.160
the tip Darian rectangular or the warm room,

1049
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:32.260
the caldarium hot room with a,

1050
01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:36.400
an apps and a cold water splash pool as Cold War's splash basin.

1051
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.780
And then most importantly,

1052
01:05:37.781 --> 01:05:42.400
the frigate Darian that small round a building with radiating alcoves.

1053
01:05:42.401 --> 01:05:47.401
That was the typical Roman bath structure until we begin to see,

1054
01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:52.940
or our first example in Rome of the so called imperial bath structure,

1055
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:54.460
uh,
the,

1056
01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:58.570
the plan that is used by the emperors for the bass that they build in Rome,

1057
01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:03.280
it is possible that Tituss was not the first,
there's been some speculation.

1058
01:06:03.281 --> 01:06:04.870
We know that Nero had built a bath.

1059
01:06:04.871 --> 01:06:08.710
There has been some speculation that narrows bath may have been the first

1060
01:06:08.711 --> 01:06:11.950
example of the imperial plan,
but we don't know for sure,

1061
01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:17.290
but Tituss of the ones that we know have the specifics about,

1062
01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:22.440
we know that Tituss was definitely an example of this imperial best structure

1063
01:06:22.631 --> 01:06:27.631
and the features that are outstanding here that we need to focus on or the fact

1064
01:06:28.541 --> 01:06:32.520
that this imperial best structure had a very elaborate entrance way,
uh,

1065
01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:37.530
that consisted either of columns on square basis or peers in the front.

1066
01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:40.390
Uh,
there seemed to have been a series of groin vaults.

1067
01:06:40.391 --> 01:06:44.500
Anytime you see an x in plan,
that means a growing vault,
a,

1068
01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:49.240
an elaborate stairway,
some more columns or peers here,
uh,
and,

1069
01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:54.330
and more groin vaults and another stairway leading into a double polestar in a

1070
01:06:54.521 --> 01:06:58.720
sense,
or you could call it a combined Balestra here on the southern side.

1071
01:06:59.050 --> 01:06:59.883
And then most,

1072
01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:03.970
and that you can see the sister and on the outside of the precinct who can see

1073
01:07:03.971 --> 01:07:07.390
the cistern that fed water into this best structure.

1074
01:07:07.391 --> 01:07:09.910
It's roughly rectangular as you can see.

1075
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.700
And unlike the stop being bas at palm pay,

1076
01:07:12.701 --> 01:07:17.380
where you have the bath complex on the right side,
you can see that the bath,

1077
01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.890
the rooms of bath,
the bath,

1078
01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:23.710
the rooms that are used for bathing are at the center of the plan.
Uh,

1079
01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:27.070
which makes sense from,
from the Roman standpoint.
You know,
the Romans thought,

1080
01:07:27.071 --> 01:07:28.320
you know,
we're very,
uh,

1081
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:32.560
focused on axiology and symmetry and that's exactly what they've done here.

1082
01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:36.760
They've placed the bathing block in the center.
They've lined the rooms up,

1083
01:07:36.790 --> 01:07:41.110
it axially with one another.
They've placed rooms on either side,

1084
01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:45.000
symmetrical rooms.
It's the same on the left as it is on the right.
Uh,

1085
01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:49.600
submit rooms are symmetrically disposed around that central bathing block and

1086
01:07:49.601 --> 01:07:52.780
they've taken the frigging Doriam which was the smallest,

1087
01:07:52.810 --> 01:07:56.950
albeit the most interesting architectural,
but the smallest room in the bath.

1088
01:07:56.951 --> 01:08:01.210
And they've made it the largest room in the bath because you can see it f a very

1089
01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:04.570
large cross shaped room within apps on one end,

1090
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:09.160
a groin vault over the center,
a single large groin vault over the center,

1091
01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:12.310
flanked by and buttressed by two barrel bolts,

1092
01:08:12.311 --> 01:08:15.650
one on either side and then opening off those barrel vaults,

1093
01:08:15.651 --> 01:08:18.140
a series of rectangular,
uh,

1094
01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:22.000
alcoves with as you can see with walls that are scalloped.
Uh,

1095
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:24.800
and then with columns that screen,
uh,

1096
01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:28.460
those alcoves from the central groin vaulted space.

1097
01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:32.060
So an entirely different way of thinking about the frigging Darian.

1098
01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:34.710
Then that into the tip of Darian from the Frig,

1099
01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:36.740
adore him again through a screen of columns.

1100
01:08:36.741 --> 01:08:40.640
That's Rick that's fairly conventional,
rectangular and then into,

1101
01:08:40.641 --> 01:08:43.910
we see here double called Aria to call Daria.

1102
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:46.340
They also in a kind of cross shape,

1103
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:51.050
although a cross shape that if he was a little bit more rounded than the case of

1104
01:08:51.051 --> 01:08:55.070
the frigate Darian,
they to screened by columns on three sides,

1105
01:08:55.071 --> 01:08:57.110
very open,
very open,

1106
01:08:57.350 --> 01:09:02.350
allowing a free flow of space in a way that was not true of the palm pay.

1107
01:09:02.631 --> 01:09:07.160
And Bas with the inference was with Vic tiny from one room to another here a

1108
01:09:07.190 --> 01:09:11.330
gate,
a great deal of emphasis on the free flow of space.
So what's most,

1109
01:09:11.370 --> 01:09:12.620
what's very important here,

1110
01:09:12.621 --> 01:09:15.860
the way I want to end today is essentially where I began,

1111
01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:20.630
what innovations of Nero's architecture lived on despite has done not to a

1112
01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:23.660
memoria.
And despite the fact that his buildings were destroyed,

1113
01:09:23.661 --> 01:09:25.010
his building's no longer stood.

1114
01:09:25.011 --> 01:09:29.130
The Dome is salary and no longer stood to be studied.
Uh,
and yet,
uh,

1115
01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.300
what we see is some of,
uh,

1116
01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:35.150
of the innovations did live on and the ones that did a include,

1117
01:09:35.151 --> 01:09:38.660
and let me just compare as the last image compare,
uh,

1118
01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:42.950
the octagonal room and axonometric view of the octagonal room,
uh,

1119
01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:45.830
with the bas of Titus in Rome.
What we,

1120
01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:50.510
what we see are some of the experimentations that were taking place in private

1121
01:09:50.511 --> 01:09:53.270
architecture,
palace architecture.
And I,

1122
01:09:53.271 --> 01:09:56.870
and I should make the point that just as we've said that to market texture was

1123
01:09:56.871 --> 01:09:59.210
often very eccentric and very experimental.

1124
01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:02.420
The same was true for private architecture.
Not surprisingly,

1125
01:10:02.421 --> 01:10:06.740
these are buildings that people make personal decisions about how do I want to

1126
01:10:06.741 --> 01:10:09.980
live and what kind of spaces do I want to live,
uh,

1127
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.910
and in Wa and where do I,
and what kind of building do I want to be buried?

1128
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:17.240
That's it.
Those are very personal decisions and they were much more likely to be

1129
01:10:17.241 --> 01:10:21.620
experimental decisions where public architecture had to toe the line to a

1130
01:10:21.621 --> 01:10:26.621
certain extent and had to be more closely aligned with what had gone before.

1131
01:10:26.691 --> 01:10:31.130
And it was also more referential in terms of looking back to other emperors and

1132
01:10:31.131 --> 01:10:35.900
so on.
So we see experiments and private,
uh,
palace and to market texture,

1133
01:10:35.901 --> 01:10:40.280
villa architecture that we don't tend to see as much in public architecture.

1134
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:43.820
But what we see happening here is act is very momentous.

1135
01:10:43.821 --> 01:10:48.821
And that is the lessons that were explored first in private architecture are

1136
01:10:48.891 --> 01:10:53.600
being adopted in the most public of all Roman buildings,
a bath building.

1137
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:57.410
And it's being done in a very different way from the coliseum.

1138
01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:03.020
Most important,
the most important adoptions innovations that we're in.

1139
01:11:03.021 --> 01:11:08.021
Nero's Domus area that are also included in the bads of Titus are axiology

1140
01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:13.160
symmetry.
And I've described both of those already knew vaulted shapes,

1141
01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:14.970
which we also did see in the coliseum,

1142
01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:18.030
the use of the groin vault extensively here.

1143
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.680
And then perhaps most importantly,
this free flow of space,

1144
01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:24.750
the free flow of space,
the vistas,

1145
01:11:24.751 --> 01:11:29.070
the panoramas from one part of this bath structure to another that is very

1146
01:11:29.071 --> 01:11:33.740
different from the bath structure of the past on the bass structure of

1147
01:11:33.741 --> 01:11:36.390
structures,
for example,
of palm pay.

1148
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:41.460
So what we see in some is the fact that despite Nero's Dom Natya Memoria,
I,

1149
01:11:41.461 --> 01:11:45.420
despite the fact that that allowed,
uh,
authorities,
and in fact the,

1150
01:11:45.421 --> 01:11:48.420
the new emperor to destroy the portraits of Nero,

1151
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:52.710
to raise his palace to the ground,
which Vespasian did after all,

1152
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:54.960
despite that,
the,
uh,

1153
01:11:54.961 --> 01:11:59.280
the architectural innovations of Nero's Domus Aurelia lived on,

1154
01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:01.290
they lived on in the bas of Titus.

1155
01:12:01.291 --> 01:12:04.290
And we're going to see they lived on in perpetuity,

1156
01:12:04.291 --> 01:12:09.291
and we're going to see them continuing to have a huge impact on the evolution of

1157
01:12:10.531 --> 01:12:13.080
Roman architecture.
Thank you.
