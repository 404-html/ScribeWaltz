1
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.580
Good morning all when we left today's lecture,

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.380
I have called,
as you can see,
uh,
the mother of all forums,

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.510
civic architecture in Rome under Trajan.
And I think you'll see what I mean.

4
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.000
Uh,

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
when we look both at a transgenic bath building and also the forum of Trajan in

6
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.430
Rome.
What I mean by mother of all forums,

7
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:28.410
these war or were Gargantuan buildings bigger than anything that we have seen

8
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:31.890
before.
And interesting in all kinds of ways.

9
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.230
We left off with Nerva with the emperor nerva and you'll recall that nerva was

10
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:40.800
old and in fact also relatively sickly,
uh,

11
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.460
when he became emperor of Rome.
You'll also remember,

12
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:47.550
and I remind you of his portrait on the lefthand side of the screen,

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
you'll also recall that he was a member of the Senate and that he was chosen by

14
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.000
the Senate,
uh,
one of their own to become emperor of Rome,

15
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:02.001
the first emperor to come from the senatorial ranks in the history of Rome.

16
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.710
Uh,
but B,
because he,
and he was very popular with the Senate,

17
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:12.660
but nerva recognized quite early on that although he was popular with the Senate

18
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:14.700
and with the aristocracy,
uh,

19
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:18.460
he was not a favorite of the army.
Uh,

20
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.780
and he realized that was not a good position to be in.

21
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.810
And so he wisely decided very early on that he would select the most popular

22
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.120
military man and the most highly successful military man in Rome,

23
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.210
a man by the name of Trajan as his heir.

24
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.890
And so nerva adopts Trajan a new see Trojans portrait on the right hand side of

25
00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:45.180
the screen.
Nerva adopts Trajan in 97,

26
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:50.181
a d so that in 98 when nerva dies because he dies after only 16 months in office

27
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.550
when Nerva dies,
Trajan succeeds him without contest.

28
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.270
Trajan was an extraordinary emperor for Rome.
Uh,

29
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.100
there are a number of important points about trades and that should be made,
uh,

30
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.170
that have an impact on our understanding and analysis of his architecture.

31
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.710
One of those is he's the first Roman emperor to be born outside of Italy.

32
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.280
He was born in Spain,
the first emperor board in Spain.

33
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.560
That's not to say that Spain was the Boondocks by any stretch of the
imagination.

34
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.460
They had already been colonized by Rome and was very highly developed with

35
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:34.320
regard to its civilization.
He also came to power as a relatively young man.

36
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.580
He was only 45 years of age,
couple of years younger than Obama.
Uh,

37
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.930
and consequently he was in very,
and he was in very good physical shape.
Uh,

38
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:47.931
and so he had the physical wherewithal to be the kind of energetic emperor that

39
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:51.750
Rome needed.
At this particular point,

40
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.180
he undertook many military campaigns and very successfully,

41
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.540
and he was the emperor that Rome to its furthest reaches to its greatest

42
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:07.480
borders.
It's most extensive borders,
uh,
during his reign.

43
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.040
Uh,
and actually these were borders that were never gone beyond.
Uh,

44
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:15.600
after this point we'll see that the emperor Hadrian consolidates,
uh,

45
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.230
the extent of the empire as reached by Trajan and no one ever takes it beyond

46
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:20.441
that.

47
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:24.970
So this is going to be the furthest extent of the Empire that we'll see in the

48
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:26.830
course of the semester.

49
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:31.690
And he was also extremely wise when it came to his choice of the kinds of

50
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:36.220
buildings that he wanted to put up because he followed in the footsteps of

51
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:41.221
Vespasian and Titus by favoring major public architecture in Rome.

52
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.190
And by a shooing a private architecture.

53
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:50.191
He wanted above all to disassociate himself from a neuro and from demission who

54
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:55.300
had favored palatial architecture as you'll recall.
And so he,

55
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.330
he builds public architecture in Rome,
uh,
and uh,

56
00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:04.300
lies himself in this regard to such earlier emperors as Augustus,
uh,

57
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.170
and as,
uh,
as,
uh,

58
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.790
Claudius and as the Flavian Dynasty.

59
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.120
And we're going to see that in his building projects today.

60
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.580
Like so many other emperors,
uh,
when he came first came to power,

61
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.530
he looked around to see which buildings had fallen into disrepair,
uh,

62
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.850
and he decided to restore as many of those as he could.

63
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.220
And he chose very carefully.
Again,

64
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:34.210
he obviously did not choose buildings of a neuro,
uh,

65
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.460
many of which had already been destroyed in any case of it.

66
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.830
Rather look back further,
in fact,
dug deep into the republic a time,

67
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:43.660
a simpler time in many respects.

68
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:48.661
And a time prior to the shenanigans of the more monarchical minded emperors like

69
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:55.720
Nero and just Vespasian Nero and Domitian,
excuse me.
Uh,

70
00:04:55.721 --> 00:05:00.380
and he restored buildings from the Republican from the Augusta period.

71
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.560
Uh,
and he looked back,
for example,
to the forum of Caesar in Rome,
the forum,

72
00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:08.080
you Liam,
which you all know,
uh,
well,

73
00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:11.500
and we've talked about it before and I'm not going to discuss it in any detail

74
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:15.670
today,
just to remind you that it began to be restored.

75
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.410
That is the form of Julius Caesar under demission and that that restoration was

76
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:25.411
completed by trade and some at some point during his reign between 98 and 117 a

77
00:05:27.541 --> 00:05:29.920
d and I remind you of that here,

78
00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:34.000
you'll recall its location right next to the victory monument,

79
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.400
Victor Emmanuel Monument in Rome.

80
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.930
A you'll remember that even though it was restored by demission and Trajan,
uh,

81
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:45.580
it has fallen on hard times.
And if you look at the temple of Venus Ghana tricks,

82
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.140
I,
you see that all that survives besides the podium and the staircase are three

83
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:54.910
columns from that restored version by Trajan.
Uh,

84
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.790
you see the same three columns over here and then you'll recall the great open

85
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:03.170
space with colonnades on either side and then the market area,

86
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.230
the shops,
or to bear nigh on the left.

87
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.860
I showed you this view as well,
uh,
uh,

88
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.610
pointing out one of the architectural blocks,
uh,

89
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.330
that belonged to the restored building,
the building under Trajan.

90
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.570
And you can see the Trajan continues this interest in a ornamentation that was a

91
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.000
characteristic of the Flavian period,

92
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:28.790
very ornamental architectural decoration,

93
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:33.770
very deeply carved with a strong contrast between light and dark.

94
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:38.771
So he does continue this Flavian interest in very elaborate architectural

95
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.360
decoration.

96
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.940
You'll remember that the temple of Venus Ghana tricks in the forum of Julius

97
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.940
Caesar had a pediment that had in the center of that pediment a scene depicting

98
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:55.150
Venus rising from the sea.
Uh,

99
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.750
and there is other Venus imagery and I show you a detail and it's on your

100
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:00.531
monument list.

101
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:05.531
I show you a detail of part of a freeze that depicts a cupid's wing,

102
00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:09.770
had chubby wing,
had babies.
As you can see here,

103
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:12.230
cupid's who are carrying the arms.

104
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:14.630
You can see one of them with a sword sheath over here,

105
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.960
they are carrying the arms and armor of Mars,
Mars of course,

106
00:07:17.961 --> 00:07:22.961
the consort of Venus and Mars making reference also to military victory.

107
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.970
Uh,
this freeze as far as we can tell,

108
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:30.050
does belong to the tray Janick renovation of the building,

109
00:07:30.051 --> 00:07:32.400
but it probably does look back,
uh,

110
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:37.510
to earlier to an earlier Julian freeze that decorated the original temple in

111
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:41.210
Rome from this from,

112
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.890
and I use that a restoration of the temple of Venus Ghana tricks in the form of

113
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:50.891
Julius Caesar as an example of the kind of restoration work that Trajan embarked

114
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:53.990
on at the beginning of his principle.

115
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:59.470
But much more important to us today are to building two buildings,

116
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:04.790
the first a bath and the second a forum that are examples of the devotion that

117
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:09.650
Trajan had two public architecture during his reign.

118
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:12.050
And I show you a view here.
In fact,

119
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:17.051
a plan of the so called baths of Trajan in Rome that were dedicated in

120
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.740
[inaudible] nine.
As you can see from the monument list,

121
00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:25.980
we know the architect in this particular case,
uh,
it is Apollo,

122
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:30.770
Doris of Damascus,
and his name says a lot about him,
Apollo,
Doris from,

123
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:35.450
from Damascus,
modern Syria.
Uh,
so it's very interesting.

124
00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:40.451
We have an emperor from Spain and an architect from Syria who worked together.

125
00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:45.530
This is a sign that things are beginning to change in the Roman empire as the

126
00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:49.010
Romans,
as Trajan extends those borders even further.

127
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.490
It brings in an even more multifaceted,

128
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.630
multifaceted civilizations around the world.
Uh,

129
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.470
and talent begins to pour into Rome from all of those places.

130
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.390
Uh,
Paula Doris of Damascus is,

131
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:07.800
we'll see today was an extraordinary architect right up there with severance and

132
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:12.720
Keller and with Riveria Spec,
one could argue even the equal of rebellious.

133
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.640
And what's particularly interesting is that that,
uh,
Apollo doors of Damascus,

134
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:19.560
like Severus in Keller before him,

135
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.250
appears to have been above all a great engineer.
Uh,

136
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.330
he actually accompanied Trajan on trade gins,
military,

137
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:33.300
uh,
campaigns,
uh,
and served as trade is military architect.

138
00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:36.030
So his first commissions,
we're building bridges.

139
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.640
I'm going to show you a reference to one today,

140
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.880
building bridges or building forts and camps on Trajan is military campaigns.

141
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.020
Uh,
and then,
uh,
using that expertise,

142
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:54.070
a ingratiating himself with the emperor who sees that he is enormously talented

143
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:58.860
cause Trajan was on the ruck.
Trajan participated in these campaigns himself,

144
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.940
seeing how talented he was and then putting him in charge of his building

145
00:10:02.941 --> 00:10:05.730
projects in Rome,
which is really quite interesting.

146
00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:10.731
And so these projects are not only aesthetically pleasing and fascinating,

147
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:13.710
but also show extraordinary,
uh,

148
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:18.390
engineering skill on the part of the major designer,
namely Apollo,

149
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.040
Doris of Damascus.

150
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:25.140
Now these bags of Trajan are very interesting in all kinds of ways.

151
00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:28.950
You can already see by looking at the plan,
their location,

152
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.170
they are located on the Eschalon Hill,
uh,
and part of the op Ian Hill,

153
00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:35.730
which I don't think I've mentioned before.

154
00:10:35.731 --> 00:10:40.731
O P P I a n the smaller op Ian Hill and the bads of Titus that,

155
00:10:41.361 --> 00:10:45.810
well,
let me,
let me remind you first that the,
uh,
the Dome is,

156
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:50.520
our area of Nero was built in part on the Escalade.

157
00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.580
Inhale.
And you'll recall the so called Espolon wing,

158
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.760
which is the one wing of Nero's Domus area that is still preserved underground.

159
00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.500
Uh,

160
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:04.500
you'll recall that after Nero's dumb not to your memoria and the coming to power

161
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:10.431
of the Flavian dynasty that Vespasian and Titus and even demission built,

162
00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:14.580
they're built razed to the ground,
uh,
Nero's buildings.

163
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:19.670
This patient did that and then he and Titus and emission built new buildings on

164
00:11:19.921 --> 00:11:24.921
top of those and chose to make those buildings the kind of public buildings that

165
00:11:25.621 --> 00:11:30.510
the citizenry as a whole would enjoy.
What from the Coliseum and amphitheater,

166
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.020
uh,
to the baths of Titus.
Uh,
and you see again,

167
00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:38.760
the bads of Titus here located right again on top of this area.

168
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.060
Uh,

169
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:44.060
that originally belonged to Nero's Domus out Aria Trajan follow suit.

170
00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:48.180
He not only his interest in public architecture like Vespasian and Titus before

171
00:11:48.181 --> 00:11:48.690
him,

172
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:53.690
but he follows their lead in building these buildings on top of earlier

173
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:57.280
structures now destroyed,
uh,
of narrow.

174
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.720
So it's again the same message giving back to the people of the land that Nero

175
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:05.590
had taken illegally,
uh,
from Rome during his reign.

176
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:11.490
The boughs of Trajan are based in large part on the plan of the Bas of Titus

177
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.110
with some additions.

178
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.520
But you can see the extraordinary difference in scale.

179
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.560
The bads of Titus.
We're not small.
Uh,
and yet the bads of Trajan,

180
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.240
uh,
are at least three,

181
00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:30.241
if not four or more times the size of the bads of Titus.

182
00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:35.431
So this tells us something again about the grandiosity of the vision of Trajan,

183
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.490
about the,
uh,
the funds that he had at his disposal.

184
00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:42.880
And he got those funds in large part because of all these military victories in

185
00:12:42.881 --> 00:12:45.460
which he took all kinds of spoils and booty,

186
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:49.960
which are used to fund his building campaigns in Rome.
Uh,

187
00:12:49.961 --> 00:12:52.330
and it also tells us something about his ambitions.

188
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.180
Now I don't want you to get the impression that we never had big buildings

189
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:56.014
before.

190
00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.170
You can think back way to the beginning of the semester when we talked about

191
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:04.171
Julius Caesar and his architecture and his bragging that he had built a a or,

192
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.580
or one of the authors of that period tells us that a Julius Caesar had built a

193
00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:11.740
temple to Mars.
The biggest in the world.

194
00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:16.540
So in its own day it was supposedly the biggest in the world.
Uh,

195
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:19.780
but we're getting even more ambitious with visa vi scale.

196
00:13:19.781 --> 00:13:24.520
And I think perhaps,
again,
I'm psychoanalyzing Trajan too much,

197
00:13:24.521 --> 00:13:29.521
but I think the fact that this is a man who had the ambitions that he did to

198
00:13:30.461 --> 00:13:34.480
extend the Empire to its furthest reaches seems to go.

199
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:38.530
It seems to be in keeping with the kind of man who would want to make the

200
00:13:38.531 --> 00:13:43.531
buildings in Rome that he built a kind of microcosm of that hugely expanded

201
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.960
empire.
With regard to the plan of the Bas,

202
00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:51.961
you will see that it follows the so called imperial bath type that was initiated

203
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.070
by the Bas of Titus,
at least with regard to a bas.

204
00:13:57.071 --> 00:13:58.660
It's still prison are still preserved.

205
00:13:58.661 --> 00:14:00.880
I mentioned to you when we talked about the bads of Titus,

206
00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:04.660
there may have been an earlier bath of Nero that actually followed this same

207
00:14:04.661 --> 00:14:09.220
imperial bath form,
but we're not absolutely sure about its plan.

208
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.290
That is the neurone and best they existed,

209
00:14:11.291 --> 00:14:13.120
but we're not absolutely sure about their plan.

210
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.450
But if we look back at the bads of Titus,

211
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:20.980
you'll remember that what made them distinctive and what made them differ from

212
00:14:20.981 --> 00:14:23.380
the earlier stobby and bas or foreign Basit.

213
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.500
Pompei was the way in which they placed the bathing block in the center rather

214
00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:33.970
than to the side,
uh,
that they arranged the main rooms,
the,
uh,

215
00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:38.350
the,
uh,
the tepid Doriam,

216
00:14:38.351 --> 00:14:43.351
the frigging Darian and the call Daria in this case in axial relationship to one

217
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:45.190
another.

218
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:49.240
And then all the other rooms of the bath were displayed around those in a

219
00:14:49.241 --> 00:14:53.810
symmetrical way.
So axiology and symmetry reign supreme,

220
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:58.250
uh,
and then otherwise we saw here the rest of the precinct within elaborate

221
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.960
entrance way over here,

222
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.320
we see roughly the same in the bowels of Trajan in that again,

223
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.830
the bathing block is located right at the center of the structure.

224
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.030
And the main rooms are aligned with one another.
Axially.

225
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.090
If you look up to the,
where it says bas of Trajan,

226
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.510
that at the northern end is the entrance into the baths.

227
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:25.460
You enter from there into n,
which is in the Tatio or swimming pool,

228
00:15:25.461 --> 00:15:26.790
a PC,
Anna.
Uh,

229
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.800
and then you can see that as surrounded by columns on axis with the swimming

230
00:15:32.121 --> 00:15:35.480
pool is the frigging Doriam at f.

231
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:39.410
And you can see just like that of the baths of Titus.

232
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:43.760
It is a groin vaulted room,
a triple groin vaulted room.

233
00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:48.710
As you can see by the three x's over the rectangular area.
Uh,
it has,
uh,

234
00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:49.820
kind of,
uh,

235
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:54.500
an apps or Exedra at the upper most part through which one comes from the

236
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:59.510
Natacha into the frigate Darian.
And you can see that is screened by columns.

237
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:04.750
Then from there into the fairly simple rectangularly shaped tepid Darian that

238
00:16:05.001 --> 00:16:10.001
serves more as a kind of passageway from the frigging Darian into C,

239
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:13.430
which of course is the caldarium or the warmest room,

240
00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:17.360
the sauna of the bas that also has a rectangular shape.

241
00:16:17.361 --> 00:16:22.361
But with these radiating a alcoves radiating alcoves that we're going to see are

242
00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:24.380
screened by columns.

243
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:29.150
And they are of course facing the southern end where the sun is a and that would

244
00:16:29.151 --> 00:16:33.950
of course help do heat the call caldarium as well.
Uh,

245
00:16:33.951 --> 00:16:35.120
and then what we see,

246
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:40.130
what we see though with regard to the baths of Trajan that make them differ from

247
00:16:40.131 --> 00:16:45.131
the bads of Titus and a part of this evolution of imperial bath architecture in

248
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:46.660
Rome,
uh,

249
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:51.670
is the fact that the bathing block is placed in this very large rectangular

250
00:16:51.861 --> 00:16:53.180
precinct.
Uh,

251
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:57.920
and this large rectangular precinct has a series of rooms around it.

252
00:16:57.921 --> 00:17:02.510
As you can see real rooms and rooms that take all kinds of shapes.

253
00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:07.270
Many of them are,
uh,
these,
uh,
heavy cycle type shapes screen,

254
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.660
uh,
by call from,

255
00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:13.130
with columns from the larger central space.

256
00:17:13.131 --> 00:17:15.900
But some of them also look like the tobacco,
NY,
uh,

257
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:19.790
that we've become used to in plan.
Uh,
we see all of those there.

258
00:17:19.791 --> 00:17:24.470
And these were used as far as we can determine as meeting halls,

259
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:28.310
lecture halls,
Greek and Latin library.
So this is this,

260
00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:33.020
this extension of the bath from being just a place where you went to,

261
00:17:33.021 --> 00:17:36.880
to get to,
uh,
you know,
for wellness essentially to,

262
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:42.460
to bathe and to relax and to have social interaction with your friends.

263
00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:44.120
Uh,

264
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.830
they are adding an intellectual element to the bath buildings.

265
00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.740
So you can also go there if you want to read.
If you want to go to the library,

266
00:17:52.741 --> 00:17:56.550
read Greek books,
read Latin books,
go to lectures,
go to seminars,

267
00:17:56.551 --> 00:18:01.290
have conversations.
Intellectual conversations are also beginning to happen here.

268
00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:06.291
So the bath becomes even more a of a Mecca for people who are interested in

269
00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:11.220
intellectual life as well as,
uh,
bathing and social life,

270
00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:15.600
which is a very important development culturally for the Romans.

271
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.620
A note here,
also this great hemi cycle down here,

272
00:18:19.621 --> 00:18:21.990
which is part of the bath building,

273
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.810
a Hemi cycle that had seats on it,

274
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:29.160
which probably serve four performances of whatever kind,
uh,

275
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.630
that would have taken place here.

276
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:35.580
So that's another interesting addition to the bathing scene and should remind

277
00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:39.000
you of the kind of Hemi cycles that we saw,
for example,

278
00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:44.180
in the sanctuary or Fortuna premed Jania at Palestrina or the sanctuary of

279
00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:48.350
Hercules at Tivoli w where they also had those performance areas.

280
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:53.350
So bringing in some of those elements from sanctuary design into a bath design

281
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:58.290
in the bads of Trajan in Rome,

282
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:01.900
the bas of Trajan.
Uh,

283
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.720
some parts of them still exist but scattered.
Uh,
and in fact,

284
00:19:06.721 --> 00:19:11.721
they are located now in a kind of a pleasant garden area.

285
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:12.870
As you can see here,

286
00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:18.080
this is a Google earth view that shows you their proximity to the coliseum.

287
00:19:18.601 --> 00:19:20.670
We see the edge of the coliseum over here.

288
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:24.070
So the Eschalon hill in large part a,

289
00:19:24.071 --> 00:19:26.730
and you can just barely make out here.
If you look,

290
00:19:26.731 --> 00:19:28.920
you see this curved wall down here.

291
00:19:28.921 --> 00:19:33.480
That curved wall is in fact that Hemi cycled with the for the theatrical

292
00:19:33.481 --> 00:19:37.230
performances that I showed you just before.
Uh,

293
00:19:37.231 --> 00:19:40.980
and that is actually the entrance where they wouldn't going to Rome over break.

294
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.590
That's actually the entrance to the dome is our area.

295
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:48.180
If it's open to periodically closes,
sometimes if things are falling down,

296
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:52.020
but if it's open,
that's how one gets there.
Uh,
and over here,

297
00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:55.620
you can actually see,
this is the,
I may have shown this to you before,

298
00:19:55.621 --> 00:19:57.420
but this is actually,
uh,

299
00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:02.290
the Oculus of the octagonal room of Nero's Domus area.

300
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.620
You can see it if you wander through this park,

301
00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:07.890
you can see it from above with a grate on top of it,

302
00:20:07.891 --> 00:20:11.670
as well as down below if you visit the palace itself.

303
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.960
And then up here you can see another right up above my finger.

304
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.240
You can see another curved wall.

305
00:20:18.241 --> 00:20:21.600
And there's another one somewhere down here,
uh,

306
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:24.240
that are part of those,
uh,
those,

307
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:29.630
those curved rooms as Hemi Securitas have made cycle shaped rooms that are,

308
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:35.100
that are,
uh,
these lecture halls and meeting halls and so on.
So,

309
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:39.880
and actually that one,
the one that's up here,
uh,
actually has,
um,

310
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.560
niches in the wall with shelves,

311
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:48.480
which indicates to us that that was used as one of the libraries scrolls would

312
00:20:48.481 --> 00:20:52.390
have been placed on those shelves and then have cupboards in front of them.

313
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:56.740
So one can see remains.
It's made out of concrete,
faced with brick,

314
00:20:56.741 --> 00:21:00.750
one can see remains on the top of that hill.
Uh,

315
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.960
but a model over here,

316
00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:05.230
it gives you a better sense of what it looked like in antiquity,
were again,

317
00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:09.070
looking at that large hemi cycle that served with its seats,

318
00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:13.450
that served four performances.
Here we're looking at the outer precinct wall.

319
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:17.380
We can see the semi domes of some of the Hemi cycles here.

320
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:22.390
And we can also see the bathing block,
uh,
at the upper most part,

321
00:21:22.391 --> 00:21:25.990
the entrance way,
the courtyard surrounded by columns,

322
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:29.380
which is where the pool or Natalia was located.
Uh,

323
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:33.480
the covered area here was the frigging Darian,
then the test,

324
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.200
the Dar in the Caldari ms here.

325
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:39.170
And here you can see those radiating alcoves with columns,
uh,

326
00:21:39.171 --> 00:21:42.430
that opened them up,
uh,
for vistas and the like,

327
00:21:42.431 --> 00:21:45.220
as well as to the warmth of the sun.

328
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.430
So an incredible bathing,
a establishment,
uh,

329
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:54.450
and one that has taken us a step further and the evolution of imperial bath

330
00:21:55.091 --> 00:22:00.091
architecture in Rome and will serve as the major model for the two most famous

331
00:22:00.911 --> 00:22:04.420
and much better preserved,
uh,
bads in Rome.

332
00:22:04.421 --> 00:22:07.690
And that is the baths of Caracalla and the bads of Diocletian,

333
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.360
which we'll look at later in the semester.

334
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:15.520
But I'd like to turn from the tray Janick vads to the unquestionably the most

335
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:20.521
important public building that was commissioned by Trajan during his reign.

336
00:22:21.821 --> 00:22:26.821
And I can't overemphasize enough the importance of this building in the history

337
00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:28.750
of Roman architecture.

338
00:22:28.751 --> 00:22:32.710
And we're going to see that it is two part in the sense that it has,

339
00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:37.900
it is a forum.
It has the forum proper and it also has markets appended to us.

340
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:41.770
They are done in a different architectural style.
And Harold,

341
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.230
something very important,

342
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.570
very important development enrollment architecture that's going to be carried

343
00:22:46.571 --> 00:22:50.800
further,
uh,
by,
uh,
trade gins,
successors.

344
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.900
The,

345
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:57.490
what we're looking at here is a spectacular aerial view of the part of Rome in

346
00:22:57.491 --> 00:23:02.290
which the forum of Trajan finds itself.
Uh,
we are looking,

347
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:06.160
we are looking at buildings that we have looked at before so we can get our

348
00:23:06.161 --> 00:23:10.090
bearings.
This is of course the wedding cake of Victor Emmanuel.

349
00:23:10.091 --> 00:23:12.280
Over here you can see,
uh,

350
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:16.790
a part of the Oval Piatsa designed by Michelangelo of the comp.

351
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:21.010
Doleo.
You can also see and what's this down here

352
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:30.790
forum met Wendy,
the Julian Forum,
the Forum of Julius Caesar,

353
00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.590
much lower ground level then the rest of the city today.

354
00:23:34.591 --> 00:23:38.220
And you can actually see those three columns from the temple that I showed you

355
00:23:38.221 --> 00:23:41.910
just before,
as well as the [inaudible] of the Julian Forum.

356
00:23:41.911 --> 00:23:46.911
And note the relationship of the Julian Forum to the tray Janick form.

357
00:23:47.271 --> 00:23:50.900
He's restoring Julius Caesar's forum at the same time he's building his own.

358
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:55.460
I can also show you here,
uh,
if you look right above my hand,

359
00:23:55.461 --> 00:23:57.790
you can see the Po,
uh,

360
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.160
Piatsa Venezia and the Palazzo Venay Tsia.

361
00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:04.520
If you look at the center of that building right over the doorway,

362
00:24:04.521 --> 00:24:08.210
there's a balcony that is the famous Mussolini Balcony.

363
00:24:08.211 --> 00:24:12.050
That's the balcony from which muscle Leni made all his speeches with his

364
00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:17.000
followers gathering in the pilots have a Naisia.
Uh,
and from that,

365
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:22.030
from the [inaudible] of the street that goes from there to the Piazza del Popolo

366
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.880
is the Corso,
the race course,
the Corso of Rome,

367
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:29.540
which is one of the major streets of Rome where the major shopping streets of

368
00:24:29.541 --> 00:24:32.840
Rome,
as well as one of the major thoroughfares that takes you,

369
00:24:32.841 --> 00:24:35.360
if you go down halfway,
take a right,

370
00:24:35.361 --> 00:24:39.950
you were at the via Conn Dottie and ultimately at the Piatsa disbar new or the

371
00:24:39.951 --> 00:24:44.590
Spanish steps,
which of course is a trap that everybody who visits Rome,
uh,

372
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:48.830
follows that path to see the Spanish steps over here.

373
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:53.420
The forum that we're going to be talking about today,
the forum of Trajan,

374
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.070
much of that forum is underground.
Uh,

375
00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:02.720
and some of it was turned into a garden.
As you can see here,
pleasant park.

376
00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.400
As you can see here,

377
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:09.290
here we are looking at some of the columns from the basilica that's part of that

378
00:25:09.291 --> 00:25:13.120
forum from the very well preserved column of Trajan.
Uh,

379
00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.870
and also over here we'll see the markets of the forum.

380
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:22.130
But I just wanted you to get your bearings again in terms of where it's situated

381
00:25:22.131 --> 00:25:25.580
in Rome and what it looks like today from the air,

382
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.830
although it is changing all the time.

383
00:25:27.831 --> 00:25:31.310
And I wanted to show you a Google earth image as well cause this is much more up

384
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:35.490
to date than the aerial view that I showed you just before.
Uh,

385
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:39.410
and you'll see the same buildings.
You'll see the Victor Emmanuel monument,

386
00:25:39.411 --> 00:25:43.060
you'll see part of the company Doleo,
you'll see,
uh,
the,
uh,

387
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.200
the muscly and he balcony and the Corso,
uh,

388
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.670
and you'll see the column of Trajan and part of the basilica.

389
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:54.830
But what you see here is that park has been replaced by structures,

390
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.010
uh,
because they are excavating.
I've mentioned this before,
they,

391
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:59.690
they are excavating,
uh,

392
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.780
more of this now with the hope of someday rejoining the Roman forum with the

393
00:26:05.661 --> 00:26:10.610
imperial fora that may not be able to happen because of traffic concerns.

394
00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:12.950
But it is certainly something that's on the drawing board.

395
00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.310
And at the very least right now without narrowing the street,

396
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:21.340
the main via day fori and periodically they are doing excavation in that park

397
00:26:21.561 --> 00:26:24.920
area and you can see what they've brought up.
This is not ancient.

398
00:26:24.921 --> 00:26:29.030
It's actually mostly medieval,
uh,
houses.
I hope you felt there.

399
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.780
No medievalism on you,
but I hope they'll eventually realize that these are,

400
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:38.240
well,
who's to say,
uh,
that,
that they should probably remove these as well.

401
00:26:38.241 --> 00:26:42.840
And take us back to the original forum of Trajan.
I hope that happens.
Somebody,

402
00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:46.560
they're very distinctive if one looks at them,
no,
just mainly rectangular rooms.

403
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.170
Uh,
but nonetheless there at that medieval level now,

404
00:26:49.171 --> 00:26:52.170
and the question is whether they're going to go down any further,

405
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.290
but here you can see not only the remains of the forum of Trajan,

406
00:26:55.291 --> 00:26:58.500
but also the form of Augustus.
Here's the temple of Marzel tour,

407
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:03.680
that great precinct wall that divided it from the Sabura also visible here.

408
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:08.160
And here we see the great heavy cycle that we'll look at today of Trajan is

409
00:27:08.161 --> 00:27:11.280
forum behind it,
the markets of Trajan.

410
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:17.090
It's important for us to look back at the general plan of the imperial fora,

411
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.340
uh,
to see where the forum of Trajan fits in.

412
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:24.750
We have already looked at the form of Julius Caesar with its Temple of Venus

413
00:27:24.751 --> 00:27:25.351
Gannett tricks.

414
00:27:25.351 --> 00:27:28.950
We have looked at the forum of Augustus with its temple of Mars old tour.

415
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.700
Remember the exact dry on either side of that temple,

416
00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:35.610
the embracing arms that were new at that time,

417
00:27:35.611 --> 00:27:40.611
and an important component of the forum of Augustus Vespasian adds his forum

418
00:27:40.801 --> 00:27:42.990
pacas over here.
Uh,

419
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:47.190
demission adds a narrow forum,
uh,

420
00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:51.540
the so called forum transitory and that served as a point of transit between the

421
00:27:51.541 --> 00:27:55.040
Roman forum and the Sabura.
Ah,
here it is at,

422
00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.950
at that he puts a temple to his patron goddess Minerva,
uh,

423
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.990
in that,
uh,
forum.
Uh,
but it is at his death.

424
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.310
It is taken over by Nerva and renamed the Forum of Nerva.

425
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.780
I mentioned to you when we talked about the forum transitory Torian that

426
00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:16.770
demission also had his eye on this property over here.

427
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.710
He had grant,
he has it.
He had his schemes,

428
00:28:19.711 --> 00:28:22.500
his grandiose for public architecture.

429
00:28:22.501 --> 00:28:26.580
At one point as per palatial architecture,
but palatial architecture one out.

430
00:28:26.581 --> 00:28:30.750
And he put all of his effort into the palace on the Palatine Hill and never

431
00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:34.170
realized,
uh,
any construction in this area.

432
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.360
When Trajan became emperor,

433
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:41.510
he decided that he would would again focus on public architecture and that he

434
00:28:41.551 --> 00:28:46.320
would build a forum like none other before it.
Uh,
and so he begins to do that.

435
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.471
Now,

436
00:28:46.471 --> 00:28:51.390
that was no small feat in this particular part of the city because most of this

437
00:28:51.391 --> 00:28:54.560
area was occupied by a hill.
Uh,

438
00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.980
the so called Queer and all Q,
u.
I,
r.
I,
N A,
l,

439
00:28:58.981 --> 00:29:03.900
the queerer knowl hill in Rome occupied most of this space.

440
00:29:03.901 --> 00:29:04.920
So what he needed to do,

441
00:29:04.921 --> 00:29:07.920
it's great to have an architect engineer in your back pocket.

442
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:12.810
So he set a Pala doors of Damascus to work.
He said,
you're a great engineer.

443
00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:17.010
All you need to do is take down a good part of the queer and the hill to make

444
00:29:17.011 --> 00:29:21.360
way for this great forum that I want to build.
And Lo and behold,

445
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:24.960
a Pala Doris was absolutely up to the job.
Uh,

446
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.420
and that's exactly what he sets out to do.

447
00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:32.450
He removes 125 feet of the queer all hill in order to make way for the forum of

448
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:39.660
Trajan.
And that very,
uh,

449
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:44.690
number 125 feet is actually commemorated in the column of Trajan because the

450
00:29:45.761 --> 00:29:48.730
column of Trajan was built to that very same height,

451
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.360
125 feet to show you as you stand in the forum,

452
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:57.450
how much of that hill had to be cut back in order to make way for the forum.

453
00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.380
You can see by looking at this plan of the imperial for as a whole,

454
00:30:02.381 --> 00:30:03.041
and this is our lead,

455
00:30:03.041 --> 00:30:06.370
not only did trade and take the Empire to its furthest extent,

456
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:11.490
this is the last forum that was added to the imperial fora in Rome.

457
00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:16.210
Uh,
you can see by looking at it in connection to the others,

458
00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:20.800
that if you count it plus the markets,
which you see wending their way up,

459
00:30:20.801 --> 00:30:23.800
what was left of the queer and they'll hill here in plaid.

460
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.290
If you compare that to the others,

461
00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:30.820
you can see that the forum of Trajan and the markets of Trajan were almost as

462
00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:34.750
large as all of the other fora,
not counting the Roman forum,

463
00:30:34.751 --> 00:30:37.390
but all of the other imperial fora together,

464
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.600
which gives you some sense of why I call this the mother of all forums.

465
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.840
Now we're going to look at the plan of this and I'm going to show you an

466
00:30:46.841 --> 00:30:49.960
individual plan in a moment.
But what I want to say,

467
00:30:49.961 --> 00:30:52.120
well this is still on the screen,
uh,

468
00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:57.420
is that I want you to look at the [inaudible] that you see on either side of the

469
00:30:57.521 --> 00:31:02.000
main space of the forum and on either side of the basilica over here.

470
00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:03.790
These are not coincidentally,

471
00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:08.620
they are certainly meant to make reference to the IG Z dry of Augustus's forum.

472
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:13.900
Trajan modeled himself after Augustus.
He became a kind of neo Augustus.

473
00:31:13.901 --> 00:31:14.734
He,
uh,

474
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:19.740
took on Augustus is hairstyle and his manners and so he was trying to associate

475
00:31:20.441 --> 00:31:22.090
himself in his life with Augustus.

476
00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:27.150
He's doing it here also through architecture by placing those exceed dry on

477
00:31:27.371 --> 00:31:29.530
either side of his forum.

478
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:34.150
Here's the plan of the forum itself.

479
00:31:34.151 --> 00:31:38.950
On the left hand side of the screen where we can see all of its major features,

480
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:41.860
you'd enter into the forum down here.
Uh,

481
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.470
there was a very elaborate entrance way here and you can see that the,

482
00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.740
the facade is actually not straight but convex,

483
00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:55.530
convex,
a convex facade,
which is very interesting curved facade,
uh,

484
00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:58.390
with an elaborate entrance way over here,

485
00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:04.450
the entrance into the main part of the forum,
rectangular in shape.

486
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.930
There's a base here for an equestrian statue of Trajan,

487
00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.180
the exceed dry on either side,

488
00:32:10.181 --> 00:32:13.930
mimicking those of the forum of Augustus colonnades,

489
00:32:13.931 --> 00:32:17.770
also on either side and some additional columns here.

490
00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.950
And we're going to see that just as an Augustus's forum.

491
00:32:20.951 --> 00:32:25.510
Another reference back to Augustus that the columns in this main area,

492
00:32:25.511 --> 00:32:29.890
our Corinthian below,
but in the second tier there are figures,

493
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.220
not figures of Karrie audits,
but different kinds of figures.

494
00:32:33.221 --> 00:32:36.700
And I'm going to show you those soon over here,
the basilica,

495
00:32:36.701 --> 00:32:40.010
which is perpendicular to the forum proper,

496
00:32:40.011 --> 00:32:43.340
this is quite different from the forum at palm pay where you'll remember the

497
00:32:43.341 --> 00:32:46.220
basilica was splayed off to the side.

498
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:51.230
Here we have it as a more integral part of the forum and perpendicular to the

499
00:32:51.231 --> 00:32:54.980
main space here.
It's a very large basilica.

500
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:59.450
It takes the name of Trajan,
his family,
his family name was opiates.

501
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.310
You LP,
I.
U.
S.

502
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:06.490
This is the Basilica Olympia in Rome with a central nave and side aisles,

503
00:33:07.371 --> 00:33:11.420
a couple of side aisles around it or veritable forest of columns.

504
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:16.490
And then other exceed dry matching exceeds our er in this case apses on either

505
00:33:16.491 --> 00:33:17.324
end.

506
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:22.450
Then through here you see the location of the column of Trajan in a small,

507
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:27.410
uh,
small,
uh,
Piatsa and to left and right libraries,

508
00:33:27.411 --> 00:33:31.310
Greek and Latin libraries.
And then at the end of temple,

509
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:35.540
we don't know what Trajan actually the,
the,
the temp,

510
00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:40.541
the northern end of the structure was not completed at trade is death.

511
00:33:40.641 --> 00:33:43.760
And we don't know if he would have put a temple there.

512
00:33:43.761 --> 00:33:47.900
It's highly likely because what forum have we seen without a temple at the short

513
00:33:47.901 --> 00:33:52.340
end,
they all had them,
so it's a good guests.
Uh,
the Trajan had that in mind too,

514
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:56.000
but the temple that was built there was actually built after his death by his

515
00:33:56.001 --> 00:34:01.001
successor Hadrian a temple that Hadrian put up to honor Trajan and also trade

516
00:34:01.481 --> 00:34:06.440
Jin's wife,
Palatine of PLO,
t I n a.
Now we know quite a bit,

517
00:34:06.441 --> 00:34:09.350
a lot of the forum,
some of the forum is still preserved.
Uh,

518
00:34:09.351 --> 00:34:12.290
and we have evidence for other parts of it that are not preserved.

519
00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:17.380
This entrance gate down here,
believe it or not,
we have coins,
uh,

520
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:21.350
that have an entrance gate on them and nicely they say,

521
00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:26.360
fortunately they say down below forum,
try on forum of Trajan.

522
00:34:26.390 --> 00:34:28.750
So putting two and two together,
uh,

523
00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:33.380
we have to go on the assumption that what we are looking at here is a rendition

524
00:34:33.381 --> 00:34:38.120
on a coin of the entrance gate into the forum of Trajan Forum.

525
00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:41.870
Uh,
and if we look at it here,
we see some interesting things.

526
00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:45.410
We see first of all that it has a single occupation in the center.

527
00:34:45.411 --> 00:34:50.030
So one doorway,
it has a series of bays that have in them,

528
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:54.950
uh,
what we call Idig,
July a,
e,
d,
I,
C,
u,
l a,

529
00:34:54.951 --> 00:34:57.890
e I udicky July,
uh,
which are little temple,

530
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.730
little temple fronts that are niches with little temple fronts around them with

531
00:35:01.731 --> 00:35:06.170
columns and pediments.
And then you can see statuary inside those.

532
00:35:06.171 --> 00:35:09.800
So a series of bays decorated with these [inaudible] with statutes,

533
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.980
then a series of circles with blobs in them.

534
00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:16.840
I think those series of circles with blobs in them are probably the,
uh,

535
00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.320
portraits represented on shields because we have act,

536
00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:25.250
we have remains of actual portraits on shields from the inside of the forums.

537
00:35:25.251 --> 00:35:29.930
So that seems to be the case here as well.
And then in the upper most part,

538
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:31.950
we see that the,
the gate,
uh,

539
00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:36.170
it looks very much like an arch and the sense that it supports a quad rigor at

540
00:35:36.171 --> 00:35:40.890
the top.
And that quad rigor represents two people,
possibly the emperor.
Again,

541
00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:44.010
we're dealing with blobs here.
We have to do the best we can to interpret them.

542
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:48.600
Uh,
but they seem to be probably the emperor and possibly victory.

543
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:53.490
Crowning him the way we saw victory crowning Titus in his chariot on his arch,

544
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:58.440
six horses in this particular case.
And then on either side trophies,

545
00:35:58.441 --> 00:36:03.300
these tree trunks decorated with captured arms and armor.
Uh,
and uh,

546
00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:06.750
prob we're not absolutely sure what surrounding them in this case,

547
00:36:06.751 --> 00:36:09.180
whether they're prisoners or Roman soldiers.

548
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:14.360
So this gives you a very good idea of the entrance gate into this structure.

549
00:36:14.581 --> 00:36:18.690
And I also want to point out if you look very closely at the columns and the

550
00:36:18.691 --> 00:36:20.460
elements above them in the attic,

551
00:36:20.461 --> 00:36:24.630
you can see that the columns project and the addict seems to have projecting and

552
00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:25.291
tablature.

553
00:36:25.291 --> 00:36:29.700
So it looks as if we have the kind of scheme here that we saw in the form,

554
00:36:29.701 --> 00:36:34.530
transitory them with that wall decorated with columns that project out of the

555
00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:39.531
wall and that have projecting and tablature giving this undulation Mu undulating

556
00:36:40.381 --> 00:36:42.690
movement from projecting to receiving,

557
00:36:42.691 --> 00:36:47.340
projecting to receiving across the facade of the entrance gate,

558
00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:54.260
the figures that were located on the upper tier of the center of the main body

559
00:36:55.861 --> 00:36:59.340
of this forum.
Again,
we're not carry odds are female figures,

560
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:00.990
but rather male figures,

561
00:37:00.991 --> 00:37:05.370
male figures of captured dations because the war,
uh,

562
00:37:05.371 --> 00:37:06.550
that Trajan,
uh,

563
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:11.750
had that enabled him to fuck to celebrate and to fund this building was his wars

564
00:37:13.411 --> 00:37:15.300
against the dations Dac.

565
00:37:15.301 --> 00:37:20.301
I a n s Daysha ancient Dacia Modern Romania today Trajan had to military

566
00:37:22.321 --> 00:37:26.580
campaigns there.
One from one oh two,
two one oh two one.
Oh,
excuse me.

567
00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:31.650
The first one from one a one two,
one oh two,
the second one from one oh five,
two,

568
00:37:31.651 --> 00:37:36.600
one oh seven.
He was victorious in both of those.
Uh,
and he,
uh,

569
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.991
he,

570
00:37:36.991 --> 00:37:41.991
this forum was built from the spoils of that war to honor his victory.

571
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:44.150
Over the dations.
Uh,

572
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:48.540
and we see therefore that the figures that are in the upper most tier of the

573
00:37:48.541 --> 00:37:53.541
main body of the form are depictions of captured a dations updation prisoners,

574
00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:59.730
uh,
brought back to Rome.
You see two of them here,
here,
a headless figure here,

575
00:37:59.731 --> 00:38:02.580
a much more complete figure.
The headless figure is still at,

576
00:38:02.581 --> 00:38:07.581
can be seen on the site and the one on the left hand side of the screen now in

577
00:38:07.591 --> 00:38:09.690
the Vatican museums in Rome,

578
00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.870
and the one on the left gives you a better sense of what these looked like in

579
00:38:12.871 --> 00:38:17.820
antiquity.
You can tell that these are not Romans wearing leggings,
a tunic,

580
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:22.050
a fringed mantle that the Romans did not wear a,

581
00:38:22.051 --> 00:38:26.270
a long fringe mantle.
And then above you see that he has a,

582
00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:30.720
unlike Trajan closely clopped Agus cropped a Gustin type hairstyle.

583
00:38:30.721 --> 00:38:35.510
You can see he has very long hair,
uh,
and also a beard.
And this,

584
00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:40.570
this identifies him as a very different in Denton for sort of,
um,
uh,
boots.

585
00:38:40.571 --> 00:38:43.240
It seemed to be made out of Suede or felt of some sorts.

586
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.740
So a very different kind of image.
Clearly,
uh,
these are again,

587
00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:52.330
the Dacian prisoners,
one after another,
uh,
aligning that second tier.

588
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:56.740
And for any of you interested in the fact that the Romans made nearly exact

589
00:38:56.741 --> 00:38:59.590
duplicates of things,
mechanical copies,
uh,

590
00:38:59.591 --> 00:39:02.890
you can see in this particular statute,
we rarely have this preserved.

591
00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:04.720
So it's an interesting example,
uh,

592
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:08.630
of these points who see these little x excess pieces of marble.
Uh,

593
00:39:08.631 --> 00:39:11.830
the Romans had created a kind of pointing machine,

594
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:16.980
which they use to make a exact replicas of originals.
Uh,

595
00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:21.160
and they usually,
when the statue was done,
they would usually obviously,
uh,

596
00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:24.580
take these away.
I mean carved them away,
which they didn't do.

597
00:39:24.581 --> 00:39:29.020
This one probably was not used for some reason it was copied and never put up on

598
00:39:29.021 --> 00:39:32.050
the building.
And so those points still remain.

599
00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.340
This is a model of the forum of Trajan,
uh,

600
00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:39.100
as it would've looked in antiquity with that convex entrance way.

601
00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:43.600
The location of the equestrian statue of the [inaudible] dry on either side.

602
00:39:43.601 --> 00:39:47.240
Here you can imagine they dations and the second tier,
uh,

603
00:39:47.241 --> 00:39:50.020
the roofed basilica,
Olivia here,

604
00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.770
the column of Trajan flagged by the Latin and Greek libraries.

605
00:39:53.771 --> 00:39:55.380
And then over here,
uh,

606
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:59.590
the temple to Divine Trajan the plan again.
Uh,

607
00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.810
and uh,
here we can hear,

608
00:40:01.811 --> 00:40:05.610
I just want to mention looking back at that plan that there was also a,

609
00:40:05.611 --> 00:40:10.611
another elaborate entrance way from the main part of the forum into the Basilica

610
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:13.540
Olivia on its long side.
And once again,

611
00:40:13.541 --> 00:40:17.920
how fortunate we are that we have a co have coins it say basilica,

612
00:40:17.921 --> 00:40:21.010
Olympia,
basilica opiate.
So we can guess,

613
00:40:21.011 --> 00:40:25.820
I think quite accurately that this must be the entrance way to the basilica

614
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.960
opiate.
Here we see something different.
We see three openings,

615
00:40:28.961 --> 00:40:32.950
not RQ weighted openings,
but Trey be aided,
opening straight lentils above.

616
00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:36.610
But look again in the way in which they're represented.

617
00:40:36.611 --> 00:40:40.840
It looks like they're quite solid and that they project into the spectators

618
00:40:40.841 --> 00:40:45.490
space.
So again,
this idea of projection,
recession,
projection,

619
00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:50.090
recession across this facade,
this is very important because as I mentioned,
uh,

620
00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.280
Roman architecture using the traditional language of Greek architecture

621
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:58.090
ultimately developed something that we call a baroque trend in Roman

622
00:40:58.091 --> 00:40:58.751
architecture.

623
00:40:58.751 --> 00:41:03.751
And you see it happening here in Rome based on the experiments of de Missions

624
00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.400
Forum trends a Tortilla.

625
00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:10.030
And you can see that same roughly that same scheme here up above,

626
00:41:10.031 --> 00:41:14.140
once again a chariot and this case a four horse chariots seemingly with one

627
00:41:14.141 --> 00:41:19.141
figure and a series of standards being hold held possibly by Roman soldiers.

628
00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:21.880
Uh,
the,
uh,

629
00:41:21.881 --> 00:41:26.710
the forum of Trajan has been the professional,
the,

630
00:41:26.711 --> 00:41:30.500
the life work of a professor,
uh,

631
00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.100
formerly of the Northwestern University James Packer,

632
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:39.640
who spent a very long time pulling together all the evidence that the forum of

633
00:41:39.651 --> 00:41:44.651
Trajan still provides to allow a very good reconstruction of what that forum

634
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:50.270
looked like.
It's computer generated.
I urge you all to look at it.
If you just,

635
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:55.300
if you just Google James Packer Forum of Trajan Ucla because that's the tower

636
00:41:56.570 --> 00:42:00.440
the Getty,
uh,
either of those two cause Ucla and the Getty supported this work,

637
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:04.400
you will be able to see computer simulations of,
uh,

638
00:42:04.401 --> 00:42:05.840
of his work.
Uh,

639
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:10.100
there's also a book by James Packer on the forum of Trajan that's on reserve for

640
00:42:10.101 --> 00:42:13.550
this course.
I send you to it less for the forum of Trajan,

641
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:16.130
but for any of you working on city plans,
again,

642
00:42:16.131 --> 00:42:19.340
this could be a very inspiring a book to look at it.

643
00:42:19.341 --> 00:42:23.780
Not that I expect you to come up with something like this.
Uh,
but nonetheless,

644
00:42:23.781 --> 00:42:26.840
I think it can give you an idea of what one can do.

645
00:42:26.841 --> 00:42:30.470
As one thinks about designing one own city.
He has,

646
00:42:30.471 --> 00:42:35.471
he has done enough research to allow a very accurate reconstruction of what this

647
00:42:35.691 --> 00:42:36.830
forum would have looked like.

648
00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:40.490
We're looking at the entrance way into the basilic Olivia here.
Uh,

649
00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:43.340
we are looking at,
uh,
the marble.

650
00:42:43.341 --> 00:42:47.270
You can see real marble and very gated marbles brought them all over the world.

651
00:42:47.271 --> 00:42:52.271
So Trajan continues the Flavian tradition of bringing marbles from all over,

652
00:42:52.371 --> 00:42:55.980
from places outside of Italy,
from Africa,
from Asia Minor,
uh,

653
00:42:56.150 --> 00:43:00.800
from Egypt and so on for the decoration of these buildings and an interest in

654
00:43:00.801 --> 00:43:05.801
multicolored marbles as facing we see also up here the Dacian prisoners and

655
00:43:06.141 --> 00:43:09.890
between them in this instance,
these shields,
uh,
with portraits on them,

656
00:43:09.891 --> 00:43:13.310
we have remains of some of those.
That's an accurate reconstruction.

657
00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.130
The same sort of thing that we saw on the entrance way.

658
00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.990
Then up there and inscription,
some,
several other dations and uh,

659
00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:23.330
some other decoration at the apex.

660
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.450
I'm going to show you just a few of these quickly from Packer's book.
Uh,

661
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:30.320
you see here a Carter with a barrel vault,

662
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:33.560
a stuccoed and painted lots of statuary.

663
00:43:33.561 --> 00:43:37.400
That would have been lots of honorific statuary,
uh,
in this structure.

664
00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:41.660
Sometimes instead of the shields with portraits between the dations,

665
00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:46.280
we see piles of captured arms and armor.
As you can see in that view.

666
00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.010
A here,
a couple more showing again,

667
00:43:49.011 --> 00:43:53.070
the marble decoration of the walls,
a very varied,

668
00:43:53.071 --> 00:43:55.000
varied in color here.
Uh,

669
00:43:55.220 --> 00:44:00.020
niches with portraits over here,
more shields with portraits.

670
00:44:00.021 --> 00:44:03.860
And here you can see some of the sculptural remains us,

671
00:44:03.861 --> 00:44:07.630
some parts of a,
of a breath,

672
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:12.460
a military figure in a breast plate,
a man,
both of them headless,
a man,
uh,

673
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:17.000
in a toga and over here,
part of one of these decorative shields with a,

674
00:44:17.001 --> 00:44:17.661
a portrait.

675
00:44:17.661 --> 00:44:21.530
We actually think this is a portrait of nerva portrait of nerve that would have

676
00:44:21.531 --> 00:44:26.531
been placed inside the shield and hung on the upper part of the wall above the

677
00:44:27.711 --> 00:44:31.710
columns.
And this,
this is a important and on your list,

678
00:44:31.711 --> 00:44:36.711
this is a view of the Basilica Olympia in Rome.

679
00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:39.150
What it would have looked like in antiquity.

680
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:43.830
You can see it conforms to Basilican architecture that we've looked at before

681
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:46.290
with a central nave,

682
00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:51.510
a divided by two by it's two side aisles in this case,
as you'll recall in plan.

683
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.090
Uh,
and uh,

684
00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:58.620
those are Corinthian capitals as you can see down here.

685
00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.370
Uh,
you can see also that it's a,
it's a Gargantuan structure.

686
00:45:02.371 --> 00:45:03.820
Look at the size of the,

687
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:08.220
of the people in the men in their togas and the building itself.

688
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:10.980
And it had a flat roof with a coffered ceiling.

689
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.280
And you can see that it had a clear story.

690
00:45:14.281 --> 00:45:19.020
We've talked about the clear story before we saw it in the house of the Mosaic

691
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:23.160
Atrium,
for example,
the clear story,
which is the opening up of the wall,
uh,

692
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.150
in this case,

693
00:45:24.151 --> 00:45:29.151
through a ionic columns to see the vistas that lie beyond and to let light into

694
00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:31.044
the structure.

695
00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:34.800
And you can see the vista that lies beyond is the column of Trajan and one of

696
00:45:34.801 --> 00:45:37.930
the libraries.
This is a,
uh,

697
00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:43.010
a photograph that I'm incredibly proud of because I took it from on top of the

698
00:45:44.881 --> 00:45:46.620
column of Trajan.
Uh,

699
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:50.030
it's not that difficult to climb the column of Trajan cause there's a spiral

700
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.860
staircase in the center of it that goes up to the top.
The part,

701
00:45:52.861 --> 00:45:55.590
the part that's hard is getting permission to get in there.

702
00:45:55.591 --> 00:45:58.920
It's always locked and you have to get special permission to do that.

703
00:45:58.921 --> 00:46:01.740
So I did it only once,
but it was a great thing to do.

704
00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.590
And you go way up to the top and you can look down,

705
00:46:04.591 --> 00:46:06.850
you can see fantastic views of Rome,
uh,

706
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:10.620
but you can also get a very good sense of what the basilica opiate looks like

707
00:46:10.621 --> 00:46:14.820
today.
Uh,
and not much.
Uh,
but you can see the central space.

708
00:46:14.821 --> 00:46:16.140
You can see some of the columns.

709
00:46:16.141 --> 00:46:19.200
We can tell that those columns were gray granite.
So again,

710
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:21.300
this interest in contrasting marbles,

711
00:46:21.301 --> 00:46:25.350
Greg rounded with white marble in the basilica opiate and elsewhere.

712
00:46:25.351 --> 00:46:28.590
And you can also see the relationship between modern ground level,

713
00:46:28.591 --> 00:46:32.760
which is much higher and ancient ground level and the possibilities that still

714
00:46:32.761 --> 00:46:36.420
remain if they want to excavate this part of the city.

715
00:46:36.421 --> 00:46:39.720
What more of the forum of Trajan may be able to be seen.

716
00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:42.870
Some of it can actually be seen under the street and packer and others have

717
00:46:42.871 --> 00:46:45.450
actually gone in to look at what is there,

718
00:46:45.451 --> 00:46:49.740
which is what has enabled him to make the kind of accurate reconstructions that

719
00:46:49.741 --> 00:46:54.300
he has everywhere in this monument.
There are references,
yes,
this is a forum.
Yes,

720
00:46:54.301 --> 00:46:59.130
forums have practical purposes,
their place to,
uh,
to,
um,

721
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:01.790
for people to meet and to market and to,
uh,

722
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:05.310
conduct law cases and so on in the basilica.

723
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:09.850
But this monument reminds you again and again and again and again that it is a,

724
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.450
uh,

725
00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:15.450
a monument in stone to Trajan victories over the dations.

726
00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:18.510
And not only do we see those stations as we looked at before,

727
00:47:18.511 --> 00:47:21.870
but we see lots of other imagery that refers to military victory.

728
00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:27.110
This is a fragment of what we think was a freeze in the Basilica Olympia that

729
00:47:27.481 --> 00:47:31.980
depicts victories,
female personifications of victory wing.
It,
uh,

730
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:37.150
either kneeling at candelabra or overhear this woman kneeling on the back of a

731
00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:38.480
bull.
Uh,

732
00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:41.980
you can see that she's whinging and she's holding the snout of that bull back.

733
00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:46.840
She's got a knife in her right hand and she is about to slit the throat of the

734
00:47:46.841 --> 00:47:47.770
bull.
Uh,

735
00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:52.360
and she is doing this to not only to not only his victory over the dations being

736
00:47:52.361 --> 00:47:53.370
marked here,
uh,

737
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:58.440
but she is also representing the sacrifice that takes place in honor of that

738
00:47:58.691 --> 00:48:01.690
victory,
uh,
by uh,
being shown,
uh,

739
00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:06.730
depicting a killing a bull back to the plan.
Once again,

740
00:48:06.731 --> 00:48:10.690
just to remind you that when we leave the Basilica Olympia doorway,

741
00:48:10.691 --> 00:48:15.520
also in its long side,
we end up in this small plaza where the temple,

742
00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.620
where the column of Trajan is located,

743
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:22.800
flanked by Greek and Latin libraries on axis with the equestrian statue on axis

744
00:48:23.301 --> 00:48:26.470
with the entrance way,
the equestrian statue of Trajan,

745
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:28.660
the other entrance way the column,

746
00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:32.290
and ultimately the temple at the very end,

747
00:48:32.291 --> 00:48:34.960
the temple ultimately to divine Trajan.

748
00:48:34.961 --> 00:48:37.990
This a model of what we think the library may have looked like,

749
00:48:37.991 --> 00:48:40.840
or both of the library's may have looked like from the outside,

750
00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:45.340
fairly smallish a square buildings with a portico in the front.

751
00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.790
And then most important,
uh,
a balcony over here.

752
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:52.930
Why a balcony so that you could come out and look at the column of Trajan and

753
00:48:52.931 --> 00:48:57.670
read some of the scenes that in circled it.
This is a reconstruction from packer,

754
00:48:57.671 --> 00:48:58.310
again,

755
00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:02.620
showing what he thinks the interior of one of these libraries might've looked

756
00:49:02.621 --> 00:49:05.170
like.
It looks larger here than it actually was a,

757
00:49:05.171 --> 00:49:07.570
but you can get a sense of it with the reading tables,

758
00:49:07.571 --> 00:49:11.980
with the scrolls inside these cabinets here.
Uh,

759
00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:16.960
with the statuary and in this case he believes that it had a vaulted roof.

760
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:21.010
As you can see,
a top,
the column of Trajan,

761
00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:25.930
you see it here in two views,
uh,
an extraordinary work of art,

762
00:49:25.931 --> 00:49:28.720
extremely WellPreserved.
Why so well preserved?

763
00:49:28.721 --> 00:49:33.040
Well likely because pope sixth is the fifth and the renaissance,
uh,

764
00:49:33.041 --> 00:49:37.900
use this column and also the column of the later Emperor Marcus Aurelius as

765
00:49:37.901 --> 00:49:42.901
important nodes in his reconstruction of the city of Rome at what he did.

766
00:49:43.031 --> 00:49:47.300
However,
at that time was that he took the statues of Trajan,
uh,

767
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.460
that would have stood on this one.

768
00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:52.690
And Marcus are really is on the other and replaced them with statues of Peter

769
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:53.553
and Paul.

770
00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:58.330
And it's Peter who's on the column of Trajan and Paul who was on the column of

771
00:49:58.331 --> 00:50:01.840
Marcus Aurelius.
But you can see how well preserved they are here.

772
00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:06.700
The column shaft rests on a base decorated with arms and armor dation arms and

773
00:50:06.701 --> 00:50:11.110
armor with ultimate,
you know,
with a statue of Trajan up at the,
uh,

774
00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:13.480
bronze statue of Trajan at the upper most part.

775
00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.540
But what's particularly interesting is the sculpture.

776
00:50:16.541 --> 00:50:18.130
I'm not going to go into that in great detail,

777
00:50:18.131 --> 00:50:21.580
but I want you to know about it because it does tell us something about

778
00:50:21.581 --> 00:50:26.350
architecture as we'll see.
It's a spiral freeze done all in marble of course,

779
00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:31.520
that from the base of the column all the way up to the top and it tells in

780
00:50:31.521 --> 00:50:34.460
documentary form,
uh,
the exploits,

781
00:50:34.461 --> 00:50:39.461
the military exploits of Trajan in his two day [inaudible] military campaigns.

782
00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:40.550
Uh,
his,

783
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:44.510
he's those two campaigns that I've already mentioned divided in the center by a

784
00:50:44.511 --> 00:50:47.690
victory writing on a shield,
a one,

785
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:51.110
there's been a lot of speculation.
There's nothing like this earlier,

786
00:50:51.111 --> 00:50:53.540
enrollment art quite like this.
Uh,

787
00:50:53.541 --> 00:50:58.100
and so it is a new innovation probably at the behest of Po pop,

788
00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:01.150
possibly out of the mind,
the creative mind of Apollo,

789
00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:03.140
Doris of Damascus and sculpt.

790
00:51:03.141 --> 00:51:06.170
Some scholars have suggested and I think very convincingly,

791
00:51:06.171 --> 00:51:10.910
it's an intriguing idea that because this was located between two libraries,

792
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:13.970
the likelihood and that the Romans had scrolls,

793
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:18.610
the likelihood is what we are dealing here with here is one of these scrolls or

794
00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:23.620
sort of wrapped around the column from base to top a unfurled and wrapped around

795
00:51:24.261 --> 00:51:29.261
the column from base to top with the text removed with images instead of text.

796
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.390
Uh,
and that,
that makes a lot of sense.
Again,

797
00:51:32.391 --> 00:51:37.391
given that you could view it most best from the two libraries on either side,

798
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:39.350
a detail of the base,

799
00:51:39.351 --> 00:51:43.730
just to show you how very well preserved the sculptural decoration is.

800
00:51:43.731 --> 00:51:46.880
This is not a course in sculpture.
I'm not going to go into this in detail,

801
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:49.820
but I want to quickly show you some of the scenes because again,

802
00:51:49.821 --> 00:51:52.340
they can be revealing from the point of view of architecture.

803
00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:57.460
This is at the very base.
We see a personification of the Danube River,
uh,

804
00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:02.470
in that area up north in Daisha where the Romans went to conquer those tribes.

805
00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:04.550
Uh,
and you,

806
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:09.320
and this is very important because we know that Apollo doors of Damascus was

807
00:52:09.321 --> 00:52:13.970
responsible for building a bridge over the Daniel Bridge River.

808
00:52:13.971 --> 00:52:18.890
It was one of his great engineering feats.
And you actually see that bridge,
uh,

809
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:19.910
located here,

810
00:52:19.911 --> 00:52:24.290
which even increases the likelihood that Apollo doors of Damascus was the

811
00:52:24.291 --> 00:52:27.470
designer of this particular structure.
You see,

812
00:52:27.471 --> 00:52:31.710
the Roman soldiers have gotten off boats.
They're walking through a,
a,
a,

813
00:52:31.711 --> 00:52:34.340
an archway.
Here you see the Roman soldiers,

814
00:52:34.341 --> 00:52:38.360
the Roman soldiers did not only do battle,
uh,
but they also,
uh,

815
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:41.690
romanized the areas that they want.
We've talked about this a lot.

816
00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:44.270
The colonization of the Roman world.

817
00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:48.620
Trajan extending the borders to their furthest,
most points.
The Romans get there.

818
00:52:48.621 --> 00:52:50.990
What do they do?
They start to build architecture.

819
00:52:50.991 --> 00:52:54.020
They start to build walls with Heteros and stretchers.

820
00:52:54.021 --> 00:52:56.990
They start to build a forts,
uh,
and,

821
00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:01.700
and city walls and which they put buildings with Roman amenities.
Remember,

822
00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.890
after wars,
after the war is over,

823
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:08.780
they're often given land by the general or the emperor,
uh,
to,

824
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:13.820
to the becomes theirs and where they can live from that point on.

825
00:53:13.821 --> 00:53:18.290
So they had every reason to want to,
uh,
fill these towns with Roman amenities.

826
00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:23.000
And we see the Roman soldiers building cities in many of these scenes.

827
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:27.120
This is the most famous scene from the column in which we see a battle between

828
00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:30.420
the Romans inside one of these sports that they've built a,

829
00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:34.710
they are all with helmets and shields.
They have their hands around something.

830
00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:39.150
We think these were probably spears that were added in metal originally.

831
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:40.890
The dations down below.

832
00:53:40.891 --> 00:53:45.780
You can identify them by their leggings and tunics and scraggly hair and beards

833
00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:48.840
here.
Uh,
they are attacking the camp.

834
00:53:48.841 --> 00:53:50.820
The Romans are of course going to be victorious,

835
00:53:50.821 --> 00:53:54.510
but the nations are shown as heroic and Valliant and,

836
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:59.160
and enemies who are pretty much the equals of the Roman and Romans and strength,

837
00:53:59.161 --> 00:54:03.210
which only underscores that the Romans were stronger still to have conquered

838
00:54:03.211 --> 00:54:04.920
them.
Uh,
and then over here,

839
00:54:04.921 --> 00:54:07.800
if you've ever wondered where the term battering Ram came from,

840
00:54:07.801 --> 00:54:11.310
you can see it right here.
Told you the Romans invented everything.
Uh,

841
00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:15.750
you can see it right here.
This pole with a Ram said at the end,

842
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:20.790
which is a serving again as a battering ram as they try to tear down the walls

843
00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:22.680
of the Roman fort.
Uh,

844
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:26.580
prob perhaps the most poignant and interesting scene happens way up at the top

845
00:54:26.581 --> 00:54:31.581
of the column where the leader of the nation's dissemble as e e B a l u s is

846
00:54:32.911 --> 00:54:37.590
shown kneeling,
almost like one of those victories on the,
uh,
on the bowl.

847
00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:41.970
Uh,
he has a,
uh,
a knife in his hand.
What is he doing?

848
00:54:41.971 --> 00:54:44.970
He is kneeling here.
He has decided,
you can see the Romans.

849
00:54:44.971 --> 00:54:47.730
He's got Romans to the left of him,
Romans to the right of him.

850
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:51.990
He's about to be taken prisoner by them and paraded in a triumphal procession

851
00:54:51.991 --> 00:54:56.490
and Rome,
uh,
in honor of Trajan.
He doesn't want to do that.
So he heroically,

852
00:54:56.491 --> 00:55:01.460
valiantly takes his own life.
He is about to plunge that knife into his heart,
uh,

853
00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.750
so that he doesn't have to be taken by the Romans.

854
00:55:03.751 --> 00:55:05.850
It's very interesting to see them,
uh,

855
00:55:05.851 --> 00:55:09.690
depicting the Romans depicting the dations in such a,

856
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:13.200
in such a heroic way.
On this column,

857
00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:18.330
I mentioned the museum in Rome that is located in ar,

858
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:21.680
the Museo della achievable.
Tell Romana the Museum of,
uh,

859
00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:24.930
of Roman civilization that has casts and models.

860
00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:28.740
I mentioned that they had casts of all the scenes from the column of Trajan.

861
00:55:28.741 --> 00:55:33.510
I show you a view that I took in that museum just to give you a sense of how one

862
00:55:33.511 --> 00:55:37.020
can see those and how one can see those at eye's level.
Uh,

863
00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:40.680
to get a good sense of them.
In antiquity,
they would have been harder to read,

864
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:45.630
but I should point out that the background was likely painted blue and there

865
00:55:45.631 --> 00:55:49.230
probably would have been some additions like the metal spears that might have

866
00:55:49.231 --> 00:55:54.220
made it easier to read.
Almost like Wedgewood might've made it easier to read,
uh,

867
00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:58.290
in antiquity.
And I also thought I would mention,

868
00:55:58.291 --> 00:56:00.570
I'm sure all of you have been down to ground zero,

869
00:56:00.571 --> 00:56:03.900
but if you go a block or two away from ground zero itself,

870
00:56:03.901 --> 00:56:08.250
there's a fireman's memorial there that was put up to many of the fireman who

871
00:56:08.251 --> 00:56:12.910
sadly lost their lives fighting those fires in the twin towers.
Uh,

872
00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:17.910
we see this here dedicated to those who fell into those who carry on a here.

873
00:56:17.911 --> 00:56:20.000
And what's interesting about this,
if you look at,

874
00:56:20.001 --> 00:56:23.530
if you Google this and look at the website for the fireman's memorial in Rome,

875
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.110
in,
in,
uh,
New York,
uh,

876
00:56:26.111 --> 00:56:31.111
you will find out that the designer for this talks unabashedly of his admiration

877
00:56:32.531 --> 00:56:34.210
for the column of Trajan in Rome,

878
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:39.250
and that he used as an artistic model of for the way in which he masked figures

879
00:56:39.251 --> 00:56:43.990
here,
showing them in relationship to buildings he used as his model.
Uh,

880
00:56:43.991 --> 00:56:48.940
the figures on the column of Trajan in Rome at the end.
Again,

881
00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:52.570
the column,
uh,
surrounded by the Greek and Latin libraries.

882
00:56:52.571 --> 00:56:56.860
The temple over here at the end,
you can see it's a conventional Roman temple,

883
00:56:56.861 --> 00:57:01.480
deep porch,
freestanding columns,
uh,
uh,
staircase,

884
00:57:01.481 --> 00:57:06.190
one staircase facade orientation.
Just as we saw,
uh,
elsewhere,
uh,

885
00:57:06.191 --> 00:57:09.050
here we see an engraving showing the,
uh,

886
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:13.210
the spiral staircase that leads from bottom to top and overhear that the

887
00:57:13.211 --> 00:57:16.340
staircase also goes down below,
uh,

888
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:20.740
into a burial chamber.
Two urns were found in that burial chamber,

889
00:57:20.741 --> 00:57:24.130
the urns of Trajan and Platina,
which tells us of course,

890
00:57:24.131 --> 00:57:28.600
that this also served as Trojans tonight.
So victory not only his grit,

891
00:57:28.601 --> 00:57:32.950
one of his great victories,
military victories,
but also victory over death.

892
00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:37.960
And then at the apex we see a good view of the top with a statue of Saint Peter,

893
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:42.130
but we have coins,
uh,
depicting a Trajan,
uh,
on,
uh,

894
00:57:42.570 --> 00:57:47.080
but depicting the original statue,
the base,
the Shaft Co,

895
00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:49.570
a portrait of Trajan,
uh,

896
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:54.870
naked portrait of Trajan [inaudible] portrait of Trajan depicted after death.

897
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:59.860
Divinized at the apex of the column.
And if you read the inscription on the coin,

898
00:57:59.861 --> 00:58:03.150
you see it refers to Trajan as Optimas,
pring caps,

899
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:07.140
phage and received many titles.
One was docie costs DAC,
ICU,

900
00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:10.300
s for his victories over the nations,
but at the end of his life,

901
00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:13.960
optimists print gaps,
the greatest prank ups of all time,

902
00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:17.410
the implication greater than Augustus.
And it is arguable,

903
00:58:17.411 --> 00:58:21.760
I think probably correct that Trajan was the even greater of the two.

904
00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:25.450
This is a restored view.
It is spectacular,

905
00:58:25.451 --> 00:58:30.451
restored view of the building complex where you can see again the entrance way

906
00:58:31.391 --> 00:58:35.260
over here,
the equestrian statue,
everything that we've described.

907
00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:38.950
But I think it's interesting if you think of yourself having entered into this

908
00:58:38.951 --> 00:58:43.720
forum,
standing here,
looking back at the basilica,
bearing trades,
his name,

909
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:46.600
looking toward the column and the temple.

910
00:58:46.601 --> 00:58:51.250
What you would have likely seen when you stood here was only the upper most part

911
00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:54.760
of the column because most of it would have been blocked by the very tall

912
00:58:54.761 --> 00:58:55.780
Basilica Olympia.

913
00:58:55.960 --> 00:59:00.930
So it's a very theatrical representation in the sense that you would be,
uh,

914
00:59:00.931 --> 00:59:03.610
you know,
standing here with Trajan during life.

915
00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:08.070
Looking back toward that column,
looking back at the divinization of,

916
00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:10.060
of Trajan bronze statue,

917
00:59:10.061 --> 00:59:13.840
which would have seemed as if it was floating on top of the basilic old.

918
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:17.760
And this is a very dramatic Tablo,
uh,
created here by Apollo,

919
00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:18.910
Doris of Damascus.

920
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:24.150
And I think it was not equal equal until the 17th century by architects like

921
00:59:24.501 --> 00:59:29.090
John Lorenzo Bernini who also created such spectacular Tableau's.

922
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:31.430
A,
just to show you again,

923
00:59:31.431 --> 00:59:36.380
the location of the markets of Trajan in relationship to the forum of Trajan.

924
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:37.461
While the mark,

925
00:59:37.461 --> 00:59:42.200
while the forum was the Romans imposing a rectangular plan on nature,

926
00:59:42.201 --> 00:59:45.380
remember they have to cut back the hill to make way for it.

927
00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:47.690
The markets are something quite different.

928
00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:52.220
They are the Romans accepting the shape of the remaining queer and mill hill and

929
00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:55.340
allowing the shape of that hill to determine,
uh,

930
00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:59.790
the irregular shape of the markets,
the markets,
uh,
unlike the,

931
01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:04.340
the,
the,
a forum that is made out of marble for the most part,

932
01:00:04.341 --> 01:00:06.230
as we've seen very gated marble.

933
01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:11.450
The markets are made out of concrete,
faced with brick,

934
01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:12.920
a very different material,

935
01:00:12.921 --> 01:00:17.720
but a material that is absolutely appropriate when you want to cover a hillside

936
01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:21.950
with tiered buildings.
Looking back very much to the spot by a,

937
01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:26.600
looking back to the Fortuna premed Jania at Palestrina,
the same idea to change,

938
01:00:26.601 --> 01:00:28.040
to turn this hill,

939
01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:32.690
what remained of the queer and hill into essentially the precursor of the modern

940
01:00:32.691 --> 01:00:36.560
shopping mall.
You have shopping.
There are 150 shops,
uh,

941
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:39.410
in the markets of Trajan.
Uh,
the,
all of these things,

942
01:00:39.411 --> 01:00:42.890
date by the way to the same period around Aidy one 13,

943
01:00:42.891 --> 01:00:46.050
the forum and also the markets.
Uh,

944
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:50.030
we see 150 shops here on a variety of levels.

945
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:53.880
This is the bottom level that is located where the [inaudible] are.

946
01:00:53.881 --> 01:00:58.830
The first Exedra is on the right side,
a great hemi cycle with shops.
Uh,

947
01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:03.500
here,
a street called the via Bieber Radhika.
That name is on your monument list.

948
01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.820
And then a covered bazaar,
a up here,
all of this on different levels.

949
01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:12.610
All of this done in a very innovative way with concrete faced with brick.
Uh,

950
01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:16.670
you can also see here the very large windows is semi dome that I'll show you in

951
01:01:16.671 --> 01:01:17.690
detail in a moment.

952
01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.280
These large windows indicate to us that the architects are real masters of the

953
01:01:22.281 --> 01:01:26.840
concrete medium here,
able to dematerialize,
uh,
the,
uh,

954
01:01:26.841 --> 01:01:30.560
wall by,
uh,
putting up these very,
very large one does.

955
01:01:30.561 --> 01:01:34.830
That's how good they were in building this.
At this point.
The,
the,

956
01:01:34.831 --> 01:01:37.400
the building block here is essentially the to bear,
not,

957
01:01:37.401 --> 01:01:40.230
not unlike what we saw in Pompei,
uh,

958
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:44.240
this small a space with a barrel vault and attic window above.

959
01:01:44.241 --> 01:01:47.570
And in this case with,
uh,
a post and lintel,

960
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:52.340
a scheme made out of travertine to mark the entrance way into the shop.

961
01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:54.710
They took this individual,
um,

962
01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:59.740
motif and they replicated it throughout this building over and over and over

963
01:02:00.171 --> 01:02:03.200
again,
offering 150 possibilities.

964
01:02:03.201 --> 01:02:07.310
Here you see a series of these in a row series of these to bear and I with their

965
01:02:07.311 --> 01:02:11.630
attic.
When does with their travertine decoration with their sidewalks,

966
01:02:11.631 --> 01:02:14.840
a kind of mini city within a city.
And then over here,

967
01:02:14.841 --> 01:02:19.841
the polygonal masonry of the streets looking very much like streets in Rome.

968
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.240
Here is a view of the great hemi cycle down on the first story,

969
01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:28.350
see the shops again.
What's interesting here is in the second story,

970
01:02:28.351 --> 01:02:30.840
you see RQ weighted elements.
You can see the con,

971
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:33.660
the facing with the brick facing.

972
01:02:33.661 --> 01:02:36.970
Although we do believe this was stuccoed over in this case here,

973
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:38.910
pilasters but look very carefully.

974
01:02:38.911 --> 01:02:43.911
You will see these pilasters support in the center and RQ weighted pediment and

975
01:02:43.981 --> 01:02:44.910
then on either side,

976
01:02:44.911 --> 01:02:49.440
these broken triangular pediments as if the pediment has broken,

977
01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:53.520
been broken to allow the uh,
the Rq weighted pediment to show through.

978
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.610
We have never seen that before.
Yes,
we saw it in the paper topics,

979
01:02:56.611 --> 01:02:57.660
but that's stuff is later.

980
01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:02.430
We have not seen that up to this point chronologically in built architecture.

981
01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:06.720
We have seen it in painting curriculum at the met over here for example,

982
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:11.130
this breaking the triangular pediment to allow something else to show through.

983
01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:15.300
This is the beginning of this experimentation that ultimately leads to this

984
01:03:15.301 --> 01:03:19.380
baroque element in Roman architecture that I'm going to talk about behind the

985
01:03:19.381 --> 01:03:24.381
semi a semi heavy cycle annular bolt with an additional set of shops and attic

986
01:03:25.741 --> 01:03:30.180
windows,
uh,
there as well.
This is the most famous street,

987
01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:34.140
uh,
from the forum,
from the markets of Trajan stuff.

988
01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:36.300
Incredible place to wander by the way.

989
01:03:36.301 --> 01:03:39.000
And they have just recently in the last couple of years,

990
01:03:39.001 --> 01:03:41.370
opened an entirely new museum here,

991
01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:46.260
which has a lot of remains from the forum and from the markets.

992
01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:50.190
And a great deal of very useful information and absolute must see for anyone

993
01:03:50.191 --> 01:03:51.150
going to Rome,

994
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:56.220
this is the famous via be burrata Berakah of the markets of Trajan where again,

995
01:03:56.221 --> 01:03:59.310
you get the sense once you're in here that you're in a kind of city within a

996
01:03:59.311 --> 01:04:02.250
city.
Uh,
but with all these wonderful shops,
uh,

997
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:07.430
you can see how skilled they are in using ramps with polygonal masonry as well

998
01:04:07.471 --> 01:04:12.450
as sidewalks and stairs so that you can make your way up with either

999
01:04:12.451 --> 01:04:16.230
alternatives here again that to bear I on either side,

1000
01:04:16.231 --> 01:04:21.231
the opening up of the walls with these incredible windows throughout a restored

1001
01:04:23.161 --> 01:04:27.550
view of what the whole thing looked like in antiquity,
the Hemi Cycle,
uh,

1002
01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.830
that the,
the uh,

1003
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:33.330
the decoration here of the central RQ weighted pediment broken triangular

1004
01:04:33.331 --> 01:04:34.530
pediments over here,

1005
01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:37.380
a very interesting space that I'm going to show you in a second.

1006
01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:42.030
Bolted with a semi dome done out of concrete with very large windows opening up

1007
01:04:42.031 --> 01:04:45.120
the space via Bieber Radhika that we already saw here.

1008
01:04:45.121 --> 01:04:47.670
And then the covered bazaar up there.

1009
01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:53.490
Quick view of the semi dome made out of concrete.
It doesn't have an Oculus,

1010
01:04:53.491 --> 01:04:55.760
but otherwise it looks kind of like the,
uh,

1011
01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:58.950
the dome of the Temple of Mercury at Baia.

1012
01:04:58.951 --> 01:05:03.510
As you can see and overhear this wall that I've already described that shows you

1013
01:05:03.511 --> 01:05:06.480
how well the Romans can work concrete now,

1014
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:09.780
enabling them to open up the wall,
uh,

1015
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:13.920
much more than they've been able to do so before and allow even more light into

1016
01:05:13.921 --> 01:05:14.754
the structure.

1017
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:20.150
The greatest part perhaps of the markets of Trajan is this a building here?

1018
01:05:20.321 --> 01:05:25.321
It's the covered bazaar and it really is a market bizarre on two tiers.

1019
01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.670
You can see in this restored view,

1020
01:05:27.671 --> 01:05:31.540
the series of to bear and I down below the attic up above,

1021
01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:35.890
you can see the groin vaults are used here in an incredible way.

1022
01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:40.060
I'll show you in a moment how a second story appear with additional to bear

1023
01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.730
night opened almost completely to the sky.

1024
01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:47.620
An incredible feat on the part of Apollo doors of Damascus,

1025
01:05:47.621 --> 01:05:50.560
assuming he also designed these markets.

1026
01:05:50.561 --> 01:05:54.740
Here is the market hall as it looks today.
What is his ancestor,
uh,

1027
01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:59.500
the Ferintino market hall that we saw way back when with its single barrel bolt

1028
01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:03.340
or some of the Crypto Porticos is that we also saw with their barrel vaults.

1029
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.950
It's that idea,
that market hall idea,

1030
01:06:05.951 --> 01:06:10.951
but look how sophisticated the Romans had become in their use of concrete.

1031
01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:11.890
Faced with brick,

1032
01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:15.910
they have realized that they don't even need a wall to support bolts.

1033
01:06:15.911 --> 01:06:20.911
They can lift their vault on top of individual peers as they have done so

1034
01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:24.700
spectacularly here.
Lift them up.
I described this,

1035
01:06:24.701 --> 01:06:28.660
I think in the introductory level lecture is in a sense opening up a series of

1036
01:06:28.661 --> 01:06:31.930
umbrellas over the space.
They have opened it up,
uh,

1037
01:06:31.931 --> 01:06:36.320
so that light can flow in from the sides.
Like can flow in from uh,

1038
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:41.320
from either long end,
uh,
just flooding the whole system with light down below.

1039
01:06:41.321 --> 01:06:45.460
Again,
the typical markets with their,
with their,
uh,
attic windows above.

1040
01:06:45.461 --> 01:06:48.820
But this is a real tour de force,
probably the greatest,

1041
01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.780
certainly the greatest bolting,
uh,
that we have seen thus far.
And again,

1042
01:06:52.781 --> 01:06:57.781
a test to just how far the Romans have come from this to this by the time of the

1043
01:06:59.201 --> 01:07:03.130
Emperor Trajan and any of you headed to San Francisco.
Uh,

1044
01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:07.360
if you go to the,
um,
to the marketplace there,

1045
01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:12.860
you will see that that owes so much to Roman antiquity with all the tobacco and

1046
01:07:13.031 --> 01:07:16.270
I like structures on either side,
the vaulting,
I mean,

1047
01:07:16.271 --> 01:07:19.140
it's this sort of thing absolutely presupposes a,

1048
01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:23.770
this kind of architectural development in the one minute that remains.

1049
01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:25.360
And that's all I need for this.

1050
01:07:25.361 --> 01:07:29.260
I just wanted to show you one last monument and make one basic point about it

1051
01:07:29.261 --> 01:07:33.670
that really has more to do with the transition from Trajan Hadrian than anything

1052
01:07:33.671 --> 01:07:38.550
else.
Uh,
and arch went up in,
not in Rome but in a place called Ben Aventa,

1053
01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:43.310
which is about an hours drive from,
uh,
from Naples,
uh,

1054
01:07:43.311 --> 01:07:46.890
in the south of Italy and Campania place called Ben event,

1055
01:07:46.891 --> 01:07:51.891
or an arch went up between one 14 to one 18 honoring Trajan and all of Trajan is

1056
01:07:52.061 --> 01:07:54.460
accomplishments.
You can see it's covered with sculpture.

1057
01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:59.020
And each of those scenes represents one of the accomplishments of Trajan.

1058
01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:03.670
It was put up on the so called via try Ana taking Trojans name,
uh,

1059
01:08:03.671 --> 01:08:07.040
a road that was built from Rome to Ben Event,
uh,

1060
01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:12.130
and was opened during trade,
gins,
rain,
and again,

1061
01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:13.990
a compendium of all his accomplishments.

1062
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:18.020
You can see very clearly that is based in general form on the arch of Titus in

1063
01:08:18.021 --> 01:08:20.750
Rome,
the single central RQ weighted bay.

1064
01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:24.470
The pedestals are supporting double columns on either side.

1065
01:08:24.471 --> 01:08:27.050
The inscription at the top,
the receding,

1066
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:30.860
a receding panels on either side of that inscription.

1067
01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.260
The major difference of course between the two,

1068
01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:38.330
that this has sculpture only on the inside and sparingly in the center and

1069
01:08:38.331 --> 01:08:41.840
around the frieze.
And this has much more sculpture,
again,

1070
01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.180
telling us in much greater detail,
a,

1071
01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:48.980
a list or describing a list of the great accomplishments of Trajan.

1072
01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:53.670
The main reason that I show it to you today besides to show that the,
the,
the,

1073
01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:58.220
that the Flavi is again served Flavian architecture served as an important
model,

1074
01:08:58.540 --> 01:08:59.630
uh,
for,
uh,

1075
01:08:59.690 --> 01:09:04.070
Trey Janick architecture is that a couple of the scenes in the,
uh,

1076
01:09:04.071 --> 01:09:06.170
in the attic above are very interesting.

1077
01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:09.740
And tell us something about the succession.
Hey Trey.
Hey,

1078
01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:13.460
Hadrian does not appear in the lower part of the arch in any of the scenes,

1079
01:09:13.461 --> 01:09:16.220
but he appears in two of the scenes and the upper most part,

1080
01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.570
which is lead scholars.

1081
01:09:17.571 --> 01:09:21.710
I think rightly to conclude that the arch was finished up to the,

1082
01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:25.520
to the attic before Trayvon's death and that Hadrian finished it.

1083
01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:29.540
And what did he do?
He put his own portrait up there with Trajan.

1084
01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.790
Why was he motivated to do that?
Well,

1085
01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:35.960
he had many ego as we'll see when we talk about Hadrian's architecture.

1086
01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:38.930
But more than that,
it had something to do with the succession.

1087
01:09:38.931 --> 01:09:43.931
We know that Trajan died on August 8th in 117 and we know that on August 8th,

1088
01:09:46.791 --> 01:09:49.880
he had no successor officially chosen.

1089
01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:53.400
Platina his wife was cray.
She had no children of around,

1090
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:58.190
which is crazy about Hadrian very much his sponsor and wanted to see him
succeed.

1091
01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:02.030
Trajan it's likely the Trajan had the same idea in mind,

1092
01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:06.230
but it's a little strange because wouldn't he then have adopted him before his

1093
01:10:06.231 --> 01:10:10.650
death?
Why would he have waited?
Uh,
but Platina decide.
She consults with advisor.

1094
01:10:10.651 --> 01:10:12.620
She said,
we're not going to announce Trojans death.

1095
01:10:12.621 --> 01:10:14.740
We're going to keep it a secret.
Uh,

1096
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:18.920
tomorrow we're going to announce the Trajan has adopted Hadrian that happens on

1097
01:10:18.921 --> 01:10:22.430
August 9th.
Uh,
and then it was only on the 11th,

1098
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:27.490
that 11th of August that Trajan death was announced to the public.

1099
01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:31.280
So some Hanky panky was going on behind the scenes,

1100
01:10:31.281 --> 01:10:35.720
but whoever made the choice,
whether it was traded himself or Platina,
uh,
he,

1101
01:10:35.721 --> 01:10:38.150
they made a great choice.
Hadrian and extraordinary,

1102
01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:41.810
extraordinary emperor as well.
And the point that I,

1103
01:10:41.811 --> 01:10:45.410
the one point that I want you to hold and keep with you over break and bring

1104
01:10:45.411 --> 01:10:48.500
back,
uh,
when we,
when we get back together and talk,

1105
01:10:48.501 --> 01:10:52.310
when we get back together about the Pantheon and Hadrian's villa actively,

1106
01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:55.730
the main point that I want you to keep in mind is what we learned from the forum

1107
01:10:55.731 --> 01:10:56.564
of Trajan.

1108
01:10:56.690 --> 01:11:01.010
And that is that Trajan combined in an incredible way with the help of a Paula

1109
01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:06.010
Doris traditional architecture in the form of the forum with it's marble marble

1110
01:11:07.461 --> 01:11:11.840
columns and the like an innovative Roman architecture in the form of the brick,

1111
01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:12.561
the brick face,

1112
01:11:12.561 --> 01:11:17.561
concrete market brought those together in one building in a way that is very

1113
01:11:18.271 --> 01:11:20.490
different from anything we've seen up to this point.

1114
01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:24.210
And we're going to see that Hadrian keeps that tradition alive,

1115
01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:28.170
not only in the Pantheon but also in his villa of Tivoli.

1116
01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:32.280
Take care.
Good,
good spring break to everybody.
