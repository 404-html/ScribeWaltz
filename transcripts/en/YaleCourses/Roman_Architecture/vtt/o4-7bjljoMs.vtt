1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.730
Good morning everyone and welcome back after what I hope was a great spring

2
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:06.564
break.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.730
This lecture that I'm going to deliver this morning has been an inspiration to

4
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:15.480
students who have selected option three for their paper topic.

5
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:19.860
How to design a Roman city because this lecture has it all.

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.360
It has great architecture.
It has an extraordinary patron,

7
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.780
a a man who traveled the empire to all kinds of exotic places that will,

8
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.060
some of which we'll be talking about today and some of which we'll be talking

9
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:36.480
about in the future.
A love triangle.
Uh,

10
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.290
some of the best buildings that we'll see in the course of some of the semester,

11
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:45.120
including the Pantheon and also Hadrian's villa at Tivoli,

12
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.850
the patron Hadrian.
Who am I show you in a portrait from Rome.

13
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.560
Now on the lefthand side of the screen,
uh,

14
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.860
it was an extraordinary man.
Uh,
he became,

15
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.690
he was born in 76,

16
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.710
Aad and he became emperor at the age of 41 after having served with Trajan for a

17
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.000
number of years.
He was born like Trajan before him in Spain,
not in Italy.

18
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.560
And,
uh,
he also was the most educated,

19
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:24.390
one of the most educated and most intellectual of the Roman emperors.

20
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.080
We'll talk about the impact that that intellect had on his architecture.

21
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.110
I mentioned that he already,
he also liked to travel.

22
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:37.950
He traveled extensively during his reign,
had three major,
uh,

23
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.130
major trips that had an enormous impact on his architecture and also on

24
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:46.830
architecture around the empire.

25
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.780
And it's also important I think to know that he reversed Trajan is policy.

26
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:53.700
You'll remember the Trajan is major,

27
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.030
a political policy had to do with military conquest that Trajan was involved in

28
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:04.930
a number of very important wars.
Uh,
and he celebrated those wars and he,

29
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.340
he extended the Empire to its furthest reaches,

30
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.570
reaches that were never gone beyond,
uh,
for the rest of the Roman empire.

31
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.710
Hadrian a reversed that policy.
He was a peace loving man.

32
00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:20.970
He had no interest in being involved in these kinds of military exploits,

33
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:25.080
although he had served with Trajan in some of them in earlier years.

34
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:30.060
He had no desire to continue that on.
A auntie was much more concerned with,

35
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.560
uh,

36
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.560
consolidating and preserving the empire as expanded by Trajan.

37
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.540
And so one of his greatest claims to fame is the Great Wall,

38
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:44.541
the famous wall of Hadrian that he built a in order to separate the Roman

39
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:48.180
empire,
the Greco Roman Empire,
uh,

40
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.910
from the rest of the empire,

41
00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:55.911
this Great Wall that divided Greco Roman civilization from the barbarian world

42
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.310
that lay outside.
And there are fragments of that wall.

43
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:05.311
It's quite extensive part of that wall that still survives in,

44
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.590
uh,
in,
in Europe today.
You can see it in Britain.

45
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.430
And I show you an example of some of those,
uh,

46
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.270
remains here on the right hand side of the screen that is of Hadrian's wall

47
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.610
Hadrian,
uh,
was also a great fill Helaine.

48
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.090
And you'll notice in that portrait that I just showed you that he wore a beard

49
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.210
and in fact,
he's the first Roman emperor to wear a beard.

50
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:32.770
Beards were not warned by Romans up to this time,
but they were worn by Greeks.

51
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.030
Uh,
and we believe that he wore that beard in large part to look more Greek.

52
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.290
We also know that although he wore a toga in public,
uh,

53
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:45.460
he was known for wearing the Greek high mation in private.
Uh,

54
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:49.960
and he did that we think in large part because of his love for Greece and for

55
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:50.980
Greek culture.

56
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.390
He was so filled Hellenic and his leanings that he received the nickname the

57
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:58.390
Greek ling.
And we'll see as we look at his architecture,

58
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.430
the impact that his love of Greece had on that architecture.
In fact,

59
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:07.930
what I'd like to do today is to begin with the most Greek of Hadrian's

60
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:12.880
buildings,
a building that we think he may have designed to himself.

61
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.080
Because we also know that Hadrian was an amateur architect.

62
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:20.680
Hadrian himself was an amateur architect,
uh,

63
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.930
and we think he designed this very building,

64
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:27.070
the so called Temple of Venus and Roma.
He was also particularly interested,

65
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:29.440
by the way in religious architecture,

66
00:04:29.441 --> 00:04:33.130
most of his public building was religious architecture temples.

67
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:34.330
This being one of them,

68
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.310
the temple of Venus and Roma at temple put up to Roma as the patron goddess of

69
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:44.200
the city of Rome,
and to Venus as the patron goddess of the Roman family.

70
00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:45.690
And you'll remember,
uh,

71
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.930
that Venus was a special favorite of Julius Caesar and of Augustus,

72
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.680
and they,
those two a thought of her as their,

73
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:56.440
as the special patron of the Julian family.

74
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.670
So we also see Hadrian here,
uh,
conjuring up,

75
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.700
I think his connections to the earlier dictators and Emperor Julius Caesar and

76
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:10.090
Augustus by his emphasis on Venus.

77
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:13.300
So this temple to Venus and Roma,
uh,

78
00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:16.990
you'll see that we don't have a precise date for this monument.

79
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.990
We think it was put up some time between one 21 and 135 we know it was dedicated

80
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:26.230
in one 35.
It seems to have been long in the making.

81
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.500
So it's hard to categorize it as either an early or a mid or a late Hadrian Anik

82
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.980
building because it does seem to have been in production for quite some time.

83
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.670
I show you two plans of the temple of Venus and Roma because there's controversy

84
00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:46.801
about which plan most accurately reflects the original Hadrian Anik temple,

85
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.130
uh,
because we know the temple,
uh,
was ball.

86
00:05:51.131 --> 00:05:54.310
It was built under Hadrian and dedicated in one 35.

87
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.660
We know that it burned down in a very serious in Rome and the late third
century,

88
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:02.990
a d and then was renovated by uh,

89
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.470
a an emperor whom we'll talk about later in the semester by the name of Max

90
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:09.020
cinches and may x,
e n t.
I,
U s.

91
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.040
It was renovated by Max sensuous in 307,

92
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.980
a d.
Uh,
and uh,

93
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:20.870
we think Mexican just kept quite closely to the original adrianic plan a but

94
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:25.220
we're not absolutely sure about that so that some of the discrepancies that you

95
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:29.450
see between these two plans may have to do with the discrepancies between the

96
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:34.130
original building and the eventual renovation.
But,
uh,

97
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.600
you will see that in the main,

98
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:38.960
these two plans and the one on the left hand side of the screen is the one

99
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:41.540
that's on your monument lists that you have in front of you.

100
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.440
The one on the right hand side of the screen is the one in your Ward Perkins

101
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:48.860
Textbook.
But if you look at its most outstanding features,

102
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:52.700
you will see that most of them are similar to one another.

103
00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:57.020
That the main features of these two buildings I have these two plans are the

104
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:58.850
same.
Uh,
and that is,

105
00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:02.090
and you should be immediately struck by these plans,

106
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:06.320
both of these plans and how different they are from what we have characterized

107
00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:08.810
as the typical Roman temple,

108
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.580
that typical Roman temple with usually with a single seller,
with a deep port,

109
00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:17.270
with freestanding columns in that porch with a facade orientation.

110
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.440
This is very different indeed no matter which of these two plans you look at

111
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:26.441
because you will see that this large temple has a double seller to sell is back

112
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:30.890
to back and you see it in both plans to sell is back to back.
Well,

113
00:07:30.891 --> 00:07:35.870
the reason for that is obvious because it commemorates to divinities Venus and

114
00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:39.890
Roma and each one needed to have a cela but these are not sell side by,

115
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.520
these are not sellers within a larger Cela,
uh,

116
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.090
located side by side is in the capital.

117
00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:50.990
I'm triad temple but rather two that are back to back to that are back to back.

118
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.030
Now what this does is take away the facade orientation of the building and give

119
00:07:56.031 --> 00:08:00.110
us two facades in the sense,
one on either side,
uh,

120
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.740
that is also a,
so we see that in both of these.

121
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:08.810
We also see that the columns,
uh,
go all the way around the structure.

122
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.500
And so does the staircase go all the way around the structure.

123
00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:13.880
We see that in both plants.

124
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.290
And then there was a large precinct that also has columns around it.

125
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:19.740
Uh,

126
00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:24.410
I can also tell you can take on faith that this building also has a low podium.

127
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.260
So what we see here is a temple that looks much more Greek than it looks.
Roman.

128
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.051
In fact,
as I said,

129
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:34.010
it doesn't look anything like the typical Roman temples that we've been talking

130
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:36.020
about today.
Why is this?

131
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.960
This has to do with the fact that Hadrian was a Phil Halane,

132
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.760
that he was and Namor to Greek architecture and that he opted in this case when

133
00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:47.270
he himself appears to have been the architect of this building.

134
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:51.740
Hadrian amateur architect seems to have designed this building himself.
A,

135
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.980
we see that when he was left entirely to his own,

136
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.040
he wanted to build a Greek temple in Rome.

137
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:03.810
And that is exactly what he did.
Now,
also important visa vi.

138
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:06.780
This temple is location,
location,
location.

139
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.800
This building is located on the,

140
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:15.030
at the edge of the Roman forum closest to the Colosseum.
Uh,

141
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:20.031
and on the Veolia you'll remember the Veolia where the arch of Titus is located.

142
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.500
Uh,
the arch of Titus.

143
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:27.501
And you'll remember that that was the area that the Flavian dynasty chose,

144
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.380
uh,
to build their buildings on,
uh,

145
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.680
in order to raise to the ground Nero's earlier.
Don't,

146
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:38.370
don't miss transitory and build their own buildings in its place.

147
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.970
So we see Hadrian continuing on in that same tradition,

148
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.320
returning to the Roman people land that had originally been there as it had been

149
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:49.890
stolen by Nero,
uh,
by building,
in this case,

150
00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:53.610
a religious structure on that site instead.

151
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:58.170
So that also extremely important to get back for a moment to the plan.
Uh,

152
00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.041
we see again,

153
00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:03.300
the major difference between these two versions is that in this case there is a

154
00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:08.100
flat back wall for each of the individual sellers.
For this one,

155
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.810
I niche on either side and niches back tobacco must kissing as you can see here.

156
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.250
Uh,

157
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.790
and then you can also see another difference is the walls are very elaborately

158
00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:19.950
scalped,
uh,
in this plan,

159
00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:24.360
which we can see in the Max [inaudible] renovation that still exists.

160
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:26.850
And I'll show it to you in a moment.
Uh,
but again,

161
00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:31.650
we're not sure if that was [inaudible] innovation in the early fourth century

162
00:10:31.651 --> 00:10:31.981
ID.

163
00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:36.960
Those back to back apps is and scalped walls or whether they come from the

164
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:38.470
original,
hey,
what did they read?

165
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.880
Restore what was in the original Adriatic building.

166
00:10:41.881 --> 00:10:46.470
I tend to prefer the one on the left because there is every evidence that we

167
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:49.560
already have all of these features,
enrollment architecture,

168
00:10:49.561 --> 00:10:54.010
think to the Flavian Palace on the Palatine demission palace,
uh,

169
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:58.750
where we saw the scallop walls in the Owl Reggio and where we certainly saw a,

170
00:10:58.751 --> 00:11:00.930
these niches with vaults of heaven,

171
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.990
a semi don't 70 volts up above them.
So everything was in place,
uh,

172
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.860
to have that kind of structure.

173
00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:11.520
So it's certainly not inconceivable in the Adriatic period.

174
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.590
Here's the view of the temple of Venus in Rome as it looks if you were standing

175
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.510
atop the coliseum and taking a picture back toward it.
And this is very useful,

176
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.090
uh,
because it shows you this is not a high podium.
This is just,
uh,
the,

177
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.920
the difference in ground level.
Once again,
uh,

178
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:33.890
ancient ground level being lower than modern ground level.
And some of the,
uh,

179
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.010
the,
the,
the,

180
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:40.070
the structures that lay below originally of Nero's a is transitory.

181
00:11:40.271 --> 00:11:43.020
Or for example,
that this building was built on here.

182
00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:46.590
You can actually see the podium of the temple and you can see that it is very

183
00:11:46.591 --> 00:11:51.570
low compared to what we're used to.
We're looking back at one of those niches.

184
00:11:51.571 --> 00:11:53.780
You can see the 70 dome,
uh,

185
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:58.240
as well as the relationship of it to the arch of Titus,

186
00:11:58.241 --> 00:12:00.160
which ends the Veolia.
Which one again,

187
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:05.190
once again points out the fact that we are dealing here with a building that was

188
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:10.891
put on property that had originally been the location of Nero's Domus

189
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.070
transitory.
Here are three very useful views.

190
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:20.100
One showing that same niche closer up from the taken from the Colosseum,

191
00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:25.000
one of those back to back niches as it looks today.
And then this one over here,

192
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:30.001
which is the other niche which is preserved inside a later building that was

193
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:35.731
transformed into a museum of the Forum Romana at one point we see it here and

194
00:12:36.281 --> 00:12:38.380
you can see in both cases the 70 dome,

195
00:12:38.381 --> 00:12:42.460
you can see the concrete construction faced with brick,
uh,
in this one,

196
00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:46.420
which has better preserved in large part because it was in,
in pardon doors.

197
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.690
We can see the columns on either side of the niche.

198
00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:52.960
And we also see that scallop wall that I described before,

199
00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:56.440
just like the owl Reggio with niches flanked by columns.

200
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.140
And you can see the beginning of a coffered vaults.

201
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.270
We're not absolutely sure it was barrel vaulted,

202
00:13:01.271 --> 00:13:04.120
but we think the building was barrel vaulted.

203
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.970
We also see on the left,

204
00:13:06.971 --> 00:13:11.520
I remind you of the octagonal room designed by rebellious,
uh,

205
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.380
for the,
um,

206
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.290
dimensions palace on the Palatine to underscore again,

207
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:21.400
the kinds of experiments that rebellious was making that had such an impact.

208
00:13:21.401 --> 00:13:26.020
As we shall see today on Hadrian and his own architectural designs.

209
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.250
You'll remember that room.
You'll remember that it has a segmented vault.

210
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:35.620
You will remember that it's treated very much like sculpture,
that it has niches,

211
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:39.280
that it has niches within,
niches,
windows within niches,
doorways within niches.

212
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.760
All of them done in an asymmetrical way.

213
00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:46.240
A that makes the design particularly interesting,
rebellious,

214
00:13:46.241 --> 00:13:50.530
and his architecture and very influential on Hadrian.
Uh,

215
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.900
keep in mind that Hadrian wants to mission.

216
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.420
I mentioned this to you when we talked about dimensions palace.

217
00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:57.430
Once the mission built that palace,

218
00:13:57.431 --> 00:14:00.910
it was the palace and all the emperor's from that time to the end of late

219
00:14:00.911 --> 00:14:04.630
antiquity lived in Hadrian was no exception.
When he was in Rome.

220
00:14:04.631 --> 00:14:09.490
He lived in that palace and he was there for seeing and experiencing,

221
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.921
uh,

222
00:14:09.921 --> 00:14:14.921
the shapes of the architectural shapes designed by [inaudible] on a daily basis.

223
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.280
He liked that octagonal room in particular and the others like it in the villa

224
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.510
in the palace.
And he was clearly,

225
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.560
it clearly had an impact on him as we shall see.

226
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.600
The last point I want to make about the temple of Venus enrollment by the way,

227
00:14:31.601 --> 00:14:33.100
has to do with materials.

228
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.300
We have been talking about the increasing use of marble enrollment architecture

229
00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:42.301
under Augustus marble from Luna or Carrara under Nero and the flavor Ian's

230
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:46.180
marble from all over the world from Asia minor from Africa of all different

231
00:14:46.181 --> 00:14:50.800
colors.
Hadrian the fill of Elaine returns to using Greek marble,
uh,

232
00:14:50.801 --> 00:14:54.840
for his buildings.
And the Temple of Venus in Roma is made,
uh,

233
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.700
proclination marble p.

234
00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:01.110
R.
O.
C.
O.
N.
N.
E.
S.
I am,

235
00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:05.030
I think I got that right.
Proclination marble,
uh,
that um,

236
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.000
that comes from Greece.
It's a blue veined marble.

237
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:13.270
He was particularly fond of it and he used it for the temple of Venus and Roma.

238
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:18.020
I want to turn from the temple of Venus enrollment to the much more famous

239
00:15:18.021 --> 00:15:20.840
temple that Hadrian constructed.

240
00:15:20.841 --> 00:15:25.070
If the temple of Venus and Roma was to two gods,
I mean this in Roma.
Uh,

241
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:28.790
the Hadrian Hadrian's pantheon was to all the gods,

242
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:32.920
which is what pantheon means to all the gods at temple,
to all the gods,
uh,

243
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:37.990
that he built in Rome between one 18 and 128 a d you see a Google earth image of

244
00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:43.590
it here,
the Pantheon surrounded by,
uh,

245
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.410
by modern structures.

246
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.740
It is one of the greatest masterpieces of architecture of all times.

247
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:56.180
Uh,
in fact,
if you were to ask a group of architectural experts to give,

248
00:15:56.181 --> 00:16:00.410
make a list of their 10,
the 10 greatest buildings ever built,

249
00:16:00.411 --> 00:16:04.010
it's hard for me to believe that not every one of them would at least list

250
00:16:04.011 --> 00:16:07.070
somewhere in that list of 10,
the Pantheon,

251
00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:09.380
not only because it's a great building in its own right,

252
00:16:09.381 --> 00:16:10.520
but because it has had such a,

253
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.880
an enormous impact on architecture in Roman times as we'll see in later

254
00:16:16.371 --> 00:16:17.204
lectures,

255
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:22.480
but also on architecture in post antique times and extraordinarily influential

256
00:16:23.031 --> 00:16:25.400
building.
And there are some,
and I would be one of them.

257
00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:27.750
Maybe I'd be the only one.
I hope not.
Uh,

258
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:32.540
who would list the Pantheon as the greatest building ever built by man or woman

259
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:37.220
of any time in any place.
And you can see as we look at it together today,

260
00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:40.190
whether you think I come closer,
I'm way off the mark on that,

261
00:16:40.191 --> 00:16:45.020
but I believe vehemently that it was the greatest building ever built.

262
00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:49.490
And it remains an extraordinary structure to see and to experience.

263
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.890
You see it here.
Oh,
and by the way,

264
00:16:51.891 --> 00:16:55.040
although I mentioned that Hadrian was an amateur architect,

265
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.760
we don't know the name of the architect for the Pantheon.

266
00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:03.620
Do I think it was Hadrian?
Absolutely not.
Hadrian was not this good.

267
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.590
It was an amateur architect,
not a professional architect.

268
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.860
This is an extraordinary work of art.
He may have had some input.

269
00:17:09.861 --> 00:17:11.570
He undoubtedly did.
Uh,

270
00:17:11.571 --> 00:17:16.010
because we're going to see that the Pantheon is at the same time complex and

271
00:17:16.011 --> 00:17:19.070
simple.
Uh,
it's also traditional and innovative.

272
00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:23.590
And what we're going to see Hadrian and his architect doing here and also doing

273
00:17:23.591 --> 00:17:27.830
it.
The villa at Tivoli is combining in an extraordinary way,

274
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:32.540
traditional Roman and innovative Roman architecture,
concrete construction,

275
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.690
and the original vocabulary of Greek architecture,

276
00:17:35.691 --> 00:17:38.570
namely columns combined in the same place.

277
00:17:38.571 --> 00:17:42.980
And he was highly influenced in this regard by his predecessor Trajan.

278
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.320
Think of the markets and forum of Trajan,

279
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.320
the way in which we had combined in the same complex,

280
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.390
a traditional forum and a very innovative marketplace.

281
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.780
We're going to see the same thing in the Pantheon.

282
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.260
We're going to see the same thing at Hadrian's villa at Tivoli.

283
00:17:58.261 --> 00:18:01.040
So Trajan exerting of Trajan and Apollo,

284
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:06.050
Doris of Damascus exerting a very strong influence as did robberies on the

285
00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:10.710
architecture of Hadrian.
Uh,
again,
this,

286
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.570
this a Google earth image is useful because it shows us the building in its

287
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.350
modern environment.
Uh,

288
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.980
but it's important to keep in mind that the Pantheon in Rome,

289
00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:23.490
uh,

290
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:28.320
was part of a complex in antiquity as most temples were temples that were in

291
00:18:28.321 --> 00:18:30.210
sanctuary samples that were in fora.

292
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.690
We've seen that in the course of the semester that they usually did not stand in

293
00:18:33.691 --> 00:18:36.900
isolation,
but we're part of architectural complexes.

294
00:18:36.901 --> 00:18:41.640
We see that here of this model is very helpful in that regard because it shows

295
00:18:41.641 --> 00:18:46.641
us that there was a rectangular court that that for court had covered colonnades

296
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:51.360
on either side,
that there was some sort of entranceway here,
possibly an arch,

297
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:56.190
possibly an altar,
also a to all the gods in front of the temple.
Uh,

298
00:18:56.191 --> 00:18:59.970
and then,
uh,
the temple itself,
the Pantheon itself.

299
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:05.300
Now this model is also very useful in the sense that it gives you an idea of

300
00:19:06.691 --> 00:19:10.150
what you actually would have seen if you had walked into,
uh,

301
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.310
this complex into this open rectangular space,
uh,

302
00:19:14.311 --> 00:19:17.160
and walked toward the,
the Pantheon.

303
00:19:17.161 --> 00:19:19.830
What would you actually have seen?
Well,

304
00:19:19.831 --> 00:19:24.630
all that you would have actually seen was the porch,
the porch,

305
00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.200
which had an attic behind it,
which screened,
uh,

306
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:32.100
the cylindrical drum and the dome from the viewer.

307
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.670
So if you were standing here,
all you would have seen was this porch.

308
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:40.800
Now this porch is very traditional.
It looks like other Roman temples,

309
00:19:40.801 --> 00:19:43.710
the fronts of facades of Roman temples that we've looked up before.

310
00:19:43.711 --> 00:19:45.840
It looks like other Greek temples,
uh,

311
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:50.990
because what you would've seen a was the pediment columns supporting that

312
00:19:51.061 --> 00:19:55.410
pediment.
It was a typical Roman temple from the top front,
deep porch,

313
00:19:55.411 --> 00:20:00.120
freestanding columns in that porch,
single staircase facade orientation,

314
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.900
very different from the temple of Venus and Roma,

315
00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.670
much more Roman looking.
Uh,
and then,
uh,
I think I,

316
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.280
and then I high podium a high podium,
which we already mentioned,

317
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.740
the temple of Venus enrollment did not have,

318
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.830
that's what you would have seen as you were standing in front of it.

319
00:20:16.831 --> 00:20:17.550
You would have thought,
well,

320
00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:22.110
this is very much in keeping with other Roman temples.

321
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.060
Uh,
but,
uh,

322
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.650
of course there was a surprise when one walk through the doors.

323
00:20:28.651 --> 00:20:32.370
And that is the very essence of adrianic architecture.
Uh,

324
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.660
the surprise that one gets when one actually goes from the outside of building

325
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.470
into the inside of a building.
Before we do that,

326
00:20:40.471 --> 00:20:45.360
I just want to show you the back of the cylindrical because this,
this,
uh,

327
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:50.370
traditional porch,
uh,
shielded,
uh,

328
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:55.380
a very innovative cylindrical drum supported by a hemispherical dome.

329
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:59.380
As you can see here,
uh,
the construction technique,

330
00:20:59.381 --> 00:21:02.710
the same as we've seen,
uh,
from the time of Augustus,

331
00:21:02.711 --> 00:21:04.900
from the time of the temple of Mercury at Baia,

332
00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:08.800
the use of concrete construction faced with brick.

333
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.160
It's more sophisticated here than it has ever been before.

334
00:21:12.161 --> 00:21:14.300
And we can see that the artists have,

335
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:19.300
the architect has relieved the severity of the structure by adding a three

336
00:21:19.301 --> 00:21:23.500
cornices.
You can see them here,
two of them at least.
Heres another one down here,

337
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.430
three cornices.
And you can also see very interestingly,

338
00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:32.690
these brick arches which tell us a great deal about Roman building practice

339
00:21:33.101 --> 00:21:34.030
during this period,

340
00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:38.320
especially obviously for the use of concrete construction because what those

341
00:21:38.321 --> 00:21:41.440
were used for is to help keep the uh,

342
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.910
concrete from settling after the,
the wet concrete had been poured.

343
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.570
Those arches keep it from settling until it dries.

344
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.970
And then once it dries,
uh,

345
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.790
those arches are no longer needed because the building,

346
00:21:54.791 --> 00:21:58.450
the concrete walls support the building on their own,

347
00:21:58.451 --> 00:22:01.990
can support the dome on their own and they're no longer needed,

348
00:22:01.991 --> 00:22:06.250
but of course they're left there and then they have a certain aesthetic value in

349
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.830
the aftermath.
Uh,

350
00:22:07.831 --> 00:22:11.980
and so you can see very clearly here as you look at what is preserved and the

351
00:22:11.981 --> 00:22:15.460
building is extremely well preserved of the back of the building.
Uh,

352
00:22:15.461 --> 00:22:20.290
you can see a reference to that construction,
uh,

353
00:22:20.291 --> 00:22:22.540
these diagrams,
both the plan,

354
00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:26.590
the plan of the structure of the cross section and the diagram on the left hand

355
00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:31.030
side also give us some very interesting and important information.

356
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.760
Uh,
they show us that the,
um,

357
00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:38.850
circular drum was internally half the height of the diameter.

358
00:22:39.101 --> 00:22:43.900
You can see that in the,
uh,
in the diagram on the left hand side of the screen,

359
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:48.220
uh,
of the diameter of the structure and,
um,

360
00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:51.670
that it was surmounted by a hemispherical dome,

361
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:56.950
the Crown of which is,
uh,
the,
the,
the exact distance,

362
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.420
the same exact distance.

363
00:22:58.421 --> 00:23:03.421
So this was very carefully orchestrated by the architect to achieve,

364
00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.510
uh,
what he needed to achieve here.
Uh,

365
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:12.940
you can also see if you look at the plan that again,
uh,
the,
the,

366
00:23:12.941 --> 00:23:16.960
the predecessors for this are clearly the frigging Daria at palm pay,

367
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.880
the thermal bath at Baia.

368
00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:23.890
This round structure with the radiating apps is a very similar but of course

369
00:23:23.891 --> 00:23:27.850
done in much,
much grander scale.

370
00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.540
Now with regard to,
with regard to,

371
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.650
and this is the facade of the Pantheon of course as it looks today with regard

372
00:23:35.651 --> 00:23:37.240
to how they made this happen,

373
00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.950
how they were able to take the small scale frigging Daria,
uh,

374
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.960
the slightly larger temple of Mercury,

375
00:23:43.961 --> 00:23:47.360
the larger still don't miss our area of neuro or the Dome Dome.

376
00:23:47.361 --> 00:23:52.361
The Dome is transitory and turn it into the Pantheon ultimately has to do in

377
00:23:52.671 --> 00:23:57.671
part not only with the skill of the architects has to do in part also with the

378
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:03.230
increasing sophistication that we've been talking about quite consistently of

379
00:24:03.231 --> 00:24:07.360
the use of concrete construction by the Romans.
Uh,

380
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.010
but also has to do with the recipe for concrete.

381
00:24:10.011 --> 00:24:13.520
We haven't talked about the recipe for concrete since the time of [inaudible]

382
00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.490
when we talked about the fact that he had made some adjustments,

383
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.540
well Hadrian made some adjustments or Hadrian and his architects made some

384
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.580
adjustments as well,
uh,
during Hadrian's reign.
Uh,

385
00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:29.300
and what they did was they,
two things,
they decreased the,
um,
thickness.

386
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.490
They decrease the thickness of the walls,
uh,

387
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:35.020
from bottom to top.
Uh,

388
00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.820
and they also did what collegial had done before,

389
00:24:37.821 --> 00:24:41.810
but did it even even more so by,
uh,
mixing,

390
00:24:41.811 --> 00:24:45.380
using as an aggregate at the base of the dome.

391
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.910
They used a heavy,
heavy stone,
a result,
very heavy,
thick,

392
00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.290
bizarre old.
But when they got toward the top,
they mixed,

393
00:24:53.291 --> 00:24:55.400
or the idea was when they got toward the top,

394
00:24:55.401 --> 00:25:00.350
they would mix in as an aggregate I porous pumice,
which was much,
much lighter.

395
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.300
And that's essentially how they achieved their goals.

396
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.870
Now,
before I talk about the exterior of the structure and,

397
00:25:10.871 --> 00:25:12.500
and take you through the building,

398
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:17.950
I want to mention one very interesting exchange between Hadrian and Trajan is

399
00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:21.200
architect Apollo Doris of Damascus.

400
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.520
You'll remember that I said that the temple of Venus and Roma we think was

401
00:25:25.521 --> 00:25:30.370
designed by Hadrian himself.
And at one point Adrian Mapala,

402
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.530
Doris was still alive and at one point and highly respected.

403
00:25:33.531 --> 00:25:35.910
And at one point Hadrian went to Apollo,

404
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:40.930
Doris to ask him for his thoughts on the designs that Hadrian was doing or the

405
00:25:42.111 --> 00:25:46.220
plans and Hadrian was doing for the temple of Venus in Roma,
which tells us,

406
00:25:46.221 --> 00:25:47.570
do you wondered where I got,
where I,

407
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.090
how we know that Hadrian was an amateur architect.

408
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:54.080
It's because of this passage because it tells us that Hadrian was doing some

409
00:25:54.081 --> 00:25:57.980
designing and that he was designing the temple of Venus and Roma.

410
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.660
And we fortunately have the,
the uh,
the uh,

411
00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:06.530
Roman senator of eastern birth.
Dyo Cassius Dio,
new words,

412
00:26:06.531 --> 00:26:08.840
Ca Ssi,
you s oh,
caches,

413
00:26:08.841 --> 00:26:13.010
a Roman senator of eastern birth who wrote a history of Rome in the third

414
00:26:13.011 --> 00:26:16.240
century,
gives us the third century ID,
gives us,
uh,

415
00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:20.810
an account of this interaction between Hadrian and Apollo.

416
00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:24.380
Doris of Damascus.
And although I don't like to read to you,

417
00:26:24.381 --> 00:26:29.000
I am going to read to you from this quote because it is so critical for our

418
00:26:29.001 --> 00:26:33.290
understanding both of the Pantheon and four Hadrian's villa at Tivoli.

419
00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:38.230
So bear with me as I read this,
you know,
a bit long dish,
um,
quote.

420
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:42.050
So Cassius Cassius diode tells us,
and I quote,

421
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:47.930
Hadrian first drove into exile and then put to death Apollo Doris,

422
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:53.760
who had carried out many of Trajan building projects.

423
00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.670
The pretext given for Hadrian's action was Apollo.

424
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.290
Doris had been guilty of some serious offense,

425
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:06.480
but the truth is that when Trajan was at one time consulting with the Paula

426
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.120
Doris about a certain problem connected with his buildings,

427
00:27:09.121 --> 00:27:12.570
that is Trajan is buildings.
The architect said to Hadrian.

428
00:27:12.571 --> 00:27:15.990
So this seems to have been before even Hadrian I became emperor,

429
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.970
the architect said to Hadrian who had interrupted them with some advice,

430
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.870
go away and draw your pumpkin's.

431
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:28.290
You know nothing about these problems for it.

432
00:27:28.291 --> 00:27:33.291
So happened that Hadrian was at that time prided himself on some sort of drawing

433
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.170
when he became emperor.
That is when Hadrian became emperor.

434
00:27:37.171 --> 00:27:42.171
He remembered the insult and refuse to put up with Apollo and refuse to put up

435
00:27:42.751 --> 00:27:45.330
with Apollo,
adores his outspokenness.

436
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.840
He sent him the plan for the Temple of Venus and Roma in order to demonstrate

437
00:27:51.721 --> 00:27:56.721
that it was possible for a great work to be conceived without a politic Chris's

438
00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:02.890
help and asked him that his Hadrian asked to Paula doors if he thought the

439
00:28:02.941 --> 00:28:05.010
building was well designed.

440
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:10.610
Apollo Doris sent a reply saying that as far as the temple of Venus and Roma was

441
00:28:11.131 --> 00:28:14.820
concerned,
it should have been placed in a higher position.

442
00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.540
It should have had a high podium,
not a low podium,

443
00:28:18.541 --> 00:28:23.541
according to a Paula Doris who goes on to say with regard to the cult images,

444
00:28:23.641 --> 00:28:27.990
Apollo,
Doris Kapala doors goes on to say with regard to the cult images,

445
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:33.270
they were made on a scale which was too great for the height of the Sella for if

446
00:28:33.271 --> 00:28:36.780
the goddesses should wish to stand up and leave the temple.

447
00:28:36.781 --> 00:28:41.781
He said they would be unable to do so when he wrote all of this so bluntly,

448
00:28:42.301 --> 00:28:45.690
Hadrian was both irritated and deeply pained.

449
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:50.070
He had the man slain.
Now the Pumpkin's,

450
00:28:50.071 --> 00:28:51.270
what's critical about this?

451
00:28:51.271 --> 00:28:55.440
It tells us two things that are absolutely essential in our understanding of

452
00:28:55.441 --> 00:28:59.610
adrianic architecture.
One that Hadrian was doing,
designing on his own,

453
00:28:59.611 --> 00:29:03.870
that he was an amateur architect and he seems to be very much involved in the

454
00:29:03.871 --> 00:29:06.090
design of the temple of Venus and Roma.

455
00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:11.400
It also tells us that Hadrian was making some drawings,
uh,

456
00:29:11.401 --> 00:29:14.580
of pumpkin domes.
What our pumpkin domes.
Well,

457
00:29:14.581 --> 00:29:18.210
pub pumpkin drones or domes are undoubtedly segmented domes.

458
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:23.360
They are just the kind of dome that rubbery barriers did for the octagonal rooms

459
00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:29.480
in the palatine palace rooms that Hadrian was exposed to by living in that

460
00:29:31.141 --> 00:29:34.950
palace himself.
Obviously fond of them like them,
uh,

461
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:39.030
started to draw his own pumpkins and we're going to see that,

462
00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:40.680
that those pumpkin's well,

463
00:29:40.681 --> 00:29:43.720
we don't have a pumpkin dome in the Pantheon and this won't see probably

464
00:29:43.721 --> 00:29:47.980
fortunately.
Uh,
but uh,
we do have them at Hadrian's villa.

465
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.910
And so again,
very critical,
uh,
for you to be aware of this.

466
00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:56.810
It's interesting exchange,
very momentous exchange between Hadrian and Apollo.

467
00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:01.360
Doris,
we see here the facade of the Pantheon as it looks today.

468
00:30:01.361 --> 00:30:05.830
You have to think a way,
this very attractive,
but nonetheless,
uh,

469
00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.660
Mars,
the view of the,

470
00:30:07.661 --> 00:30:11.910
of the facade of the Pantheon that was put up in the renaissance,
uh,

471
00:30:11.911 --> 00:30:15.280
and you have to imagine the building now stands in isolation without it's

472
00:30:15.281 --> 00:30:20.050
colonnades and without it's for court.
So you have to try to imagine them,

473
00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:24.070
but you can see how very well preserved the Pantheon is.
Uh,

474
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:28.510
the ground level has shifted so we don't see the very tall podium that was once

475
00:30:28.511 --> 00:30:29.020
there,

476
00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.770
although there have been some excavations around it that demonstrate that it is

477
00:30:32.771 --> 00:30:35.600
indeed,
there are part of it is indeed there.
Uh,

478
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:39.610
but we can see the columns across the front.
We can see an inscription,

479
00:30:39.611 --> 00:30:41.320
we can see the pediment and the attic.

480
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:45.040
And this is a good view because although you see the dome peeping up a little

481
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:49.180
bit on the top,
it gives you some sense of when you stood in the colonnade,

482
00:30:49.181 --> 00:30:52.480
walking toward it,
uh,
that the,
the forecourt walking toward it,

483
00:30:52.481 --> 00:30:55.900
that you would have only seen essentially the most traditional part of the

484
00:30:55.901 --> 00:31:00.520
building.
And that is the columns supporting the pediment with the Dome behind.

485
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:05.350
This is a detail of the inscription of the building.

486
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.220
Uh,
we can also see the columns.
You can see that they are gray.
Granted,

487
00:31:09.221 --> 00:31:13.390
I've a better view in a moment.
Gray granite with white marble capitals.

488
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.070
The inscription is fascinating.
It tells us that m.
Dot.
At grip up.
Marcus Agrippa,

489
00:31:18.071 --> 00:31:22.240
that's the famous Marcus Agrippa,
the childhood friend,
confidant,

490
00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:26.680
son in law firsthand.
Man.
One time air,
uh,
to Augustus.

491
00:31:26.681 --> 00:31:29.200
Marcus Agrippa LF lucious Phil,

492
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:32.290
he is the son of Lucius Cos coast,

493
00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:37.000
a console consult tear team for the third time.
Fake it made it,

494
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:41.950
this tells us Marcus Agrippa console for the third time son of Lucius made it,

495
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.500
made the Pantheon.
What's that all about?

496
00:31:44.501 --> 00:31:47.680
Marcus Agrippa lived in the age of Augustus.
Well,

497
00:31:47.681 --> 00:31:51.370
we know there was an earlier pantheon on this site that Marcus Agrippa was

498
00:31:51.371 --> 00:31:52.930
responsible for commissioning.

499
00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:57.340
Marcus Agrippa like a Augustus commissioned a lot of buildings in Rome.

500
00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.050
He also commissioned them in the provinces.

501
00:31:59.051 --> 00:32:01.630
We'll look at some of those when we go out to the provinces.

502
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:06.520
Marcus Agrippa major building program in Rome,
including a pantheon,

503
00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:11.230
a temple to all the gods.
And we don't,
that Pantheon no longer exists,

504
00:32:11.231 --> 00:32:13.900
although there've been some excavations that have discovered some of it

505
00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:16.420
underneath the current building.
Uh,

506
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:20.890
but it stood on this very site and we know from a literary description that had

507
00:32:20.891 --> 00:32:22.360
had a car he porch,

508
00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:26.460
which is perhaps not surprising in the context of Augustan architecture.

509
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:29.410
Remember the car he audits in the forum of Augustus,
uh,

510
00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.240
that we looked at earlier in the term.

511
00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:35.710
So we know that Marcus Agrippa actually built Rome's first Pantheon,

512
00:32:35.711 --> 00:32:38.530
both its first temple to the gods on this very site.

513
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:41.990
When Hadrian built his own Pantheon on the same site,

514
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.620
he decided to piously reference,
uh,

515
00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:49.400
the earlier building of Marcus Agrippa telling us that Marcus Agrippa made this,

516
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:51.800
made a building that originally stood on this site,

517
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:56.360
which he is basically very modestly saying he restored.
Of course,

518
00:32:56.361 --> 00:33:01.040
this building that he made has nothing to do undoubtedly with the Pantheon

519
00:33:01.041 --> 00:33:04.460
enrollments,
a very different and much more sophisticated building.

520
00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:09.440
But it was a very modest thing to do.
But I think there was a,

521
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:13.260
uh,
you know,
a method to his madness in the sense that he,
he,

522
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:17.780
he was underscoring by so doing his relationship once again to Augustus,

523
00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:20.750
which was obviously very important for him to do.

524
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:25.310
But this inscription confused a lot of scholars for a long time who actually

525
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:28.910
called this originally a,
um,
an Augustan building.

526
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.120
You can see the pediment up above.
You can see all the holes there.

527
00:33:32.121 --> 00:33:35.980
Those are the attachment marks for sculpture that would have stood in that would

528
00:33:35.981 --> 00:33:39.230
have been located in this pediment that no longer survives.

529
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:43.010
Here's another view showing the gray,
the light gray granite columns,

530
00:33:43.011 --> 00:33:46.880
the white Corinthian capitals,
all of these VR magnificently carved,

531
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:51.560
very high quality artists,
architects and artisans here.
By the way,

532
00:33:51.561 --> 00:33:54.440
I forgot to mention when we talked about the temple of Venus and Roman,

533
00:33:54.441 --> 00:33:58.280
the use of Greek marble that Hadrian not only abroad in Greek marble,

534
00:33:58.281 --> 00:34:02.360
but he brought in Greek marble cutters,
marble carvers,
uh,

535
00:34:02.361 --> 00:34:06.320
who were responsible for working on these.
So he wanted the very best,

536
00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:09.350
those who are most familiar with carbon,
Greek marble,
uh,

537
00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.880
to be used for his buildings.

538
00:34:10.881 --> 00:34:13.870
And they were undoubtedly used for this one as well.
Uh,

539
00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.860
and we can see the depth of the porch.

540
00:34:15.861 --> 00:34:20.480
I think also from this view of the Corinthian columns of that porch,

541
00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:26.330
it's very hard in a classroom,
in new haven,
even with outstanding slides,
uh,

542
00:34:26.331 --> 00:34:30.770
to be able to give you a sense of the experience that one has of the surprise

543
00:34:30.771 --> 00:34:35.540
that one has as one walks through the door of the Pantheon.

544
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.950
Uh,
we see,
uh,
the door's open tier.
They are bronze doors,

545
00:34:39.951 --> 00:34:44.840
they are original drawer door doors from this extremely well preserved
structure.

546
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:48.830
And the reason that it is so well preserved is because like other buildings in

547
00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:52.520
Rome,
it was reused in later times as a church,

548
00:34:52.521 --> 00:34:56.660
primarily with a wonderful name Santa Maria Rotunda,

549
00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.160
Saint Mary,
the Rotunda,
Mary essentially,
uh,
which is perfectly,

550
00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.370
perfectly chosen,
uh,

551
00:35:03.371 --> 00:35:08.180
for a building with a giant Rotunda with a great cylindrical drum that the

552
00:35:08.181 --> 00:35:09.620
building has a,

553
00:35:09.621 --> 00:35:13.670
we see those doors opened up here and as one walks through this very traditional

554
00:35:13.671 --> 00:35:17.670
porch through the original bronze doors into the interior,
uh,

555
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:22.750
one is struck by the extraordinary nature of the interior of the Pantheon,

556
00:35:23.571 --> 00:35:27.590
which you see over here.
And all you're looking at here is the upper most part,

557
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:31.400
uh,
with the,
uh,
with the Dome essentially because,

558
00:35:31.401 --> 00:35:34.790
and the reason is because it is near the Hue.
Even the human eye,

559
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:39.030
both eyes can't take in,
uh,
the,

560
00:35:39.031 --> 00:35:41.880
the extent of this interior all in one glance.

561
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.970
And even if one uses the widest of wide angle lenses,

562
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.060
you get a tremendous amount of distortion I knew,

563
00:35:48.061 --> 00:35:50.580
can't really take the whole thing in at once,

564
00:35:50.581 --> 00:35:52.350
which is what makes it extraordinary.

565
00:35:52.351 --> 00:35:57.351
And one has to rely instead on this painting by Panini that shows you the grand

566
00:35:59.251 --> 00:36:00.270
jury beneath the dome.

567
00:36:00.271 --> 00:36:04.260
That gives you a better idea that any image I can show you however professional

568
00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:08.450
of what the interior of the Pantheon actually looks like.
A,

569
00:36:08.451 --> 00:36:11.580
and you can see in this Panini painting,
uh,

570
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:16.350
the wonderful marble revetment,
the marble floor,
uh,
the,

571
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:21.000
uh,
the,
the Dome,
uh,
with its coffers.
There are,
um,

572
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.460
uh,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,

573
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:28.260
five rows have five rows of 28 coffers each 140 coffers and all,

574
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.690
uh,
they were likely gilded in antiquity.

575
00:36:30.691 --> 00:36:35.430
You see that there is an oculus through which light streams down onto that

576
00:36:35.431 --> 00:36:38.550
gilding down onto the marble in cross station,

577
00:36:38.551 --> 00:36:41.550
the marble incrustation by the way,
extremely well preserved.

578
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:46.380
This is about our best example of ancient Roman marble.
Not all of it is ancient,

579
00:36:46.381 --> 00:36:48.060
but a good portion of it is,

580
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:52.140
and it gives you a very good sense of what some of these marble buildings would

581
00:36:52.141 --> 00:36:54.120
have looked like in antiquity.

582
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:59.370
And I show you a detail of some of the original marble revetment over here.

583
00:36:59.371 --> 00:37:03.330
And this is what those palm pains wished.
Their walls actually were.

584
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:07.830
A beautiful marbles of all different colors brought from all different parts of

585
00:37:07.831 --> 00:37:08.221
the world.

586
00:37:08.221 --> 00:37:12.930
So even though Hadrian chose proclination marble or his temple of Venus and
Roma,

587
00:37:12.931 --> 00:37:17.280
his Greek building,
which we really need to think of as a kind of Greek import,

588
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:19.140
a for this more Roman building,

589
00:37:19.141 --> 00:37:23.340
he is following in the footsteps of narrow and the Flavian and using

590
00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:27.990
multicolored marble both for the revetment on the wall and the marble pavement

591
00:37:27.991 --> 00:37:32.440
down below.
Uh,
most of this building,
again,
it's very well preserved.

592
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:35.910
It's original is the original structure,
the original columns,

593
00:37:35.911 --> 00:37:40.830
the original pilasters still extremely well preserved and the Pantheon,

594
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:43.920
uh,
because it was used over time as a church.

595
00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:49.100
There are lots of accouterments that one would expect a in a church,

596
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:53.880
uh,
various saints and niches and so on and so forth.
So much of the sculpture,
uh,

597
00:37:53.881 --> 00:37:57.920
is,
is,
is from a later period.
And it even served a,

598
00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:02.820
has served as a burial place for famous,
uh,
Italians,
uh,

599
00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:04.890
not the least of which was Rafael,

600
00:38:04.891 --> 00:38:08.550
the famous renaissance painter who hold your remember left to graffito when he

601
00:38:08.551 --> 00:38:12.720
went down,
uh,
into the subterranean chambers of Nero's.

602
00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:17.040
Don't miss our area.
He was buried here in his tomb is one of the high points,

603
00:38:17.041 --> 00:38:20.760
but most visitors to this structure,
you see it here,
uh,

604
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:25.050
dwarfs to most people's minds.
The tumor,
Victor Emmanuel,
uh,

605
00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:27.780
whom you see over here on the left hand side of the screen.

606
00:38:27.781 --> 00:38:30.540
But note all of that Roman symbolism.
You know,

607
00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:33.780
the Eagle without stretch wings and the Amazonian Pelton.

608
00:38:33.781 --> 00:38:36.910
So on all of those of Roman power,

609
00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:41.920
a still very much used by dynastic modern dynasty like Victor Emmanuel,

610
00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:49.920
the Dome of the Pantheon had the largest diameter of any dome,
uh,

611
00:38:49.921 --> 00:38:54.190
up to this point.
Uh,
we know that it was,

612
00:38:54.191 --> 00:38:57.580
the diameter of the Pantheon is 142 feet.

613
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:02.710
And,
uh,
if we compare it to the other large dome in Rome,

614
00:39:02.711 --> 00:39:04.540
that of Saint Peters,
uh,

615
00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:09.130
we find that the Pantheon Dome still surpasses Saint Peter.

616
00:39:09.131 --> 00:39:12.490
Saint Peter's is 139 feet in diameter.

617
00:39:12.491 --> 00:39:14.680
So just a bit smaller.
Now,

618
00:39:14.681 --> 00:39:18.010
any of you who have been both in the Pantheon and in Saint Peters will probably

619
00:39:18.011 --> 00:39:19.660
say to me,
wait a minute here.
Uh,

620
00:39:19.661 --> 00:39:22.780
the Dome of Saint Peter's actually looks larger when you stand in front

621
00:39:22.781 --> 00:39:25.720
underneath it.
And I show you a view of that dome here.

622
00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:30.280
The reason it does look a bit larger is the Dome of Saint Peter's is taller.

623
00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:34.750
So volume metrically it looks bigger.
Uh,
and visually it looks bigger,

624
00:39:34.751 --> 00:39:37.660
but it isn't in terms of its diameter in diameter.

625
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:42.870
The Dome of the Pantheon is still the largest dome in the city of Rome.

626
00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:47.470
And as you look at this dome and compare it to Saint Peter's one can't help but

627
00:39:47.471 --> 00:39:49.570
think and think back to uh,

628
00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.890
demission and his dominus at de [inaudible] and his Baltz and so on and so
forth.

629
00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:57.820
The whole idea of being,
uh,
having the Dome of Heaven over one's head,

630
00:39:57.821 --> 00:40:02.140
I think one can't help but think when one looks at this,

631
00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:05.680
that there may be some reference here,
both to the orb of the earth.

632
00:40:05.681 --> 00:40:09.670
And to the Dome of Heaven.
And it is certainly,
uh,
a,
um,

633
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:14.790
a appropriate symbol for a building that honors all the gods.

634
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.670
I think it's important to,
um,

635
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.230
to at this juncture to say something about or to compare,
uh,

636
00:40:23.231 --> 00:40:25.390
the most important Greek temple,

637
00:40:25.391 --> 00:40:30.370
the Parthenon on the Acropolis in Athens with the most significant Roman temple,

638
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:31.810
the Pantheon,
uh,

639
00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:36.840
to see that we have really come from an exterior to an interior architecture.

640
00:40:37.091 --> 00:40:41.570
Then in the case of the Parthenon,
fifth century BC,
the Indian Necropolis,
uh,

641
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:45.610
they are thinking primarily of a building that interacts with the rock of the

642
00:40:45.611 --> 00:40:49.420
Acropolis and with the urban landscape.
Uh,

643
00:40:49.421 --> 00:40:51.100
and in other contexts,

644
00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:54.790
these Greek buildings interact directly with nature.

645
00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:58.420
That's the way the Greeks thought about their buildings essentially as an

646
00:40:58.421 --> 00:40:59.830
exterior structure.

647
00:40:59.831 --> 00:41:03.430
And we see the Romans following suit in their emphasis on facade,

648
00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:06.910
the facade of temples in their own religious architecture.

649
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.250
But with the Pantheon that changes,
yes,

650
00:41:09.251 --> 00:41:13.270
it does have a facade does have a pediment in the front.

651
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:14.890
It does have a traditional porch.

652
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:19.240
So that's a nod to traditional temple architecture.

653
00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:24.180
But once you go through that port into the structure and see that great a

654
00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.550
cylindrical drum,
the hemispherical dome,

655
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:29.830
the light streaming through a,
you're in,

656
00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:34.840
this is totally new interior world that has no precedent in early Roman

657
00:41:35.241 --> 00:41:39.440
architecture.
And that had a huge impact on later Byzantine architecture,

658
00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:42.830
medieval,
especially Byzantine architecture.
And particularly go to Istan,

659
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:45.380
Valencia,
Aya,
Sophia or the blue mosque.

660
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:50.360
They owe everything to the dome of the Pantheon.
So we see this final,

661
00:41:50.361 --> 00:41:51.980
this real transition here,

662
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:57.020
a transition also in building materials from stone to concrete construction.

663
00:41:57.350 --> 00:41:59.990
A few more views of this,
um,

664
00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:04.580
of the interior of the dome,
the Dome of the Pantheon.

665
00:42:04.581 --> 00:42:08.380
These are very dramatic in black and white.
Uh,
and you can see it's,

666
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:12.680
it's just if you're in Rome and half the time it's great deal of fun to go and

667
00:42:12.681 --> 00:42:16.190
look at the Pantheon at different times of day because the light has such an

668
00:42:16.191 --> 00:42:20.870
impact on what the interior looks like.
You know,
go,
go in there in the morning,

669
00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:25.790
take a look,
then go out of a long lunch,
glass of wine,
come back later and see,

670
00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.940
see what has happened.
And it's also fun to be there when it rains.

671
00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.570
It's interesting.
Does have the rain come down and collect?

672
00:42:32.571 --> 00:42:35.300
There is a drain but it doesn't always work all that well.

673
00:42:35.301 --> 00:42:40.301
So I see water collecting on the edges of the floor in this extraordinary

674
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:44.180
building.
A one last view.

675
00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:48.650
I love taking views of the,
I mean I take Xyz Zillions of images that I've taken,

676
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:53.780
including this one of the interior of the Pantheon at all different times of

677
00:42:53.781 --> 00:42:58.340
day.
But I think it behooves us to notice and to say that,
uh,
in,

678
00:42:58.341 --> 00:43:00.920
in this kind of new interior architecture,

679
00:43:00.921 --> 00:43:05.810
this architecture of interiors surprise,
uh,
it's not only the vault itself,

680
00:43:05.811 --> 00:43:10.811
it's not only the concrete construction or the marble revetment light plays a

681
00:43:11.061 --> 00:43:15.260
very important role and we've seen light playing a very important role from the

682
00:43:15.261 --> 00:43:19.140
times of the,
uh,
the domains of the dome.
Is he tall Laika,
uh,

683
00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:22.310
up through and the sanctuary at terror Cina for example,

684
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:26.300
up to where we are today,
but never more important than here.

685
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.500
Light that streams through the oculus light that is used not only to aluminate

686
00:43:30.501 --> 00:43:35.030
this building and illuminated extremely well,
but also to create drama,

687
00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:39.770
to create drama.
And you have to imagine it even more dramatic when they,

688
00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:42.450
when the coppers were gilded.
Uh,

689
00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:47.350
and when the marble down below may have been even brighter still.
Uh,

690
00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.670
the marble pavement by the way,
which I didn't show you,

691
00:43:49.671 --> 00:43:52.700
is also extremely well preserved.
So this light,

692
00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:57.940
this light plays a very important and dramatic role in this new highly developed

693
00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.070
interior architecture.
And,
uh,

694
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:06.550
I know I personally know of no other building that one can visit and experience

695
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:11.570
that gives you a better sense than this one of the divine presence on earth,

696
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:14.990
whether it's one god,
multi gods.
As we're honored here,

697
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:20.090
you really get a sense of spirituality when you stand in this extraordinary,

698
00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:23.840
uh,
temple and really do get a sense of the divine presence.

699
00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:28.670
I think on earth I mentioned that the Pantheon has,

700
00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:33.700
has spawned lots of you has lots of buildings and be cloned from the Pantheon

701
00:44:34.141 --> 00:44:35.190
both in ancient times.

702
00:44:35.191 --> 00:44:37.770
And I'll show you a couple of examples later in the semester,

703
00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:41.370
but also in more modern times.
There are lots of examples.

704
00:44:41.371 --> 00:44:46.020
Woolsey Hall for example,
here on campus is a kind of a pantheon.
Uh,
but,

705
00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:48.180
uh,
look,
look at the most,

706
00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:52.650
the most obvious example in the United States is,
uh,

707
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:57.270
the not only Monte Cello,
but also Thomas Jefferson's University of Virginia,

708
00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.970
the Rotunda at the University of Virginia,

709
00:44:59.971 --> 00:45:04.950
which you see here is clearly based exactly on the Pantheon.
Thomas Jefferson,

710
00:45:04.951 --> 00:45:08.580
a great fan of ancient architecture.
His library,

711
00:45:08.581 --> 00:45:12.600
his personal library has lots of books on Roman architecture,
but I lost,

712
00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:12.811
you know,

713
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:16.860
when you look at a view of the Rotunda and the lawn at the University of

714
00:45:16.861 --> 00:45:20.070
Virginia,
I told my first teaching job was at Uva,
taught there for three years.

715
00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:23.670
Uh,
but,
um,
but,
uh,
when you look at this,

716
00:45:23.671 --> 00:45:28.110
when you look at this building or the lawn at Uva with the Rotunda,

717
00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.970
you can't help but wonder if Thomas Jefferson didn't know,
uh,

718
00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:36.490
that the Pantheon in Rome had that for court because the,
the,

719
00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:40.470
the Rotunda faces that the wrong way faces this way.
But nonetheless,

720
00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:43.810
he's got behind it,
uh,
in,
in his own design,
uh,

721
00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:48.900
this extraordinary rectangular court that does conjure up a exactly what the

722
00:45:48.901 --> 00:45:53.020
pantheon looked like in Rome.
A few very quick,
uh,

723
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:55.740
views of the Pantheon.
I just hate to let it go.
Uh,

724
00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:59.940
but just some quick views of the Pantheon.
Uh,
one of the best ways of seeing it.

725
00:45:59.941 --> 00:46:04.410
It's surrounded by not only a wonderful Piatsa,
which is a great place to eat,

726
00:46:04.411 --> 00:46:08.280
Gelato,
or have a glass of wine.
Uh,
but,
uh,
there are,
you can,

727
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:12.210
you can encounter it from a number of narrow streets and that whole element of

728
00:46:12.211 --> 00:46:15.360
surprise is still there.
You know,
you're walking along the street and wow,

729
00:46:15.361 --> 00:46:18.150
all of a sudden there it is in front of you.

730
00:46:18.151 --> 00:46:21.870
And you can see that very well here as you begin to get a glimpse of it with

731
00:46:21.871 --> 00:46:24.000
regard to eating around the Pantheon.

732
00:46:24.001 --> 00:46:27.000
I recommend one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Rome,

733
00:46:27.001 --> 00:46:31.620
which is a easy to remember because it's for,
to,
not to all pantheon.

734
00:46:31.621 --> 00:46:33.370
You see it over here with its,
um,

735
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:38.670
wonderful outdoor space and it's white,
uh,
White,
um,

736
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:42.480
umbrella's,
uh,
right across from the Pantheon,

737
00:46:42.481 --> 00:46:45.630
directly across is a Mcdonald's.
Uh,
I never,
you know,

738
00:46:45.631 --> 00:46:48.990
the Golden Arches are really very much like a Roman aqueduct,
don't you think?

739
00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:52.800
So references the,
I told you there were residences everywhere of Rome.

740
00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:55.290
Don't eat it.
You know,
you can eat a McDonald's anytime.

741
00:46:55.291 --> 00:46:59.400
Go to go to the other one.
Um,
much more interesting and it has the best.

742
00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:01.770
I've never had this anywhere else.
It has,
um,

743
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:06.870
a veal Scallopini all Gorgonzola with Gorgonzola,
very thin,

744
00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:09.660
a layer of Gordon's delicious.
Uh,

745
00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:14.690
I also told you I was going to keep you abreast of the latest on Gelato in Rome.

746
00:47:15.301 --> 00:47:19.230
We've talked about trace Collini,
so I just wanted to show you della Della Panna.

747
00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:23.340
If you're standing at the Pantheon restaurant,
look to the right.

748
00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:26.780
You're going to see della Paul Mopey,
AOL and a,

749
00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:29.590
it's a of the four best.
Actually,
I think it's the fourth.

750
00:47:29.591 --> 00:47:31.880
It's not my absolute favorite,
but if you like,

751
00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.770
it's a little bit more Americanized.
As you can see from this selection.

752
00:47:35.771 --> 00:47:39.370
Notice their Mars Bar speechy Ali tar,
uh,

753
00:47:39.371 --> 00:47:41.260
as well as some of their other flavors.

754
00:47:41.261 --> 00:47:44.800
My favorite personal favorite is up by owning,
which you see over here.

755
00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:49.660
But just to whet your appetite early in the morning,
I want to move in the,

756
00:47:49.661 --> 00:47:53.260
in the,
um,
20 minutes or so that remain,

757
00:47:53.261 --> 00:47:58.261
I would like to move from the Pantheon in Rome to Hadrian's home,

758
00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:00.700
not as home in Rome,
which is,

759
00:48:00.701 --> 00:48:05.701
we've mentioned was the palace of demission on the Palatine Hill,

760
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:12.330
but his Rome activity is his villa at Tivoli Tivoli,

761
00:48:12.581 --> 00:48:16.300
ancient Tibor.
We've talked about Tivoli many times before where the marble,

762
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:19.000
the travertine quarries are located.

763
00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:22.240
Tivoli Tivoli is about of a,
I dunno,

764
00:48:22.241 --> 00:48:27.190
40 minute drive from Rome today,
kind of high speed drive from Rome today.

765
00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:31.060
Uh,
but in antiquity longer obviously,

766
00:48:31.061 --> 00:48:34.270
but not inaccessible from Rome.
It was Hadrian.

767
00:48:34.271 --> 00:48:37.600
Obviously you had no problems getting there in ancient Roman times.

768
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:41.390
It's an extraordinary place.
Uh,
and Hadrian it was a,

769
00:48:41.391 --> 00:48:45.100
it was a place that Hadrian used as a kind of incubator for his architectural

770
00:48:45.101 --> 00:48:48.520
ideas.
And it's highly likely that many of the,
of the,

771
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:52.330
of the buildings that we see there were designed in part by him,

772
00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.670
especially those famous pumpkin dumps.

773
00:48:54.671 --> 00:48:58.240
Cause we're gonna see that a number of these buildings do indeed have pumpkin

774
00:48:58.241 --> 00:49:02.290
domes designed under the influence of the architecture of rebellious.

775
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:06.910
It's an amazing below it is the most extensive villa preserved from the Roman

776
00:49:06.911 --> 00:49:10.630
world and likely the most grand of all the Roman villas.

777
00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.960
And if we think back to Nero's palace in Rome,

778
00:49:13.961 --> 00:49:17.860
what made Nero's palace in Rome so scandalous,
uh,

779
00:49:17.861 --> 00:49:21.070
was the fact that it was located in downtown Rome.
Uh,

780
00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.640
but if you compare Nero's palace,
uh,
to,

781
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:28.730
to Hadrian's villa activity,

782
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:30.760
there's no comparison between the two.

783
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:33.880
Hadrian's villa activity is much more extensive.

784
00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:38.860
It has a much more extraordinary buildings from the architectural standpoint.
Uh,

785
00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:43.690
and it was decorated even more opulently with a wide variety of sculpture,

786
00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:48.400
mosaics and paintings.
It was clearly an extraordinary place.
And if,

787
00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.230
if Trajan is forum,

788
00:49:50.231 --> 00:49:55.150
was in a sense a microcosm of the extent of the empire under Trajan,

789
00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:58.720
I like to think of Hadrian's villa,
uh,
as,
uh,

790
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:00.730
the empire under Hadrian,

791
00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:03.820
the empire that he traveled around so many times.

792
00:50:03.821 --> 00:50:07.480
And I show you in the upper right,
a map of the Roman empire,

793
00:50:07.481 --> 00:50:12.190
all of that orange area is the area that was under Rome's Egis,
uh,

794
00:50:12.191 --> 00:50:16.660
at the time of Trajan and into the years of Hadrian.
And if you look closely,

795
00:50:16.661 --> 00:50:20.770
you will see three colored lines,
a yellow,
a blue,
and a red line.

796
00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:24.220
Those are Hadrian's travels around the empire.

797
00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:28.010
And it shows you how extensive they were.
He went everywhere.
Why?

798
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.660
Because he loved to travel.
He just loved to travel.
Uh,

799
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:36.730
but he also went in order to take a look at a provincial affairs at firsthand.

800
00:50:37.671 --> 00:50:39.110
Now,
everywhere he went,

801
00:50:39.111 --> 00:50:44.111
he either he himself paid for buildings that were erected or more often than

802
00:50:44.451 --> 00:50:48.370
that,
buildings were put up by local,
uh,

803
00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:52.190
local magistrates and so on.
Local cities,
uh,

804
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:54.520
in honor of Hadrian.
Uh,

805
00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:59.180
in order to try to get a favor out of him or just to honor him on his visit.

806
00:50:59.181 --> 00:51:00.560
Some of these were rushed,
you know,

807
00:51:00.561 --> 00:51:05.561
put up in a rush job in order to be there when he arrived on the scene.

808
00:51:05.601 --> 00:51:09.920
So we see this incredible array of building activity,
uh,

809
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:13.810
during this period,
and we will see that reflected as we make our way.
Um,

810
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:18.230
beginning already next week,
wake our way into the provinces.

811
00:51:18.231 --> 00:51:20.450
We will begin to see some very interesting,

812
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:25.660
hey adrianic buildings in those provinces that reflect what he was doing

813
00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:30.440
elsewhere or in Rome.
But what we see here,

814
00:51:30.441 --> 00:51:33.650
what we see at the villa is fascinating because all of us were just back from

815
00:51:33.651 --> 00:51:35.240
break.
Some of you did some traveling.

816
00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.720
We know that traveling expands all of our horizons.

817
00:51:38.721 --> 00:51:43.190
We go someplace experientially were different than we were before by what we see

818
00:51:43.191 --> 00:51:46.360
and what we experience.
And we also,
um,

819
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:49.100
maybe not in this new economic climate,
but at least in the past,

820
00:51:49.101 --> 00:51:51.110
we all tended to pick up souvenirs,
you know,

821
00:51:51.111 --> 00:51:55.640
t shirt here and whatever their handbag there.
Uh,
and,

822
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:59.780
um,
and we bring those back to remind us,

823
00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:04.070
remind us and make us,
you know,
have memories of the wonderful trip that we took.

824
00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:07.130
Well,
Hadrian did that as well.
He collected souvenirs,

825
00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:11.360
but because of his own wealth and because he had the imperial treasury behind

826
00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:15.410
him,
he could,
he could collect buildings as souvenir essentially.

827
00:52:15.411 --> 00:52:18.470
So when Hadrian traveled and saw what he liked,

828
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:22.160
what he did was he came back to this laboratory,

829
00:52:22.161 --> 00:52:27.161
this architectural laboratory that he had at Tivoli a and t either created,

830
00:52:27.951 --> 00:52:31.400
some of these were probably designed by him,
others by his architects.

831
00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:36.680
He created a series of buildings that were in a sense souvenirs of his travels,

832
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:41.710
either exact duplicates of things he saw or variations on those themes.

833
00:52:42.861 --> 00:52:47.750
And it makes these buildings particularly fascinating to look at the,
uh,
the,

834
00:52:47.830 --> 00:52:50.990
the villa of Hadrian was,
uh,
had three,
three,

835
00:52:50.991 --> 00:52:55.090
essentially three building phases and early a middle and a late,
uh,

836
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:58.990
they span the entire,
uh,
attire,
um,

837
00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:01.820
reign of Hadrian.
Uh,
this,

838
00:53:01.821 --> 00:53:05.060
this villa was clearly Hadrian's hobby as well as his home.

839
00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.250
And if he hadn't died in one 38,

840
00:53:07.251 --> 00:53:09.590
he would have undoubtedly continued to build here.

841
00:53:09.591 --> 00:53:13.670
So these buildings go up throughout the course of Hadrian's reign.

842
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:17.450
I show you a view from the air of the villa.
As it looks today,

843
00:53:17.451 --> 00:53:21.980
you can see that there are a series of very attractive pools of water

844
00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:27.210
interspersed with architecture.
Uh,
if look at a plan of the villa,

845
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:31.710
you will see that it is different than any other villa we've seen before in
that,

846
00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:35.910
uh,
these buildings are actually kind of casually,
almost in an ad hoc way,

847
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.940
arranged around nature to interact with nature.

848
00:53:38.941 --> 00:53:43.560
We don't see the axiology and the symmetry that is so characteristic of so much

849
00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:47.700
of Roman architecture.
They kind of meander along as you might expect,

850
00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:52.290
architectural experiments to man to meander.
And it has everything there.

851
00:53:52.291 --> 00:53:53.250
Not only pools,

852
00:53:53.251 --> 00:53:57.250
but a wide variety of buildings that I'm going to show you fairly fleetingly.
Uh,

853
00:53:57.251 --> 00:53:59.850
this great island villa over here,
uh,

854
00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:04.500
the Piatsa Dora Dora or the Golden Plaza,
uh,
the,

855
00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.920
um,
the two sets of baths,
a large bath and a small bowel.

856
00:54:07.921 --> 00:54:09.600
So you also see a stadium here,

857
00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:13.650
hairpin shape that I'm not going to return to the Canopius another pool.

858
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:17.980
This was so complete that it even had its own Haiti's its own hell.
Uh,

859
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.440
in the villa.
Everything was here.
Hadrian left no stone unturned.

860
00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:27.210
I want to show you in fairly quick succession examples of the most interesting

861
00:54:27.211 --> 00:54:28.940
buildings of these,
uh,

862
00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:33.180
tourist souvenirs that Hadrian brings back from his travels.

863
00:54:33.181 --> 00:54:36.900
The first I'd like to show you is the so called Temple of Venus,

864
00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:43.280
which belongs to the latest building phase at the villa one 33 to 138.

865
00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:46.380
This is Hadrian the fill Helene once again,

866
00:54:46.381 --> 00:54:49.140
just as we saw him at the temple of Venus and Roma,

867
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:54.030
he goes to the Greek island of [inaudible],
k n I d o s,

868
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:58.260
the Greek island of tonight us on which there was the most famous round temple

869
00:54:58.261 --> 00:55:02.170
of Venus with the most famous Greek statue of Venus.
Uh,

870
00:55:02.171 --> 00:55:05.670
a statue by the great Greek sculptor Prac siddeleys.

871
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:10.690
Lots of people went to see it.
And interestingly enough,
it was this,
uh,
this,
uh,

872
00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.930
temple and the statue,

873
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:18.110
a excavated in a number of decades ago by a woman wrote female archeologist with

874
00:55:18.451 --> 00:55:22.050
the perfect name Iris love for the goddess of land.
That was really her name,

875
00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:26.280
destined to go excavate.
Uh,
the,
uh,
the,
uh,

876
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:30.860
temple of the goddess of love on the Greek island of [inaudible].

877
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:35.790
Hadrian goes there.
He's enraptured by what he sees.
He bills at his villa,

878
00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:40.820
an exact replica and exact replica of this Greek round temple.

879
00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:43.470
Uh,
you can see it's the doric order.

880
00:55:43.471 --> 00:55:47.860
You can see it supports triglycerides and met apiece.
And then in the center,
uh,

881
00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:51.840
a statue of Venus,
unfortunately now headless and RM lists,

882
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:55.890
that's a cast.
The original is in the museum on the site.

883
00:55:55.891 --> 00:55:59.460
You see it in the museum on the site over here,
uh,

884
00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:04.260
based on practice siddeleys earlier,
uh,
uh,
statue.

885
00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:07.610
There are lots of copies of this famous praxis telian statute.

886
00:56:07.611 --> 00:56:10.830
We see another one here in the Vatican.
Uh,
that's more complete,

887
00:56:10.831 --> 00:56:13.140
gives you a better sense of what it looked like.
But again,

888
00:56:13.141 --> 00:56:15.770
here are the door at columns and the triglyceride metaphase.

889
00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:17.610
So the most important point for you,

890
00:56:17.611 --> 00:56:20.850
an exact replica in this particular case,

891
00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:26.050
the most extraordinary of these,
uh,
sort of architectural conceits,

892
00:56:26.051 --> 00:56:26.950
these giant,

893
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:31.600
a tourist souvenirs that Hadrian brings back from his travels to his villa

894
00:56:31.601 --> 00:56:35.890
activity is the so called Canopius add Hadrian's villa.

895
00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:39.310
My personal favorite,
the CANopen Canopius at Hadrian's villa,

896
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:41.260
which you see on your monument list,

897
00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:46.290
also dating to the latest period one 33 to 138 a d it is meant to conjure up in

898
00:56:50.171 --> 00:56:53.740
this case,
not Greece,
but Egypt,
uh,
a canal,

899
00:56:53.741 --> 00:56:58.060
the canal opus in Egypt.
That was a tributary of the Nile.
Uh,

900
00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:03.120
and we know that you could travel from Alexandria to a small town called

901
00:57:03.621 --> 00:57:06.130
Canopius by means of this canal.

902
00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:08.800
And that is what is meant to be conjured up here.

903
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:14.190
The city of CANopen had in it a temple to the Egyptian gods.

904
00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:19.060
Cerasis,
s e r a p I s arap is who was the healing God.

905
00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:23.980
And people came from all around the world to be healed at the temple of

906
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.823
[inaudible].

907
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:29.830
It was also well known as a place with a wonderful amusement park.

908
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:34.190
Uh,
and we think that all hell though Hadrian seems to have gone there,
uh,

909
00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:39.240
in part to go to the sanctuary of syrup as he also appears to have gone there

910
00:57:39.610 --> 00:57:41.920
because it was also an amusement park.

911
00:57:41.921 --> 00:57:45.880
And this is where we get into the personal love triangle of Hadrian.

912
00:57:45.881 --> 00:57:50.740
Hadrian was married to a woman by the name of Sabina,
a very beautiful woman,

913
00:57:50.741 --> 00:57:53.040
but you've does look kind of Dour,
uh,

914
00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:55.720
in this portrait on the right hand side of the screen.

915
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:59.680
So perhaps we don't blame him for taking up with what must have been the most

916
00:57:59.681 --> 00:58:01.900
beautiful boy and all of antiquity.

917
00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:06.670
A youth by the name of Ann [inaudible],
a n t,
I n o,

918
00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:11.700
u s and Tinto is whom Hadrian met on his travels in Asia minor smitten with the

919
00:58:13.661 --> 00:58:18.370
boy.
Uh,
and they became constant companions thereafter.

920
00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:22.360
Uh,
but unfortunately antenna was while still very young,

921
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:24.700
died by drowning where else?

922
00:58:24.701 --> 00:58:29.260
But the Nile in Egypt also on these travels,
they went to Canopius together,

923
00:58:29.261 --> 00:58:31.840
by the way,
to the amusement park.
Uh,

924
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:35.080
but poor antenna was died by drowning in the Nile.

925
00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:38.410
No one knows exactly what happened.
Was it an accident?

926
00:58:38.411 --> 00:58:42.670
Some say that he may have given his life to save Hadrian's we don't really know.

927
00:58:42.671 --> 00:58:46.690
That's never been sorted out as to exactly what happened to this love this,

928
00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:49.970
this wonderful and beautiful young man.
Um,

929
00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:51.940
but he died by drowning in the Nile,

930
00:58:51.941 --> 00:58:54.940
which made the Nile a particularly poignant spot,
uh,

931
00:58:55.130 --> 00:59:00.040
for Hadrian who appears to have recreated it here at his villa.

932
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:01.990
He also went on to found,

933
00:59:01.991 --> 00:59:05.860
this is one of the reasons this has inspired so many design your own Roman

934
00:59:05.861 --> 00:59:06.521
cities project.

935
00:59:06.521 --> 00:59:10.570
Not only the relationship between Hadrian and antenna was and this love triangle

936
00:59:10.571 --> 00:59:11.680
with Sabina.
Uh,

937
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:16.710
but also because Hadrian went around the empire and founded one Antonopoulos

938
00:59:17.051 --> 00:59:18.940
after another.
There were tons of,
and,

939
00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:24.150
and to Novelis is all Rome and he put up statues of antenna was in every

940
00:59:24.171 --> 00:59:26.420
possible guys have every possible God,

941
00:59:26.421 --> 00:59:31.421
the major Roman gods and some of and and all the minor Roman gods as well.

942
00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:34.370
And there are lots of statues of aunt and it was,

943
00:59:34.371 --> 00:59:37.650
this is another one that was founded,
the villa not at this pool,
although,

944
00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:40.820
although it might have been given that the inspiration was Egypt.
Uh,

945
00:59:40.850 --> 00:59:45.410
this shows him an Egyptian guys with the Egyptian headdress,
uh,
and uh,

946
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:48.230
covered covering all that wonderful curly hair,
uh,

947
00:59:48.231 --> 00:59:50.840
for which he was so well known.
But nonetheless,

948
00:59:50.841 --> 00:59:55.841
antenna was as a pharaoh from Hadrian's villa back to the Canopius.

949
00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:59.480
You see the pool,
you see it has columns on one side.

950
00:59:59.750 --> 01:00:03.050
These columns are had a sculpture interspersed in here.

951
01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:06.470
Grease comes back to the fore because many of these statutes here,

952
01:00:06.471 --> 01:00:09.410
we're also based on ancient Greek prototypes.

953
01:00:09.411 --> 01:00:12.560
So we see this interesting.
Um,

954
01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.540
eclecticism here.

955
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:17.990
I pool based on Egypt with some Egyptianize and statuary,

956
01:00:17.991 --> 01:00:22.550
but also interspersed with Greek statues based on famous Greek prototypes.

957
01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:25.460
Most important to us from the architectural standpoint,

958
01:00:25.461 --> 01:00:29.780
the straight lentil and the RQ weighted lintel used here for the Canopius.

959
01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.450
We saw that in second style Roman wall painting.

960
01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:35.210
We're beginning to see it now in built architecture,

961
01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:38.930
it becomes a particular favorite of Hadrian's and we're going to see it

962
01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:42.550
elsewhere in the Roman provinces under Hadrian,
uh,

963
01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:46.760
the influence again of Egypt and also in this case also of Rome to river gods

964
01:00:46.761 --> 01:00:48.830
that seemed to have decorated the Canopius.

965
01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:52.740
This one leaning on a figure of a sphinx.

966
01:00:52.741 --> 01:00:56.930
So this is clearly the Nile River,
this one leaning on the,

967
01:00:56.931 --> 01:01:01.460
she will suckling Romulus and Remus clearly the Tiber.
So once again,

968
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:03.860
very eclectic sculptural program,

969
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:08.740
the [inaudible] where they are to lining one side of the pool of the Canopius.

970
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:11.330
You see them over here now in the museum,

971
01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:16.160
extremely well preserved based on the original fifth century BC,

972
01:01:16.161 --> 01:01:17.930
Karrie audits on the Acropolis.

973
01:01:17.931 --> 01:01:21.470
So Hadrian's spill hallel Leninism coming to the fore again,

974
01:01:21.471 --> 01:01:25.910
you remember Augustus copied the same car,
he audits for his form reduced scale.

975
01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:30.680
Hadrian's are in full length,
full scale,
same scale as those in Greece.

976
01:01:30.681 --> 01:01:34.940
And the major difference between Hadrian's Karrie audits and Augustus's Augustus

977
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:39.970
is like the Eric theone with the original porch of the maidens in is in a public

978
01:01:40.161 --> 01:01:41.840
building.
In the case of Hadrian,

979
01:01:41.841 --> 01:01:46.841
a private villa using these curry audits at a private villa here you see them

980
01:01:47.031 --> 01:01:51.470
lining one side of the Canopius flanked on either side by Seders,

981
01:01:51.471 --> 01:01:54.800
the same kinds of fellows we saw and the Dionysiac mystery paintings.

982
01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.380
And then just so that we don't forget Egypt,
uh,

983
01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.190
this wonderful representation of a statue of a,
of a crocodile,
uh,

984
01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:06.710
that was surely placed in the center of the pool peeping out of the water just

985
01:02:06.711 --> 01:02:09.860
so that we make sure we remember it's the Nile.
Uh,

986
01:02:09.861 --> 01:02:12.640
and I can trace my whole professional career.

987
01:02:12.641 --> 01:02:16.370
I'm sitting on this crocodile because every time I'm there,

988
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:19.280
including even now I post on that crocodile,

989
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.150
but I do it in part because I think it's fun.
Uh,

990
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.170
but also big to encourage there.

991
01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:28.980
There are two pictures that are really like students to send me when they travel

992
01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:29.671
to Italy.

993
01:02:29.671 --> 01:02:33.540
One is have them sitting on the crocodile at Hadrian's villa and another is them

994
01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:37.620
on the stepping stones at palm pay.
So I hope if you do go that you will do that.

995
01:02:37.621 --> 01:02:41.870
My favorite one and I can't find it unfortunate cause this is pre digital was a

996
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.090
student who sent me himself on this with his shades on,

997
01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.360
but then he had put a cigarette in the mouth of the crocodile unlit cigarette

998
01:02:50.581 --> 01:02:55.050
and then it was really a cool picture.
I've got to find that someday.
Uh,
the uh,

999
01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:59.730
plan of the Canopius over here shows us what we've looked at.

1000
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.800
The straight and RQ weighted lintel here,
the crocodile on this side,

1001
01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:09.820
the chorionic,
it's on that side.
And then over here at the end,
uh,

1002
01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:14.900
the temple of Cerasis because they were trying to recreate again this canal that

1003
01:03:15.721 --> 01:03:19.890
led from Alexandria to Canopius.

1004
01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.180
And at the end of course,

1005
01:03:21.181 --> 01:03:24.960
the temple of Syrup is the healing God that was located at Canopius.

1006
01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:28.560
But you can see as well as I by looking at the plan,
uh,

1007
01:03:28.561 --> 01:03:30.930
this curved structure over here,

1008
01:03:30.931 --> 01:03:34.470
which we'll see is made out of concrete that this is no Egyptian building.

1009
01:03:34.471 --> 01:03:37.650
This is a very modern,
uh,
Roman looking building.

1010
01:03:37.651 --> 01:03:40.530
And I show it to you here on the end of the canal.

1011
01:03:40.531 --> 01:03:44.730
This is called the so called Sarah pm or the temple of Syrup is,

1012
01:03:44.731 --> 01:03:48.090
and you can see it has one of Hadrian's pumpkin domes.

1013
01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:53.070
It is very likely that it was designed by,
by,
by him,
by Hadrian,

1014
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:54.930
and we see it made out of concrete.

1015
01:03:54.931 --> 01:03:58.830
We can see it has niches that actually served as a fountain with very deep

1016
01:03:58.831 --> 01:04:01.950
niches from which there would have emanated a water display.

1017
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:07.250
And then you can see a concrete dome up above with those segmented flat and

1018
01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:13.041
concave alternating flattened concave segments that look like a gourd or a

1019
01:04:13.681 --> 01:04:16.920
pumpkin dome probably designed by Hadrian himself.

1020
01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:19.920
Here's a closer view showing you the same

1021
01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:26.400
bats there.
Two baths at Hadrian's villa,
uh,
one of them,
um,

1022
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:30.210
I show you the only,
the large beds here up Hadrian's villa,

1023
01:04:30.211 --> 01:04:34.470
which dates to the early phase of one 25 to one 33.

1024
01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:37.440
I'm not going to say too much about these,
I'm not going to show you the plan,

1025
01:04:37.441 --> 01:04:41.850
but just to make the point that the villa has not one but two baths and they are

1026
01:04:41.851 --> 01:04:44.100
Gargantuan.
Look at the size of this.

1027
01:04:44.101 --> 01:04:47.250
Look at the tourists here in relationship to the so called large bets.

1028
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.160
This is a private bathing establishment,

1029
01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:54.330
but it shows you that Hadrian has learned well from Trajan.

1030
01:04:54.331 --> 01:04:57.180
This is if Fraijanes forum was the mother of all forums.

1031
01:04:57.181 --> 01:05:02.040
This is the mother of all private bath buildings that we see at a Hadrian's

1032
01:05:02.041 --> 01:05:02.550
villa.

1033
01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:07.260
And we also see the expert way in which these architects use concrete

1034
01:05:07.261 --> 01:05:08.970
construction.
It's extraordinary.

1035
01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:13.971
Look at these vaults vaults that are springing just as they did in Hadrian's

1036
01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:17.200
market hall,
uh,
in the markets in Rome,

1037
01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:21.530
springing from a groin bolts and spring from a bracket,
uh,

1038
01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:24.790
rather than from a column or a Pilaster and look at the way in which they've

1039
01:05:24.791 --> 01:05:29.740
been able to open up this wall.
D materialize the wall with very large windows,

1040
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:33.160
very sophisticated use of concrete construction here,

1041
01:05:33.161 --> 01:05:38.161
a detail of the groin vaults springing from the bracket with the stucco

1042
01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:42.220
decoration that you can also see very quickly.

1043
01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:45.340
I also want to show you,
um,
the,
uh,

1044
01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:49.060
the so called Piatsa Doro or the Golden Plaza,

1045
01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:54.360
which dates also to the early phase of the villa of Hadrian activity one 25 to

1046
01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:55.900
one 33.

1047
01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:00.570
You can see just by looking at its plan that it's interesting.
It was used as a,

1048
01:06:00.571 --> 01:06:05.180
an audience hall when Hadrian greeted important visitors at the villa.
Uh,

1049
01:06:05.181 --> 01:06:07.180
if you look at the entrance vestibule,

1050
01:06:07.181 --> 01:06:11.550
it's octagonal just like the octagonal room of rebellious,
uh,

1051
01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:14.890
with a pumpkin vault.
Then a great open rectangular space,

1052
01:06:14.891 --> 01:06:18.370
fairly traditional surrounded by columns.
And then over here,

1053
01:06:18.371 --> 01:06:22.300
the audience hall or our law Aula itself,
this is,

1054
01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:24.100
this is an amazing structure.

1055
01:06:24.101 --> 01:06:28.480
And what makes the Owlet particularly interesting and important is like the

1056
01:06:28.481 --> 01:06:32.380
Pantheon.
It combines traditional and innovative architecture.

1057
01:06:32.381 --> 01:06:36.550
It combines concrete construction with traditional vocabulary of Greek

1058
01:06:36.551 --> 01:06:41.380
architecture,
namely columns.
There is an annual or vault over here.

1059
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:46.240
Uh,
you can see that the walls of the structure undulate but this undulation is

1060
01:06:46.241 --> 01:06:51.100
particularly interesting because the walls are not made out of concrete.

1061
01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:56.120
Uh,
we'll see that the walls are made out of columns here.
I show you,
uh,

1062
01:06:56.220 --> 01:07:01.220
a cutaway axonometric view of the hour law where you can see these undulating

1063
01:07:01.571 --> 01:07:03.820
walls making a kind of cruciform shape,

1064
01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.720
but you can see that they are supported by columns.
So again,

1065
01:07:07.721 --> 01:07:12.670
this fascinating a bringing together of the traditional vocabulary of Greek

1066
01:07:12.671 --> 01:07:13.331
architecture,

1067
01:07:13.331 --> 01:07:18.331
namely columns with a concrete pumpkin dome on top use of innovative,

1068
01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:23.080
uh,
of the traditional vocabulary of architecture and an innovative way.

1069
01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:27.250
One might even call this an example of the so called Baroque trend in Roman

1070
01:07:27.251 --> 01:07:29.980
antiquity,
which we'll be talking about increasingly.

1071
01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:34.750
And I want you to be aware that you had that it happens here just very quickly.

1072
01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:39.751
The very sculptural vestibule entranceway so inspired by [inaudible] of the

1073
01:07:39.791 --> 01:07:44.770
Piazza,
Doro showing this concrete construction with a pumpkin dome,

1074
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:45.280
uh,

1075
01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:50.280
and then a detail of some of the columns along that undulating that curve or

1076
01:07:50.951 --> 01:07:54.220
undulating wall that are still preserved in the outlet.

1077
01:07:55.750 --> 01:08:00.080
I,
I want to show you also lastly at Hadrian's villa,

1078
01:08:00.290 --> 01:08:04.270
the so called a tro tro Marie Timo,
the maritime theater,

1079
01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:09.190
which dates to the very earliest of the phases,
one 18 to one 28.

1080
01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.910
This was the building I hydrea and started with this first because this is what

1081
01:08:12.911 --> 01:08:16.130
he wanted most of all,
which was an island villa within a villa,

1082
01:08:16.131 --> 01:08:19.310
a place where he could really go if you wanted to be alone,

1083
01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:23.090
even at his own villain.
One can imagine him escaping here,
uh,

1084
01:08:23.210 --> 01:08:28.100
with an antenna was by his side.
Uh,
we see that island villa here.

1085
01:08:28.101 --> 01:08:31.520
It's a round structure,
uh,
in order to protect himself.

1086
01:08:31.521 --> 01:08:33.350
Once he crossed the drawbridge,

1087
01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.330
he has placed a moat around the,
uh,

1088
01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:39.800
around the island villa within a villa.

1089
01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.840
But if you look at the plan of that island villa,

1090
01:08:41.841 --> 01:08:45.360
you would think that Roberto was,
was still alive.
You know,
in the sense of that,

1091
01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:49.640
that compass work that we saw Burberry is doing in the private wing of the
Domus.

1092
01:08:49.641 --> 01:08:53.350
Al was down a playing off,
convex against concave.
Uh,

1093
01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.260
but the difference between this and what [inaudible] did is this combines in

1094
01:08:57.261 --> 01:08:58.880
this very exciting way,

1095
01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:04.220
concrete walls with a and concrete domes with columns.

1096
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:07.100
We see that same combination here.

1097
01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.440
Here's a view of what the island within the,
uh,

1098
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:12.470
the [inaudible] Marie Timo looks like today.

1099
01:09:12.471 --> 01:09:15.020
Here's the island surrounded by the moat.

1100
01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:18.560
And you can see this wonderful combination of brick,
face,

1101
01:09:18.561 --> 01:09:22.010
concrete construction with columns.
But if you look at the columns,

1102
01:09:22.011 --> 01:09:27.011
you will see that they follow the curvature of the foundation of the wall.

1103
01:09:27.231 --> 01:09:31.370
So this again,
combination of traditional and innovative architecture,

1104
01:09:31.371 --> 01:09:36.080
another view of the mode of a colonnade with ionic capitals that surrounds the

1105
01:09:36.081 --> 01:09:40.810
hall.
And then another view of the island part,
uh,

1106
01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:45.970
with this wonderful interaction of columnar and concrete architecture.

1107
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:51.100
Lastly,
I just want to show you the,
uh,

1108
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:54.780
tomb of Hadrian and make a very few points about it.

1109
01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:58.280
The tomb of Hadrian,
the famous Maza Liam of Hadrian,

1110
01:09:58.281 --> 01:10:00.890
better known as the [inaudible] Angelo in Rome,

1111
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:04.000
was put up at the end of Hadrian's reign,
uh,

1112
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:09.070
between one 35 and his death in one 38 and consecrated by his successor Antonius

1113
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.060
Pius.

1114
01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:14.960
It is located in the part of Rome that we have not explored thus far because

1115
01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:18.470
very few ancient buildings survive from that part of the city.

1116
01:10:18.471 --> 01:10:23.240
We are looking at an excellent Google earth view of the Tiber river.

1117
01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:27.620
You will notice,
uh,
the,
uh,
Piazza Navona over here,

1118
01:10:27.621 --> 01:10:31.730
the great stadium over here,
and we should be able to see the Pantheon,

1119
01:10:31.731 --> 01:10:35.180
but it may be cut off as is,
uh,
the,
um,

1120
01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:39.920
in this view as is the tomb of,
of Augustus,

1121
01:10:39.921 --> 01:10:42.020
which is located over here.
But we can see,

1122
01:10:42.021 --> 01:10:47.021
well the [inaudible] Angelo of Hadrian's Mazda Liam fronted by a bridge over the

1123
01:10:49.761 --> 01:10:53.660
Tiber and that's the Vatican II Vatican City upright above.

1124
01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:58.220
So Hadrian chose a location across the Tiber where there were some imperial

1125
01:10:58.221 --> 01:10:59.720
gardens for his tomb.

1126
01:10:59.721 --> 01:11:04.721
Here you can better see also Google earth of view of the castle son Angelo as it

1127
01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:05.570
looks today.

1128
01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:10.430
The walls and the watch towers were added later because this served as a

1129
01:11:10.431 --> 01:11:13.890
fortress for the pope's,
uh,
when the pope in the Vatican,

1130
01:11:13.891 --> 01:11:15.600
the pope's in bad times,

1131
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:20.100
they had an underground passageway that they could scurry from the Vatican two,

1132
01:11:20.101 --> 01:11:22.410
this fortress where they could be protected.

1133
01:11:22.650 --> 01:11:27.180
And that's when the watch towers and so on were added.
As you can see here,

1134
01:11:27.181 --> 01:11:31.340
fronted by a bridge.
This is the famous Pont de San Angelo,
uh,

1135
01:11:31.341 --> 01:11:33.000
designed by Bernini,

1136
01:11:33.001 --> 01:11:37.860
the great 17th century architect Bernini with a series of angels and hear

1137
01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:42.780
another view of the castle son Angela with Bernini's angels on the bridge.

1138
01:11:43.290 --> 01:11:45.720
The most important point for us as you can see,

1139
01:11:45.721 --> 01:11:50.721
that although a tombs round tombs were no longer oh core round in the second

1140
01:11:51.121 --> 01:11:55.140
century,
a d they had gone out of fashion,
remember tightest,

1141
01:11:55.141 --> 01:11:58.050
buried in his arch,
Trajan buried in his column.

1142
01:11:58.050 --> 01:12:02.100
They really weren't doing round tombs at the extent that they had been doing

1143
01:12:02.101 --> 01:12:04.350
earlier.
Hadrian chooses this.
Why?

1144
01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:07.260
Because the Great Mazal Liam of Augustus was around to him.

1145
01:12:07.261 --> 01:12:11.670
He wants to associate himself with Augustus and he wants to create a new tomb

1146
01:12:11.671 --> 01:12:14.190
for a succession of dynasties.

1147
01:12:14.191 --> 01:12:18.540
Nervo was the last to be buried in the mausoleum of Augustus Hadrian,

1148
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:20.130
the first in this Mazal Liam,

1149
01:12:20.131 --> 01:12:24.000
which became be continued to be used in the second century.

1150
01:12:24.001 --> 01:12:29.001
And so it uses the mausoleum of Augustus and the Cecilia Metalla Tomb as models.

1151
01:12:30.841 --> 01:12:35.040
We have seen this model here of the tomb of a,
of Hadrian.
Uh,

1152
01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:40.130
it's round made out of concrete placed as the Cecilia metalla tune was on a

1153
01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:43.410
podium,
a very tall podium,

1154
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:47.700
probably a tool Mulas on top earth into a Mulas like Augustus is to them.

1155
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:50.070
We don't know what happened at the very apex,

1156
01:12:50.071 --> 01:12:54.660
whether there was a statue of Hadrian or a temple like structure as you see

1157
01:12:54.661 --> 01:12:59.430
here.
But the most important point for us is that at the end of his life,

1158
01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.770
Hadrian is,

1159
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:05.310
is continuing to connect himself to Rome's first emperor to Augustus.

1160
01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:07.910
Both of them in perpetuity,
uh,

1161
01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.380
filled Hellenic emperors with Phil Hellenic leanings.

1162
01:13:10.381 --> 01:13:13.230
But in the case of both of them,
and particularly Hadrian,

1163
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:17.280
he combines it with this new concrete architecture in a very special,

1164
01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:22.580
very distinctive way that will have a lasting impact on architecture in the

1165
01:13:23.130 --> 01:13:23.130
Roman Empire.
