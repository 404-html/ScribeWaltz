1
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.393
Good morning.

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.760
Today's lecture is entitled the Prince and the Palace human made divine on the

3
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:14.211
Palatine hill and I want to begin essentially where we left off and that is with

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.260
the emperor Vespasian,

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.380
the founder of the Flavian dynasty and the political shrewdness that Vespasian

6
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.360
demonstrated when he made the decisions that he did when he made the decision,

7
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:35.031
especially to use architecture to further his political agenda.

8
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.020
And you'll recall that the way in which he did that was that he,

9
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:45.021
and I'm just going to show you the site plan once again on the eschalon and

10
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:49.680
Palatine hills,
the site plan that shows us how he did this,

11
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:54.450
how he did this was he recognized that he didn't want to associate himself with

12
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:57.660
neuro,
but it was to his advantage to soap,

13
00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:01.260
to associate himself instead with the emperor Claudius.

14
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.710
And he did that by finishing the platform and indeed the temple itself that we

15
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:13.911
looked at at that time where we looked at last time and that is the temple of

16
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:19.500
the divine Claudius,
the Claudine them that had been begun by Agra [inaudible],

17
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.850
the younger he completed that as a nod to Claudius.
And again,

18
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:26.910
a very smart political move on his part.
He also is,

19
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:30.540
you'll recall raised the Dome is area of neuro to the ground,

20
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.390
covered up what was left of it otherwise,

21
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:35.970
and then he filled in the artificial lake.

22
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.360
I had to use the property that the artificial lake was on to build the coliseum,

23
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.720
which itself was a shrewd gift to the Roman people to gain their favor.
Uh,

24
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.060
and he did succeed in that regard.
Equally important,

25
00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:56.061
perhaps even more important is the decision that Vespasian made in the year 79 a

26
00:01:57.661 --> 00:01:59.670
d and that decision.

27
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:03.390
And we see a portrait once again a Vespasian on the right hand side of the

28
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:05.310
screen.
Now in Copenhagen,

29
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.400
the decision he made in [inaudible] 79 was to a point,

30
00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:12.630
his elder son Titus as coal region.

31
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.280
And we see a portrait of Titus on the lefthand side of the screen and military

32
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:22.230
costume.
Uh,
we see him.
It's a portrait that was found in Herculaneum,

33
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.060
uh,
so that we know it needs to date prior to 79.
Uh,

34
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:30.060
so very likely some time in the 70s,

35
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:32.520
that particular statue was put up.
Now,

36
00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:35.250
the reason it was smart politically to a point,

37
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.580
Titus as his co region was at Titus was extremely capable.

38
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.170
He was also extremely popular in Rome with the people with the Senate.

39
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.130
And,
uh,

40
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.710
what it did was to ensure the succession to ensure the succession.

41
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:57.060
And so when Vespasian died of natural causes in 79,

42
00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:01.210
a d Titus was to take over and indeed,

43
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.800
indeed he did.
And he took over without any contest whatsoever,
which was,

44
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:10.090
it was a great accomplishment.
Titus,
however,
I,
oh,

45
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.570
and Titus by the way,
was young when he became emperor.

46
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:18.180
He was in his early thirties,
about 32 full of energy,
uh,

47
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.930
and he needed it for what lay ahead because he was unlucky.
Uh,
and his,

48
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.793
his,
uh,

49
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.860
his reign was affected by three major events of the first of which,

50
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:31.480
you know,
intimately already.

51
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:36.481
And that is the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 and Titus is reign was 79 to 81.

52
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:39.670
So in 79,

53
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.090
a d a d a Vesuvius erupts and Titus has to deal with the consequences of that

54
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:49.370
covered over,
as you well know,
almost all of campaign.

55
00:03:49.371 --> 00:03:52.150
Yet in the year 80,
uh,

56
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:55.930
he suffered a Rome suffered a very serious plague,

57
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.330
which Titus also had to deal with.

58
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:02.950
You have to marshal all of his energy and all his ingenuity to deal with a very

59
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:07.420
serious plague in row.
It's very serious plague in Rome.
And that plague was,

60
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.490
was followed by a fire,
also an exceedingly serious fire.

61
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:13.100
Uh,

62
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.100
so Titus had his hands Bolen perhaps it's not surprising given all the stress of

63
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:23.221
those years that he too died of natural causes in 81 at a very young age.

64
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.580
But despite what he went through during [inaudible] 79 to 81 Titus Titus,

65
00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:32.650
his claim to fame was something that happened much earlier.

66
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:37.030
And I've mentioned it before and that is something that happened already in the

67
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.190
year.
[inaudible] 70,

68
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.240
and it was in the year [inaudible] 70 that Vespasian sent his elder son to

69
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.300
Jerusalem to Judea to get involved in a major military war.

70
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.860
Uh,
and it was Titus as you'll recall,
who was victorious in the Jewish wars.

71
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.210
And that took place in 78 [inaudible] 78 d and it was extremely important,

72
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:02.310
not only in itself from Rome standpoint,
uh,

73
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.240
but also because it provided legitimacy to the Flavian dynasty.

74
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:09.420
I mentioned that the,
uh,

75
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.320
that when a Roman dynasty came to power in a civil war,

76
00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:18.710
which was the case both for Augustus after the civil war 40,
uh,

77
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.180
the civil war,
that was,
that Rome was plunged into after Caesar's death.
Uh,

78
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.260
and was a case again for Vespasian after the chaos of the year 68 69,

79
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.490
they needed a foreign victory to gain legitimacy.
So for the Flavian Dynasty,

80
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.040
the war,
uh,
over Jerusalem was,

81
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:41.041
gave them that legitimacy and was therefore extremely important in terms of the

82
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:44.710
art and ideology of the Flavian Dynasty.

83
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.480
I want to turn to an arch that was put up in honor of that very victory over

84
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.590
Jerusalem.
Uh,
sometime after Aidy d one,

85
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.560
it was the so called arch of Titus,
the most,

86
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.150
one of the most famous Roman monuments of all,
uh,
and it was put up,

87
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:06.620
although it bears Titus,
his name,

88
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:09.650
it was put up not by him but by his brother mission.

89
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:13.610
His younger brother Domitian who succeeded him after Titus is death,

90
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:17.420
which is why we date it to some time after a d 81,

91
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.770
I want to show you first it's location because that itself is significant.

92
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:26.660
We are looking at the Google Earth view of the Roman forum.

93
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.610
You see the Roman forum here,
you see the Colosseum up at the top center.

94
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.390
Uh,
you see the Capitoline hill or Compa Doleo here,

95
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.570
the victor of Manual Monument Tier pointed these out many times before the via

96
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:46.000
de Fori am periodically of the selenium,
the imperial fora to the left.
Again,

97
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.280
the Roman forum here and the Palatine Hill,

98
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:51.890
which we're going to be concentrating on today.

99
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.050
But you'll remember that Nero's hope was to link the Palatine Hill with the

100
00:06:57.051 --> 00:07:00.980
Escalade inhale,
which is why right up to the left of the coliseum.

101
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.070
And to do that via a spur hill,

102
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.310
a spur hell that's located right here,
a bit above my finger.
Uh,

103
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:13.100
they spur hill called the Veolia B e l I a,
uh,
that was to link the two.

104
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:16.320
And you'll remember Nero's plans for his dome is transitory.

105
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:21.320
This palace that was to serve as a point of transit between those two hills.

106
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:23.020
And you'll recall also,
uh,

107
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.400
the remains of some of the rooms from the domus transitory.

108
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:32.150
So this was again,
land that had been,
that had been built up by Nero.

109
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.870
So it's not surprising to see the flavor ones once again,

110
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:40.160
a Titus following suit and then his younger brother demission following suit to

111
00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:45.161
use land that had earlier been used by Nero for new Flavian monuments.

112
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:46.641
In this case,

113
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:51.641
an arch put up to the victory that Titus celebrated over Jerusalem.

114
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:54.380
And if you look very carefully,
again,
just a bit,

115
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:59.000
a few inches above where my finger is,
you will see,
uh,
the arch of Titus,
uh,

116
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:01.150
standing on that spur hill.

117
00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:05.780
I'm the Veolia between the pallet time and the Escalade hills,

118
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.620
the arch of Titus again,

119
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:14.621
which dates to after [inaudible] 81 was placed right next to the sacred way or

120
00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:19.710
the via Socra.
It doesn't span the street,
but it's placed right next to it,

121
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.200
adjacent to it,
and I think you can see that very well in these two views here,

122
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.550
which also showed that a quite a bit of ancient road actually survives or a

123
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:32.150
piece of ancient Rome wrote actually survives in the Roman forum.

124
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.350
It's on the slope that you see here and you can see the way in which it goes

125
00:08:36.351 --> 00:08:39.980
right by the arch of Titus that you'd see two,
it's right.

126
00:08:39.981 --> 00:08:44.981
This is a view up the hill up the sacred way toward the Veolia and here down

127
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.790
from the arch of Titus down into the rest of the forum.
And again,

128
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:54.791
you can see the polygonal masonry of the ancient road still preserved the

129
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:56.670
ancient way.

130
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:01.670
This the via sock Rowe was the road that the triumphant general took when he

131
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:04.520
returned to Rome after a great military victories.

132
00:09:04.521 --> 00:09:08.430
So this is exactly the road that Titus himself would have taken when he came

133
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:11.290
back from,
from Judea,
uh,
and,

134
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.340
and walked in triumph or road and triumph in his chariot along the sacred way

135
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.990
and up to the capital line hill because the triumphant general,
uh,
who was,

136
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:22.621
who was,
uh,

137
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:27.621
garbed in with the attributes of Jupiter in this procession made his way up to

138
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:31.230
the Capitoline hill would,
would get off his chariot up there,

139
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.260
right at the altar in front of the Temple of Jupiter Omc and make a sacrifice to

140
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.590
Jupiter.

141
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.670
So you have to imagine a Titus doing this along with Vespasian cause you'll

142
00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:45.480
remember I mentioned to you that they celebrated a joint triumph that Titus was

143
00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:49.140
willing to share his triumph with his father.
Vespasian.
Uh,

144
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:53.850
so they both would have come in,
in triumph into Rome after this great victory.

145
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.060
Once again,
you can see the arch in the view on the right,

146
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.550
another view of the our cheer,
which shows it on the Veolia.

147
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:04.530
And here you can get a very good sense of the way in which that spur hill unites

148
00:10:04.531 --> 00:10:09.480
the Palatine and the SQL line as well as the proximity of the arch of Titus to

149
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:10.500
the coliseum.

150
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.260
We are seeing that the Flavian is or building up a certain area of Rome,
uh,

151
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.580
with their monuments.
And this is no exception.

152
00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.940
The view that we see here from the forum of the one side of the arch of Titus

153
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.560
shows a modern inscription,

154
00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:30.120
but we'll see that there is an ancient inscription on the other side and we're

155
00:10:30.121 --> 00:10:34.410
also going to see that although the arch looks very well preserved,

156
00:10:34.411 --> 00:10:39.411
it was actually quite heavily restored by an architect by the name of a Giussep

157
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.800
Bay Bala Da.
And that happened in the 19th century.

158
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:48.801
That ball la Da da La d I e r Giuseppe Viola da restored the arch of Titus.

159
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.110
And the part of the,

160
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:56.140
the arch that is ancient is essentially the central section right here,

161
00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.060
the,
the uh,
mostly on the other side,
actually on this side,

162
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:03.330
just the spandrels and the inner panels here.

163
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.820
And on the other side we'll see.
Well,

164
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.980
I'll show you when we get to the other side.
So this side,

165
00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:10.890
important to know that the inscription is a modern one.

166
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.130
Here's the other side of the arch where you can see again,

167
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.520
the central section is ancient with the spandrels.

168
00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:22.290
These triangular areas here.
Uh,
the columns on this side are ancient.

169
00:11:22.291 --> 00:11:25.500
The keystone is ancient.
The frees up above,
uh,

170
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.520
the keystone is ancient,
the inscription is ancient on this side,

171
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.950
but all the rest was restored by Viola Da.
Uh,

172
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.120
as I said in the 19th century and Viola da did something very interesting and

173
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.430
archeologically very,

174
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:44.060
very forward thinking in that since the center of the arch was made out of Greek

175
00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:48.570
marble pentelic marble,
p,
e,
n,
t,
e,
l,
I,

176
00:11:48.571 --> 00:11:52.320
C pentelic marble from Mt.
Penn Telecon in Greece,

177
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.910
which in itself is interesting because we saw that the Flavian Ian's,

178
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.810
we're using imported marbles in their buildings.

179
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:03.640
I've mentioned that already before.
So we see a continuation of that trend here,

180
00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:07.030
use of pentelic marble for the arch.
Uh,

181
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:11.170
but when Viola da did the restorations,
he or the reconstruction,

182
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:14.700
he used travertine,
uh,
for the modern parts of the arch.

183
00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:17.800
So that when you probably isn't so evident to you from this view,

184
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.630
but when you stand in front of the art,

185
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:21.790
you can see the difference in the materials.

186
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:26.350
And he wanted to point out to the spectator that there was a difference between

187
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:31.330
the ancient part of the monument and the modern part of the monument as restored

188
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.240
by him.
This view on the left,
there are quite a number of,
uh,

189
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:41.370
preserved paintings and engravings that show the arch before the Valar da

190
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.650
reconstruction.
And you see one of those over there.

191
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:48.040
And you can see we're looking at the fame side of the arch here as we are here.

192
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.030
So once again,

193
00:12:49.031 --> 00:12:53.620
you can see the ancient survived of the ancient arch,

194
00:12:53.621 --> 00:12:58.360
the central part,
the two columns on basis,
uh,
the keystone,
the,

195
00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:02.200
the spandrels,
the,
uh,
freeze,
and then the,

196
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.290
and then the inscription.
What does that say?
Great.

197
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:14.530
Okay,
fine.
We'll accept that.
Uh,
so,

198
00:13:14.531 --> 00:13:18.820
and we see that here and this is another one of those Roman monuments that was

199
00:13:18.821 --> 00:13:21.640
essentially preserve because of reuse over time,

200
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:24.220
or at least the part of it that it still exists.

201
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:29.230
And this was turned into as so many other monuments was turned into a fortress

202
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.880
at one point,
a fortress that was owned by the front Japonais family in Italy.

203
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.930
So that's the ancient part,
the rest restored by Viola Da.

204
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:41.060
And you have to also reconstruct and your mind's eye,
uh,

205
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:46.110
that this arch would have served as a kind of statue base for a representation

206
00:13:46.421 --> 00:13:48.580
or for a sculptural group,
uh,

207
00:13:48.581 --> 00:13:53.500
in bronze that would have represented Titus and perhaps this beige and also

208
00:13:53.501 --> 00:13:58.330
together seated did in a chariot being led by four horses.
Uh,
uh,

209
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:03.190
great.
Quadric a group that was customarily placed on the top of such arches.

210
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.150
Below that,
the inscription plaque below that is upper,

211
00:14:06.151 --> 00:14:09.490
already described a freeze.
I'm going to show you that freeze in a moment.

212
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.080
Then the spandrels and then in the center here,
two great panels,

213
00:14:14.081 --> 00:14:17.920
one on either figural panels,
one on either side of the arch.

214
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.690
You see the inscription here,

215
00:14:19.691 --> 00:14:24.100
it's interesting because it tells us that it was the senate and people of Rome,

216
00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:29.101
the Spq are the Senate and people of Rome who put this up to the divine.

217
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.160
Titus DOL,
Tito,
as you can see here.

218
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:38.220
And the divine Titus who was the son is an f for affiliates right over here.

219
00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:43.120
Uh,
the son of the divine Vespasian.
So the divinity of both of these men,

220
00:14:43.121 --> 00:14:46.990
both of whom were made gods at their death is alluded to here.

221
00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:51.010
So the Senate and people of Rome put this up to the divine.
Titus,

222
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.140
the son of the divine Vespasian.

223
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:58.820
And if you can see all of these little holes that are located in some of the

224
00:14:58.821 --> 00:15:03.821
letters or the reason for though those is that those were were bronze letters

225
00:15:04.011 --> 00:15:05.780
were actually attached a,

226
00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.470
so these letters were inscribed and then bronze letters were attached to them.

227
00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:13.110
Uh,
so that the inscription would gleam in the science,
Sean.

228
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.490
And so that you could see it from a considerable distance.

229
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.990
Down below the inscription plaque,
we see the freeze,

230
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:26.350
which purports to represent this great procession of parade that took place when

231
00:15:26.601 --> 00:15:30.100
best buy,
when Titus returned from Jerusalem,
uh,

232
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:35.140
and had his triumphal procession along the sacred way and add up to the Capitol

233
00:15:35.571 --> 00:15:40.150
on Hill and the Temple of Jupiter.
Uh,
and you can see that the artist has,
uh,

234
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:44.030
has made the figures fairly small,
but at the same time has,

235
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.740
has made each one distinct from the other so that this is more readable from the

236
00:15:48.741 --> 00:15:49.574
ground.

237
00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:54.580
And then below that declaration of the keystone and then in either a spandrel or

238
00:15:54.651 --> 00:15:57.140
triangular area at either side of the keystones,

239
00:15:57.141 --> 00:16:01.820
we see victories flying Vic flying female figures of victory that are of course

240
00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:04.120
making reference in a general way,
uh,

241
00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:08.690
to this great victory that that's the tightest had over Jerusalem.

242
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:13.340
Important from the architectural standpoint are the columns and especially the

243
00:16:13.341 --> 00:16:17.990
capitals.
I show you a detail of one of the preserved there too again,

244
00:16:17.991 --> 00:16:22.430
but one of the two preserved capitols from this side of the arch,

245
00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:27.380
the arch that the side that faces the Coliseum and you see it here and it's a

246
00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:30.760
distinctive capital that we have not seen before.
Uh,

247
00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:35.770
it's a capital that actually combines the Corinthian and the ionic because you

248
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:40.800
can see the Corinthian,
a canvas leaves growing up here,
uh,

249
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.710
flowers as we see in the,
in the usual Corinthian order.
And then,
uh,

250
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.100
prominent volumes of the ionic order up above.

251
00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:52.280
We refer to this as the composite capitol,

252
00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:55.760
the composite capitol combining Corinthian and ionic.

253
00:16:55.761 --> 00:16:59.090
We see it quite infrequently in Roman architecture,

254
00:16:59.091 --> 00:17:01.130
but we do see it on occasion.
Uh,

255
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:05.270
so it's good for you to know about in the center of the bay,

256
00:17:05.271 --> 00:17:09.800
I mentioned that there were two break figural panels and these figural panels

257
00:17:09.801 --> 00:17:11.930
make reference to,
uh,

258
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:17.320
to Titus is victory over Jerusalem to this important event from the point of

259
00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:20.840
view of the Flavian that gave their dynasty legitimacy.

260
00:17:20.841 --> 00:17:22.490
And we see one of those here.

261
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:27.620
We actually see an image of Titus in his chariot and he's riding alone without

262
00:17:27.621 --> 00:17:30.770
his father.
Uh,
he's riding alone in his chariot,
uh,

263
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.730
with the exception of a female figure who accompanies him.
Uh,

264
00:17:34.731 --> 00:17:39.230
and you can see that female figure is winging it and she is a personification of

265
00:17:39.231 --> 00:17:43.760
victory.
So she has heralding the victory that he has had in Jerusalem.

266
00:17:43.761 --> 00:17:47.840
And in fact,
she holds a Laurel wreath above his head,
crowning him.

267
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.500
Because of that victory,

268
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:54.540
the chariot is led by four horses who are whizzing by as you can see here,
uh,

269
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:59.541
and they are led at the front by a woman in a helmet and military costume who

270
00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:05.010
might well be Roma,
the personification of Rome herself.
And what is she doing?

271
00:18:05.011 --> 00:18:10.011
She's welcoming Titus back to Rome after his great victory over Jerusalem over

272
00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:16.230
here.
Two other figures,
a two other male figures,
both headless today,

273
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.630
but one of them,
uh,

274
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:22.670
in a toga and the other figure with a bare chest and a mantle rapped over the

275
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:24.060
lower part of his body.

276
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.870
Because we have the same figures in other reliefs.

277
00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:29.790
We know despite the fact that they are headless,

278
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:34.470
that these are personifications of the Senate,
the dressed person,

279
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.640
the person in Toga is the Senate,
the gayness,
GE Nius like genius,

280
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.330
the gain new Sonatas or the spirit of the Senate.
And this,

281
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:45.210
the gain use papillae Romani which was the,

282
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.170
the representative of the Roman people.
So keep in mind,
again,

283
00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:52.030
it was the senate and people of Rome that put up a,

284
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:57.140
the arch to Titus at the son of the divine Vespasian and we see them selves rep

285
00:18:58.151 --> 00:19:01.470
or their personifications represented in this scene.

286
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:03.780
More interesting from our standpoint.

287
00:19:03.781 --> 00:19:08.730
Visa v Architecture is the other scene on the other side of the Central Bay,

288
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:13.590
uh,
where we see the Roman soldiers or a group of Roman soldiers bringing back

289
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:18.330
spoils or booty trophies from Jerusalem,

290
00:19:18.331 --> 00:19:21.900
things that they have stolen from the temple in Jerusalem.

291
00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:26.610
And you can see the famous seven branch candle labrum that they are carrying

292
00:19:26.611 --> 00:19:29.990
here.
The weight is so great that it is,
that they're,
they're,
uh,

293
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.820
shoulders bend under that weight.
Uh,

294
00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:37.821
and we also see them with a table over here that has a number of sacrificial

295
00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:42.480
implements and so on that were taken also from the temple in Jerusalem.

296
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.480
So they carry these along in this parade for the people to see for those

297
00:19:47.641 --> 00:19:48.750
enrollment to see,

298
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:53.940
to get a real palpable sense of what it meant to have this victory and of the

299
00:19:53.941 --> 00:19:55.590
spoils that are being brought back.

300
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.890
And you can see that this is represented very illusionistic Lee.

301
00:19:58.891 --> 00:20:03.891
And you can see that they seem to be a walking through an art that is also

302
00:20:04.291 --> 00:20:09.230
represented here.
A very interesting,
uh,
seen indeed.
And you'll recall,
uh,

303
00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.100
what,
what they did with those spoils.

304
00:20:11.101 --> 00:20:15.660
They took those spoils and they put them in the temple and pockets that we

305
00:20:15.661 --> 00:20:19.290
talked about last time or the forum pockets that we talked about last time that

306
00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:22.400
served essentially as a kind of museum,
uh,

307
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:26.670
where the people of Rome could see these images.
So,
once again,

308
00:20:26.671 --> 00:20:31.220
the Flavian is always showing and affinity for and an interest in,
uh,

309
00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.470
the people of the city,
the people of the city,
uh,

310
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:38.100
that they were trying of course to court favor from.
So we're seeing demission,

311
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.580
uh,

312
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:43.580
who again was the commissioner of this monument continuing on in the same vein

313
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.420
as Vespasian and Titus honoring this victory,
uh,

314
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:50.980
that gave legitimacy to,
uh,
the Flavian Dynasty,

315
00:20:50.981 --> 00:20:55.780
but also always acknowledging and thinking of the impact that it's going to have

316
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.540
on the Senate and the people of Rome,

317
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:03.610
the Central Bay.
If you stand right below it,
uh,
and look up,

318
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.260
you will see the bolt of the interior of the arch.
Uh,

319
00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:12.700
and you can see that it has a coffered ceiling as we've seen so often in Roman

320
00:21:12.701 --> 00:21:16.790
monuments,
quite well preserved with the coppers and then the Rosettes,
uh,

321
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:21.010
in the center.
And if I show you a,
another detail of that,

322
00:21:21.011 --> 00:21:25.990
you'll get an even better sense of it.
And also of how,
or Nate,
the decoration is,

323
00:21:25.991 --> 00:21:29.770
we've talked about the fact that the Flavian has had a particular interest in

324
00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:33.610
very ornate decoration.
And you can see that as well here.
In fact,

325
00:21:33.611 --> 00:21:38.611
the drill has been so used so extensively that it almost d materializes.

326
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:39.970
The bolt,

327
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:44.970
I think in a very interesting way of creating a kind of overall tapestry of dark

328
00:21:45.881 --> 00:21:50.640
and light.
And then in the center,
a panel that is surrounded by a Garland,
uh,

329
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.440
and in the center of that panel,
a depiction,

330
00:21:53.441 --> 00:21:55.420
you can probably barely see it from where you sit,

331
00:21:55.421 --> 00:22:00.421
but a depiction of Titus being carried to heaven on the back of an eagle.

332
00:22:01.111 --> 00:22:04.450
In this case,
Titus is not in military dress,
but in a toga.

333
00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.770
He's on the back of an eagle with outstretched wings and that Eagle is taking

334
00:22:08.771 --> 00:22:13.240
him up to the heavens.
What this is is a representation of apotheosis,

335
00:22:13.241 --> 00:22:16.180
a p,
O,
t,
h,
e,
O,
s,
I,

336
00:22:16.181 --> 00:22:19.300
s apotheosis or divinization,

337
00:22:19.301 --> 00:22:23.230
the divinization because the Romans believed that they could make humans into

338
00:22:23.231 --> 00:22:24.490
God's after their death,

339
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:30.030
the making of Titus into a god after his death and the depiction of the material

340
00:22:30.701 --> 00:22:35.560
depiction of him actually being carried to heaven on the back of an eagle,

341
00:22:35.561 --> 00:22:40.150
a very powerful image.
And the fact that it is in the arc of volt,
uh,
of this,
uh,

342
00:22:40.151 --> 00:22:45.151
of this ball tier has led scholars to suggest that it is possible that the arch

343
00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:51.031
of Titus in Rome served as Tituss tomb and that seems to be corroborated by the

344
00:22:53.891 --> 00:22:58.891
fact that behind the attic or inside the attic of the arch is a staircase as

345
00:22:59.591 --> 00:23:00.730
well as a chamber.

346
00:23:00.731 --> 00:23:04.660
And I show both of them to hear a spiral staircase and a chamber,

347
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.960
a chamber that might well have served as a burial chamber for an earn a of

348
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.400
Titus.
The urn was never fat,
was not found in the excavation of this monument.

349
00:23:15.401 --> 00:23:16.720
So we can't prove this,

350
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:21.990
but I think it's very possible that this arch served as a tomb for the emperor

351
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.943
Titus.

352
00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:30.420
Titus Titus was succeeded as I've already mentioned by his younger brother

353
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:33.790
Domitian,
uh,
whom you see in two portraits here,

354
00:23:33.791 --> 00:23:38.740
portrait from Munich on the left and military garb and then a bust length

355
00:23:38.741 --> 00:23:42.730
portrait in Rome on the right hand side of the screen.

356
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:48.410
Demission was born in [inaudible] 51 so he was only your age,

357
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:53.440
about 19 when Titus went off to the Jewish wars.

358
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.410
Uh,

359
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:58.370
there was never any question that the mission would succeed as brother Vespasian

360
00:23:58.371 --> 00:23:59.720
was in this for the long haul.

361
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:04.070
He created a dynasty and expected both of his sons,
verse Titus,
his older son,

362
00:24:04.071 --> 00:24:06.980
and then his younger son Demission to succeed him.

363
00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:11.400
So dimensions eventual rise to power was never in question.
Uh,

364
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:15.410
and yet demission was jealous of his brother who was very popular in Rome,

365
00:24:15.411 --> 00:24:16.400
as I've already mentioned,

366
00:24:16.401 --> 00:24:21.401
and who had this great military victory on which the Flavian based their claim

367
00:24:21.891 --> 00:24:24.830
to rule and demission was,
was very jealous of his brother.

368
00:24:24.831 --> 00:24:29.450
He felt out of the loop.
And so when he succeeded,
uh,

369
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:33.380
Titus quicker than he thought because Titus died way before his time.

370
00:24:33.381 --> 00:24:36.590
And his thirties is,
you know,
when demission succeeded Titus,

371
00:24:36.591 --> 00:24:41.591
he came to power as a very embittered man and he never got over that bitterness.

372
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:43.551
And in fact,

373
00:24:43.551 --> 00:24:48.551
what we see demission doing is really reverting to the mega Lamont maniacal way

374
00:24:49.791 --> 00:24:54.791
of thinking of people like Caligula and Nero exercising his imperial

375
00:24:55.161 --> 00:24:58.210
prerogatives to the fullest.
And,
uh,

376
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:02.460
in fact even insisting that he be a,
he,

377
00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:07.490
that he be dressed as Lord and God Domino's at Davis,

378
00:25:08.151 --> 00:25:11.040
which I've put on your monument list for you.
Don't miss a day,

379
00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:15.740
is it Lord and God.
Uh,
and he not surprisingly given his bent,

380
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.800
he not surprisingly moved away from the public architecture that Vespasian and

381
00:25:21.321 --> 00:25:25.700
Titus had favorite for best basion of course buildings like the coliseum for

382
00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:27.740
Titus,
the bads of Titus,
uh,

383
00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.820
the public architecture that had been favored by his father and his brother.

384
00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:36.500
He moved back to being interested in building palatial architecture,

385
00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:39.050
essentially,
uh,
to his own glory.

386
00:25:39.051 --> 00:25:43.130
And we're going to see that the major monument that he commissioned was the

387
00:25:43.131 --> 00:25:47.300
imperial palace on the Palatine Hill that had been begun by co,

388
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:52.340
by Tiberius and Caligula.
He completed that palace in the 90s,

389
00:25:52.341 --> 00:25:54.590
a d before we get to that,

390
00:25:54.591 --> 00:25:57.350
which will be our main focus today I would like,

391
00:25:57.351 --> 00:26:01.570
cause it's extensive and there's a lot to see.
I would like to,
um,

392
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
say a few words about another commission of demission because he wasn't without

393
00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:10.670
the desire to at least build some public buildings.

394
00:26:10.671 --> 00:26:13.190
And I'd like to begin with one of those here.

395
00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:18.580
This is a model of the so called stadium of Demission Nice Stadium or race

396
00:26:20.451 --> 00:26:25.010
course,
uh,
that was used,
that was put up during the missions rain.

397
00:26:25.011 --> 00:26:27.730
We date it usually to the latter part of his reign,

398
00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.590
92 to 96 a d.

399
00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.730
And you see that model again here and you can tell a lot about this building,
uh,

400
00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.660
from both the scanty remains,
uh,

401
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:41.000
but also from other,

402
00:26:41.001 --> 00:26:45.150
other evidence that allows us to be able to reconstruct it relatively

403
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.670
accurately.
Uh,
you see it here.

404
00:26:47.671 --> 00:26:50.970
These stadia at were hairpin and shape.

405
00:26:50.971 --> 00:26:55.620
As you can see a straight end on one side,
a curved end on the other,

406
00:26:55.950 --> 00:27:00.480
but long elongated,
a kind of elongated oval with one,

407
00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:02.610
a straight side.
As you can see,

408
00:27:02.611 --> 00:27:07.320
it was put up in very similar fashion to theaters and to amphitheaters in that

409
00:27:07.321 --> 00:27:12.321
they built a concrete a hill and line that concrete hill with stone seats and

410
00:27:14.251 --> 00:27:17.560
then buttressed it with a wall.
As you can see here,
uh,

411
00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:21.360
that was decorated just like the theater of Marcellus or like the coliseum

412
00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:25.890
within this case,
two tiers of arches to two sets of arcades,
uh,

413
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.800
with columns in between them.
Those columns,
again,

414
00:27:28.801 --> 00:27:31.140
having no structural purpose whatsoever,

415
00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:34.530
just used as decoration for the monument.

416
00:27:34.531 --> 00:27:36.450
And then the exits and entrances again,

417
00:27:36.451 --> 00:27:41.451
done very similarly to amphitheater or theater architecture as we've discussed

418
00:27:41.521 --> 00:27:42.120
it thus far.

419
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:46.920
So the main difference is it's not quite as tall as amphitheaters for example,

420
00:27:46.921 --> 00:27:50.910
or theaters.
And just two tiers of columns as you can see here.
Uh,

421
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:51.810
and the main dish,

422
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.140
the main difference in plan is that it's a hairpin shape again,

423
00:27:55.141 --> 00:27:58.830
with one straight side and one curved side,

424
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.820
only a small one can see today.

425
00:28:02.821 --> 00:28:06.180
And this is essentially underground and what survives of it is underground,

426
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.350
although there's one section that can still be seen as I'll show you in a
moment.

427
00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:12.840
But what's absolutely miraculous is the,

428
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:18.050
is the fact that the actual hairpin shape of the stadium of demission is

429
00:28:18.211 --> 00:28:23.211
preserved in its entirety in the shape of one of Rome's most famous Piazza's.

430
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.240
And my favorite by far the Piazza Navona,

431
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.360
which you see from the air here in a Google earth image.

432
00:28:30.361 --> 00:28:34.360
And you can see again the exact shape,
the straight side,
uh,

433
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:39.380
and the curved side of demission stadiums still preserved in the Piazza Navona

434
00:28:42.781 --> 00:28:46.740
in Rome.
Uh,
it's,
it's a wonderful Piatsa for those of you who've been there.

435
00:28:46.741 --> 00:28:50.820
I'm sure you,
you,
you,
you have enjoyed spending time there.

436
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:54.480
For those of you who haven't,
it really is a mecca,
uh,
within Rome.

437
00:28:54.481 --> 00:28:57.880
And you can see not only,
not only is it a pleasant place to walk,
uh,

438
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.230
but also a place to see great buildings.
For example,

439
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:05.970
Francesco Borromini knees on [inaudible] Goanna and Bernini's,

440
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:10.590
a four rivers famous four rivers fountain in the center of the Piazza in

441
00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:12.120
dialogue with one another.

442
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:14.880
And as we look at this from the air and we look at the,

443
00:29:14.881 --> 00:29:18.590
at the curved and of the Piazza Navona,

444
00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:23.520
you can see this one street that you can take out of that curved end when small

445
00:29:23.521 --> 00:29:27.390
street.
If you take a left,
uh,
and then a left again,

446
00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.180
you will see the remains of the stadium of demission.

447
00:29:30.181 --> 00:29:32.010
I'm going to show those to you in a moment.

448
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:35.830
And if you stay in the center of the Piatsa near the four rivers found,

449
00:29:35.831 --> 00:29:38.850
and then you go,
uh,
I sort of diagonally across from that,

450
00:29:38.851 --> 00:29:43.630
you will end up at one of the four best ice cream places in Rome.
It gets,

451
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:46.170
cause you can get some of the best gelato in Roman.

452
00:29:46.171 --> 00:29:50.500
You get good gelato almost anywhere in Rome and in Italy.
But the very best,
uh,

453
00:29:50.501 --> 00:29:54.610
this is one of those four,
say something more about that in a moment.

454
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.070
Here are the remains of the,
uh,

455
00:29:57.071 --> 00:29:59.560
of the stadium of demission that can still be seen.

456
00:29:59.561 --> 00:30:01.660
Very few tourists a notice this,

457
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:05.050
but it's well worth looking at cause you can see the brick face,

458
00:30:05.051 --> 00:30:08.020
cement construction that served for the,

459
00:30:08.021 --> 00:30:11.230
that was how the substructures of this building were built.

460
00:30:11.231 --> 00:30:14.250
And I think you can even see that from a distance here,
uh,

461
00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.300
made out of concrete faced with brick,

462
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:21.600
but the arcades and the columns that I showed you before out of travertine

463
00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.460
Ashler Masonry,
travertine,

464
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:29.350
which was one of the last buildings actually in Rome to be made of travertine

465
00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:33.070
Ashleigh Masonry.
Uh,
just to,
just to,

466
00:30:33.071 --> 00:30:36.660
to show you also that again,
just as we,
when we were in Coppery,

467
00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:40.090
I showed you the bar to Berio and it's referenced in Tiberius.

468
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.890
It's amazing what those who put up restaurants and bars and so on,

469
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.870
uh,
around Rome.
It's,
it's amazing.
It demonstrates the,

470
00:30:48.871 --> 00:30:52.960
the strong sense of history that Italians have because I just,

471
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:57.850
the fact that they recognize that these are remains from the stadium of

472
00:30:57.851 --> 00:31:00.850
demission.
Everyone thinks of this structure as the Piazza Navona,

473
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:04.870
but the fact that they are well aware of the fact that it was demission stadium

474
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.000
so that the wine bar across the street,

475
00:31:07.001 --> 00:31:09.340
and this is one that was just opened the last couple of years,

476
00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.260
the wine bar across the street,
uh,

477
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:16.210
is called the domain Siano that don't meet Siano after demission because it's

478
00:31:16.211 --> 00:31:21.211
right across the street from the stadium of demission with regard to ice cream.

479
00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:26.290
I take my gelato seriously and I'm sure all of you have been to Italy feel the

480
00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:29.500
same way.
It's like,
it's not like American ice cream,

481
00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:33.790
not that American ice cream isn't good.
Uh,
but it's,
it's absolutely fantastic.

482
00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:36.340
And I,
so I will make some recommendations,
uh,

483
00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:39.790
this semester and this is the first one that I'm going to make,

484
00:31:39.791 --> 00:31:42.820
cause it's one of my favorites and everyone agrees this is one of the best ice

485
00:31:42.821 --> 00:31:46.870
cream parlors and Rome.
It's called trace Galena.
It's also a restaurant,

486
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:51.760
a restaurant you can pass on so many restaurants in the center of famous

487
00:31:51.761 --> 00:31:56.110
Piazza's.
It's not the best,
but uh,
yeah,
and you don't have to sit outside,

488
00:31:56.111 --> 00:31:58.990
although they will try to beckon you to sit outside because it costs more to eat

489
00:31:58.991 --> 00:32:02.320
the ice cream outside than it does.
If you just walk into,

490
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.690
we'll walk through the door.
There are actually two doors,

491
00:32:04.691 --> 00:32:07.720
one on that's I want on this dot.
Go right up to the counter.

492
00:32:07.721 --> 00:32:11.680
Take a look at what's there and make your order.
And I,
the,

493
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:15.640
my recommendation for this particular geolog Therea,
uh,

494
00:32:15.641 --> 00:32:17.980
is the Tartu fee.
They are very famous.
These,

495
00:32:17.981 --> 00:32:22.620
this is the best Tartufo in Rome without question.
If you like chocolate,
uh,

496
00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.850
it's,
it's a chocolate bomb essentially,

497
00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.680
as you can see in these images here it is one big,
well,
fairly large,

498
00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:34.630
uh,
very rich,
uh,
chocolate with big,
big,

499
00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:38.640
the biggest chocolate chips you ever saw on it.
And then they,
they put a doll up,

500
00:32:38.641 --> 00:32:40.670
I don't even whipped cream,
but when it's pawn,

501
00:32:40.671 --> 00:32:44.090
not when it's pawn on top of the Tartufo,
I go the whole way.

502
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.530
So you have the pond on top of the Tartufo phone.

503
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.820
If you sit outside and a willing to pay extra,
they'll throw a pure,

504
00:32:50.821 --> 00:32:53.890
a wet on the top.
If not,
you have to forego the farewell.

505
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:56.990
But I really highly recommend what do you like chocolate or you don't like

506
00:32:56.991 --> 00:33:00.440
chocolate?
I've gone with people who are not the kind of junk all the guy,
um,
uh,

507
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:02.900
who,
who um,
who like this anyway,

508
00:33:02.901 --> 00:33:06.650
so it's really a treat and at least once when you're in Rome,

509
00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:10.820
you have to indulge in a Tartufo at Tracy Delaney.

510
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:13.320
I want to move from dimensions,

511
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:18.350
a stadium to the building that we're going to concentrate on today because

512
00:33:18.621 --> 00:33:18.891
again,

513
00:33:18.891 --> 00:33:23.891
it is so extensive and that is dimensions palace on the Palatine Hill will

514
00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:29.540
usually refer to it as the emissions palace on the Palatine Hill or the imperial

515
00:33:29.541 --> 00:33:34.510
palace on the Palatine Hill.
Uh,
but the nomenclature is,
is,

516
00:33:34.511 --> 00:33:39.230
is complex because it,
in antiquity it was referred to as the Domus,

517
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:43.640
the dome.
Most owl goose Donna,
like the Dome is our,
yeah,
Golden House of Neuro.

518
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:48.350
The Dome was,
was Donna Augustus,
his house,
essentially,
because by this point,

519
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:52.070
uh,
the word Augustus had become synonymous with emperor.

520
00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.750
So every emperor was the Augustus.
Uh,

521
00:33:54.751 --> 00:33:58.820
so this is the Domus Augustana,
uh,
which again,

522
00:33:58.821 --> 00:34:00.380
continuous construction.

523
00:34:00.381 --> 00:34:05.150
We talked about the fact that Tiberius had begun a palace on the Palatine hill

524
00:34:05.151 --> 00:34:09.740
on the slope of the Palatine Hill that Caligula had added to that his

525
00:34:09.741 --> 00:34:12.220
successors,
Claudius,
uh,

526
00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.910
was not that interested in palatial architecture is you'll remember a neuro had

527
00:34:16.911 --> 00:34:20.870
other plans for the Dome is transitory and for the dome salary.

528
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:26.260
So it was left to the Flavian specifically to demission to complete the imperial

529
00:34:26.721 --> 00:34:28.720
palace,
which he does.
Uh,

530
00:34:28.721 --> 00:34:32.630
and then it is dedicated as you can see from the monument list in [inaudible]

531
00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:37.530
92.
We also know the architect of the dome.
Miss,

532
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:37.920
uh,

533
00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:42.920
I was Donna and that was a man by the name of rebellious r a.

534
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.360
B.
I,
r.
I,

535
00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:49.130
U s very important Roman architect by the name of rebellious,

536
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.500
to get back to the nomenclature for a moment.

537
00:34:51.501 --> 00:34:55.790
So the actual name of the palace was the Domus Augustana.

538
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:58.520
But here's where it gets complicated.

539
00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:03.620
There's also a public wing of the house and a private wing of the house,

540
00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:08.120
the public wing,
and you can see it in this Google earth image from the air.

541
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.800
The public wing is on one story and we see that over here.

542
00:35:12.801 --> 00:35:16.910
And that was referred to an ancient times as the Flavian House,

543
00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.830
the Domus Labia,
the Domus,
Flavio,

544
00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:25.420
the private wing was on two stories or part of it was on two stories.

545
00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:29.930
You can see it here,
it's even larger,
more extensive.
Uh,

546
00:35:29.931 --> 00:35:34.190
and that was called in ancient times also the domeless [inaudible].

547
00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.750
So the way this word,

548
00:35:35.751 --> 00:35:40.230
the domus out who's done a referred both to the private way as opposed to the

549
00:35:40.231 --> 00:35:43.170
dome is Flavia,
but also to the palace as a whole.

550
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.870
So I just wanted you to be aware of that because as you do your reading in the

551
00:35:45.871 --> 00:35:50.160
textbooks and so on,
you might find that a little bit confusing.
But we can make,

552
00:35:50.161 --> 00:35:54.480
we can simplify it completely and just call it the palace of division on the

553
00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:58.380
Palatine Hell,
which is what I suggest we do.
So once again,

554
00:35:58.381 --> 00:36:02.940
we can see quite good in this view from the air,
the way in which this,
uh,

555
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:07.260
this,
uh,
[inaudible] structure was planned and built a,

556
00:36:07.261 --> 00:36:09.030
we see over here for example,

557
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:12.760
and I'm going to show you these implant plan and also the remains shortly.
Uh,

558
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:15.560
we can see on the upper left,
uh,

559
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:19.740
what is a basilica next to that,
an audience hall,

560
00:36:19.741 --> 00:36:24.030
a Great Fountain Court over here and try Clinique IOM or dining room,
uh,

561
00:36:24.031 --> 00:36:24.691
over here.

562
00:36:24.691 --> 00:36:29.370
And then fountains on either side that belonged to the Domus Flavio or the

563
00:36:29.371 --> 00:36:33.690
public room,
uh,
public,
uh,
area of the palace public section of the palace.

564
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.420
And then over here,
the private area,
as I said,

565
00:36:36.421 --> 00:36:41.421
larger on two stories right here with a court in the center and a whole host of

566
00:36:41.731 --> 00:36:46.110
small rooms surrounding that living quarters and so on for demission and others,

567
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.810
a peristyle court,
another Paris,
Dell court,
and then a great something stadium.

568
00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:53.250
Uh,
over here on the right,

569
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:58.500
this was a far cry from Romulus is huts as you see them.

570
00:36:58.501 --> 00:37:03.501
The Romulus is village of the eighth century BC that I remind you of over here

571
00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:07.990
and show you what has happened in the Inter Inter,
uh,

572
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:11.280
in the interlude.
But what's extremely important,

573
00:37:11.281 --> 00:37:16.281
I think given a dimensions view of themself as Lord and God is dominus Deus.

574
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:19.860
Uh,
it's interesting to see what he builds.

575
00:37:19.861 --> 00:37:23.310
And he certainly felt that he was very much in the tradition of Romulus.

576
00:37:23.311 --> 00:37:27.690
He wants to associate himself with Romulus and also of course with Augustus,

577
00:37:27.691 --> 00:37:32.040
who lived,
as,
you know,
on the Palatine Hill.
But at the same time,

578
00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:34.110
he wants to inject a,

579
00:37:34.111 --> 00:37:37.800
his living space with the kind of brand juror that had not been,

580
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:40.230
that was certainly true under Nero and his domain salary,

581
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:43.980
but they did not been true for any of the other earlier Roman emperor.

582
00:37:43.981 --> 00:37:47.130
So the don't miss our,
the impact of the Domus area once again,

583
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.570
is something we should think about as we look at this incredible palace.

584
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:52.890
This is a,
uh,

585
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:58.040
a plan from the Ward Perkins Textbook that perhaps shows you better than the

586
00:37:58.171 --> 00:38:02.370
view from the air exactly what this,
this structure was all about.

587
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.790
We see the,
uh,
the,
uh,
the,
uh,

588
00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:08.250
public wing on the lefthand side,

589
00:38:08.251 --> 00:38:13.200
the Domus Flavia of the palace on the Palatine Hill.

590
00:38:13.201 --> 00:38:16.230
And it includes,
as you can see in the upper left corner,

591
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.390
a basilica basilica,

592
00:38:18.391 --> 00:38:23.100
a room with a central central space divided by two side aisles by columns.

593
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:26.370
Uh,
and that was a basilica that,

594
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:31.400
that demission himself sat in and tried cases in as the judge.

595
00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:36.280
Then next to that and audience hall or an hour law,
a l a,
uh,

596
00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:40.600
that was the place where demission met with visiting dignitaries.
Uh,

597
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:44.500
then on access with the,
Oh,
I'll up in the upper right,
a lararium,

598
00:38:44.501 --> 00:38:47.560
which was a place where they kept the household gods and so on.

599
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:52.670
Then on access with the audience,
all the Paris style,
the peristyle.

600
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.510
And if you,
and if you look at that and plan,
it's got columns,

601
00:38:55.511 --> 00:38:58.780
of course it's Paris,
dials do,
but look at what's in the center of it.

602
00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:03.460
It actually is a fountain and it is the fountain that is octagonal in shape.

603
00:39:03.461 --> 00:39:08.461
So the impact of Nero's Domus aurea immediately clear the impact of that

604
00:39:08.861 --> 00:39:13.861
remarkable octagonal room on the architecture of the mission and on the

605
00:39:14.561 --> 00:39:17.920
architect rib area.
So a,
an octagonal fountain.

606
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:20.860
And then on access with the Allah or audience hall,

607
00:39:20.861 --> 00:39:25.630
the peristyle is the try Klinean or dining room of the house of very large

608
00:39:25.631 --> 00:39:30.100
dining room with panoramic windows through which one could see a very

609
00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:34.750
interestingly elliptically shaped fountain one on either side.

610
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.080
Now as you look at that plan of the Domus Labia,

611
00:39:38.081 --> 00:39:42.520
and especially at the basilica,
the audience hall and the Tri Klinean,

612
00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:46.390
there was one feature that all three of those have in common that I haven't yet

613
00:39:46.391 --> 00:39:48.400
mentioned.
Uh,
which is what,

614
00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.193
<v 1>okay,</v>

615
00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.110
<v 0>all three of them have what?</v>

616
00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:02.380
<v 1>No,
one</v>

617
00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.670
<v 0>half circle.
Okay.
And I exactly.</v>

618
00:40:08.671 --> 00:40:13.671
And apps and apps on one end and all of those apps is facing the same direction.

619
00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:18.250
The basilica is an Apps,
the audience,
all as an apps if try Klinean has an APP,

620
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:20.040
those were dimensions apses.

621
00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.240
That's where demission sat domain as a day as he wanted to be honored,

622
00:40:24.241 --> 00:40:27.000
in fact worshipped as Lord and God,

623
00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:31.620
and he needed a space to do it in and he wanted to sit on a throne underneath

624
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:36.210
the Dome of Heaven in a sense of the Dome of Heaven was a bolt made out of

625
00:40:36.211 --> 00:40:39.720
concrete and decorated in some way in antiquity,

626
00:40:39.721 --> 00:40:43.530
probably with mosaic or whatever,
to give it the sense of a dome of Heaven.

627
00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:47.130
He wanted to sit in that space in every one of those rooms.

628
00:40:47.131 --> 00:40:49.290
So whether he was trying a la carte court case,

629
00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:55.080
just welcoming visiting dignitaries or eating in his try Klinean he wanted to

630
00:40:55.081 --> 00:40:58.560
sit,
uh,
beneath at least a semi dome of Heaven.

631
00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:03.270
And that's indeed what he did as he was again,
worshiped as dominus a day or so.

632
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.580
This,
this is a very important,
I think,

633
00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:10.640
a phenomenon in this particular monument and one that is well worth thinking

634
00:41:11.251 --> 00:41:12.040
about,
uh,

635
00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:17.040
in terms of the way in which architecture is used by a given individual's to

636
00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:22.170
define themselves,
to define their lives and to define their era.

637
00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:26.550
Over here.
Again,
the private wing.
I'm going to hold on that for a moment.

638
00:41:26.551 --> 00:41:29.830
We'll come back to that shortly.
This is a deep,

639
00:41:29.831 --> 00:41:34.831
a detail of the basilica where see the plan of the basilica and also a cross

640
00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:38.600
section of the same structure.
And you can see it is,

641
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:42.290
it is completely in keeping with other basilican architecture.

642
00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:46.760
We've looked at both in civic,
uh,
locations and elsewhere.

643
00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:51.560
A central nave within apps on one end.
Again,
imagine demission sitting over here,

644
00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:56.420
uh,
the central nave divided from the side aisles by columns.

645
00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:01.750
A fairly simple but a very interesting structure in the context of this

646
00:42:02.391 --> 00:42:07.391
particular palace over here and outstanding restored view that probably gives

647
00:42:08.631 --> 00:42:12.770
you a better sense in almost anything I can show you of the dome is Flavio or

648
00:42:12.771 --> 00:42:17.270
the public space of demolitions palace.
Uh,

649
00:42:17.271 --> 00:42:20.840
here's of course the basilica over here and you can see that this room,

650
00:42:20.841 --> 00:42:23.400
like all of the rooms in this palace,
uh,

651
00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:28.540
were done in marble and that marble was a various colors as you can see here.

652
00:42:29.421 --> 00:42:31.820
And it was marble that was brought from all over the world.

653
00:42:31.821 --> 00:42:33.980
We talked about the fact that the Flavian did this,

654
00:42:33.981 --> 00:42:37.370
we talked about this as the case for the temple and pockets.
For example,

655
00:42:37.371 --> 00:42:42.050
bringing marble from Egypt and Asia minor and Greece,
uh,

656
00:42:42.051 --> 00:42:45.230
and uh,
elsewhere in the Roman world.

657
00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.570
Bringing it all here and using it,

658
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:52.460
using that very gated marble to make,
to get to ornament.

659
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:56.240
Obviously this palace in Rome over here,

660
00:42:56.241 --> 00:43:01.120
the outlaw or the,
the upgrade audience hall,
the [inaudible],

661
00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:06.110
we call it over here also with the marble on the floor as well as on the walls.

662
00:43:06.111 --> 00:43:09.950
You can see that this particular room and it was apparent and plan as well,

663
00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:15.050
has a scalloping on either around the edge,
around the perimeter of the room,

664
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:18.920
a series of niches,
as you can see with,

665
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:21.020
with the statuary in them,

666
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:25.910
surrounded by columns to tears with other windows up above.

667
00:43:25.911 --> 00:43:28.950
As you can see and hear you get a sense of that,
uh,

668
00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:33.320
of that space in which demission would've sat the apps of the room,

669
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.780
the curvature of the wall made of course,

670
00:43:35.781 --> 00:43:40.210
that of concrete as this entire structure was made out of concrete with a semi

671
00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:41.690
dome.
And you have to again,

672
00:43:41.691 --> 00:43:46.691
imagine a demission sitting beneath that are inside that apps and beneath that

673
00:43:46.701 --> 00:43:50.930
semi dome here,
the peristyle court open to the sky,
uh,

674
00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:55.610
columns all around,
covered colonnade,
two stories,
uh,
and then in the center,

675
00:43:55.611 --> 00:43:58.790
this octagonal fountain,
leave it to Demission,

676
00:43:58.791 --> 00:44:03.791
leave it to rebury as to transform Nero's octagonal room into a fountain in the

677
00:44:04.581 --> 00:44:06.620
context of this palace.

678
00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:11.920
And then on access again with the Aloe Rajah and with the Paris style is the Tri

679
00:44:12.201 --> 00:44:13.034
Clint Iom.

680
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:16.670
And this restored view again gives you a very good sense of that apps in which

681
00:44:16.671 --> 00:44:21.030
demission would have sat in throne with the semi dome above his head.
Uh,

682
00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.130
two tiers.
Again,

683
00:44:22.131 --> 00:44:26.900
the walls decorated with very gated marbles brought from all different parts of

684
00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:31.350
the world as well as with columns and then picture windows through which would

685
00:44:31.351 --> 00:44:36.351
see these very interesting elliptical fountains as you dined one on either side

686
00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:40.590
of the structure,
there's a lot of controversy as to how the,

687
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:44.460
the rooms that were roofed were roofed,
whether they had barrel vaults or not.

688
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:48.090
Or you can see this particular restored view shows one flat roof.

689
00:44:48.091 --> 00:44:52.080
And when barrel vaulted a roof,
we're not absolutely sure about that.
And again,

690
00:44:52.081 --> 00:44:55.830
scholars continue to argue,
which was the case here.

691
00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.720
I mentioned statuary in the [inaudible] and we have some evidence for what that

692
00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:06.930
statuary might have been like and the way in which it was used by demission.

693
00:45:06.931 --> 00:45:10.140
I show you two examples.
These are two statues,

694
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:15.350
one representing Hercules on the left and the other on the right representing a

695
00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:20.130
Paulo.
And you can,
and these are truly colossal in scale.

696
00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:23.850
Uh,
and uh,
they are made a beautiful materials.
Again,

697
00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:28.350
imported materials in this case,
a kind of a Maroon colored stone in this case,

698
00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:32.760
a green greenish colored stone.
Again,
they're very large in scale,

699
00:45:32.761 --> 00:45:37.470
colossal in scale and you can see the exaggerated musculature of both of these

700
00:45:37.471 --> 00:45:41.580
figures.
And I think they are very telling in terms of,
you know,
as we,

701
00:45:41.581 --> 00:45:45.240
as we think about demission sitting in rooms like the aloe,
Reggie,

702
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.280
greeting visitors.

703
00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:51.240
And when you think about what this man who wanted to be worshiped as Lord and

704
00:45:51.241 --> 00:45:55.560
God thought of himself and you see the kind of statuary that he surrounded

705
00:45:55.561 --> 00:46:00.080
himself with,
this is a very different man than his predecessor,
Claudius,
uh,

706
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:02.820
the kind of imagery that he associated himself with.

707
00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:07.820
Its as a way of pumping himself up I think by having himself surrounded by these

708
00:46:08.371 --> 00:46:12.870
very athletic figures of Hercules and also of Apollo.

709
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:18.060
Uh,
what do you think this is just from looking at it?
The remains,

710
00:46:18.061 --> 00:46:21.180
you can see the remains are not as extensive as one which is they were,

711
00:46:21.181 --> 00:46:25.020
but enough is there to allow a reconstruction of the hall.

712
00:46:25.021 --> 00:46:29.550
What are we looking at here?
The,
the Octagonal Fountain,

713
00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:34.320
the Octagonal Fountain of the peristyle court.
Excellent.
It's really the most,

714
00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:37.980
most people who wander around these remains were not be able to figure out for

715
00:46:37.981 --> 00:46:40.230
the life of themselves what this was.

716
00:46:40.231 --> 00:46:43.640
But you'll be glad when you go up on the Palatine Hill to,
uh,

717
00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:47.900
to know as you stand here that this was once an octagonal fountain with this

718
00:46:47.901 --> 00:46:50.490
spectacular water display.
Undoubtedly

719
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.980
this is the try Clint IOM or what survives sad,

720
00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.610
what survives of dimensions.
Try Klinean.
This is his apps.

721
00:46:59.611 --> 00:47:01.420
This is the very abs in which,
uh,

722
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:06.210
demission would've sat and throned as he ate with special invited guests as he

723
00:47:06.211 --> 00:47:11.070
held a state dinner in Rome.
Uh,
and you can see if you look very carefully,

724
00:47:11.071 --> 00:47:14.250
again,
the construction is brick faced concrete construction.

725
00:47:14.251 --> 00:47:17.130
We talked about the fact that after the fire of 64,

726
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:21.810
a decision was made to begin to,
uh,
to,
uh,

727
00:47:21.811 --> 00:47:26.030
use brick as a facing because brick was more fireproof than stone.
Uh,

728
00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.810
and we see that borne out,

729
00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:32.811
the entire imperial palace on the Palatine Hill was made a brick based concrete

730
00:47:33.491 --> 00:47:35.680
construction.
But if you look very carefully,

731
00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:39.640
you will see some stucco and you will also see some marble revetments.

732
00:47:39.641 --> 00:47:40.930
So in this case,

733
00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:45.700
that brick was covered over with marble to give it a much more luxurious look

734
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.460
for the Domina sit day is also interesting here.
Actually.
There's a tea,

735
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:55.090
there's a tarp on top of preserve mosaic and I'll show you that mosaic in a

736
00:47:55.091 --> 00:47:58.540
moment.
But what's interesting here is the uh,
the,

737
00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:03.190
the pavement rests on something that should remind you of something we saw

738
00:48:03.191 --> 00:48:07.990
earlier in this semester,
which is what,
when do you're nodding.
So the hypo cost,

739
00:48:07.991 --> 00:48:12.340
it's a hypercar system.
Justice we saw in the snobby and bass in Pompei,

740
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:17.500
they have raised the pavement up on these piles of brick and then in between

741
00:48:17.501 --> 00:48:22.501
them would have place terracotta pipes and also a braziers with hot hot hot

742
00:48:22.511 --> 00:48:27.511
coals and so on and so forth to heat the floor of the Tri Klinean so that

743
00:48:28.271 --> 00:48:33.271
demission could not only sit in his abs but could have his feet warm while he

744
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:35.080
ate.
This gives you again,

745
00:48:35.081 --> 00:48:40.081
I think a really good window into the kind of man we are dealing with here and

746
00:48:40.181 --> 00:48:43.210
what he was trying to achieve.
Once again,
through architecture,

747
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:44.860
through architecture.

748
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:49.690
This is another view of the apps in which demission sat.
And here we do see,

749
00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:50.200
you know,

750
00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:54.160
without the tarp we can see that the mosaic is actually pretty well preserved.

751
00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:57.790
And it is the colors that we so often find in Roman mosaics,

752
00:48:57.791 --> 00:49:02.791
especially in major public buildings and in private policies of this combination

753
00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:05.170
of green,
Maroon,
and white,

754
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:10.270
as you see here with a variety of very attractive geometric shapes.
Again,

755
00:49:10.271 --> 00:49:13.840
you can see the concrete construction faced with brick and you can see the

756
00:49:13.841 --> 00:49:18.490
remains of some of the marble revetment that would have covered the walls and

757
00:49:18.491 --> 00:49:23.110
made this all that much more ostentatious in ancient Roman times.

758
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:26.710
This fountain is a Marvel,
I love this fountain.

759
00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:28.540
This is the fountain that you see.

760
00:49:28.541 --> 00:49:32.800
You're one of the two that you would see through the panoramic windows of the

761
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:36.490
power of the,
uh,
try cladium and dimensions palace.

762
00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:39.190
And this is where I think the gene,

763
00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:43.960
the genius of rubbish rebellious shows through and rebury his shows in a sense

764
00:49:43.961 --> 00:49:46.590
himself to be the frank Gehry of his day.

765
00:49:46.591 --> 00:49:49.600
I mean somebody who really enjoyed undulating,

766
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:54.840
undulating forms and the way in which concavity and convexity can be played off

767
00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:59.520
against one another to great result.
Uh,
it's an elliptical founded.

768
00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:03.820
It's fairly small in scale,
it's elliptical as you can see here.
Uh,

769
00:50:03.821 --> 00:50:04.840
and the,
uh,

770
00:50:04.841 --> 00:50:09.841
the convexity of that ellipse played off and you see it repeated again here,

771
00:50:10.691 --> 00:50:14.200
played off against these interesting undulating walls.

772
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:18.000
All of this created again out of concrete and faced with bricks.

773
00:50:18.001 --> 00:50:21.340
So you imagine the bricks have to be very carefully,
uh,

774
00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:26.080
molded to fit where they need to fit in to this incredible scheme.

775
00:50:26.081 --> 00:50:27.160
And of course in antiquity,

776
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:30.950
this would have been stuccoed over and probably had some marble revetment on it

777
00:50:30.951 --> 00:50:32.610
and so on and so forth.
Uh,

778
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:36.620
but the shape is absolutely marvelous and I think we are definitely in the

779
00:50:36.621 --> 00:50:41.360
presence of a great architectural genius in the person of Liberia who was

780
00:50:41.361 --> 00:50:44.180
working for,
uh,
for demission,

781
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:48.800
the private wing of the palace.
Equally spectacular in its own way.

782
00:50:48.801 --> 00:50:52.550
I mentioned to you already that it's more,
it's larger and in,
uh,

783
00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:54.290
in the space that it covers.

784
00:50:54.291 --> 00:50:58.190
Then the Domus Flavio and part of it is on two stories.

785
00:50:58.191 --> 00:51:02.840
The part that you see over here,
there's a fountain court in the center.
Uh,

786
00:51:02.841 --> 00:51:07.820
and then two stories of rooms around that.
Another peristyle back here.

787
00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:10.820
And then a stadium once again,

788
00:51:10.821 --> 00:51:13.670
a hairpin shape with a curved side and the flat side,

789
00:51:13.671 --> 00:51:15.650
just like his stadium in Rome.

790
00:51:15.651 --> 00:51:19.550
But he already had a stadium where he could public stadium where one could watch

791
00:51:19.551 --> 00:51:22.340
race horses and these races and the like.

792
00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:26.450
He used this instead and it's actually sunken cause remember this part is two

793
00:51:26.451 --> 00:51:29.810
stories.
This is sunken eyes,
Sunken Stadium next to it.

794
00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:35.020
It was used as a place for a pleasurable walks as a kind of outdoor garden aware

795
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:40.870
demission and again,
a special visitors,
uh,
could,
uh,
could spend some,

796
00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:45.920
some time,
a pleasant place to walk within the city.
Uh,

797
00:51:45.921 --> 00:51:47.150
we see here,
uh,

798
00:51:47.151 --> 00:51:52.151
another of the accident metric view from Ward Perkins where we can also get a

799
00:51:52.191 --> 00:51:56.840
very good sense,
not only of the Domus Flavio as we've already described it.

800
00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:02.030
Uh,
the basilica and the owl on one end,
the octagonal fountain in the center.

801
00:52:02.031 --> 00:52:06.390
And then over here,
the dining hall with the two,
uh,
to,
uh,

802
00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:08.870
elliptical fountains.
One on either side.

803
00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:14.140
Here we see again the private area with the sunken stadium over here with the

804
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.560
Peristyle Court,
with a fountain in the center.
Two stories around that.
Uh,

805
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:21.740
and then over here,

806
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:26.210
another couple of other peristyle courts are actually three peristyle courts in

807
00:52:26.211 --> 00:52:29.210
total here.
But what's interesting,
I think when you look at this accident,

808
00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:34.160
a metric view,
I think it's interesting to see that kind of cutaway view,

809
00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:36.710
uh,
that to see that from the outside,

810
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:40.670
a lot of these spaces didn't look as interesting as they did from the inside.

811
00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:44.200
We are definitely moving,
I mean we've seen that be the case for a while,

812
00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.830
but he's,
it'd be Roman architecture.

813
00:52:45.831 --> 00:52:49.580
Think back to some of the early residents is in palm pay where they were very

814
00:52:49.581 --> 00:52:51.140
plain and severe on the outside.

815
00:52:51.141 --> 00:52:55.300
But when you went in inside and saw the atrium and the medium and the comm

816
00:52:55.301 --> 00:52:58.250
plutonium in the,
and the garden,
it was something else.
Again,

817
00:52:58.251 --> 00:52:59.900
this whole element of surprise.

818
00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:05.140
And that's true even here I think in this palace where the structures are less

819
00:53:05.451 --> 00:53:10.280
interesting from the outside and more interesting from the interiors of them.

820
00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:15.520
Here's the Google Earth image again of just the private part of the palace where

821
00:53:15.801 --> 00:53:18.830
we see this interesting Paris dial court,

822
00:53:18.831 --> 00:53:21.210
the other two peristyle courts behind it.
Uh,

823
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:25.040
these rooms placed on two stories and then once again,

824
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:28.620
Sunken Stadium,
Sunken Stadium is actually quite well preserved.

825
00:53:28.621 --> 00:53:33.030
As you can see here,
it's one of the better preserved parts of the villa today.

826
00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:36.450
You can get a very good sense,
not only of a shape and also its scale,

827
00:53:36.451 --> 00:53:39.360
its enormous,
huge stadium.
Uh,

828
00:53:39.361 --> 00:53:44.130
and again you'll have to imagine demission wandering around here.
Uh,
and uh,

829
00:53:44.131 --> 00:53:46.080
you can see the curved end on one side,

830
00:53:46.081 --> 00:53:50.940
but most importantly the concrete construction faced with brick and including

831
00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.100
columns and other marble.

832
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:57.270
That meant this is a view of that first court,

833
00:53:57.271 --> 00:54:00.990
the one that has rooms on two stories around it.
Once again,

834
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:03.930
rebellious has had a great deal of fun with his fountain.

835
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:08.460
He seems to have taken particular pleasure and designing fountains and in

836
00:54:08.461 --> 00:54:13.170
letting his magic imagination run free.
With regard to fountain design,

837
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:17.010
uh,
you see,
you see here,
uh,
again he's playing off,

838
00:54:17.011 --> 00:54:21.600
convex against concave.
He's done all of this out of uh,
out of concrete.

839
00:54:21.601 --> 00:54:24.300
They shapes are done in concrete,
faced with brick and again,

840
00:54:24.301 --> 00:54:25.830
the bricks have to be molded,

841
00:54:25.831 --> 00:54:29.370
very special lead to fit the space within that,

842
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:32.640
that they need to accommodate themselves to.

843
00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:36.780
And if any of you know anything about those female warriors called the Amazons,

844
00:54:36.781 --> 00:54:40.590
they carry shields called as p e l t a as they should remind you,

845
00:54:40.591 --> 00:54:44.730
don't they look Robert like pell tie?
Uh,
they look very much like,
I don't know,

846
00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:48.870
that's probably coincidental.
I'm not implying here that there's any,
um,

847
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:52.200
any particular iconography to this particular fountain,
but who knows.

848
00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:56.700
But they do look very much like shields that are carried by Amazonian women.

849
00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:57.540
But at any rate,

850
00:54:57.570 --> 00:55:02.570
this playing off of convex against concave Burberry's is clearly enjoying

851
00:55:02.611 --> 00:55:06.780
himself with this monument.
Then the rooms on two stories and you see,

852
00:55:06.781 --> 00:55:10.670
just as we saw quite quite some time ago in the second phase of the villa,

853
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:15.710
the mysteries where they were beginning to open up the exterior and create bay

854
00:55:15.721 --> 00:55:19.500
windows and more windows and make it less severe than it had been in the

855
00:55:19.501 --> 00:55:22.700
original.
Don't Miss Vitalik like we see that sort of thing here.

856
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:25.590
Many more windows you the wall being opened up,

857
00:55:25.591 --> 00:55:28.830
they've gotten so sophisticated in their use of concrete,
uh,

858
00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:32.460
that they are able to,
um,
to open the,

859
00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:36.480
the walls up more with these rectangular windows of different shapes.

860
00:55:36.481 --> 00:55:39.090
As you can see,
some large,
some smaller,
some on the ground,

861
00:55:39.091 --> 00:55:43.540
some higher sort of like windows and then above,
uh,
additional,
um,

862
00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:48.540
openings that are,
that are RQ waited on the top.
So clearly he's again,

863
00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:52.860
having,
enjoying,
uh,
opening up this wall and creating interesting,

864
00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:58.230
interesting,
uh,
views from one part of the structure to another.
Two more,

865
00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:03.150
two more images of that wonderful fountain where I think you can see even better

866
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:06.930
the way in which this has all been done out of concrete,
faced with brick.

867
00:56:06.931 --> 00:56:10.200
And you have to imagine,
of course,
the spectacular water display.

868
00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:15.030
The found the actual water jets that would've come up,
uh,

869
00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:18.710
the Bellagio,
it may not have been,
but it probably was something,
you know,

870
00:56:18.711 --> 00:56:23.460
sort of pride,
the ancient version of the Bellagio in Las Vegas.
Uh,

871
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:28.470
the fountains at the Bellagio here you see a restored view of this fountain

872
00:56:28.811 --> 00:56:32.560
court where you get a sense that once you add a bunch of statuary,

873
00:56:32.561 --> 00:56:35.700
some water jets,
which you don't see actually working here,
uh,

874
00:56:35.701 --> 00:56:37.180
and paint the walls,
uh,

875
00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:40.450
the whole thing would have been even more spectacular still.

876
00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:44.410
And I think that gives you some general sense of the original appearance of the

877
00:56:44.411 --> 00:56:48.650
palace around the,
uh,
the,
um,
the,

878
00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:52.720
the court,
the Fountain Court and the private wing that we've just looked at.

879
00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:57.640
There were a series of rooms and if you look at some of those rooms in detail,

880
00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:01.710
I think you'll be amazed by what you see.
Some fantastically shape rooms,

881
00:57:01.711 --> 00:57:04.030
some of them cruciform cross shaped,
uh,

882
00:57:04.031 --> 00:57:07.420
some of them going way back to the frigging Daria with,
uh,
you know,

883
00:57:07.421 --> 00:57:11.980
circular rooms with radiating alcoves.
And not surprisingly,
again,

884
00:57:11.981 --> 00:57:14.630
given,
uh,
what,
uh,
what,
uh,

885
00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:18.580
Severus and Keller were able to achieve at Nero's Domus Aria,

886
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:23.710
given the fact that the octagon is all clearly also in the mind of rebellious in

887
00:57:23.711 --> 00:57:24.520
this building,

888
00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:29.290
we see him creating small act acti octagonal rooms and exploring and

889
00:57:29.291 --> 00:57:31.840
experimenting with those octagonal rooms.

890
00:57:31.841 --> 00:57:34.900
And you see a couple of them and plan on the side.

891
00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.900
And one of the sides of this Fountain Court,

892
00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:42.970
I show you here a view from or several views from the Ward Perkins Textbook

893
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.210
where we see a cross section,
a plan,

894
00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:51.130
and also an accident metric view of one of these octagonal rooms that we believe

895
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:55.390
was designed by rubbing areas for the Palatine Palace.

896
00:57:55.570 --> 00:58:00.300
And I compare it down here,
uh,
to the octagonal room of Nero's domes,

897
00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:00.761
Aria,

898
00:58:00.761 --> 00:58:05.761
which was clearly the model for rebellious Prius's foray into,

899
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:08.690
uh,
to,
to designing opta gods.

900
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:12.460
It's a much smaller room than Nero's octagonal room,

901
00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:17.320
but he takes the whole concept a step further.
It's an octagon.
Yes,

902
00:58:17.321 --> 00:58:22.180
it's eight sided,
just like the dome is Aria.
Uh,
it has radiating alcoves.

903
00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:26.440
Uh,
some of them are rectangular,
some of them are,
are,
are circular,

904
00:58:26.441 --> 00:58:30.550
as you can see here.
Uh,
and if you look at the accident metric view,

905
00:58:30.551 --> 00:58:34.210
you will see two interesting things that are a step forward.
Uh,

906
00:58:34.211 --> 00:58:38.090
one of them is the fact that although in the Dome is our area,
uh,

907
00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:41.620
the eight sided row,
although the room was eight sided,
they,

908
00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:46.120
the Dome was itself essentially,
uh,
a,
you know,

909
00:58:46.121 --> 00:58:48.460
cur curved as traditional dome.

910
00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:53.790
What we see happening here though is they take the eight sides and continue that

911
00:58:54.131 --> 00:58:56.980
segmented feel into the dome.

912
00:58:56.981 --> 00:59:00.550
So we have an eight sided segmented dome in the,

913
00:59:00.551 --> 00:59:04.330
this octagonal room in the Palatine Palace,

914
00:59:04.331 --> 00:59:07.570
which is different than the dome is salary.
And the other thing,

915
00:59:07.571 --> 00:59:09.160
and perhaps even more significant,

916
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:12.520
is the fact that if we look at the individual niches,

917
00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.860
we will see that they are envelopes of space.

918
00:59:14.861 --> 00:59:19.580
And the same way that narrows don't Miss Al Rhea was and that they have.
And,

919
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:23.030
and just like Nero's domes,
they have just like new,
don't miss salary.

920
00:59:23.050 --> 00:59:24.680
They have niches within niches.

921
00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:28.460
But what [inaudible] has done here is something really quite extraordinary.

922
00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:32.360
And very different from anything we've seen earlier.
Enrollment,
architecture,

923
00:59:32.361 --> 00:59:37.361
and that is he's placed some of these additional niches or windows or doorways

924
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:41.270
off axis with the niche itself.

925
00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:45.830
Now we have seen that the Romans cared above all about the holiday and symmetry.

926
00:59:45.831 --> 00:59:50.570
And yet we see here,
and this is why I call him the Frank Gehry of the Roman are,

927
00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:55.550
you know,
Roman architects.
He is willing to try something entirely different.

928
00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:58.110
He is clearly unarmored of,

929
00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.520
of circles and rectangles and domes and the like.

930
01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:06.660
But he is also willing to dispense with the usual axiology of Roman architecture

931
01:00:07.161 --> 01:00:11.930
and explore placing things off axis in a quite inventive way.

932
01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:17.290
And I can show you that even better by looking quickly at the two views of one

933
01:00:18.831 --> 01:00:23.831
of these octagonal rooms from the private wing of the Palatine Palace,

934
01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:27.290
uh,
where you can see not only,
and I hope you can see it from where you are,

935
01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:30.440
you can see not only the segments can you see this segmented dome,

936
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:34.190
I think quite clearly here.
Uh,
you can see these envelopes,
this space.

937
01:00:34.191 --> 01:00:38.060
You can see these openings,
this whole idea of creating vistas from one,
uh,

938
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:42.590
one building to another.
Uh,
but,
and you can see the way in which these very,

939
01:00:42.591 --> 01:00:45.200
that some are doorways,
some are windows,

940
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:49.100
but I think you can also see the way in which he is beginning to place.

941
01:00:49.101 --> 01:00:53.540
Here's a window that is placed completely off axis with the niche.

942
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:57.680
This is even more apparent in this other view where you can see one of these

943
01:00:57.681 --> 01:01:00.440
radiating niches.
And in that radiating niche,

944
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:03.200
there's an opening that starts with the floor.

945
01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:07.250
And then there's another opening to the left of it that's higher up.
Uh,

946
01:01:07.251 --> 01:01:11.810
and again,
you get the sense of asymmetry rather than symmetry in this.

947
01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:15.440
And this is again,
very,
very experimental,
very different.

948
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:18.830
It really is different than almost anything I can show you not only before,

949
01:01:18.831 --> 01:01:21.890
but even after this great work of architecture.

950
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:26.890
And it gives us some insight into the creativity of rebellious and the way in

951
01:01:27.561 --> 01:01:30.950
which,
uh,
demission was allowing him to be.

952
01:01:30.951 --> 01:01:35.660
Because I think this goes above and beyond.
Clearly.
Demission is imaging himself.

953
01:01:35.661 --> 01:01:38.210
I think especially in the public realm of this building,

954
01:01:38.211 --> 01:01:42.830
he's very concerned with how he's presenting himself to his public.
Over here.

955
01:01:42.831 --> 01:01:46.520
I have the sense that he has really let rebellious be rebellious and he's let

956
01:01:46.521 --> 01:01:50.650
rebellious do what he wanted to do to create an interesting architectural,

957
01:01:50.651 --> 01:01:52.460
the exciting space,
uh,

958
01:01:52.461 --> 01:01:57.461
in which he could live a and could enjoy some of what some of the interesting

959
01:01:58.041 --> 01:02:03.041
architectural motifs that rebellious instills in this extraordinary structure.

960
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:11.120
Now to mission to mission was succeeded by John Kerry.
No,

961
01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:12.063
uh,
well,

962
01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:16.170
sort of in the sense that he was succeeded by a man by the name of Nerva who it

963
01:02:16.171 --> 01:02:18.460
looks very much like John Kerry.
Don't you think I'm,

964
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:22.700
that's a coin of neuroma on the lefthand side of the screen.
Uh,

965
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:26.370
demission by the way,
I think I may have forgotten to mention,
but he,
he,
he,

966
01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:29.940
he ended up just the way neuro dead.
He was,
well,
in his case,

967
01:02:29.941 --> 01:02:32.820
he was actually assassinated.
Nero was forced to commit suicide,

968
01:02:32.821 --> 01:02:35.160
but a demission was assassinated.

969
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:39.140
He was issued a dumb not to your memorial at his death.
Uh,

970
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:43.860
and he was succeeded by Nirvana.
Nirvana,
who was appointed by the Senate.

971
01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:48.000
The Senate had had it with dead spots and they decided the time had come to

972
01:02:48.001 --> 01:02:52.650
choose one of their own and they selected nerva who was an elderly and very

973
01:02:52.651 --> 01:02:55.200
highly respected member of the Senate.

974
01:02:55.201 --> 01:02:57.540
And this was the first time the Senate did this and that,

975
01:02:57.550 --> 01:03:01.510
but since the dust is founded,
the empire and,
uh,
his reign,
uh,

976
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:02.880
the first emperor of Rome,

977
01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:08.050
this is the first time that an emperor was appointed by the Senate.
Uh,

978
01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:10.900
nerva was a highly respected and,
and,

979
01:03:10.901 --> 01:03:15.901
and pretty level headed guy and he was able to bring peace and prosperity back

980
01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:20.640
to the empire.
He did not last very long,
however,
he had a very brief reign,

981
01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:22.500
uh,
and uh,

982
01:03:22.501 --> 01:03:26.880
and therefore very little time to have an impact on architecture.
But again,

983
01:03:26.881 --> 01:03:31.170
you see him,
uh,
represented on a coin on the lefthand side of the screen.

984
01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:35.490
I'd like to show you one building though I'd like to end today with one building

985
01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:41.220
that was actually begun by demission and then completed by Nerva.

986
01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:44.860
It began as a so called forum trends Victorian,
uh,

987
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:49.740
under demission and became the forum of Nerva under nerva.
In order to do this,

988
01:03:49.741 --> 01:03:54.210
I need to take you to the general plan of the imperial for in Rome.

989
01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:55.860
We've looked at this before.

990
01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:01.100
You'll remember the location of the Roman Forum here and obviously down below

991
01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.090
the form of Julius Caesar that we've already studied the forum of Augustus built

992
01:04:06.091 --> 01:04:08.790
right next to that,
that we've also looked at in detail.

993
01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:12.930
And then the forum pacas or the temple and pockets of Vespasian,
uh,

994
01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:17.400
which we have looked at more recently and which you'll recall was built in such

995
01:04:17.401 --> 01:04:22.401
a way so that it faced the forum of Augustus and the Forum of Julius Caesar next

996
01:04:22.621 --> 01:04:24.210
door.
I mentioned to you,

997
01:04:24.211 --> 01:04:28.650
I think already that there was a very large piece of property over here.
Uh,

998
01:04:28.651 --> 01:04:30.690
that was,
that was,
uh,

999
01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:35.740
that on which stood essentially one of Rome,
seven hills,
the queer and all hell.

1000
01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:40.830
Can You I R I n a l the clearer knowl hill of Rome occupied this area,

1001
01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.920
but it was an area that was being eyed by demission.

1002
01:04:43.921 --> 01:04:46.920
You can see from his palace that he had big plans and,
uh,

1003
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:49.740
once the palace was coming to fruition,

1004
01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:53.160
he was thinking again about public architecture and the fact that he would

1005
01:04:53.161 --> 01:04:58.080
really like to build a forum to rival that of his father for him that was bigger

1006
01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.700
than that of his father's.

1007
01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:04.700
And he'd liked to put it over here facing his father's Borum across the forum of

1008
01:05:05.371 --> 01:05:09.230
Augustus and the Forum of Julius Caesar.
He drank,

1009
01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:14.020
he dreamed those big dreams,
but he was never able to realize them.
Uh,

1010
01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:19.070
what he did instead was to take it this area that was located between the forum

1011
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:25.510
of Vespasian and the form of Augustus form of Julius Caesar.

1012
01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.330
This area that I mentioned to you was called the [inaudible].

1013
01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:33.570
A.

1014
01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.660
R.

I think I've got it there.
The are delayed them.
Uh,

1015
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:42.990
that area was a street that connected the Roman forum with an area of Rome

1016
01:05:44.351 --> 01:05:47.290
called the Sabura Suv.
Ura.
This Bora,

1017
01:05:47.530 --> 01:05:50.860
which was a residential area that I mentioned was it was,
uh,

1018
01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:54.220
had in it mostly these wooden apartment houses,

1019
01:05:54.221 --> 01:05:57.700
large numbers of people lived in the suburbs.
So there was the street,

1020
01:05:57.701 --> 01:05:59.830
the argillite item that,
uh,
that,
uh,

1021
01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:02.890
attached the two or the connected the two to one another.

1022
01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:07.740
And demission decided to use that as a forum to himself,
uh,

1023
01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:11.860
that would be placed next to that if his father,
uh,
Andy placed in that forum,

1024
01:06:11.861 --> 01:06:16.780
a temple of his patron goddess Minerva is patron goddess was Minerva.
And he,
he,

1025
01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:17.140
he,

1026
01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:22.140
he built a temple to honor her in this location because this forum was so,

1027
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:27.320
it was like a street and was so narrow,
uh,
that had,

1028
01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:32.080
that had an effect on what could be built there.
So that you can see,
for example,

1029
01:06:32.081 --> 01:06:35.500
in plan that while the forums of Julius Caesar,

1030
01:06:35.501 --> 01:06:40.501
an Augustus and the foreign pockets all had colonnades covered colonnades.

1031
01:06:41.021 --> 01:06:44.860
In fact,
there was no space to build a covered colonnade here.

1032
01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:49.600
So what they had to do was place the columns very close to the wall,
uh,

1033
01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:53.920
and not put any ceiling on top of those columns.

1034
01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.940
You can see the same here.
This is a plan of the,
uh,

1035
01:06:57.941 --> 01:07:02.941
of the original forum of demission or what was called the forum transitory IOM

1036
01:07:04.361 --> 01:07:08.620
because it served as a point of transit between the [inaudible] and the Roman

1037
01:07:08.621 --> 01:07:09.430
forum.

1038
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:13.180
The temple of Minerva over here consistent with temple architecture as we've

1039
01:07:13.181 --> 01:07:17.950
seen it thus far this semester.
Uh,
a temple with a frontal orientation,

1040
01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:20.980
single staircase,
a facade orientation,

1041
01:07:20.981 --> 01:07:25.540
freestanding columns in the porch and so on.
Uh,
the entrance way over here,

1042
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:29.860
the forum pockets would be here form of Caesar and Augustus at the top.

1043
01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:35.220
And then you can see these bases for the columns very close to the wall and not

1044
01:07:35.981 --> 01:07:36.761
attached to it,

1045
01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:40.780
but very close to the wall on either side because there's no space for

1046
01:07:40.781 --> 01:07:41.614
colonnades.

1047
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:46.630
He is a Google earth image showing the imperial for as it looks today,

1048
01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.850
part of the later forum of Trajan,

1049
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000
the forum of Augustus and what is preserved of the so called forum transitory

1050
01:07:54.341 --> 01:07:55.210
him over here.

1051
01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:59.320
This is a model of what the forum transitory and would have looked like in

1052
01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:03.970
ancient Roman times and the time of demission with the temple of Minerva,
uh,

1053
01:08:03.971 --> 01:08:05.620
with these columns and either side.

1054
01:08:05.621 --> 01:08:08.710
And you can see from this model the difference that that makes when you don't

1055
01:08:08.711 --> 01:08:11.290
have enough space to build covered colonnades.

1056
01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:15.260
You've got columns that look like they are projecting out of the wall with

1057
01:08:15.261 --> 01:08:17.840
projecting and tablature is on top of them.

1058
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:21.050
We have not seen this before in built architecture.

1059
01:08:21.051 --> 01:08:24.380
This is a very important development.
We have seen it in painting,

1060
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:28.130
but we haven't seen it in built architecture.
Here's a detail of the forum,

1061
01:08:28.131 --> 01:08:30.290
transitory them with these columns.

1062
01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:33.590
A placed almost flush with the wall of though not quite the project,

1063
01:08:33.591 --> 01:08:37.510
a little bit in front of the wall with the projecting and tablatures the

1064
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:41.810
building,
the walls made out of two full blocks.
As you can see here,

1065
01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.630
the rest with marble and a panel at the top.

1066
01:08:44.631 --> 01:08:47.990
And we think that would have been lots of such panels representing the Goddess

1067
01:08:47.991 --> 01:08:50.990
Minerva Hymns herself.
So we see that here.

1068
01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.390
We have not seen it in built architecture before,

1069
01:08:53.391 --> 01:08:54.950
but we have seen it in painting.

1070
01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:59.090
This is a detail of curriculum 16 in the Ville of the mysteries.

1071
01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:03.800
And you can see one such set of columns that project out of the wall with the

1072
01:09:03.801 --> 01:09:06.720
projecting and tablatures up of Bob.
Uh,

1073
01:09:06.730 --> 01:09:11.730
so it's something again that we think may have been done in a temporary wooden

1074
01:09:12.111 --> 01:09:16.670
architecture for example.
Uh,
but keep in mind how early that painting is.

1075
01:09:16.671 --> 01:09:20.690
You all know the data because you've studied it for the exam.
It's mid BC,

1076
01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:24.440
so it's way before even the Augustan period.

1077
01:09:24.710 --> 01:09:28.850
And yet we see that there and now we finally see it in built architecture and

1078
01:09:28.851 --> 01:09:32.570
it's going to have a real history in Roman architecture in a very different way

1079
01:09:32.571 --> 01:09:33.710
than concrete does.

1080
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:38.950
This whole idea of decorating a wall by placing a series of columns that project

1081
01:09:39.411 --> 01:09:40.910
in and out along that wall,

1082
01:09:40.911 --> 01:09:45.260
giving it a kind of using the traditional language of architecture columns to

1083
01:09:45.261 --> 01:09:48.470
create a kind of undulating wall or what we're going to call later in the

1084
01:09:48.471 --> 01:09:53.360
semester a baroque,
a wall to details of the uh,

1085
01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:53.961
some of the,

1086
01:09:53.961 --> 01:09:58.961
one of the surviving capitals with the freeze up above a freeze that represents

1087
01:09:59.271 --> 01:10:00.650
scenes of women weaving.

1088
01:10:00.651 --> 01:10:04.230
I'm not going to get into the meaning of all of that here today,
uh,

1089
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:08.240
but you can see the way in which the columns project somewhat out of the wall,

1090
01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.420
Corinthian capitals projecting and tablature,

1091
01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:13.580
very highly decorated,

1092
01:10:13.581 --> 01:10:17.840
just like all the Flavian architectural ornament.
Uh,

1093
01:10:17.841 --> 01:10:21.170
as you can see here,
very deeply drilled and so on and so forth.

1094
01:10:21.171 --> 01:10:25.310
But this whole idea of decorating a wall in this way and instilling movement in

1095
01:10:25.311 --> 01:10:29.870
that wall by this undulating in and out a scheme is going to again,

1096
01:10:29.871 --> 01:10:32.930
have a very important future enrollment architecture.

1097
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:36.680
This is an interesting view because it shows us just what we've looked at.

1098
01:10:36.681 --> 01:10:40.790
Some of those remaining columns from the so called form transitory and which was

1099
01:10:40.791 --> 01:10:44.870
renamed the forum of Nero after demission is deaf and dumb,

1100
01:10:44.871 --> 01:10:48.080
not tio memoria.
I Nero just took it over and said,
okay,

1101
01:10:48.081 --> 01:10:51.110
it's my forum now and renamed it to himself,

1102
01:10:51.111 --> 01:10:53.540
but didn't add anything architecturally to it.

1103
01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:57.710
We see it here and this is one of those great views in which you can see the

1104
01:10:57.711 --> 01:11:00.950
difference between modern ground level and ancient ground level.

1105
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:04.820
In order to see the lower part of the form is got to go right up to the edge of

1106
01:11:04.821 --> 01:11:06.410
the street and looked down on it.

1107
01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:11.740
And this also a interesting engraving by the famous artists Pyrrhonese

1108
01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.510
Pyrrhonese print of the 18th century.
I did a lot,

1109
01:11:15.511 --> 01:11:19.170
a lot of wonderful prince and event.
If there's any interest in this class,

1110
01:11:19.171 --> 01:11:21.960
by the way,
we have plenty of these at Yale.

1111
01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.420
And I know one of the teaching fellows,
if not more than one,

1112
01:11:24.421 --> 01:11:27.720
would be more than happy to,
to uh,
to uh,

1113
01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:32.810
find a time to take those of you who might be interested in looking at Pyrenees

1114
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:33.720
Prince of Rome,
uh,

1115
01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:37.860
over to the British arts centre and so on to or elsewhere to take a look at

1116
01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:38.340
these.

1117
01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:42.930
But what's interesting about this one is it shows where the ground level was at

1118
01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:46.370
the time that this was in grave by,
uh,

1119
01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:50.670
Pyrrhonese that is in the 18th century.
It was pretty much where it is here.

1120
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:53.970
It was much,
much higher than it is now.

1121
01:11:53.971 --> 01:11:56.160
And then when they excavated it in modern times,

1122
01:11:56.161 --> 01:12:00.660
they got us down to ancient ground level and to the bottoms of the columns.

1123
01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:03.480
I want to end up with this one last image,
uh,

1124
01:12:03.570 --> 01:12:07.980
because we have very different Wendy a very different,

1125
01:12:07.981 --> 01:12:11.430
but uh,
it,
it,
it,
it allows us to continue on with a,

1126
01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:15.000
with a point that I made when we discussed the coliseum and which has already

1127
01:12:15.001 --> 01:12:17.220
turned up in the online forum.

1128
01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:22.640
And that is the use of a Roman buildings as quarries for later architects and

1129
01:12:24.031 --> 01:12:24.870
later patrons,

1130
01:12:24.871 --> 01:12:29.580
namely princes and popes and the way in which buildings like the Colosseum where

1131
01:12:29.581 --> 01:12:30.450
pirated,
uh,

1132
01:12:30.451 --> 01:12:35.070
for later architecture in the case of the forum transitory him or the form of

1133
01:12:35.071 --> 01:12:38.370
nerve or we know that the temple of Minerva,

1134
01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:40.470
that the material out of which it's made,

1135
01:12:40.471 --> 01:12:43.050
the reason that it does not exist at all today,

1136
01:12:43.051 --> 01:12:47.900
the temple of Minerva is that it was taken apart and re reused,
uh,

1137
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.000
by Pope Paul the fifth for a fountain that he wanted to build on the [inaudible]

1138
01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:58.230
hill in Rome,
the socal Aqua Paolo,
which you see here.

1139
01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:03.480
And the Aqua Paula,
the,
uh,
the temple was torn down in 1606,

1140
01:13:03.481 --> 01:13:08.130
it's still stood in 1606.
It was torn down then and it was placed in,

1141
01:13:08.131 --> 01:13:11.640
this founder are used for the construction of this fountain that was dedicated

1142
01:13:11.641 --> 01:13:16.230
in 16,
12 and built by the architect,
Giovanni Fontana.

1143
01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:21.640
And you see it here.
Uh,
and it's not easy to determine exactly which is,
you know,

1144
01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:24.090
which parts are from the temple itself,

1145
01:13:24.091 --> 01:13:27.720
but much of the building stone that you see here,
he reused in this fountain,

1146
01:13:27.930 --> 01:13:31.320
comes from the Temple of Minerva in Rome.

1147
01:13:31.321 --> 01:13:33.900
So it shows you the way,
again,

1148
01:13:33.901 --> 01:13:35.910
the way in which these buildings were used as quarries,

1149
01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.980
but the way in which Roman buildings live on,

1150
01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:41.250
they either live on as themselves or they live on as other buildings.

1151
01:13:41.251 --> 01:13:45.480
And I think that's a nice,
a nice thought and a nice note on which to end today.

1152
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.080
Thank you.
