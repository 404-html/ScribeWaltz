1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.850
Good morning everyone.
Augustus founded the Julio,

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.260
Claudia and dynasty.
Uh,
the name says it all.
Julio,

3
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.200
Claudia and Julio for the Julian side of the family.

4
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:17.220
Julius Caesar Augustus,
uh,
the Claudia,

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.930
the Claudia and for the Claudia and side of the family that was Augustus.

6
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:26.880
His wife's from a full Augustus,
his wife,
uh,
from a,

7
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.220
for her,
her side of the family,
excuse me,

8
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.490
the Claudia and side of the family and there were four emperors in the Julio,

9
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:38.700
Claudia and dynasty.
These were tybee,
serious Caligula,

10
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.270
Claudius and neuro,
every one of them.

11
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:47.271
All four made an important contribution to the evolution of Roman architecture

12
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:51.270
and we'll talk about the contributions of those for today.

13
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.980
But we'll also see that the single most important contribution from the

14
00:00:55.981 --> 00:01:00.030
standpoint of Roman architecture was by Nero,

15
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.960
the notorious Emperor Nero,
which is why I do call this lecture,
no tour,

16
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.990
notorious Nero and his amazing architectural legacy,

17
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.410
an architectural legacy that would have been impossible without some of the

18
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.200
earlier concrete constructions that we've already discussed.

19
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.440
Specifically the frigging Daria up Pompei and also the thermal bath at Baia,

20
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:28.500
which I remind you of here.
The so called Temple of Mercury.

21
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.360
We see it again with its dome made out of concrete construction,

22
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.310
a view from the exterior and down here at the left of view of the interior of

23
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:39.001
the monument.

24
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:44.001
And I remind you of the way in which that is designed so that light streams

25
00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:49.161
through the oculus in the dome down on to the sides of the wall,

26
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.400
uh,
creating light effects,
uh,
a circle,
uh,
that,

27
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.310
that cohort corresponds to the shape of the opening above,
uh,

28
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.650
and then falling initially on the pool of water that would have been located

29
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.460
there as well as across the,
uh,
walls,

30
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:07.080
which probably would have been,

31
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.370
that was certainly stuccoed over and probably would have been covered with

32
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:15.960
mosaic.
So a very spectacular interior indeed.

33
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.860
And one again,

34
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.890
that had an important impact as we'll see on the architectural designs of the

35
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.760
Roman Emperor Nero.
I want to begin though with the first of the Julio,

36
00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:30.990
Claudia and emperors and that is with Tiberius and you see a portrait of

37
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:34.740
Tiberius now on the screen.
Just to give you a sense of what he looked like.

38
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.750
A Tiberius again,
the son of Livia by a former marriage,

39
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:43.140
the elder son of Libya by a former marriage,
uh,

40
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:46.560
who becomes a emperor of Rome right after Augustus.

41
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:51.561
And the portrait that you see here is a marble portrait of Tiberius that is now

42
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:54.930
in the knee,
Carlsberg,
glip ditech in Copenhagen.

43
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.210
Tiberius was emperor of Rome from 14 to 37 a d.

44
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.050
And with regard to architecture,

45
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:08.260
he completed projects begun by Augustus.

46
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.650
He also was responsible for restoring Republican buildings that had fallen into

47
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:17.350
sin,
into severe disrepair by his reign.

48
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.740
And this included several temple's a basilica warehouses and also a theater.

49
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.200
Tiberias also initiated some new building projects in Rome.

50
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.650
These included a temple to the divine Augustus temple to a d was our goose does

51
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.390
his divine adoptive father because Augustus was made a god is Caesar had been

52
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:41.920
before him at his death.

53
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.310
Tiberius also put up a series of arches to his relatives and also a camp for the

54
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:51.700
Praetorian guard.

55
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.460
But what we'll see about Tiberius is that his real passion was not the public

56
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:00.160
architecture that Augustus had been so fond of.

57
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:04.570
Think the forum of Augustus and the Temple of Marzel tour or the Arra pocket

58
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.460
goose die,
which were among a Augustus is most important building projects.

59
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.460
Tiberius was interested in stead in private architecture.

60
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:19.330
Architecture is sense for himself and his nearest and dearest.

61
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.260
And he began a palace on the Palatine Hill.

62
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:27.880
He did not think the small modest house of Augustus despite the fact that it had

63
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:29.320
those nicely painted walls.

64
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.850
He did not think that that be fit his own grand juror.
Uh,

65
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.860
and he began a major palace on the Palatine Hill on the northwest side of the

66
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:43.411
Palatine hill and he renovated and built villas elsewhere outside of Rome,

67
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.260
especially on the spectacular island of Capri.

68
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.450
And indeed during the reign of Augustus and also the reign of Tiberius,

69
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.030
that family that the Augustan and Julio,

70
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.390
Claudia and family built 12 villas.

71
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:05.410
Count them 12 villas on the island of Capri.

72
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.840
One more spectacular than the next.

73
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:11.720
It's worth mentioning by the way that Augustus is tastes even in villas with

74
00:05:11.721 --> 00:05:16.060
somewhat more modest than Tiberius.
Augustus used to decorate his villa.

75
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:20.860
We are told a with dinosaur bones and things like that of historical interest.

76
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.220
Whereas Tiberius spared no expense in introducing every luxury of possible in to

77
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.850
his villas with regard to the palace on the Palatine Hill,

78
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:38.380
the so called Domus Tybee Arianna,
I just want to mention it in passing,

79
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:42.490
there's very little that survives of the substructures,

80
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:46.810
that type Bearius was responsible for beginning a for that palace.

81
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.220
They were made out of concrete construction and you can see here what's called

82
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:52.520
the Cleveland Palatino,

83
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.650
which is a ramp way leading from the Roman forum up to the hill and you can see

84
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:01.610
some of the remains of those substructures over here.

85
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.210
The ones that we see we're probably restored later in pro,
may not,

86
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:08.030
may or may not date to the Thai Berrien period,

87
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:12.860
but they give you some idea of the sort of construction that he began on the

88
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:13.640
Palatine Hill.

89
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.870
And I mentioned this just because we'll see that Caligula and some of the other

90
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:21.760
emperors continue to add to this palace.
And then the entire,
uh,

91
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.810
Palatine hill is redesigned by the emperor demission in the late first century.

92
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:30.830
A D much more interesting and much more.

93
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:33.510
And there's much more information for us to,
uh,

94
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.410
to look at are the villas on the island of Capri.

95
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:41.240
And I'm going to show you one of the best preserved from that island.
Uh,

96
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:46.241
the so called Villa Joe vis the village Ovis the villa of Jupiter,

97
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.450
which is an interesting name when you think about it for a villa,

98
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.890
for the emperor Tiberius,
the village Ovis,
which was put up,
uh,

99
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.580
some time in the years in which Tiberius was emperor,

100
00:06:58.581 --> 00:07:01.040
that is from 14 to 37.

101
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.840
It's a spectacular place,
beautifully situated.

102
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.060
And I'm going to take you there today.
Now,

103
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:10.100
the only way to get to the island of coppery,

104
00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:13.700
which by the way is one of my very favorite places in the world.

105
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.840
I don't know how many of you been there,
but it's quite extraordinary.
Uh,

106
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.090
the island of copper,
you can't jet to the island of copper.

107
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:24.660
You have to arrive there by boat.
Uh,
and most people take a boat,
uh,
if,

108
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.450
unless they have a private yacht.

109
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.190
But those of us who don't have to take a boat either from Naples,
uh,

110
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.220
usually a hydrofoil,
although they have larger boats as well,

111
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.730
a hydrofoil from Naples or from Posey Tano.

112
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.480
And I actually show you this is a view on the left hand side of the screen,

113
00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:45.200
a posy Tano on the Amalfi coast.
You go down to the beach,

114
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.740
there's a place where you can pick up a hydrofoil takes a very short time,

115
00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:50.030
half an hour or so,

116
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:54.110
less little bit less to get over to the island of coppery from Posey Tonah.

117
00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:57.050
So we're sitting on one of those hydrofoils,
or at least eight of us are,

118
00:07:57.051 --> 00:07:59.060
cause that's usually what they fit.
Uh,

119
00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:04.061
and we are making our way from Posey Tano toward coppery as you go there,

120
00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:08.760
if the weather is good enough and if the,
if the sea is calm enough,
uh,

121
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.660
they will take you to see the famous grottoes,
the Green Grotto,

122
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:14.930
and also the blue grotto.
Uh,
and,
uh,
again,

123
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.960
I can just give you a little sense here in this view of how blue is blue.

124
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:23.330
I mean,
it's really a neon blue.
When you go to see the blue grotto,

125
00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:28.160
it's a spectacular sight and a very special color blue that you really don't see

126
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.780
anywhere else in the world.

127
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:33.290
So they'll drive you around in the hydrofoil to see the grottoes and then you

128
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:36.390
eventually get to the dock at coppery.

129
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:41.430
And this is what you see as you get off the boat at the island of Capri.

130
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.920
Uh,
a very,
uh,
a very,
again,
very beautiful spot to visit.

131
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.910
As you go up,
you make your way from the doc,
uh,
up to the finished color,

132
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.070
take the finical or up to the main part of town.
Uh,

133
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.650
and one of the first things you see is the popular bar t Berio.
I show it to you,

134
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:01.080
not to,
it's a fun place to go,

135
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:05.460
but I show it to mainly because it's one of these examples of the way in which

136
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:10.461
the Roman emperors have had a lasting impact even today that so many of these

137
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:15.681
bars and restaurants and so on are named for a Rome's emperors or for some of

138
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:19.410
the monuments that we'd been studying in the course of this semester.

139
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:22.050
And this bar is no exception.
And in fact,
if you go,

140
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:25.680
if you go through the doors that lead into the interior of the bar,

141
00:09:25.681 --> 00:09:30.540
you will see a,
a,
a portrait of Tiberius etched on the doorway.

142
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:35.540
So Tiberias very much throw lives and thrives in the center of downtown coppery.

143
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:38.290
Uh,

144
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:43.290
still today what most tourists go to coppery to see besides just to walk around

145
00:09:43.871 --> 00:09:46.800
the magnificent island and to test out some of the beaches,

146
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:49.000
which tend to be on the rocky side,
uh,

147
00:09:49.001 --> 00:09:52.110
is to see the most famous rocks of coppery.

148
00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:55.170
And these are the so called Farchioni.
You see them here,

149
00:09:55.171 --> 00:10:00.171
you go up to the so called gardens of Augustus and then up to a spot where you

150
00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:06.930
can see these particularly well.
They're magnificent.
They are,
uh,

151
00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:11.790
a the landmark spot on the island of Capri and they have survived,

152
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:12.300
uh,

153
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:17.300
coastal landslides and see erosion to look as as wonderful as they still do

154
00:10:18.571 --> 00:10:21.570
today.
And this is of course the photo op on the island.

155
00:10:21.571 --> 00:10:25.080
I don't think there's anyone who visits coppery who doesn't take a photo or have

156
00:10:25.081 --> 00:10:28.370
a photo taken of themselves at the far ione.

157
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.400
The villa that I wanted to show you is again,

158
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:36.690
the best preserved villa of Tiberius on coppery.
Uh,
and again,

159
00:10:36.691 --> 00:10:40.590
I mentioned that it's called the village Novus and a dates to 14 to 37.

160
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:44.640
And it's,
it's a trek to get up there.
Uh,
you,

161
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.900
you have to walk.

162
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.930
Essentially the streets are such that there are no cabs or cars that can get you

163
00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:54.000
there.
You have to,
to make it on your own.

164
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:58.770
And there are two paths I've made the mistake of taking the floor arduous path,

165
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:02.310
which looks like this,
uh,
to get up to the top.
But there are,

166
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.030
there's another path also that takes you by,
uh,

167
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.460
some very attractive houses and villas which are fun to see.

168
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.860
And you will see the most,

169
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.530
the largest lemons has anyone ever been on the island of Capri.

170
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:16.290
And you'll see the largest lemons in,
in,
in,

171
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.940
on coppery as well as on the Amalfi coast in general that you've ever seen

172
00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:25.690
anywhere.
Gigantic Lemons on lemon trees as you make your way up to,
uh,

173
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.060
the villa,

174
00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.430
the villa jove is now here is a plan of the village office as well as a cross

175
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:35.520
section from the Ward Perkins Textbook.

176
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.440
And if we look first at the cross section,
at the upper most part of the screen,

177
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.680
you will see the way this,
this building was made.

178
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.370
Or you will see that the architects have taken advantage of developments in

179
00:11:47.371 --> 00:11:52.320
concrete construction to create a series of barrel vaults in tears.

180
00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.790
And those barrel vaults and tears are,

181
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:58.480
are where are the cisterns of the villa,
where,

182
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.410
where the water was kept to supply the baths and the kitchen.

183
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:05.590
And so on of the villa.
You see those there.

184
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.660
And in this plan down here,

185
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:12.010
you can see the cisterns again and the way in which a pavement has been placed

186
00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:17.011
on top of those tiers of barrel bolts to create a very large court here.

187
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.080
The entrance way into Tiberias is villa on coppery,
uh,

188
00:12:23.081 --> 00:12:24.220
was over here.

189
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:29.070
You can see a series of columns for in total,
uh,

190
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.530
that you see as you make your way into the entrance way of the villa.

191
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.990
Along this side of the villa,

192
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.050
which is the southern side of the villa,

193
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.890
you see the baths not surprisingly placed on the southern side,

194
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:45.580
extensive bath structure,
uh,
for the emperor.

195
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.670
On the western side,

196
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:53.700
you see a series of rooms that are for the entourage of Tiberius.

197
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.390
The kitchen is located on this side as well.

198
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.410
And then perhaps the most important room of the house from our standpoint,

199
00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:05.230
the hall or the Owl Aula,

200
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.070
the Allah of Tiberius,
his villa at coppery.

201
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.650
And you can see the shape of that Allah.
It's a kind of Hemi cycle,
uh,

202
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:18.690
with large picture windows that allow views that lie outside and it should

203
00:13:19.151 --> 00:13:23.410
remind you of the second phase of the Ville of the mysteries in palm pay,

204
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:28.590
where we also saw that attractive bay window with the panoramic views out beyond

205
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:34.360
the panoramic views were much more spectacular here than even in,

206
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.430
uh,
from the villa of the mysteries.

207
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:40.590
Because as I think you can see also from this site plan,
uh,

208
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.710
that this is located right at the edge of a promontory.
Uh,

209
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.760
it's in fact 1095 feet above sea level and you get some incredible views of,

210
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:53.250
uh,

211
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:58.250
of the sea and of other islands from this location on this side.

212
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.860
The northern side of the structure is where the apartments of Tiberius,

213
00:14:05.351 --> 00:14:10.351
we're located a series of rooms for the emperor himself and including also an

214
00:14:10.871 --> 00:14:15.640
imperial lodge where he could walk out and get some attractive panoramas

215
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.070
privately on his own.

216
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.930
You can also see that there is a corridor that leads from the private apartment

217
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.790
to this very long walkway that is located right at the edge of the cliff on this

218
00:14:27.791 --> 00:14:32.560
side.
This is called technically an ambu lot,
tio,
a m,
B,

219
00:14:32.561 --> 00:14:37.240
u,
l a,
t,
I,
O n,
Omd Nulato.
And it was just for that.

220
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.420
It was for,
for,
for taking pleasant walks,

221
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.390
getting nice views of the sea from there,

222
00:14:43.391 --> 00:14:46.060
especially for the emperor and special invited guests.

223
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.740
And right in the center was a try Klinean you see it right here at Tri Klinean

224
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:55.770
or dining room where the emperor could dine a and could look out again over,

225
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.510
uh,
views that were,
uh,
uh,

226
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:04.190
possible from this particular locale.
This is a view,

227
00:15:04.191 --> 00:15:05.750
unfortunately in black and white,

228
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:10.430
but it's the only one that I had that gives you a sense of the remains today

229
00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:14.870
from above the extent of those remains.
And you can see again,

230
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:16.220
the concrete construction,

231
00:15:16.221 --> 00:15:19.880
I think quite well from this as well as the fact that although all the

232
00:15:19.881 --> 00:15:23.330
foundation walls are there,
there's no decoration,

233
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:26.660
the ceilings are all are missing.
Uh,
and so on and so forth.

234
00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:31.220
You see the sister in here,
the location of the owl up here,
the uh,

235
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.083
the,
uh,

236
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:37.300
area for the entourage of Tiberius and the private apartment on that side,

237
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:41.420
a church and a statue on a base were added later.

238
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.420
And so of course you need to think those away.

239
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.460
This is a view of some of the remains as they look today.

240
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:53.510
Just to give you a sense that when you're actually up there and wandering
around,

241
00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.230
uh,
the walls don't go up all that far,

242
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.210
but you can also see that they,

243
00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:02.960
they do preserve the entire plan of the structure,

244
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:06.680
which is why we have such a good idea of what it looked like in antiquity and

245
00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:08.990
how all of those pieces fit together.

246
00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.040
You can see that the construction is concrete and the facing his stone,

247
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:16.470
a irregular stone work,
the kind of openness and care him work,
uh,

248
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:20.770
that we've seen elsewhere in Campania.
Because remember this is a,

249
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.890
this is an island,

250
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:26.570
but it's off the coast of Naples Pompei and a plant as it is in that same

251
00:16:26.571 --> 00:16:29.240
general area of Italy.
And this,

252
00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:33.350
this is one view and one I have many more spectacular ones in this one,

253
00:16:33.351 --> 00:16:36.710
but this is one that she gives you a sense of the sort of thing.

254
00:16:36.711 --> 00:16:41.470
You can see this one I took right from I think from near the um,
uh,

255
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.020
from near the [inaudible].
Uh,

256
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.910
just to give you an idea of what you see from their beautiful views of the sea

257
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:51.800
in some,
some,
some areas you can see the rocky outcroppings as you look down.

258
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:57.110
And then views of some other islands in the area.
For example,
Ischia and so on.

259
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:04.120
The successor to Tiberius was a man by the name of Caligula Caligula became

260
00:17:07.011 --> 00:17:10.580
emperor at the death of Tiberius.

261
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.110
And we see a portrait of him here on the right hand side of the screen.

262
00:17:15.111 --> 00:17:18.620
Just again,
to give you a sense of the man,
he had a very short,

263
00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:22.550
he was very young when he became emperor of Rome.
He had a very short rain,

264
00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.560
only three years,
uh,

265
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:29.590
and he was a somewhat unbalanced and it was not long after he became emperor.

266
00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:33.260
Oh by the way,
he was very popular when he was a boy.
He was a prince,

267
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.990
a very popular,
he used to run around the military camps with his family,
uh,

268
00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.950
in a little military costume.

269
00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:44.980
And he wore these distinctive military boots called the colleague a cal Iga,

270
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.070
which is how he got the nickname Caligula from those boots.

271
00:17:48.071 --> 00:17:52.800
He was extremely popular with everyone and everyone was quite excited when he

272
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:57.780
became emperor of Rome.
But his power went to his head.
He became a desk spot.

273
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.860
And,
uh,
he spent most of his time cavorting with his three sisters.

274
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:06.390
I show you them here on a,
uh,
on a coin.
Uh,

275
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:10.760
then they're all named Agra Pina.
Julia Andrew Scilla was his favorite.

276
00:18:10.761 --> 00:18:15.000
So of course she's in the center there to Scilla.
Uh,
and uh,

277
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:19.730
he also did strange things like conduct wars,
fat,
you know,

278
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.300
fat full wars,
essentially four wars with FAU enemies.
I,
for example,

279
00:18:24.301 --> 00:18:27.240
his war against Britain,
so,
so to speak.
Uh,

280
00:18:27.241 --> 00:18:32.241
and he also spent a good deal of time trying to work it out so that his horse in

281
00:18:33.171 --> 00:18:35.280
key Todd has,
could become a senator.

282
00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:39.570
So this gives you some idea of the kind of man we're dealing with here.

283
00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:43.200
He was occupied with all of that and really not that much with architecture.

284
00:18:43.201 --> 00:18:46.090
And again,
he was only on for for a very short time.

285
00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:50.160
So there was a limit to what kinds of architectural contributions he could make,

286
00:18:50.161 --> 00:18:51.210
but he didn't make none.

287
00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.240
I mean he made some and in fact one of them is particularly important.
Uh,

288
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:58.290
and I want to emphasize those two here.
So again,

289
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.950
Caligula was emperor between 37 and 41,

290
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.350
and he had little public building again.
He,
he,
he,
he uh,

291
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.740
continued the tradition of tybee serious and that is in having much more

292
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:15.741
interest in private villa architecture then in public architecture.

293
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.711
Uh,
but again,

294
00:19:16.711 --> 00:19:20.400
it's only fair we know as we judge him in terms of his architectural,

295
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:24.090
a contribution.
I think it's only fair to remind ourselves that again,

296
00:19:24.091 --> 00:19:26.970
he was only emperor for three years.
If he had been ember longer,

297
00:19:26.971 --> 00:19:30.480
perhaps his contribution would have been a greater,

298
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.020
he did finish several buildings begun by Tiberias.

299
00:19:34.021 --> 00:19:37.350
And we're going to see this as a pattern that is emperors coming to the fore and

300
00:19:37.351 --> 00:19:40.320
completing buildings,
uh,
by their predecessors.

301
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.420
And he did build a couple of new things,

302
00:19:42.421 --> 00:19:47.421
including two new aqua ducks and a circus located near what is now Vatican City.

303
00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.580
He added,
he thought the Domus tybee Ariana was a terrific idea.

304
00:19:53.581 --> 00:19:56.640
And consequently he added to that palace.

305
00:19:56.641 --> 00:20:01.200
That's the palace that Tiberius began on the slopes of the Palatine hill.

306
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.980
But his main interest was villas outside Rome.

307
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.040
He built a number of those when I'm not talking about coppery now,

308
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:11.880
those were already built and he could go down and enjoy those as emperor of
Rome.

309
00:20:11.881 --> 00:20:16.881
But he wanted to ring Rome with a series of villas and he began that work.

310
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:21.910
And later on,
according to Pliny,
the elder Rome was a ring with the villa's,

311
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.450
not only of Caligula but also of Nero.

312
00:20:24.451 --> 00:20:28.710
So these were going up a pace around the city of Rome itself.

313
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.990
The single most important contribution though that,
uh,
Caligula made,

314
00:20:33.991 --> 00:20:38.970
and it is very significant,
is to alter.
It was during his reign,

315
00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:43.971
during his brief reign that the recipe for Roman concrete construction was

316
00:20:44.131 --> 00:20:44.964
altered.

317
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:50.660
What they did was make the decision to lighten it up and they did that by taking

318
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:56.410
the stone rubble that had been used in the mixture of concrete for some time.

319
00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.800
Uh,
taking that stone rubble and dispensing with it,

320
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:04.690
getting rid of it because it was too heavy and mix the liquid mortar instead

321
00:21:04.691 --> 00:21:07.630
with a very porous yellow Tufa.

322
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.730
And also with pumice,

323
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:13.810
which is a soft light stone resembling cork.

324
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.980
So when you think of replacing heavy rubble was something that resembles cork,

325
00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:18.341
uh,

326
00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:22.660
you get the sense that that is going to lead to lighter doms lighter domes are

327
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:26.260
going to lead to domes that are able to span greater spaces.

328
00:21:26.261 --> 00:21:30.790
So this is no small accomplishment.
This is very,
very significant.

329
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:35.660
It happens during the reign of Caligula and we'll see already today that the,
uh,

330
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.820
so called Golden House or dome salary of Nero would not have been possible.

331
00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:44.290
The span of that dome would not have been possible without this change in the

332
00:21:44.291 --> 00:21:47.710
recipe in concrete that happened under [inaudible].

333
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.930
The other development under Caligula that I want to make reference to really has

334
00:21:52.931 --> 00:21:54.490
more to do with religious practice,

335
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:59.020
but it has also has an important impact on architecture.

336
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.100
And that is the impact of mystery cults on Roman religion.

337
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.770
I think I've mentioned to you already that the Romans practiced,
uh,

338
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:11.590
a state religion and that state religion was considered the religion that

339
00:22:11.591 --> 00:22:14.710
everyone should adhere to.
But over time,

340
00:22:14.711 --> 00:22:18.040
because of Rome's connections to other parts of the empire,

341
00:22:18.041 --> 00:22:20.380
especially the eastern empire,

342
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:26.020
a whole host of different kinds of religions,
mystery,

343
00:22:26.021 --> 00:22:29.830
religions,
exotic religions,
began to infiltrate Rome.

344
00:22:29.831 --> 00:22:34.480
They came back through the army,
they came back through commerce to Rome.

345
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:38.320
And initially they were not accepted.
You couldn't,
uh,

346
00:22:38.321 --> 00:22:41.140
you were not allowed to practice these openly.

347
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.770
And so we saw an example was the Ville of the mysteries where,
uh,

348
00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:49.630
the woman of the house created a special room room number five for the

349
00:22:49.631 --> 00:22:54.160
celebration of the cult of Dionysus because that was considered a secret

350
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.500
religion at that particular point.

351
00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:00.910
But these mystery religions Caligula himself showed some interest in them and

352
00:23:00.911 --> 00:23:01.481
they began,

353
00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:06.190
it began to look as if perhaps they would be able to begin to come up from

354
00:23:06.191 --> 00:23:10.330
underground.
They didn't during his reign,
but I think,
uh,
again,

355
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:14.680
his contribution in that in that way was also an important one.

356
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:19.450
They did continue to have to meet in secret and one sector in particular I want

357
00:23:19.451 --> 00:23:24.090
to make reference to today,
the so called neopathy Korean sect.
Uh,

358
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:28.120
because we will see in the next monument that I want to show you that it was

359
00:23:28.121 --> 00:23:33.121
that sect that was celebrated in a very interesting underground basilica that I

360
00:23:34.031 --> 00:23:37.840
want to turn to now.
It doesn't date to the time of collegial,
in fact,

361
00:23:37.841 --> 00:23:40.810
it's a little bit later in the reign of Claudius,

362
00:23:40.811 --> 00:23:45.650
but I want to show it to you here because again,
it was collegial as you know,

363
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:50.710
beginning to be more accepting of these kinds of things that led in part to

364
00:23:50.841 --> 00:23:55.160
their proliferation initially underground and above ground as well.

365
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.660
This is the so called underground basilica because it is located underground

366
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:03.800
dates to around Aidy 50.
Uh,
and,
uh,

367
00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:08.510
you can see from this site plan,
it's location.
I can see it,

368
00:24:08.511 --> 00:24:12.320
mark basilica up there.
Uh,
and you can see that it's near a street.

369
00:24:12.321 --> 00:24:15.380
We've already talked about the via Prajna,
Stena in Rome,

370
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:19.280
which you'll remember is one along with the via lobby conda that came and

371
00:24:19.281 --> 00:24:23.570
converge on the tomb of the baker that we looked at last time.
In fact,

372
00:24:23.571 --> 00:24:24.830
if you look at this site plan,

373
00:24:24.831 --> 00:24:29.390
you see the trap is idle plan of the tomb of the baker right here.

374
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.700
And when we discuss the tomb of the baker,

375
00:24:31.701 --> 00:24:36.500
I made the point to you that it was located or recited in front of a great gate,

376
00:24:36.501 --> 00:24:40.640
the so called Puerto majority or the great gate,
uh,
that was,
uh,
that,

377
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.810
that spanned two aqueducts.
And I said to you,

378
00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:49.700
I urge you to think away that a great gate,
uh,
because it was built later,

379
00:24:49.701 --> 00:24:52.460
it was built.
In fact,
during the reign of Claudius,
we're going to look at it.

380
00:24:52.461 --> 00:24:56.670
And momentarily.
So you see the great gate here and you see,
uh,

381
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.360
the tomb of the baker.
Uh,

382
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:03.680
and that gives you a sense of the location of the basilica,

383
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:07.930
the underground basilica of 50 a d.
If you look at that facility,

384
00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:12.170
you see the plan is exactly like the basilica in a civic context.

385
00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:14.600
The basilica at Pompei for example,

386
00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:17.450
with a central nave and two side aisles,

387
00:25:17.451 --> 00:25:22.190
a divided by that knave,
that central space,
uh,
through,

388
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:26.990
through architectural members in this case,
through peers rather than columns.

389
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:32.230
And then at the end to give some emphasis to one short side of this space,

390
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:36.200
a,
an apps that you also see there.
This is,

391
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:39.170
this underground basilica was used for religious worship.

392
00:25:39.171 --> 00:25:44.171
So we see once again what I've referred to as the interchangeability of form,

393
00:25:44.391 --> 00:25:48.140
the idea of creating a certain building plan for a civic center,

394
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:52.310
the law court or Basilica,
and then using it in other ways.

395
00:25:52.311 --> 00:25:57.311
We already saw the Basilican plan being used in house design at Herculaneum as a

396
00:25:57.561 --> 00:25:58.460
banqueting hall.

397
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.640
And here we see it as a religious place for religious worship underground.

398
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:04.430
Uh,

399
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:09.430
a basilican form being used for religious worship under ground.

400
00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:15.680
The underground basilica is miraculously preserved.
Why?

401
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:20.090
Because it's underground.
And,
uh,
it didn't,
it consequently was,
uh,

402
00:26:20.091 --> 00:26:23.000
was kept in very good shape over time.

403
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:27.590
It's very difficult to get permission to go down and see it.
But it is a marvel,

404
00:26:27.591 --> 00:26:29.690
as you can see from this image here.

405
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:33.320
How did they create this underground basilica?

406
00:26:33.321 --> 00:26:36.020
How did they make this building underground?
Well,

407
00:26:36.021 --> 00:26:39.800
they cut trenches in the two far rock and the two far rock.

408
00:26:39.801 --> 00:26:44.760
Remember we've talked about how ubiquitously too for rock was in,
in Rome,
uh,

409
00:26:44.761 --> 00:26:49.260
both,
uh,
on,
on the hillsides like the Palatine and elsewhere.

410
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.560
So they cut trenches in the Tufa rock and then they poured concrete into those

411
00:26:55.171 --> 00:26:58.290
trenches to create the walls.
Uh,

412
00:26:58.291 --> 00:27:02.640
and also the barrel vault that you see so well here.

413
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.390
And once that concrete had dried,
uh,

414
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:11.630
they cut it out in such a way as to create the peers that you also see very well

415
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.600
in this structure.
So we're looking at that central space.

416
00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:19.610
We're looking at the peers,
the arches above those peers,
uh,

417
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.640
and then that supporting a barrel vaulted ceiling as well as a semi bolt in the

418
00:27:25.861 --> 00:27:29.160
apps of this structure.
Another view,

419
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:33.990
gives you a sense of the relationship of the central space to the isles.

420
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.700
It's a fairly small structure,

421
00:27:35.701 --> 00:27:39.780
but nonetheless it is quite light and airy as I think you can see here.

422
00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:44.760
As we look from the central nave toward one of the side Oz can see the peers and

423
00:27:44.761 --> 00:27:46.290
the arches above those peers.

424
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.230
And you can also see the way in which the walls are decorated.

425
00:27:49.231 --> 00:27:50.460
They're made out of concrete,

426
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:55.470
but they're stuck out over and divided into a series of panels that are

427
00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.970
decorated with pretty strong resemblance to third style.

428
00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:05.160
And that resemblance becomes even clearer as we look up to the vault above a,

429
00:28:05.161 --> 00:28:06.420
this is how we,

430
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.600
we surmise that this building was put up to the neo Pythagorean cult because the

431
00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:16.880
figures that we see floating in the central panels here,
uh,

432
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:20.850
those who have a good understanding of the neopathy jaggery and called have

433
00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:24.360
suggested that these track,
uh,
extremely well.

434
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.590
The beliefs of this particular cult,
but interesting for us is again,

435
00:28:28.591 --> 00:28:31.980
the close resemblance of this to third style Roman wall painting.

436
00:28:31.981 --> 00:28:34.500
It's done in Stucco.
The stucco was painted,

437
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:38.910
but you can see it's divided into a series of panels with floating mythological

438
00:28:38.911 --> 00:28:43.650
figures.
It's our floating religious figures in this case,
inside the panels.

439
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.910
And look then very carefully at some of the floral decorations,

440
00:28:47.911 --> 00:28:52.911
which you will see also resemble very closely the flimsy candelabra and so on

441
00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:57.360
that are characteristic of third style Roman painting.

442
00:28:57.361 --> 00:28:58.380
This shouldn't surprise you,

443
00:28:58.381 --> 00:29:01.950
the data 50 and is still well within the third style.

444
00:29:01.951 --> 00:29:05.760
We talked about the very long life of the third style that it was used already

445
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.830
in the late first century BC,

446
00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:12.810
but that it didn't really go out until about 62,
a d so 50.

447
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.600
We're still in that period of the third style.
It doesn't surprise us,
uh,

448
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:21.680
to see decoration like this in this very interesting underground basilica.

449
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.630
Caligula was murdered,
uh,
in,
uh,

450
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:33.110
at the end of it was murdered and he and 41 and his wife and daughter,

451
00:29:34.171 --> 00:29:37.350
he had one daughter were also murdered at the same time.

452
00:29:37.351 --> 00:29:41.830
He had no family member to succeed.
Him and his uncle Claudius,
uh,

453
00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.800
was chosen as the next emperor of Rome.

454
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.810
Many of you may know the interesting story at the quite captivating story of
how,

455
00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.810
uh,
it,
Claudius was chosen as emperor.

456
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.050
He was someone who is not highly respected by his family.

457
00:29:56.051 --> 00:29:57.850
And I'll say more about that in a moment.

458
00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.950
No one ever thought he was going to amount to anything I,

459
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:05.640
and when after Caligula's death,
uh,
Claudius was such kind of timid,
uh,

460
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.210
that he hid behind a curtain.

461
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.350
But as the Praetorian guard wandered through the palace trying to figure out who

462
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:15.250
in the world they were going to a point as Caligula's success,

463
00:30:15.251 --> 00:30:18.370
if they saw a pair of feet underneath the curtain,

464
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:22.030
they pulled open that curtain and they saw Claudius and they thought,
oh,

465
00:30:22.031 --> 00:30:25.030
he's going to be no trouble at all.
No one thinks much of him.

466
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.230
We're going to be able to get everything we want if we appoint Claudia's as

467
00:30:29.231 --> 00:30:31.960
emperor.
And so they did.
They bowed down and they said,

468
00:30:31.961 --> 00:30:34.060
you are now where they put him up on their shoulders.

469
00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.000
You are now emperor of Rome.
Well,
Claudia,

470
00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:41.080
surprise them because he was very smart individual.
Indeed,
as we shall see,

471
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.480
this is a cameo,
a famous cameo that represents Claudius,

472
00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:49.150
just for you to get some sense of what he looked like over here on the left with

473
00:30:49.151 --> 00:30:52.570
his wife,
and then possibly these two figures over here,

474
00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:57.610
controversial possibly with Tiberius or some other member of the imperial

475
00:30:57.941 --> 00:31:00.670
family.
This is blown up into colossal size.

476
00:31:00.671 --> 00:31:02.830
It's a fairly small but very beautiful.

477
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:08.070
Cami on these cameos were used as presentation pieces in ancient Roman Times.

478
00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.990
Claudia's was emperor of Rome.

479
00:31:10.991 --> 00:31:15.070
Between Aidy 41 and 54 he,

480
00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.700
I mentioned that his family did not have much respect for him.

481
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:23.110
They thought he was weak and sickly and they thought he was dimwitted.

482
00:31:23.111 --> 00:31:26.110
And the only reason they thought he was dimwitted because the poor fellow

483
00:31:26.111 --> 00:31:30.870
stammered.
And they thought that that reflected,
uh,
a,
an undisciplined mind.

484
00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:34.780
Not at all.
He was very,
very intelligent indeed,

485
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:38.710
and he surprised them.
He surprised not only the Praetorian guard,

486
00:31:38.711 --> 00:31:41.230
but also his family.
When he became emperor.

487
00:31:41.231 --> 00:31:45.340
He turned out to be a unique individual with a predilection.

488
00:31:45.341 --> 00:31:49.680
As we shall see,
you bought a,
an entirely new kind of,
uh,

489
00:31:49.681 --> 00:31:54.681
and very distinctive form of architecture and one that I believe,

490
00:31:55.901 --> 00:31:58.060
and I'll try to make the case due today,
reflect,

491
00:31:58.061 --> 00:32:01.330
reflected his very distinctive intellect.

492
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:06.730
We need to know therefore something about him and how he came and had what he,

493
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:10.480
how he had trained himself intellectually before he became emperor of Rome.

494
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.540
He was 50 years old when he became emperor.

495
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:18.700
He had been in the years prior to that,
a scholar and a historian,

496
00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:20.980
an antiquarian,
a linguist,

497
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:25.460
he wrote a history of Rome by himself,
was not ghost written.

498
00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.950
And he wrote several volumes also on his own,
on the trust skins.

499
00:32:29.951 --> 00:32:32.380
He was particularly interested in the Etruscans.

500
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:37.480
We know he added a few letters to the Latin alphabet to give it more range.

501
00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.520
And he was the last as far as we know,

502
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.090
to be able to read and also write a trust.

503
00:32:44.091 --> 00:32:49.070
And this gives you a very good sense of the man.
Uh,
with regard to architecture.

504
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:54.071
He rejected categorically the interest of Tiberius and Caligula in villa

505
00:32:55.131 --> 00:33:00.020
architecture.
And he returned to the construction of public architecture.

506
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:05.200
He looked to Augustus as a model for this and especially to public works.

507
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.140
Let me show you one example.

508
00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:14.910
You see on the screen a site plan of the port of Rome.

509
00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:16.611
Uh,
W we,

510
00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:20.690
I've already mentioned the fact that the port of Rome was located at Osteon

511
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:23.300
Ostia,
the city at the mouth of the Tiber river.

512
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:28.600
We saw the plan of Ostia I colony already founded in the mid fourth century BC

513
00:33:29.331 --> 00:33:34.070
and around three 50 and it grew over time and it had its efflorescence as we'll

514
00:33:34.071 --> 00:33:38.810
see in a later lecture in the second century.
Aidy here,
the plan of,

515
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:43.010
uh,
of,
of a Ostia over here,
the Tiber River,

516
00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.240
and then at the mouth of the Tiber river at a place that we call Portas,

517
00:33:47.241 --> 00:33:51.560
a location that we call portals or Porto.
It's on the monument list for you.

518
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:53.810
The actual harbor itself.

519
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.470
What we're looking at above is a coin of the Emperor Nero.

520
00:33:57.471 --> 00:34:00.080
You see neuro on the arbors and on the reverse,

521
00:34:00.081 --> 00:34:04.670
a representation of what we think is the port built by Claudius.

522
00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:09.720
We have a description of the port of Claudius by Sue Atonia [inaudible],
uh,

523
00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.450
in his lives.
Sua Tony is,

524
00:34:11.451 --> 00:34:16.451
tells us that the port had curving breakwaters curving breakwaters.

525
00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:22.330
Uh,
and if we look at this coin of neuro that was struck,
uh,
by,
uh,

526
00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:27.450
by the emperor between 64 and 68 a d we see on the back,

527
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.600
uh,
what is clearly a port with curving breakwaters.

528
00:34:31.601 --> 00:34:36.601
So we believe that this must be a depiction of the port built built by Claudia

529
00:34:37.281 --> 00:34:41.810
sometime during his reign that is between 41 and 54.

530
00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:46.790
What does that coin tell us about what that,
uh,
port must've looked like?

531
00:34:46.791 --> 00:34:50.870
We can see that there is a large statue in the upper center.

532
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:55.640
There is a river God reclining below probably the Tiber himself to locate,

533
00:34:55.900 --> 00:35:00.020
uh,
this port a and also a series of boats in the center.

534
00:35:00.021 --> 00:35:02.870
But most important,
again,
are the curving break waters,

535
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:06.080
which you can see are made up of a series of columns.

536
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:10.250
They look like colonnades one on either side,
curving colonnades.

537
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.260
This plan down here,
uh,

538
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.240
shows us the likely plan of the Claudia and harbor,

539
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:19.220
roughly circular,
uh,

540
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:23.870
again with breakwaters on either side with columns on either side.

541
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:27.320
This area was added to by the Emperor Trajan,

542
00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:32.240
the early second century aids.
He added a five sided,

543
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.250
uh,
port as well.

544
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:38.130
And you can see that here in this plan as well.

545
00:35:38.131 --> 00:35:39.510
But think that away for now.

546
00:35:39.511 --> 00:35:43.660
All that would have been there was Claudius is port with the curving break

547
00:35:43.661 --> 00:35:44.494
waters.

548
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:49.520
This is a painting of both of those ports that's on the wall and the Vatican.

549
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.750
I walked by in many times and only recently really noticed it and took a picture

550
00:35:54.751 --> 00:35:58.770
of it and I think it'll be helpful to you today because it gives you a sense of

551
00:35:58.771 --> 00:36:01.500
what this port looked like in antiquity equity.

552
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.470
We see the later port of trade and over here,
but again,

553
00:36:04.471 --> 00:36:09.080
think that away for now and concentrate on the curving break waters of Claudia

554
00:36:09.081 --> 00:36:11.880
says port.
You see here,
this colossal statue,

555
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.720
possibly of Neptune over here.
Uh,

556
00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:19.410
a light house over here and uh,
the boats in the center of this.

557
00:36:19.411 --> 00:36:21.000
But most important for us,
again,

558
00:36:21.001 --> 00:36:25.110
are those curving break waters and the fact that they were made up of columns.

559
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:30.470
The columns are all that survived today and what a set of columns they are.

560
00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:31.430
Uh,

561
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:36.360
I show a detail of some of them to you here and you should be struck by these

562
00:36:36.361 --> 00:36:41.040
columns because these are columns unlike any other columns that we have seen in

563
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:45.600
the course of this semester.
If you look at these columns very carefully,

564
00:36:45.601 --> 00:36:49.680
you will see,
uh,
that the base that the capital's on the top,

565
00:36:49.681 --> 00:36:52.440
which are very severe,
they're not exactly the doric order,

566
00:36:52.441 --> 00:36:56.650
but they resemble the doric order,
very severe.
Uh,

567
00:36:56.651 --> 00:36:58.080
and they are finished.
You can,

568
00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:01.790
you can identify them as capitals and the bases.

569
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.900
I'll show you a view of a basis in a moment.

570
00:37:03.901 --> 00:37:08.901
The basis as we'll also see are also finished with very nice moldings down

571
00:37:09.301 --> 00:37:13.290
below.
But in between the bases and the capitals,

572
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.230
we see something again that we've never seen before.

573
00:37:16.231 --> 00:37:21.231
And that is a series of drums of column drums piled one on top of another.

574
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:26.310
But those drums are not finished or they're left in a rough state,

575
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:27.240
one or the other.

576
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:32.800
They have either been deliberately left in a Russ rough or [inaudible] state or

577
00:37:32.941 --> 00:37:35.550
they were unfinished.
Why might they have been unfinished?

578
00:37:35.551 --> 00:37:40.290
They might've been unfinished because the project was,
was uh,

579
00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.470
it was,
it was late.
They were rushing it.
They want it to get it done.

580
00:37:43.471 --> 00:37:48.060
They needed to use the harbor.
And so they said,
look,
to save time,

581
00:37:48.061 --> 00:37:52.770
just put those columns up the way they are and don't bother finishing the drums

582
00:37:52.771 --> 00:37:53.610
of the column.

583
00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.480
Or it might have had or one could argue that it might have had to do with

584
00:37:57.481 --> 00:38:00.870
expense,
that it was getting too expensive and then they decided not to finish,

585
00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.700
uh,
the drums for that reason.

586
00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:06.630
Or it might have been deliberate or it might've been deliberate.

587
00:38:06.631 --> 00:38:10.800
The idea to leave those drums rough,
to make them look [inaudible].

588
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:13.350
I'm going to make a case today that it's the last,

589
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:18.390
that this was a deliberate move on Claudius and his architects and one of the

590
00:38:18.691 --> 00:38:21.420
main reasons I can make that if this is all we had,

591
00:38:21.421 --> 00:38:25.380
if we had only this port of Claudius,
only these columns in this style,

592
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.300
it would be very difficult to make the case.

593
00:38:27.301 --> 00:38:31.280
But as we're going to see when we moved from this to that great gate or the port

594
00:38:31.281 --> 00:38:34.770
of majority,
which was put up under Claudius and then not today,

595
00:38:34.771 --> 00:38:39.070
but next time to a building that was put up and Claudius is honor after his

596
00:38:39.071 --> 00:38:39.700
death,

597
00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:44.700
we will see that all three of those have these rust dicated columns or peers in,

598
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:50.230
in common.
Uh,
which suggests to us,
that suggest to me for sure,
uh,

599
00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.250
that these are these,
that,

600
00:38:52.251 --> 00:38:55.750
that leaving them in this Russ dicated state was deliberate on the part of the

601
00:38:55.751 --> 00:38:57.670
patron and his architects.

602
00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.510
And I'm also going to suggest that it had to do,
uh,
with,

603
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:06.280
with Claudius is peculiar personality and especially his interest in

604
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:09.880
antiquarianism in the past and the history of Rome and the history of the trust

605
00:39:09.881 --> 00:39:13.510
skins and so on.
Here's another detail,

606
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:18.760
a of one of the columns over here where you can see the rough drum and then down

607
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:21.250
below the base on which that sits,

608
00:39:21.251 --> 00:39:25.330
a molded bay based very carefully molded the architects,
the designers,

609
00:39:25.331 --> 00:39:29.860
the artisans could,
could finish these columns perfectly well if they chose to.

610
00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:33.700
They did it on the base.
They did it in the capitals,
but not in between.

611
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:38.410
Here's another one where you can see a series of columns engaged into a wall.
Uh,

612
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:41.440
and again,
you can see the rough or rust dicated drums.

613
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:46.180
Then down below the molded,
the finished finished basis.

614
00:39:46.181 --> 00:39:51.181
So this difference between what we call finished masonry or dressed dres,

615
00:39:51.331 --> 00:39:56.050
SCD dressed masonry or rust dicated,
masonry,

616
00:39:56.051 --> 00:39:58.810
masonry,
that is deliberately left rough.

617
00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:03.670
Again,
in order to underscore this point,

618
00:40:03.671 --> 00:40:08.671
I want to turn now to the great gate or the Porta majority in Rome.

619
00:40:08.801 --> 00:40:13.801
Also built by Claudius between 41 and 54 had you already know its location near

620
00:40:15.791 --> 00:40:17.550
the tomb of your recipes,
uh,

621
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:21.430
near the underground basilica that we also discussed today.

622
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:27.990
And I had mentioned to you already that the purpose of this gate was to uh,

623
00:40:28.541 --> 00:40:31.140
serve as a crossing point for two aqueducts,

624
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:35.370
aqueducts that had been begun earlier,
were worked on by Calendula,
uh,

625
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:39.040
and then completed by Claudius and there were two of them,

626
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:43.990
two of them that crossed at this very point and they needed something to mask

627
00:40:43.991 --> 00:40:48.310
that crossing.
And so they built this great gate.
The porter majority,

628
00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.250
if you look at this general view of the port,
a majority,

629
00:40:51.251 --> 00:40:53.740
you will see much of what I have already described.

630
00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:57.610
It has to open archways the upper most part,

631
00:40:57.611 --> 00:40:59.620
which is the attic which has an inscription.

632
00:40:59.621 --> 00:41:02.590
It's a three tiered attic as you can see.
And you can,
if you look carefully,

633
00:41:02.591 --> 00:41:07.180
you will see it as an extensive inscription making reference to Claudius and to

634
00:41:07.181 --> 00:41:09.070
the aqueducts.
And so on,
uh,

635
00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:14.160
down below we see a series of smaller occupations surrounded by a columns on

636
00:41:15.641 --> 00:41:19.870
either side,
supporting pediments above.
If you look closely,

637
00:41:19.871 --> 00:41:24.270
you can see that the pediments are finished,
pediments are finished,

638
00:41:24.271 --> 00:41:27.630
the lintels are finished,
the capitals are finished,
uh,

639
00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:32.140
bought the blocks of the column and the blocks of the rest of the structure are

640
00:41:32.141 --> 00:41:35.240
left in a hated state.
They are not finished.

641
00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:40.240
And we see that very stark difference between the rustic catered masonry and the

642
00:41:40.371 --> 00:41:42.320
finished masonry,
the smooth masonry,

643
00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.700
the dressed masonry and the rough masonry in this structure.

644
00:41:46.701 --> 00:41:51.290
This arch bought this gate by the way,
is made out of travertine,

645
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:54.500
travertine cut stone construction.

646
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:58.620
Here's another view that I think shows you better the way in which this gate

647
00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:02.230
masks the crossing of those two aqua ducks.
A,

648
00:42:02.231 --> 00:42:07.231
you can see a two channels there and the one one would have had pipes running

649
00:42:08.361 --> 00:42:12.260
through it one way and the other would have had pipes running through it the

650
00:42:12.261 --> 00:42:15.230
other way and that's how they crossed in antiquity.

651
00:42:15.231 --> 00:42:18.530
And I'll show you a model that may make that even clearer in a moment.

652
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:21.500
You can also see the location of the tomb of the baker,

653
00:42:21.501 --> 00:42:26.180
your Rissa keys right next to the so called Puerto Majora.

654
00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:29.260
Here's the model that I showed you when we looked at the tomb of your risk,

655
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.930
the keys,

656
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:34.040
the way in which the prime to Stina and the lobby Kona come into Rome and

657
00:42:34.041 --> 00:42:36.950
converge at the facade of that tomb.

658
00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:41.630
A here you see the great gate or porter majority behind it.
And this is the best,

659
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:45.890
the best illustration I can give of the way in which those two,

660
00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:51.070
the pipes of the two aqueducts crossed behind the attic of the gate,

661
00:42:51.741 --> 00:42:53.870
which is one of the reasons it had to be as tall as it did.

662
00:42:53.871 --> 00:42:56.080
And one of the reasons it had to have tears,
uh,

663
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:59.270
was in order because it was separated,
uh,
behind.

664
00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:03.110
You can see that very well here as well as the rest Decatur.

665
00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:08.140
The contrast between the recirculated masonry and the finished masonry of this

666
00:43:08.541 --> 00:43:13.520
great gate.
This combination of the two is,

667
00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:16.280
uh,
is,
is,
is a very mannered thing to do.

668
00:43:16.281 --> 00:43:20.720
And it's interesting that later renaissance architects in Italy.
Uh,

669
00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:24.110
and for those of you who are aficionados of the,
of the renaissance,

670
00:43:24.111 --> 00:43:28.760
you may know the work of an architect by the name of Julio Romano who created

671
00:43:28.761 --> 00:43:31.970
the great,
the famous Palazzo del Tay in Mantua.

672
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:35.660
And I show you a detail of the Palazzo Delta.
Just to make the point,

673
00:43:35.661 --> 00:43:38.750
the more general point,
you don't have to worry about Julio,

674
00:43:38.751 --> 00:43:40.710
but just to make the general point,
uh,

675
00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:44.830
that these renaissance architects like Giulio Romano looked back,
uh,

676
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:49.870
to buildings like the porter majority in Rome when they also conceived a

677
00:43:50.451 --> 00:43:52.310
buildings in which they contrast it.

678
00:43:52.311 --> 00:43:56.060
Russ dicated masonry with a smooth masonry,

679
00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:01.010
as you can also see so well and here too,
last details of the port of majority.

680
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:05.540
And I think these show you almost more than anything else I have thus far.
Uh,

681
00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:10.700
this incredible contrast between the finished and the unfinished masonry between

682
00:44:11.061 --> 00:44:14.660
the smooth and the rough.
Uh,
and here you see,

683
00:44:14.661 --> 00:44:18.710
you can see a detail of the pediment of the smoothness of that,

684
00:44:18.711 --> 00:44:22.310
of the lintel down below of the capitol,
which is completely finished.

685
00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:25.280
And then even of the upper most part of the column,

686
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:29.120
and this is a particularly interesting detail I think because it gives me the

687
00:44:29.121 --> 00:44:32.190
sense as I look at it,
uh,
that the,

688
00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:36.990
what the arc at patron and architects are trying to do is give us a sense that

689
00:44:36.991 --> 00:44:41.370
the column actually lives inside the rustic gated drums.

690
00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:44.760
I get the sense as I look at this,
that this finished column is just,

691
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:49.320
is very anxious to bust out of the [inaudible] masonry and winded,

692
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.800
which it is confined.
It's very anxious to,
to,
uh,

693
00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:57.520
to emerge from that rustic dicated masonry.
And I,

694
00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.920
I can't help but think of the renaissance again and especially of Michelangelo

695
00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:06.510
for any of you who've seen his slaves and the academia in Florence,
uh,

696
00:45:06.511 --> 00:45:10.680
the slaves that seem to,
he took these big blocks of Carrara marble and he try,

697
00:45:10.681 --> 00:45:14.730
he represents the slaves as if they are still immersed in that marble.

698
00:45:14.731 --> 00:45:18.570
But trying to break free from that marble is if these,

699
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:22.110
these images of human beings,
we're somehow,

700
00:45:22.111 --> 00:45:27.111
I'm located inside that marble and just waiting for the genius Michelangelo to

701
00:45:27.511 --> 00:45:29.100
free them from that marble.

702
00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:33.270
It's the same sense that I get here when I look at this and it makes me think

703
00:45:33.271 --> 00:45:37.950
again that a very intelligent,
uh,
a very refined mind,

704
00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:38.340
uh,

705
00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:43.340
is behind sorting out this kind of thing and conceiving of something of this

706
00:45:43.621 --> 00:45:45.210
nature and given the,
uh,

707
00:45:45.211 --> 00:45:50.211
the education and the bent of Claudia C as just the kind of man who might have

708
00:45:50.521 --> 00:45:54.120
done that.
And I think we need to see the architecture of Claudius,

709
00:45:54.121 --> 00:45:57.930
this rustic hated architecture of Claudius and sophisticated architecture of

710
00:45:57.931 --> 00:45:58.350
Claudia's,

711
00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:03.330
which is contrasted to the smooth and finished architecture at the same time as

712
00:46:03.331 --> 00:46:08.331
something that really is reflective of the peculiar personality of this man.

713
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:12.960
I think it's also important to say though that this kind of architecture at this

714
00:46:12.961 --> 00:46:15.090
time is very old fashioned.

715
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:20.150
The whole idea of using cut stone travertine construction after what we've seen

716
00:46:20.341 --> 00:46:24.330
is going on in concrete construction is a very old fashioned thing to do.

717
00:46:24.331 --> 00:46:28.470
It again shows us a man who is looking to the past was looking to the history of

718
00:46:28.471 --> 00:46:28.801
Rome,

719
00:46:28.801 --> 00:46:33.801
to the history of the Etruscans perhaps rather then to the present,

720
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:38.520
uh,
at,
but,
but on the positive side,
one could also say,
uh,

721
00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:41.490
that what he is doing here he is using stone construction,

722
00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.890
but he is using it in a very different way.

723
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:48.420
And indeed and almost anti classical way to the way in which Augustus used to

724
00:46:48.421 --> 00:46:50.130
think of Augustus is our pockets.

725
00:46:50.131 --> 00:46:55.131
Think of Augustus is a temple of Marzel tour in the forum of Augustus in Rome.

726
00:46:55.561 --> 00:46:59.460
Both of those,
uh,
marble buildings,
uh,
in that case,

727
00:46:59.461 --> 00:47:02.880
Luna or Carrara marble based on ancient Greek prototypes.

728
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.790
This is also stone architecture and in that sense,
again,
old fashioned,

729
00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:11.370
but it's travertine,
not marble.
Uh,
but it is anti classical in,

730
00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:15.810
in its use of this rustic skated as well as smooth masonry.

731
00:47:15.811 --> 00:47:20.250
So I do want you to ponder this architecture of,
of Claudius and,

732
00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:23.940
and think for yourselves about whether you think,
again,

733
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:26.190
it is,
it is,

734
00:47:26.191 --> 00:47:31.191
do the form that it takes is due to the very interesting and unusual personality

735
00:47:31.331 --> 00:47:35.860
of this one man from,
uh,
Claudius.

736
00:47:35.861 --> 00:47:40.861
I want to turn to the notorious Nero and his amazing architectural legacy.

737
00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:46.450
Uh,
and you see a portrait of neuro here on the right hand side of the screen.

738
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.250
Uh,
and a coin,
uh,
with his mother on the left,

739
00:47:51.251 --> 00:47:55.630
the mother of Nero was Agra Pina,
the younger Agra Pina,

740
00:47:55.631 --> 00:48:00.631
the younger was the last wife of Claudius and it was rumored that ag Repina,

741
00:48:00.641 --> 00:48:05.080
the younger murdered Claudius with a bowl of poisoned mushrooms.
Uh,

742
00:48:05.081 --> 00:48:09.070
we don't know if that's true or not.
It may be just rumormongering.
Uh,

743
00:48:09.071 --> 00:48:13.030
but it's perfectly conceivable because she certainly had a motive and that is

744
00:48:13.031 --> 00:48:16.240
she thought she would have more power if her teenage son,

745
00:48:16.241 --> 00:48:19.090
cause he was only about 17 years old at the time,

746
00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:22.540
was on the throne of Rome instead of her older husband.

747
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:26.200
And this coin that you see on the left hand side of the screen of the young

748
00:48:26.201 --> 00:48:29.890
neuro and Agra Pina,
I think says it all.
I mean,
mother and son,

749
00:48:29.891 --> 00:48:34.340
almost nose to nose.
Uh,
this,
this,
this gives real meaning to,

750
00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:38.600
to being in your face.
As you can see here.
Uh,
I'd repeat,

751
00:48:38.601 --> 00:48:43.601
peanut is certainly in the face of neuro on this coin and she was with regard to

752
00:48:43.991 --> 00:48:48.130
his life dominating him in the very early years of his reign.

753
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:51.070
Neuro was born in [inaudible] 37.

754
00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:55.390
He was emperor between 54 and 68.
At his death.

755
00:48:55.420 --> 00:49:00.280
His murder has his,
he was forced to commit suicide actually,
uh,
in 68,

756
00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:03.620
uh,
he suffered a dumb not too Memoria,
uh,

757
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:08.230
which was a condemnation by the Senate,
uh,
of him,

758
00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:13.260
a damnation of his memory and an attempt to destroy his portraits and also his

759
00:49:13.421 --> 00:49:16.790
architectural monuments of followed that dumb not to know.

760
00:49:16.791 --> 00:49:21.160
Memoria Nero was the last of the Julio,
Claudia and emperors.

761
00:49:21.161 --> 00:49:25.300
He was as he was the adoptive son of Claudius.
And as I've already mentioned,

762
00:49:25.301 --> 00:49:29.230
the real son of Claudius,
his last wife,
Agra Pina.
The elder.

763
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:33.070
I mentioned already that Agora [inaudible] gave you the sense that I grew up ina

764
00:49:33.071 --> 00:49:35.800
was a cra,
quite,
uh,
uh,
aggressive,
uh,

765
00:49:35.801 --> 00:49:39.250
woman who aggravated Claudia's EdNeuro both.

766
00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:44.270
We talked about the poisoned mushroom stories,
uh,
and the fact that the,
the,
when,

767
00:49:44.271 --> 00:49:48.220
when her son became emperor,
she received at least for a while,

768
00:49:48.221 --> 00:49:49.750
enhance power in Rome.

769
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:54.600
But Nero eventually paid his mother back by having her murdered in [inaudible]

770
00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:58.320
59,
he also got rid of his wife Octavia,

771
00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:02.140
beautiful young girl whom he had murdered in [inaudible] 62.

772
00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:06.490
So by the age of 25,
Nero had gotten rid of the women,

773
00:50:06.491 --> 00:50:11.491
the two women who had dominated his youth and his much touted madness.

774
00:50:11.981 --> 00:50:15.880
He was not unlike Caligula and some of the wild things that he did as much

775
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:20.440
touted madness began to appear.
That said,
despite his madness,

776
00:50:20.441 --> 00:50:23.260
he was absolutely adored by the populace.

777
00:50:23.261 --> 00:50:27.890
It was a great show to watch neuro and people liked seeing what he would do

778
00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:32.720
next.
He was adored by the populous.
He was however hated by the aristocracy.

779
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:34.100
And in 68,

780
00:50:34.101 --> 00:50:39.101
he was hunted down by his enemies and he was forced to commit suicide.

781
00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:45.320
I would call Nero,
uh,
a patron of architecture.

782
00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:46.520
Extraordinary.

783
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:51.530
His contribution to the development of Roman architecture is indeed

784
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:54.710
extraordinary.
He had a passion for the arts,

785
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.830
which undoubtedly lead to his devotion to building.

786
00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.280
He wrote in these sang poems.
Neuro was a musician.

787
00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:03.440
He collected Greek works of art.

788
00:51:03.441 --> 00:51:07.790
He traveled to Greece to participate in the Olympics.
Whenever he did that,

789
00:51:07.791 --> 00:51:10.010
they were always fixed in his favor.

790
00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:14.270
He stole when he traveled around Greece and Asia Minor,
he stole.

791
00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:15.770
If he saw a work of art he liked,

792
00:51:15.771 --> 00:51:19.220
he's stolen and he brought it back to Rome to display.

793
00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:24.170
He interwove his life with his art in the same manner as Claudius did.

794
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:28.580
He took a,
he took advantage of that very famous fire in Rome,

795
00:51:28.581 --> 00:51:30.620
which took place in 64.

796
00:51:30.621 --> 00:51:35.621
A D to a legend has it that he fiddled while Rome burned.

797
00:51:35.901 --> 00:51:37.550
He wasn't fiddling actually,

798
00:51:37.551 --> 00:51:42.440
but he was participating in some sort of musical performance.
We know that,

799
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.570
uh,
and after,
uh,

800
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:48.680
the fire raged through the city and caused incredible havoc and great

801
00:51:48.681 --> 00:51:49.514
destruction,

802
00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:54.890
what Nero did was instead of rebuilding the land for the people of Rome,

803
00:51:55.611 --> 00:52:00.611
he just expropriated or he expropriated 300 to 350 acres of prime real estate in

804
00:52:03.441 --> 00:52:08.420
downtown Rome.
And he used it to build his own villa,

805
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.060
his own palace in the center of Rome,

806
00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:15.350
the famous Domus our area or golden house because it had a gilded facade.

807
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:20.420
Neuros architecture was intimately bound up with the vicissitudes of his life

808
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:25.700
and his distinctive,
if not warped personality as we shall see,

809
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.430
neuro belt,
two palaces in Rome.

810
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:33.290
And I'd like to begin with the one,
uh,
the with,
with,

811
00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:37.070
I would like to deal with those in consecutive order.
The first of these,

812
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:39.680
as you can see from his,
from the monument list,

813
00:52:39.681 --> 00:52:44.330
is the so-called domus transitory or the less well known one and less

814
00:52:44.331 --> 00:52:47.180
WellPreserved one.
The Dome is transitory in Rome.

815
00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:51.650
A that was built sometime before the fire,
before [inaudible] 64,

816
00:52:51.651 --> 00:52:56.651
because it was very significantly destroyed in that fire of d 64.

817
00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.420
I'm showing you a Google map,

818
00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:04.770
Google earth image of the part of Rome in which this building found itself.

819
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:07.550
We are looking down,
we've seen this one before.

820
00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:09.830
We are looking down at the Roman forum,

821
00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:13.160
the Coliseum and the upper most part there,

822
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:17.170
the Palatine Hill over here.
Uh,
and uh,

823
00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:21.800
if we follow the Roman forum toward the Coliseum and toward the arch of the

824
00:53:21.801 --> 00:53:26.790
later arch of Constantine,
we will see that there is spur hill over here.

825
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:32.030
And that spur hell is located between the Palatine Hill and one of Rome's other

826
00:53:32.641 --> 00:53:35.910
hills.
The Escalade,
he,
s.
Q.
U.
I,
l.
I.
N.
E,

827
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:41.150
the Escalade Hill Nero's dream was to link the buildings that were going up on

828
00:53:42.781 --> 00:53:43.410
the Peloton.

829
00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:48.180
We've already talked about the imperial palace begun by Tiberius a continued by

830
00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:51.300
Colliculi.
Claudius had no interest in that,
uh,

831
00:53:51.301 --> 00:53:56.250
but then neuro returns to it and he's continuing to build this palace on the

832
00:53:56.251 --> 00:53:56.821
Palatine.

833
00:53:56.821 --> 00:54:01.710
But his dream is to link that with property that he also owns on the Escalade

834
00:54:01.711 --> 00:54:05.770
and hill.
And to make one truly grandiose palace,
uh,

835
00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:10.790
that links those two hills across a spur hill called the Veolia v e l I a,

836
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:16.220
which is in this upper most part of the Roman forum closest to the Coliseum.

837
00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:17.880
That was his dream.

838
00:54:17.881 --> 00:54:21.960
And he began to try to realize it prior to 64.

839
00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:26.430
And the building is called the Dome is transitory because it served as a point

840
00:54:26.431 --> 00:54:28.710
of transit between those two hills,

841
00:54:28.711 --> 00:54:33.030
between the Palatine and the Escalade hills.
Again,

842
00:54:33.031 --> 00:54:35.640
because it was so seriously destroyed in fire.

843
00:54:35.641 --> 00:54:40.000
And also because it was deliberately,
uh,
deliberately,
uh,

844
00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:44.490
destroyed by later and Bruce who were following the damnation,
the dom,

845
00:54:44.491 --> 00:54:45.470
not Geo Memoriae,

846
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:49.710
the damnation of Nero's memory and felt that that was there,

847
00:54:49.711 --> 00:54:53.820
right in the sense to destroy his buildings.
So those two things together,

848
00:54:53.821 --> 00:54:57.360
deliberate destruction plus the fire essentially destroyed.

849
00:54:57.361 --> 00:54:59.370
Most of the Dome is transitory,

850
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:03.270
but a couple of sections are preserved underground and they're very important

851
00:55:03.271 --> 00:55:07.530
for us to look at because they give us insight into the latest go to the later

852
00:55:07.531 --> 00:55:09.300
golden house or domes area.

853
00:55:09.301 --> 00:55:12.870
I want to show you the two sections that are still preserved,
uh,

854
00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.920
in restored views that you will find in your textbook.
And Ward Perkins,

855
00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:21.930
one of these is located beneath the,
uh,
while this is still on the screen,

856
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:25.470
if you look at the Palatine policy or just a little bit up beyond where my

857
00:55:25.471 --> 00:55:30.360
finger is,
there is the,
uh,
the dining hall of the later for a century,

858
00:55:30.361 --> 00:55:35.310
a d palace that we'll look at a soon next week.
Um,
you see it there.

859
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:38.670
And uh,
one of the buildings,

860
00:55:38.671 --> 00:55:43.020
a fountain of Nero's Domus transitory is located under that.

861
00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:44.430
And then over here,

862
00:55:44.431 --> 00:55:49.110
this temple that you see right close to the coliseum is a later Hadrian Anik

863
00:55:49.111 --> 00:55:50.760
temple of Venus and Roma.

864
00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:54.180
The domed room that I'm going to show you is under that.

865
00:55:54.181 --> 00:55:58.530
So both of these are underground beneath a later structures.

866
00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:03.660
This is a restored view from Ward Perkins of the,
uh,
of the Fountain,

867
00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:07.020
the Fountain Court of Nero's Domus transitory.

868
00:56:07.021 --> 00:56:09.690
And we see a number of important features.

869
00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:13.650
We see an open court with a pool,
with columns around it.

870
00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:19.010
We see on the northern wall over here we see the fountain itself.

871
00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:23.680
We see that what the architects have done is create,
use a niche,

872
00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:25.330
a place in that niche,

873
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:30.360
a series of other niches that served as the location of the actual uh,

874
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:35.520
water from which the fountain emerged and the water would cascade over this,

875
00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:40.480
uh,
this wall down here and then end up in a long basin in front of it.

876
00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:43.180
The Wall is what's most interesting.
If you look at it,

877
00:56:43.181 --> 00:56:47.800
you will see that it is essentially scalloped,
uh,
with columns in the front.

878
00:56:47.801 --> 00:56:52.480
And then additional columns in the receiving bay is creating a kind of in and

879
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:56.710
out effect,
very similar to a theater architecture.

880
00:56:56.711 --> 00:57:01.270
And I show you a restored view of a typical uh,
theater,
uh,
of,

881
00:57:01.271 --> 00:57:04.570
of earlier date.
It just to give you a sense of what this is based on.

882
00:57:04.571 --> 00:57:07.960
You can also see that opening up off the central court,

883
00:57:07.961 --> 00:57:11.770
screened by columns are barrel vaulted rooms on either side.

884
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:15.880
These were used as special dining areas and special dining areas with beautiful

885
00:57:15.881 --> 00:57:20.680
views out onto this fountain court on either side and this,

886
00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:24.160
and then this restored view also gives you a sense that uh,

887
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:26.140
the pavements were very gated,

888
00:57:26.141 --> 00:57:30.220
were done in different designs and we know that these pavements were made out of

889
00:57:30.221 --> 00:57:32.770
marble and that the walls were prevented with marble.

890
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:35.080
This isn't the full marble of the first style.

891
00:57:35.081 --> 00:57:38.740
This is real marble and it's our first example in Rome,

892
00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:40.620
a of a,
uh,
of,

893
00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:45.660
of a room that was reverted with marble brought from all parts of the world.

894
00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:50.110
Marble brought from Africa,
marble brought from Egypt,

895
00:57:50.111 --> 00:57:55.111
marble brought from Asia minor and also from Greece in various colors to

896
00:57:55.271 --> 00:58:00.020
decorate the fountain court of Nero's Domus transitory.

897
00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:05.050
The other room,
and perhaps the more important of the two is the domed room.

898
00:58:05.051 --> 00:58:06.630
Definitely more important of the two.

899
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:11.650
The dome drew in the Dome is transitory of Nero and you see a restored view of

900
00:58:12.431 --> 00:58:14.620
it here.
What are we dealing with?

901
00:58:14.621 --> 00:58:19.480
We are dealing with a build a structure that is clearly based on the thermal

902
00:58:19.481 --> 00:58:24.400
bath at by and the frigate Daria pump pay.
It is a concrete,
uh,
structure.
Uh,

903
00:58:24.401 --> 00:58:28.420
it looks as if it's round.
In fact,
you can see a circle inscribed in the,

904
00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:31.240
in the pavement down here below,

905
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:35.950
the structure is made out of concrete.
It has a dome and an Oculus.

906
00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:38.770
But even though that it is inscribed in the circle,

907
00:58:38.771 --> 00:58:42.610
if you look carefully at the walls,
you will see that although they are curved,

908
00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:46.780
they follow the curvature of the circle.
There are eight sides to this wall.

909
00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:50.800
So the architect is starting to explore the idea of an octagon.

910
00:58:50.801 --> 00:58:55.750
This is not an octagon.
It's a circle inscribed in an octagon in a sense.

911
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.111
Uh,

912
00:58:56.111 --> 00:59:01.090
but it is an exploration into an eight sided form that we're going to see is

913
00:59:01.091 --> 00:59:02.720
very,
very important,
uh,

914
00:59:02.830 --> 00:59:06.820
for a later development in the Golden House of Nero.

915
00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:10.450
Uh,
it also,
what we see here that's very interesting,

916
00:59:10.451 --> 00:59:14.710
that's a further development of the Frigidaire Doriam and thermal bath idea is

917
00:59:14.711 --> 00:59:19.711
instead of this circular circular structure in an octagon ending with these

918
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:24.380
radiating apps as the four rating a radiating apps is that we saw at Baia for

919
00:59:24.381 --> 00:59:25.214
example,

920
00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:29.510
we see that they extend into Carter's on either side,

921
00:59:29.511 --> 00:59:34.430
which expands the space in a way that we have not seen before.
You see,

922
00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:38.960
they don't end on either side.
With these,
with these apps is with walls,

923
00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:42.620
they expand into these long carters.
As you can see,

924
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:47.400
creating a kind of cross shape and certainly adding uh,
to uh,

925
00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:52.420
the interesting spatial relationships in spatial as spatial possibilities.

926
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:55.760
And the use again of Vista and Panorama as we've seen.

927
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:59.810
We see here also on either side here,
uh,

928
00:59:59.811 --> 01:00:03.180
a series of columns with metal grills on top,
uh,

929
01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.230
so wonderful views through those columns,
uh,

930
01:00:07.231 --> 01:00:10.010
to what lies beyond.
And then on this side,

931
01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:14.840
they small pool that had white marble and then colored marbles around that.

932
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:16.940
So you have to imagine again,

933
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:21.140
the overall appearance of this and antiquity when Wa light would have streamed

934
01:00:21.141 --> 01:00:25.160
through the dome of the central space onto the walls.

935
01:00:25.161 --> 01:00:30.161
It probably had mosaic on them through the grills and the columns onto the water

936
01:00:31.341 --> 01:00:35.570
of the white pool here,
which was also surrounded with very gated marbles.

937
01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:38.030
The same marbles brought from all over the world.

938
01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.440
The view must have been quite spectacular.
Uh,
this is certainly,
again,

939
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:47.450
a form of ostentatious palatial architecture,
uh,
that,
uh,

940
01:00:47.451 --> 01:00:52.451
Augustus issued but was becoming of increasing interest to the likes of Tiberius

941
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:56.530
Caligula and ultimately Nero.
And again,
uh,
just,

942
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:58.520
just to make the same point again,

943
01:00:58.521 --> 01:01:03.521
that we can trace this back to the experiments of the Frig Adare at palm pay.

944
01:01:03.651 --> 01:01:07.700
That's a star being bounced to the thermal bath,
the temple of Mercury at Baia.

945
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:12.050
But look at the difference that it makes when you extend those apps is into

946
01:01:12.051 --> 01:01:13.070
Carter's,
uh,

947
01:01:13.071 --> 01:01:18.071
creating a much freer a spatial situation and adding to the Vista and Panorama,

948
01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:24.860
the idea that has been so popular as we've long seen with the Romans and the

949
01:01:25.401 --> 01:01:27.710
time that remains [inaudible].
I want to return,

950
01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:32.130
I want to turn to a is most important,
uh,

951
01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:33.890
architectural commission.

952
01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:38.270
And I can't overemphasize the significance of this structure that I'm going to

953
01:01:38.271 --> 01:01:43.220
show you now.
The so called Domo salary or the Golden House of neuro,
again,

954
01:01:43.221 --> 01:01:45.140
because of its gilded facade,

955
01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:49.430
we've already talked about the fire that raged through Rome and 64,

956
01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.850
and that when that fire,
when the smoke from that fire died down,

957
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:57.650
that Nero expropriated 300 to 350 acres in prime,

958
01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.360
downtown Rome,
uh,

959
01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:03.230
for his own use for a private palace,

960
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:05.060
the so called Golden House,

961
01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:10.300
we see a site plan here also from Ward Perkins where you can get a sense not

962
01:02:10.491 --> 01:02:14.400
only of the extent of this,
look how it,
how it,
it,
uh,

963
01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:19.480
it covers ground from the circus maximus all the way across to the SQL line

964
01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:24.450
hill.
Uh,
as you can see,
so well here,
so the Palatine Hill,
the Escalade,
Neil,

965
01:02:24.451 --> 01:02:28.890
and also even the Caelian Hill over here,
he dug an artificial,

966
01:02:28.891 --> 01:02:33.030
or he had his architects dig an artificial lake in the center of this,

967
01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.220
as you can see here.
Uh,

968
01:02:35.221 --> 01:02:38.430
and the Golden House was very extensive.

969
01:02:38.431 --> 01:02:42.960
There's only one part of it that remains today,
uh,
uh,
under the,

970
01:02:42.961 --> 01:02:47.160
or as part of the ESCO line hill in Rome and we therefore call it the Escalade

971
01:02:47.161 --> 01:02:50.310
and wing of the Dome is our area of Nero.

972
01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:54.840
This palace had an incredible set of Gimmicks,

973
01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:58.860
gimmicks that were so noteworthy that the names of the architects of come down

974
01:02:58.861 --> 01:03:01.860
to us,
the architect and engineer who are responsible for this.

975
01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:02.940
And I think it is largely,

976
01:03:02.941 --> 01:03:06.690
they came down to us largely because of these incredible gimmicks that they

977
01:03:06.691 --> 01:03:09.180
created for this structure.

978
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:13.380
Their names were Severus and Keller Severus and Keller.

979
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.570
And I believe I have put their names on the monument in this for you.
Yes,
I have.

980
01:03:18.571 --> 01:03:22.170
Underneath the plan of the Espolon wing.
So Severus in Keller,

981
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:27.330
their names suggest to us that they were a Roman architects.

982
01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:28.550
In fact,
uh,

983
01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:33.560
and these gimmicks included a 125 foot statue of Nero himself,

984
01:03:34.051 --> 01:03:38.310
a colossal statue or the colossus as it is designated here,

985
01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:43.580
a colossal statue of Nero with the feature neuro assimilated to the sun god Sol,

986
01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.880
Sol.
The Sun God saw,
uh,

987
01:03:47.881 --> 01:03:52.740
and it was done in bronze and it was done by a famous artist whose name we also

988
01:03:52.741 --> 01:03:57.190
know Zena Doris.
I've also put his name on the monument list for you.
[inaudible],

989
01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:59.790
who was a very famous bronze caster.

990
01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:05.160
So Zina Doris is colossus,
uh,
the gilded facade.

991
01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:09.570
Uh,
and what were some of the gimmicks that a severance and Keller added to this

992
01:04:09.571 --> 01:04:12.720
palace?
When you,
when you ate in the dining hall,

993
01:04:12.721 --> 01:04:16.810
if you were invited as a special guest to eat with Nero while you were eating a,

994
01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:20.700
they coffered ceilings of one of the dining rooms would drop on you.
Uh,

995
01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:25.820
all kinds of wonderful fragrance fragrances and flower petals while you ate.

996
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:31.460
Uh,
there was also a bath that gave you a choice of,
uh,
of,

997
01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:35.020
of,
of,
of seawater and,
um,
uh,

998
01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:38.490
salt water and it's water from the sulfur springs of Tivoli.

999
01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:42.060
You had your choice if you were bathing,
it narrows.
Don't Miss Aria.

1000
01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.220
And most spectacularly of all.

1001
01:04:44.221 --> 01:04:48.930
And I think what a severance and Keller had particular fame for was they created

1002
01:04:48.931 --> 01:04:52.760
a banqueting room that had a revolving ceilings,

1003
01:04:52.761 --> 01:04:56.590
supposedly a ceiling that revolve with the heavenly body.

1004
01:04:56.591 --> 01:05:00.240
So an incredible array of,
uh,
of Gimmicks,

1005
01:05:00.241 --> 01:05:03.810
as I said before in this extraordinary a palace.

1006
01:05:03.811 --> 01:05:07.920
But all of them clearly possible,
uh,
Visa v architecture.

1007
01:05:07.921 --> 01:05:08.850
At this time,

1008
01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:13.650
I'm showing you here a plan of the eschalon wings is the one part of the palace

1009
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:14.970
that survives today.

1010
01:05:14.971 --> 01:05:18.490
We'll talk about what happened to this palace in a later lecture,
uh,

1011
01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:20.380
but you can see it here,
uh,

1012
01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:24.160
dozens and dozens of rooms around a five sided court,

1013
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:29.050
as you can see at this location.
And then here,
what is up to this,

1014
01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:29.913
what is,

1015
01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:34.390
what is the so called octagonal room of Nero's Domus area,

1016
01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.070
which is a remarkable room.

1017
01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:41.110
And I think it's fair to say the single most important room that I will have

1018
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:46.111
shown you thus far this semester is the octagonal room of neuros.

1019
01:05:46.261 --> 01:05:48.160
Don't miss area.
And you see it here.

1020
01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:52.540
You can see the plan of the octagon and then the radiating spaces out from it.

1021
01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:56.620
I'll return to that plan.
And just a moment,
just to mention though,

1022
01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:58.510
by using Google earth again,

1023
01:05:58.511 --> 01:06:03.340
I can show you the particular location of the Dome of the Escalade wing on the

1024
01:06:03.341 --> 01:06:08.260
Po,
on the Escalade Hill today.
Uh,
what happened to it eventually,

1025
01:06:08.261 --> 01:06:11.960
and again,
I'm not going to go into the details now,
but I will in the future.
Uh,

1026
01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:16.450
the after Nero's dumb not to a memorial,
I,
some of this was destroyed.

1027
01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:21.520
Much of it was incorporated into later buildings.
Uh,
eventually a bath,

1028
01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:25.720
uh,
of the emperor Trajan ended up on this site and the emperor,

1029
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:28.780
they covered over what was remained of Nero's domus salary,

1030
01:06:28.781 --> 01:06:33.070
what hadn't been raised to the ground and incorporated some of it into his later

1031
01:06:33.071 --> 01:06:34.750
bath.
Uh,
and in fact,

1032
01:06:34.751 --> 01:06:39.751
this hemi cycle of Trajan is bath is actually the entrance way today of the Dome

1033
01:06:40.661 --> 01:06:41.201
is salary.

1034
01:06:41.201 --> 01:06:46.201
You can see it right here and you can see that the other remains of both Trajan

1035
01:06:46.661 --> 01:06:50.950
is bads and of the domus salary had been incorporated into a modern garden,

1036
01:06:50.951 --> 01:06:54.520
a very attractive garden where you can wander and see some of the remains of

1037
01:06:54.521 --> 01:06:56.590
both.
And actually what you see here,

1038
01:06:56.591 --> 01:06:58.360
it just shows you how amazing Google earth is.

1039
01:06:58.361 --> 01:07:02.590
This circle that you see here is actually,
it has a great on top today,

1040
01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:06.670
but it is actually the Oculus of Nero's octagonal room,

1041
01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:09.280
which is down below,
which is located underground.

1042
01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.450
So if you visit the miss our IA,
which is as you can see right near the coliseum,

1043
01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:18.790
you go into the entrance way through the Hemi cycle of trade gins,
later Baz,

1044
01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:21.790
and you find yourself in a series of corridors.

1045
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:27.000
We've talked about these Carter's before because we talked about the paintings

1046
01:07:27.611 --> 01:07:31.900
that fabulous did a four Nero's Doma salary at first,
the third style paintings,

1047
01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:33.700
and then the fourth style paintings.

1048
01:07:33.701 --> 01:07:37.840
And you'll remember that they don't miss our AEA was described as fabulous as

1049
01:07:37.841 --> 01:07:40.780
prison because there was so many rooms and Carter's that it would take a whole

1050
01:07:40.781 --> 01:07:44.440
lifetime to paint them.
And you see some of those here,
barrel vaulted,

1051
01:07:44.441 --> 01:07:49.210
Carter's a stuccoed over,
uh,
and then painted in the third and fourth styles.

1052
01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:52.420
Uh,
another gimmick that you see throughout the,
um,

1053
01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:57.310
the don't miss our AEA are a series of bridges that are built to carry water

1054
01:07:57.670 --> 01:08:02.520
from one part of the palace to another.
Another view here,

1055
01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:04.090
a showing one of the carters.

1056
01:08:04.091 --> 01:08:07.540
And what you see here is something that we have not discussed yet,

1057
01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:12.280
but as the wave of the future and that is concrete faced with brick after the

1058
01:08:12.281 --> 01:08:14.830
fire,
there was realization the fire of 64,

1059
01:08:14.831 --> 01:08:17.810
there was realization that stone burn too easily.

1060
01:08:17.811 --> 01:08:20.750
It was not an effective facing any longer,
uh,

1061
01:08:20.751 --> 01:08:22.940
and that they needed to come up with something else.

1062
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.370
A brick was work better with fire.

1063
01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:29.270
So the decision was taken to move and this is not the tile,
brick and palm.

1064
01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.860
This is real brick.
Uh,

1065
01:08:30.861 --> 01:08:35.861
and the decision was taken to begin to use brick face construction for these

1066
01:08:36.201 --> 01:08:40.070
buildings.
At this time it was stuccoed over,
as you can see here,

1067
01:08:40.071 --> 01:08:42.080
stucco and then painted on top.

1068
01:08:42.081 --> 01:08:45.860
So you wouldn't have actually seen the brick in antiquity,
but we'll see.

1069
01:08:45.861 --> 01:08:49.640
It was not long until the Romans recognize that brick was a very attractive

1070
01:08:49.641 --> 01:08:53.780
material in its own right and began to leave it exposed,
but we're not there yet.

1071
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:56.920
The paintings,
the fourth style paintings and fabulous,

1072
01:08:56.921 --> 01:09:00.980
you'll remember this one that we've already looked at with the reintroduction of

1073
01:09:00.981 --> 01:09:05.210
architectural fragments and the architectural cages in the domes area.

1074
01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:07.940
This is the single,
as I've already said,

1075
01:09:07.941 --> 01:09:11.660
the single most remarkable and important room that I've shown you thus far this

1076
01:09:11.661 --> 01:09:15.230
semester.
The octagonal room in Nero's Domus area.

1077
01:09:15.231 --> 01:09:20.231
You see this across section plan and axonometric view from Ward Perkins here,

1078
01:09:21.441 --> 01:09:25.640
and you can get a very good sense of this.
This is truly an octagonal room.

1079
01:09:25.641 --> 01:09:30.320
The experiment in the Dome Room where they had inscribed a circle into an

1080
01:09:30.321 --> 01:09:35.000
octagon gave them the idea that they were going to try to make an actual

1081
01:09:35.001 --> 01:09:38.270
octagonal room out of concrete and they succeed.

1082
01:09:38.271 --> 01:09:40.790
Here you can see the eight sides of this room.

1083
01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:44.870
You can see it has a series of radiating alcoves,
but much bigger alcoves.

1084
01:09:44.871 --> 01:09:49.460
Then we saw it in the frig or Daria at palm pay or in the thermal bath that via

1085
01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:53.600
a and differently shaped ones and not,
you know,
all the same.
Uh,

1086
01:09:53.601 --> 01:09:57.440
but when one couple of cross shaped and others are rectangular different shapes

1087
01:09:57.441 --> 01:10:02.430
and then the accident,
a metric view shows you that within those alcoves uh,

1088
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:07.160
there are additional niches in some of the walls that gives a more of a

1089
01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:11.330
sculptural quality to this then has been the case before.

1090
01:10:11.331 --> 01:10:15.740
And this again was no small feat on the part of these architects.

1091
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:21.050
Why is the Domus hour he is so important?
The reason I,
the,

1092
01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:24.860
excuse me,
the octagonal room of the Dome is our area so important.

1093
01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:28.100
The octagonal room of the Domus area,

1094
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:30.020
and I'm giving you a number of bullet points here,

1095
01:10:30.021 --> 01:10:33.980
represents a break from the tyranny of the rectangle,

1096
01:10:33.981 --> 01:10:37.310
the tyranny of the rectangle that we know from Greek and a trust can

1097
01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:42.140
architecture.
It enables vistas to be created in every direction and you know,

1098
01:10:42.141 --> 01:10:45.080
the importance to Roman's of vistas and panoramas.

1099
01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:50.000
It creates one continuous envelope around an interior space.

1100
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:53.750
It fully realizes this development has been long in coming.

1101
01:10:53.751 --> 01:10:54.890
But we're finally there.

1102
01:10:55.130 --> 01:11:00.130
It fully realizes the technical and expressive potentiality of Roman concrete

1103
01:11:01.281 --> 01:11:02.114
construction.

1104
01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:07.660
It represents a switch of emphasis from solids to voids from walls and roofs

1105
01:11:09.351 --> 01:11:13.190
that we saw in such buildings as a temple of Port Tunis to the end.

1106
01:11:13.191 --> 01:11:16.950
Substantial space that they enclose and shape.

1107
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:18.660
It is the interior space,

1108
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:23.520
not the walls that matter now and in this new interior architecture,

1109
01:11:23.521 --> 01:11:26.130
light plays a key role,

1110
01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:31.340
natural light that creates drama as well as illuminates the importance of the

1111
01:11:32.761 --> 01:11:34.950
octagonal room of narrows.

1112
01:11:34.951 --> 01:11:39.900
Domus Aria can not be overstated.
Exclamation point,

1113
01:11:39.901 --> 01:11:44.340
exclamation point,
exclamation point.
The octagonal room,

1114
01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.713
Harold's,

1115
01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:49.740
the Roman architectural revolution that we saw already beginning at places like

1116
01:11:49.741 --> 01:11:54.420
Palestrina,
but it is finally here and it's full blown form where as I said,

1117
01:11:54.421 --> 01:11:59.421
the potentiality of the expressiveness of Roman concrete is fully realized.

1118
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:04.060
This is the room itself as it looks today.
Uh,
we can see,
uh,

1119
01:12:04.150 --> 01:12:06.600
the octagon.
We can see the dome,

1120
01:12:06.601 --> 01:12:10.860
we can see the way in which the octagon becomes the dome,
the eight sides,

1121
01:12:10.861 --> 01:12:13.800
and the way it is shaped to become the dome above.

1122
01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:18.460
We can see some of the niches here.
We can see the way in which the,

1123
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:22.980
the spaces that expand from the central space.
And we can see,
uh,

1124
01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:26.790
niches within those to give greater sculptural quality to it.

1125
01:12:26.791 --> 01:12:29.290
And you can get a little bit of the sense of the light here.
It,

1126
01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:32.220
this would have been elaborately decorated in antiquity.

1127
01:12:32.221 --> 01:12:36.120
I show you a restored view.
All of those same marbles from Egypt,
from Africa,

1128
01:12:36.121 --> 01:12:40.770
from,
uh,
from,
uh,
Asia minor from Greece,
all brought together here.

1129
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:42.150
Lots of different colors.

1130
01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:46.380
This is what those palm pay ins wished their walls actually looked like a,

1131
01:12:46.381 --> 01:12:50.280
but you see real marble reverted walls,
marble pavements,

1132
01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:52.680
and then up above and all kinds of colors.

1133
01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:57.090
And then up above the ceiling stuccoed over and also painted.

1134
01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:00.820
One can only imagine neuro,
uh,

1135
01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:05.460
entering into this octagonal room and how he must have felt.

1136
01:13:05.461 --> 01:13:06.570
And in fact,

1137
01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:10.950
we have a quote from Nero and in which he says that when the Dome is our area,

1138
01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:15.210
uh,
in Rome was finished,
or he is reported to have said,

1139
01:13:15.211 --> 01:13:17.970
when the dome is salary in Rome was finished,
he's reported to have said,

1140
01:13:17.971 --> 01:13:20.910
and I quote at last,
at last,

1141
01:13:21.190 --> 01:13:25.530
I am going to be able to be housed like a human being.

1142
01:13:26.130 --> 01:13:29.820
That was the way neuro thought about this.
He achieved his goal undoubtedly,

1143
01:13:29.821 --> 01:13:34.500
at least for a short period of time before,
uh,
before he died in 68.

1144
01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:37.200
Uh,
and I believe,
and I'm sure you agree with me,

1145
01:13:37.201 --> 01:13:39.390
I believe that it is for the dome is salary,

1146
01:13:39.391 --> 01:13:43.200
especially for the octagonal room of the Dome is our Ia.

1147
01:13:43.201 --> 01:13:47.940
That Nero would have liked to be remembered,
and indeed he achieved his goal.

1148
01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:48.570
Thank you.
