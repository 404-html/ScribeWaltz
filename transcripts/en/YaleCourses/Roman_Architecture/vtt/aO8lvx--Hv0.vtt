1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.750
Good morning.
Uh,
as you can see,

2
00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:08.751
the title of today's lecture is lifestyles of the rich and famous houses and

3
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:11.430
villas at Pompei.

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.840
We spoke last time about the public architecture of Pompei,

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.670
about the forum,
about the temples,
about the basilica,

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.890
about the Babs,
and also about,
uh,

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.900
shops and tombs as well.
Uh,

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.360
but today we're going to turn to the residential architecture of Pompei,

9
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.280
a residential architecture that is extremely important,

10
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:38.040
not only for what it tells us about palm pay,

11
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.990
but what it also tells us about domestic architecture in the first centuries BC

12
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.310
and the first century,

13
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:49.311
a d because there is no place where the houses are better preserved than at palm

14
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:55.170
pay.
So it tells us,
again,
not just about the city itself,

15
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.290
but also about residential architecture in Rome,

16
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.430
where we have very few examples and elsewhere in the Roman world.

17
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.480
I want to begin with the image that you see now on the screen,

18
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:09.030
which is a building.
Uh,

19
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:13.020
and we're talking about the one at the far at the left front left.

20
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.980
A building that is on one of palm pays main thoroughfares,

21
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:21.150
the via Dell Abbondanza,
the via del Abbondanza,
the street of abundance.

22
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.740
And the building in question is,
is relatively well preserved.

23
00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:27.720
And what is significant about it,

24
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.780
about it for us right now is the fact that it is two storied as you can see

25
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:37.560
here.
What we'll see in the course of today's presentation is that most of the

26
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:38.394
buildings,

27
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.050
most of the houses in early Pompei are single story dwellings.
Uh,

28
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:47.250
but here we see one that is two storied and this two story dwelling actually

29
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.540
dates fairly late in the history of residential architecture and palm pay.

30
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.750
It dates sometime between the earthquake of 62 and the eruption of a [inaudible]

31
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.940
of 79.
So between 62 and 79 a d.

32
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.270
And we see that,
that it has two stories.
In this instance,

33
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.770
a story down below that may have been that it says has entrance ways might even

34
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:14.420
have been opened up as a shop.
And then a second story,
uh,

35
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.170
that is very interesting indeed and it has a,
what we call cannot realize,

36
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.470
Cen Acu,
l Aee,
conops July,

37
00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:27.471
which are second story dining rooms that have open panoramic windows,

38
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.070
these windows as you can see through column.

39
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:35.670
So an interesting nod to Hellenization once again,

40
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:40.671
this idea of incorporating Greek elements into Roman architecture,

41
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.880
uh,

42
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.480
elements that again are under that are that come into Roman architecture through

43
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:48.390
the influence of earlier Greek architecture,
uh,

44
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.020
and views out through those columns.
So two important points,

45
00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:56.100
one that these are have two stories and that the second that adding a second

46
00:02:56.101 --> 00:03:01.101
story to a Roman building a is or a palm pay and building in this instance

47
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:05.710
doesn't occur until between the earthquake and the eruption of the service.

48
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.390
And secondarily,

49
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:10.870
this idea of the picture window and we've talked about the importance of the

50
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:14.260
Romans of Vista and Panorama and they're doing it here.

51
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:18.280
They're opening up that second floor so that you can sit in one of these dining

52
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:22.450
rooms and then have a very nice view out through the columns of the street and

53
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:27.010
the street life below.
Now this building,
uh,
on the,
uh,

54
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.100
via de la been Bundoran,

55
00:03:28.101 --> 00:03:32.470
so lies at the end of the development of Pompey and domestic architecture.

56
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.550
And so what I'm going to do is take us back to the beginning and,
uh,
trace Rome,

57
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.840
palm and domestic architecture from the Sam night period up through the eruption

58
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.950
of the service with regard to the earliest houses at Pompei.

59
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.280
These were done during a,
again,
the saddened night period,

60
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:53.920
the fourth and third centuries BC.

61
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.480
Keep in mind that the sound and lights weren't Italk tribe that is indigenous to

62
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:03.460
Italy from way back when I had mentioned too that Pompei was founded already in

63
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:07.840
the eighth century BC and these atomic tribes,
uh,

64
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.000
built houses obviously in which they lived,
uh,

65
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.950
already in the fourth and third substantial houses in which they lived already

66
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:17.290
in the fourth and third centuries BC.

67
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.640
I want to begin our conversation about domestic architecture in Palm Bay and by

68
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:28.530
extension in Rome itself with the so called Domus Etol Alica.

69
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.240
Uh,
what was the Dome missy tallest of the dome.

70
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.540
He Aca was an ideal Roman House plan.

71
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:38.920
And we know quite a bit about it because of the writings of Vitruvian,

72
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.060
but Truvia is not to be confused with Vesuvius,

73
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.300
but Truvia is was an architectural theoretician who was writing in the age of

74
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.880
Augustus,

75
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.470
Augustus being Rome's first emperor and the Truvia has left a great deal of

76
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:58.420
writings about all kinds of architecture including domestic architecture and he

77
00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:02.940
talks in detail about the Domus at Talico or the uh,

78
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.840
or the what he considered the ideal Roman house and he describes all of its

79
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:12.841
parts and through his writings we can explore together what the ideal Roman

80
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:15.910
house was and what you're going to find.

81
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.560
Very interesting I believe is the fact that the actual houses at Pompei can form

82
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:24.850
or the earliest houses conform very closely to this ideal plant.

83
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.200
Let's run through it together,
both in plan and in restored view.

84
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.800
Again,
I'm going to need to go over a lot of terminology here,

85
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.790
but I guarantee you I'm going to,

86
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.230
I'm going to repeat it enough today that it will be indelibly marked on your

87
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:39.670
minds and you won't even have to.

88
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.240
I don't think you'll even have to study this when the time comes because you're

89
00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:47.260
going to know these parts of the house houses so well after we go through them

90
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:51.700
today.
Here you see the plan of the typical Domus.
He Taller Guy,
you can see it.

91
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:54.520
Number one is the entrance into the house.

92
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.050
The entrance to the house was called the foul ks,
Fau,
c,

93
00:05:58.051 --> 00:06:00.950
e s the foul case or the throat of the house.

94
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.210
Sometimes the foul case was uh,
had it before it,

95
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.460
a vestibule called the vestibule them.

96
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:11.690
And all of these words are on the monument list for you of vestibular them,

97
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:16.000
which was a place right before the beginning of the fall case,
uh,

98
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:19.460
underneath the eaves of the house where you could actually stand,
uh,
get,

99
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:22.700
get in from the rain in case it was raining outside while you waited for the

100
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:27.080
door to be open.
But in these early,
these very early doe,
missy Tamika houses,

101
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:30.560
we don't tend to see the vestibule alum.
So think that a way for the moment,

102
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:34.640
just the foul Kaeser throat of the house.
Then on either side of the foul case,

103
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:39.440
there are two rooms which are called cells or cells cell,
ah,

104
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.270
uh,
in the singular and sell ice,
e.
L,
l.
I.
E in the plural.

105
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.210
These can be treated in a number of different ways.

106
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:50.130
They can either be closed off from the street,
uh,

107
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.480
and used as interior rooms for the house,

108
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.250
extra bedrooms or uh,
living and living spaces.

109
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.200
Or they can be as you see them in this ideal plan opened up to the street when

110
00:07:03.201 --> 00:07:04.730
they are opened up to the street,

111
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:09.260
they take on the role of shops or to bear NY t a,
B,

112
00:07:09.261 --> 00:07:11.810
e r n e shops or to bear NY.

113
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.070
And those shops could be either used by those who own the house,
uh,

114
00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:21.071
to make additional money or they could be leased out to others,

115
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:25.220
to others for their shops.
Uh,
you see,
uh,

116
00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:29.450
the foul Kay's leads into the most important room of a Roman house,

117
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.770
the so called atrium,
the famous atrium of the Roman house at t r.

118
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:38.240
I.
U.
M.
A.
The Atrium was the audience hall of the House.

119
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:42.320
And it's important to mention from the outset that Roman houses had a very

120
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:45.470
different role enrollment society than houses do for us today.

121
00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:49.160
We tend to think of our houses today in large parts as retreats,

122
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:51.350
as places we could get away from it all,

123
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:54.880
get away from work and away from schoolwork and so on and escape.

124
00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:58.730
Although we do enjoy,
obviously having friends and family visit us there,

125
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.980
we tend to think of it as a place of retreat.

126
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:06.140
This was not true in Roman times when the house was also a place to do some very

127
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:09.770
serious business.
The man of the house,
the head of the household,

128
00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:14.771
the potter familias often greeted clients in the Atrium of the house and when he

129
00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:17.750
was away on business or a at war,
his wife,

130
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.430
the Matera Familia Os would stand in for him and she would conduct business in

131
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.210
the atrium.
So considered a very public part of the house,

132
00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:30.290
a place where you wanted it to look its best because you were going to be

133
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:34.040
greeting important visitors there to do business.

134
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.990
So the Atrium is located here.

135
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:40.730
You can see this rectangular pool in the center of the Atrium that is the

136
00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:45.170
emplouee IOM and you have that on the monument lets the employee Veeham of the

137
00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:49.940
house,
which is a pool in which they collected rainwater for daily use.

138
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.020
How did they collect that rain water?
Because there was a,

139
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.800
an opening in the ceiling,

140
00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:00.210
also rectangular in shape that's called a calm plutonium and that and the calm

141
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:04.170
Plu beum uh,
had uh,
had surrounding it,

142
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.200
a slanted roof to encourage the water obviously to slide in through the comp

143
00:09:09.431 --> 00:09:14.110
lithium and land in the [inaudible] down below,
uh,

144
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:18.900
around the Atrium and also around the employee are at four.

145
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:22.110
Here are the bedrooms of the house,

146
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:27.111
the cubic you alum in the singular and cubic que la in the plural,

147
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.670
the cubic ula or bedrooms of the house.

148
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:32.820
And you can see that each one of them opens up off the atrium.

149
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.690
They are very small in size,
smaller than any other rooms in the house.

150
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.910
And they were literally just a place to sleep.
They were very small,

151
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.920
mostly very dark.
Some of them had slipped windows.

152
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:46.590
I'll show you one of those later.
Many of them didn't have any windows.

153
00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:50.580
They were literally just sleeping spaces.
Over here at five,

154
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.220
we see the wings or the ally,
a,
l a,

155
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:58.680
e the wings or the ally,
our law and the singular all I have the house,

156
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.000
the wings of the house.

157
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:04.140
We're a very important place in the point of view of family tradition and

158
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.030
religious practice and so on.

159
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:10.530
It was the place where the Romans kept the shrines of their ancestors.

160
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.000
They had wooden shrines,
they will usually made out of wood with um,

161
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.570
with doors.
And they kept inside those,

162
00:10:18.571 --> 00:10:23.310
the busts and portraits of their ancestors.
And they would take those out.

163
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:27.060
They would open those shrines up and take those out on special occasions,

164
00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:31.500
usually anniversaries,
marking,
uh,
the anniversary of the death of the deceased.

165
00:10:31.501 --> 00:10:35.850
And they had an interesting practice in which the member of the family who most

166
00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:40.230
closely resembled the deceased in size and general appearance would put on that

167
00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:43.770
mask and participate in a kind of parade,
uh,

168
00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:45.330
in honor of the debt.

169
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.480
So they kept those in those shrines in the wings or the ally of the house here

170
00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:52.530
at six on axis.

171
00:10:52.531 --> 00:10:56.790
And we know how much the Romans liked axiology as well as symmetry.
Uh,

172
00:10:56.791 --> 00:10:58.530
we see the,
uh,

173
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:03.600
the room over here at six is on access with the Fao k's and the atrium.

174
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.800
This room is called the [inaudible] t a,
B,
l,
I,
N,
u m,

175
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.970
the to bleed them,
which started as the master bedroom of the house,

176
00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:14.970
the most important bedroom,
much larger than the cubicles.

177
00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:19.800
But over time it became a place where the family archives were kept.

178
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.060
And,
and beyond that,
and we'll see it happening in pretty early actually today.

179
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:24.481
Uh,

180
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:29.481
it becomes almost a kind of passageway between the Atrium and the area that lay

181
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.020
beyond here at seven.
We see,
uh,

182
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.790
the also a fairly large room,
the dining room or try Clinique them.

183
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.070
And you can see in this case and the ideal Roman house,

184
00:11:41.071 --> 00:11:45.090
it opens off the Atrium so easy to get to from the atrium.

185
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:49.650
And then at the back,
number eight,
for one of these ideal Roman houses,

186
00:11:49.651 --> 00:11:53.710
the Hortus,
h,
o,
r,
t,
u s or the garden of the house,

187
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:58.060
which was obviously open to the sky.
If you look at the restored view,

188
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.460
you can see how in the how these,

189
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.420
how these earliest houses really had a very enclosed feeling.

190
00:12:04.421 --> 00:12:08.920
They were quite stark and geometrically ordered with very few openings are you

191
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:11.370
can see in this case,
this one opening,
uh,

192
00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:16.390
as an entrance way into the fal case as well as into two shops as you can see

193
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:17.020
here.

194
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:21.070
And then of course the comp Lou beum a hole in the ceiling and then the hoarders

195
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.240
is open to the sky.
But other than that,
there are no windows whatsoever.

196
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.710
It's a very enclosed a structure and we're going to see that although that's the

197
00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:32.140
case in the beginning,
that changes over time.

198
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:37.170
We'll see a very important and interesting evolution.
Now,
as I add,

199
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.040
another point that I want to make from the start is,

200
00:12:40.041 --> 00:12:44.110
is just as in temple architecture and we've traced it,

201
00:12:44.111 --> 00:12:49.111
the development of early Roman temple architecture where we saw the Romans

202
00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:54.271
ultimately using combining and a trust can plan with a Greek elevation.

203
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.300
We're going to see something actually quite similar happening in the development

204
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.780
of a Palm Payan and Roman domestic architecture.

205
00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:05.050
We're going to see that a trust skin earlier trust skin,
uh,

206
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.850
monuments had an impact.
And I show you uh,

207
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.960
a plan of an Etruscan tomb over here.

208
00:13:10.961 --> 00:13:15.100
We've looked at this before and a trust can tomb over here just to show you that

209
00:13:15.101 --> 00:13:20.101
the general arrangement of that tomb a with an entrance way here with two rooms

210
00:13:20.471 --> 00:13:20.861
over here,

211
00:13:20.861 --> 00:13:24.760
kind of like the to bear nigh that we looked at where the cells that we looked

212
00:13:24.761 --> 00:13:28.540
at just before a big space over here,
not unlike the atrium,

213
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.170
the idea of axiology entering into it.
Then this large space,

214
00:13:32.171 --> 00:13:36.130
then another space which mirrors that to bleed them or is likely to bleed them

215
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:40.090
of the Roman house.
And then other rooms on either side.
So this whole idea,

216
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.280
this progression of one space,

217
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.690
an axial progression of one space to another space,
to another space.

218
00:13:46.691 --> 00:13:49.960
It's on the same axial focus.
Uh,
very important.

219
00:13:49.961 --> 00:13:54.961
And I think those who were building these fairly early on the Sam nights and so

220
00:13:54.971 --> 00:13:58.570
on,
we're clearly looking at a trust skin,
uh,
examples.

221
00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:02.080
And it shows us very early on also that in the minds of the Romans,

222
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:06.580
it was a very close association between the houses of the living and the houses

223
00:14:06.581 --> 00:14:10.030
of the dead.
Because if you look at the inside of this,
a trust in tomb,

224
00:14:10.031 --> 00:14:12.460
and I mentioned it,
not holding you responsible for it,

225
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:17.140
but I mentioned it to you underneath the dome,
Missy Tamika on the monument list.

226
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.880
This is the tomb of the shields and seats in cheer Vettery of the sixth century

227
00:14:21.881 --> 00:14:24.210
BC.
Uh,
and if you look at it,

228
00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.670
you can see that inside the tomb it's all carved from the Rock,

229
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.690
from the Tufa rock.

230
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.110
You can see that it looks very much like what you'd expect to house to look like

231
00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:36.880
with bands.
And notice the detail they've even provided is all done in stone.

232
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.930
The two fa stone,
but you see they've even provided stone pillows here.

233
00:14:40.931 --> 00:14:41.830
Not very comfortable,

234
00:14:41.831 --> 00:14:44.920
but it gives you the sense of of what a house would have been like.

235
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:49.720
And we know that houses that bed's in houses look very much like these over
here,

236
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:52.730
a throne with a nice footstool as you can see.

237
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.140
And then if you look very carefully,
also indicated in stone,
the rafters,

238
00:14:57.141 --> 00:14:58.190
the beams,
uh,

239
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.840
done in stone and then the moldings around the door and around the shields,

240
00:15:02.841 --> 00:15:06.050
which is the reason this is called the shields and the seats obviously as cause

241
00:15:06.051 --> 00:15:09.770
if I seats in it as shields on the,
uh,
on the wall.

242
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.040
So I just wanted to make the point because it'll turn up a number of times in

243
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:14.210
the course of the semester,

244
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:18.800
the closest association in the mind to the Romans between cities of the houses

245
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:21.470
of the living and houses of the debt.

246
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:26.270
And also that important point that the early Sab night builders are looking at a

247
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:28.040
trust skin prototypes.

248
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:33.410
I want to show you now the way in which actual Pompei in houses can form very

249
00:15:33.411 --> 00:15:34.670
closely.
The early ones,

250
00:15:34.671 --> 00:15:39.671
at least of the fourth and third centuries BC conform very closely to this Domus

251
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.110
Vitalik a ideal plant.

252
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:47.450
I want to begin with the so called house of the surgeon in palm pay,

253
00:15:47.451 --> 00:15:52.040
which dates to the third century BC and it's called the house of the surgeon

254
00:15:52.041 --> 00:15:56.570
because of all the surgical instruments that were found in the house.

255
00:15:56.571 --> 00:16:00.380
And I show you the array of them.
Now on the screen.
Uh,

256
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.890
this should be of considerable interest to especially,

257
00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:07.160
and I know there are a number of you in here,
students whose major is biology.

258
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.520
And I want to mention also that you'd be,
you might be surprised to hear,

259
00:16:10.521 --> 00:16:11.390
but maybe not yell,

260
00:16:11.391 --> 00:16:15.350
has such amazing collections that the medical school has a collection of

261
00:16:15.351 --> 00:16:19.100
surgical instruments that goes way back and it goes way back to ancient Rome.

262
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.650
You can actually see ancient Roman surgical instruments in that collection,
uh,

263
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:26.930
that we have here at Yale.
I'm not perhaps as many as this,

264
00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:29.900
but an interesting selection.
Uh,
and uh,

265
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.040
those of you who are in that field might at 1.1 to take advantage of that and

266
00:16:35.631 --> 00:16:37.100
get to see them firsthand.

267
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.970
So this house got its name from this cache of surgical instruments that were

268
00:16:40.971 --> 00:16:42.350
found inside.
Uh,

269
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:46.130
that probably gives us some sense of the profession of at least one of the

270
00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:47.510
people who was living here.

271
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:53.080
I show you the plan of the house of the surgeon and you'll see a version on your

272
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.960
monument list that actually has the rooms designated there,

273
00:16:56.961 --> 00:17:00.320
which I don't have here.
So that will be helpful to you as you,

274
00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:03.860
I wanted you to have that version so that you can,
when you're studying,
uh,

275
00:17:03.861 --> 00:17:07.880
you have that before you and uh,
in any,
any exam,
by the way,

276
00:17:07.881 --> 00:17:10.400
even if I show something slightly different in class,

277
00:17:10.401 --> 00:17:13.750
I will show you only what is on your monument list in the exam.

278
00:17:13.751 --> 00:17:16.460
So those are the ones that you should study and remember.

279
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.530
But you'll see the plan is exactly the same.

280
00:17:18.531 --> 00:17:20.180
It just doesn't have the labels here.

281
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.420
So we can see that it conforms the house of the surgeon.

282
00:17:23.421 --> 00:17:28.421
Third Century BC to the ideal at a Domus Etol Lik a plant you enter here,

283
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.410
you enter into the FAO case or throat of the house.
There are two cells,

284
00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:34.550
one on either side.

285
00:17:34.551 --> 00:17:39.260
It's very clear in plan that this cell is close to the outside and opens only

286
00:17:39.261 --> 00:17:43.340
off the atrium,
so used by the family,
uh,
for their own purposes.

287
00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.410
This one is open to the street,

288
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.860
clearly used as a shop either by this family or they've leased it out to

289
00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:54.420
somebody else.
The atrium is on access.
With the foul case,

290
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.480
we can see that the atrium has a pool,

291
00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:02.490
a rectangular pool or improve IOM and there would have been a calm blue beam up

292
00:18:02.491 --> 00:18:04.380
above on either side,

293
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:09.410
the cubicles or bedrooms of the house opening off the atrium over here.

294
00:18:09.451 --> 00:18:14.451
The wings or ally of the house for the ancestral shrines over here.

295
00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:17.430
Again,
a a dining room,
a try Clinique them.

296
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:22.350
That opens off the Atrium up here we think probably a portico few columns,

297
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:26.010
one column or two,
but that might belong to a later renovation.

298
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:27.420
And I'll explain why in a moment.

299
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.920
And then in the back of somewhat irregularly shaped Hortus or garden.

300
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:37.100
But I think you can see from this example how closely these actual houses track.

301
00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.500
Uh,
the Dome Missy Tall,
uh,

302
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:44.570
described by the Truvia is another example of one of these early Roman houses

303
00:18:46.141 --> 00:18:48.440
that conforms to the Domus.

304
00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:53.450
Etol Lik a tight is the so called house of Sallisaw and Tom pay that dates to

305
00:18:53.971 --> 00:18:55.470
the third century BC.

306
00:18:55.471 --> 00:19:00.300
This is another house that has the Domus he Talia as its core,

307
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.590
a Bot,
just like most of the houses in palm pay.
You'll remember,

308
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.830
remember how when the Romans took over palm pay an 80,

309
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.720
or made Pompei a Roman colony.
They tossed the soundbites out of their homes,

310
00:19:12.721 --> 00:19:16.290
they took them over and of course,
once they took them over,
they renovated them.

311
00:19:16.291 --> 00:19:20.340
So there's a quite a bit of renovation that takes place to some of these early

312
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.800
Sam night houses.
And this case,
the house of Salus,
uh,

313
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:28.740
seems to be an example of that.
But we still see the original core of the Domus.

314
00:19:28.741 --> 00:19:33.450
He tall [inaudible] the entrance over here into the foul case of the house.

315
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.870
Uh,
one,
uh,
well I'll say something about that in a moment.

316
00:19:36.871 --> 00:19:41.400
The Atrium on axis with that,
with the [inaudible] over here,

317
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.750
the all lie or wings here,
the [inaudible] of the house over here.

318
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:46.711
In this case,

319
00:19:46.711 --> 00:19:51.270
you can see that the trickling IOM opens up off the,

320
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.310
toward the Hortus.
Instead,

321
00:19:53.311 --> 00:19:58.110
this family wanted to provide views of the hardest rather than the atrium from

322
00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.520
the dining hall.

323
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.410
Now what's particularly interesting and may belong to the renovation is the

324
00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:09.411
shops that are opening up off the street because you can tell in plan exactly

325
00:20:09.721 --> 00:20:14.430
how this shop was used.
Anyone volunteer to say based on the plan,

326
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:19.990
what kind of a shop was this?
A fast food style?
Yeah.

327
00:20:19.991 --> 00:20:24.900
So fast food shop at Thermop oleum because we can see the counter and we can see

328
00:20:24.901 --> 00:20:26.550
the recesses in plan.

329
00:20:26.551 --> 00:20:31.551
So this family either had or let let it space out for one of these Napoleon for

330
00:20:33.001 --> 00:20:35.130
one of these fast food stands,
uh,

331
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:38.160
in the front of their house.

332
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.340
So two examples.
The,
uh,

333
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.820
house of the surgeon and the House of salad that conform closely,

334
00:20:44.821 --> 00:20:49.821
third century BC to the original Vitalik a plan in the second century BC.

335
00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:55.801
We see something happen in house designed quite extraordinary and that is linked

336
00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.580
to the same kind of development we saw in temple architecture.

337
00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:04.960
And that is a yes,
they've been looking at the Etruscan type of plan.

338
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:06.970
They'd been conforming to that to a certain extent.

339
00:21:06.971 --> 00:21:10.840
All of a sudden in the second century,
they get the bug,
uh,

340
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:15.870
to make their houses look more Greek and they begin to incorporate elements of

341
00:21:16.421 --> 00:21:19.090
that they take from earlier Greek architecture.

342
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.390
And the result is quite extraordinary.

343
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.650
I'm showing you here an example of an ideal,

344
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:31.000
a plan of what we call the Hellenized Domus,

345
00:21:31.001 --> 00:21:34.780
the Domus that has been hellenized that has been given Greek l.

346
00:21:34.781 --> 00:21:39.781
It has been enhanced with Greek elements and we let's want run through the plan

347
00:21:40.271 --> 00:21:44.320
again,
a of the so called Hellenized Domus type.
Uh,

348
00:21:44.321 --> 00:21:49.020
you can see that,
uh,
the core is the same as the Dome Missy Tamika,

349
00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.470
you enter over here.

350
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.940
Here we can see in plan the incorporation of the vestibular,

351
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.380
this vestibule that come,
that that,
that,
uh,

352
00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:02.480
is located right in front of or at the beginning of the foul case.
Uh,

353
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:06.070
the purpose of which you can see it right here.
The purpose of what you've just,

354
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.650
you've kind of entered into the house.
The,

355
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.980
the roof of the House protects you in case the weather is not good,

356
00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:16.960
but you still have to stand in that vestibule until you're allowed into the foul

357
00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:21.040
k's and the rest of the house.
So we see here the vestibular,
the foul case,

358
00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:23.500
the two cells cell I one on either side.

359
00:22:23.501 --> 00:22:25.900
In this case they are not opened up as shops.

360
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:31.410
The atrium here with its emplouee IOM to catch rain water at four we have the

361
00:22:32.951 --> 00:22:37.951
usual a Qubica Ula or bedrooms at five we have the usual ally or wings and then

362
00:22:39.761 --> 00:22:44.650
six that to bleed them on axis with seven the try Klinean opening off the

363
00:22:44.651 --> 00:22:47.690
atrium.
So once again,
the core of the original Domus,

364
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:52.660
he tall like a very much intact in the hellenized domus but look what's happened

365
00:22:52.661 --> 00:22:55.780
up here.
What's happened up here is it number eight,

366
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:59.710
under the influence of Greek architecture under the influence of what's

367
00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:01.420
happening in temple architecture,

368
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:06.630
they incorporate columns in to the interior of the house.
Uh,

369
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:11.020
and they place their garden.
Here it's a garden court,
uh,

370
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:15.880
with columns,
which technically is called a Paris style,
p,
e,
r,
I,

371
00:23:15.881 --> 00:23:20.530
s,
t,
y,
l,
e.
And it is comparable to what we see in temple architecture.

372
00:23:20.531 --> 00:23:24.000
When we saw the art,
the,
uh,
architects,
um,

373
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:27.190
giving some of the temples,
the peripheral colonnade,

374
00:23:27.191 --> 00:23:30.580
you remember the colonnade that goes all the way around and it's free standing

375
00:23:30.581 --> 00:23:33.730
under the influence of Greek architecture.
It's the same sort of thing here,

376
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.160
except it's on the inside of the building.

377
00:23:36.161 --> 00:23:40.510
So this peristyle court come garden,
uh,
located right here.

378
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.860
And then on either side,

379
00:23:41.861 --> 00:23:46.861
additional bedrooms or cubicles or these were probably very desirable to have a

380
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:51.110
bedroom that opened,
had a nice view out over your garden.

381
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.070
And then back here to additional,
uh,
uh,
try Clinique,

382
00:23:55.100 --> 00:24:00.050
two additional dining rooms,
uh,
to take advantage of the beautiful views,
uh,

383
00:24:00.051 --> 00:24:03.250
that one could get if one could see it.
Probably not terribly much that,

384
00:24:03.251 --> 00:24:04.250
these narrow doorways,

385
00:24:04.251 --> 00:24:08.480
but at least opening up on to the peristyle court.

386
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.190
We see Neil one second.

387
00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:14.810
Just we see up here the restored view showing the same,
the entranceway.

388
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.900
And look here,
you can even see columns added,
uh,

389
00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:22.370
in the front to announce from the very start that this is a house,
uh,

390
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:26.930
that is,
that is,
that is owned by a very cultured individual who knows his Greek,

391
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.110
uh,
and knows his Greek culture,
uh,

392
00:24:29.111 --> 00:24:32.810
and knows to incorporate these wreak elements into his house.

393
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.380
Then we see the comp Lumion,
we see the peristyle from above.

394
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:40.790
You can see open to the sky with columns,
but still very stark,

395
00:24:40.791 --> 00:24:44.640
very plain on the outside,
no windows to speak of.

396
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.700
Very much an enclosed space.
Neil,

397
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.260
some of these houses did have kitchens and I'll show you an example in a moment

398
00:24:57.261 --> 00:25:00.410
and probably more of them did them.
We then we're sure of,
uh,

399
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:03.470
it's just a question of what remains in terms of being able to determine that.

400
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.950
But we certainly have examples of that.
So they did seem to have kitchens.

401
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:12.560
So now I want to show you some examples of houses that conform to the hellenized

402
00:25:12.561 --> 00:25:15.290
domus type.
Uh,
this being the first one.

403
00:25:15.291 --> 00:25:18.320
It's one of the most famous houses in palm pay.
And if you're making,

404
00:25:18.321 --> 00:25:21.950
if you're going there any time soon and are making a list of must sees,

405
00:25:21.951 --> 00:25:26.540
this is one of those Macies in palm paid the house of the Betty e the vetting we

406
00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:30.020
think it belongs or that we're not absolutely sure to the various brothers,

407
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.040
to the various brothers in palm pay.
And a date is the monument.

408
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:39.100
A list indicates to the second century BC and later looking at this plan,

409
00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:44.270
you can see the way in which it conforms to the hellenized Domus type.

410
00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.650
Once again,
it has the core,
it has the dome,
he tall like a core,

411
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.720
the entrance way over here with the FAO case,
the cells on either side,

412
00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:58.100
the in this case used as a rooms internal to the house.

413
00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:00.410
They do not open off the street as shops.

414
00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.400
The atrium here with the [inaudible],

415
00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:08.000
a smaller number of cubic ula on either side.
Uh,

416
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.450
all I over here,

417
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:13.340
look what has happened to the [inaudible] it to bleed them is gone.
Essentially.

418
00:26:13.341 --> 00:26:18.290
All it consists of is a couple of Bay Pilasters,
uh,

419
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.670
that are located right here.

420
00:26:19.671 --> 00:26:23.030
And I'll show them to you in a moment cause it's WellPreserved pilasters here.

421
00:26:23.031 --> 00:26:26.180
So it to bleed them has essentially disappeared.

422
00:26:26.181 --> 00:26:28.710
It's become a kind of passage way,
uh,

423
00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:32.390
from the core of the house into the garden.

424
00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:37.130
And it is a peristyle garden surrounded by columns as you can see and you can

425
00:26:37.131 --> 00:26:41.000
see how important that peristyle garden has become.

426
00:26:41.001 --> 00:26:44.400
This family has decided to decrease.
Uh,

427
00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:49.410
there are other space in order to have this stupendously large garden here and

428
00:26:49.831 --> 00:26:54.150
they have also put a very large dining hall,
try cleaning up here.

429
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:59.070
That opens off the Paris style and it has a much bigger opening,

430
00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:03.810
uh,
so that they could clearly dine and get views of this,
uh,

431
00:27:03.811 --> 00:27:05.010
of this garden.
Uh,

432
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.450
this peristyle garden of which they were obviously incredibly proud.
Uh,

433
00:27:09.451 --> 00:27:13.740
so some,
some major changes.
They are now this particular house.
Oh,

434
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.230
I did want to say though,
despite those changes,

435
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.200
the house is still very enclosed and very,

436
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.990
very plain and stark from the outside.

437
00:27:21.991 --> 00:27:25.650
This is a restored view of what we believe the outside looked like,

438
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:30.390
sort of geometrically ordered cubic.
As you can see just one entrance way,

439
00:27:30.391 --> 00:27:33.690
possibly a few small windows,
possibly not a,

440
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:37.860
and then you can see the comp Lou BM and the Paris style court.

441
00:27:37.861 --> 00:27:42.861
But otherwise very much in closed like the earlier Domus Vitalik and not much

442
00:27:42.901 --> 00:27:47.130
change with regard to how the exterior of the building is treated.

443
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:51.290
This again is one of the reasons everyone flocks to this house is it's very well

444
00:27:51.291 --> 00:27:54.810
preserved.
There's been some restoration work of course,
uh,
but it really,

445
00:27:54.811 --> 00:27:58.620
this is one of those must seize because it really gives you as good a sense as

446
00:27:58.621 --> 00:28:02.130
anything of what these houses looked like in antiquity.

447
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:06.340
We have obviously entered into,
we've come through the foul case.
Uh,

448
00:28:06.341 --> 00:28:08.310
we are standing in the atrium,

449
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:13.080
we can see the pool or [inaudible] here we can see the comp.

450
00:28:13.081 --> 00:28:15.270
Lou Vient very well preserved up above.

451
00:28:15.271 --> 00:28:19.140
I think it's probably the best preserve calm blue beam that we have or close to

452
00:28:19.141 --> 00:28:23.040
it.
And you can see that there were a little anti fixes added in terracotta and

453
00:28:23.041 --> 00:28:27.480
stuff as decoration up at the top.
As we're standing here,

454
00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.560
we look back through what was once the to bleed them and now is basically a

455
00:28:31.561 --> 00:28:32.660
point of transition,

456
00:28:32.661 --> 00:28:37.140
a passageway from the Atrium to the most important part of the house from the

457
00:28:37.141 --> 00:28:40.950
point of view of these patrons,
the garden.
Uh,
so you're looking through,

458
00:28:40.951 --> 00:28:42.940
you see these great peers,
uh,

459
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.900
on either side that are all that's left of the to blend them.

460
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:48.060
You look through that and you see the garden.

461
00:28:48.061 --> 00:28:52.740
The garden has its columns surrounding it.
The walls are painted of that,

462
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:57.330
of that garden.
Uh,
all a very lively and wonderful,

463
00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:58.890
uh,
interior.

464
00:28:58.891 --> 00:29:03.870
And what also comes v becomes very clear and looking at this particular view is

465
00:29:03.871 --> 00:29:05.490
something that we've already discussed.

466
00:29:05.491 --> 00:29:10.290
And that is the importance in the minds of the Romans of Vista or Panorama of

467
00:29:10.291 --> 00:29:13.620
great views that you can see from one part of a building to another.

468
00:29:13.621 --> 00:29:17.940
Remember the sanctuary of Jupiter anchor at Terra Cheena and all of those

469
00:29:17.941 --> 00:29:22.941
wonderful lateral and an axial entrances and exits where there were all kinds of

470
00:29:23.611 --> 00:29:26.370
interest in light effects.
We see the same sort of thing here.

471
00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:31.670
The idea is to pass from a particularly well lighted area outside into a darker

472
00:29:31.951 --> 00:29:33.120
area.
The foul case,

473
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:37.230
then a little bit more light added to the system through the comp Lube,
IOM,

474
00:29:37.231 --> 00:29:40.890
and then a whole host of light that you can see in the distance,

475
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:45.750
the open because of the open peristyle.
So dark,
light,
dark light,
I,

476
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.840
there's progression of space is progression of life.
Uh,
through this structure.

477
00:29:49.841 --> 00:29:53.650
I have a very typical Roman thing to do.
Uh,
the other,

478
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.880
other thing of course is this emphasis on axiology the of this movement through

479
00:29:57.881 --> 00:30:02.230
a structure in a very axial way.
Uh,
the,
uh,

480
00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.060
garden here as it looks today,

481
00:30:04.061 --> 00:30:07.120
it would have been of course even more beautiful in antiquity when it would have

482
00:30:07.121 --> 00:30:09.700
been in better shape.
But nonetheless,
this gives you,

483
00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:11.290
it's been overgrown now and so on.

484
00:30:11.291 --> 00:30:14.950
But it gives you some sense of what it would've looked like with the greenery in

485
00:30:14.951 --> 00:30:18.280
the garden surrounded by the columns with,
uh,
you know,
with,

486
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:21.460
with garden furniture,
a little fountains,

487
00:30:21.461 --> 00:30:25.140
a little marble fountains and the like,
uh,
and with the walls,

488
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:29.170
paintings are not in very good shape today,
but imagine them more vibrant.

489
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:33.100
And I'm going to show you examples of that on Thursday and next week of some of

490
00:30:33.101 --> 00:30:34.810
the paintings that are in better condition,

491
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.000
how vibrant this would have been with those paintings.

492
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.820
Look also at the columns because you can see,

493
00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:43.150
we'll see that some of these columns are made out of stone.

494
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:47.920
Some of them are made out of those,
um,
those tiles,

495
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.080
those look like bricks that I've shown you before.

496
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.230
But in all cases they were stuccoed over white.

497
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:57.580
Why were they stuccoed over white to make them look like Greek marble?

498
00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:01.660
So once again,
this Hellenization of Roman domestic architecture,

499
00:31:01.661 --> 00:31:06.280
this attempt to make these things look as Greek as possible.

500
00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.180
Neil,
you asked about the kitchen.
Well,
this is our best preserve kitchen,
uh,

501
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.940
from Palm Pompei.
It's really quite amazing.

502
00:31:12.941 --> 00:31:17.941
There's a stove and the pots and pans that were clearly a still sitting on the,

503
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:21.760
um,
sitting on,
on the stove at the time.

504
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.620
This particular family had to flee from the,
um,

505
00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:29.680
from the thumb Vesuvius and I neglected to show you,

506
00:31:29.681 --> 00:31:33.280
but you can look at the monument list for this plan where the,

507
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:35.350
where the rooms are marked.
Uh,

508
00:31:35.351 --> 00:31:39.880
you will see the kitchen marked on that plan and you will also see what's called

509
00:31:39.881 --> 00:31:43.910
the women's quarters marked on that plan,
which was probably where,
uh,

510
00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:47.170
some of the slaves who were owned by this particular family,
the Betty,

511
00:31:47.171 --> 00:31:50.080
his brothers,
uh,
lived in that,
in that area.

512
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:56.530
Another example of a house that conforms upon pay in house that conforms to the

513
00:31:56.531 --> 00:32:00.610
Hellenized Domus type is the one that you now see on the screen.

514
00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:05.940
It's a plan of the House of the silver wedding in palm pay.

515
00:32:05.981 --> 00:32:09.550
A,
we believe it was remodeled in the first century BC,

516
00:32:09.551 --> 00:32:10.810
although it's controversial,

517
00:32:10.811 --> 00:32:15.700
it might have been remodeled a bit later in the first century.
A D uh,

518
00:32:15.701 --> 00:32:19.780
it,
um,
it's an interesting structure had got its name,

519
00:32:19.781 --> 00:32:21.630
the House of the silver wedding because it,

520
00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:24.670
there was a lot of fanfare in the late 19th century.

521
00:32:24.671 --> 00:32:29.530
I think it was precisely 1893 when the king and Queen of Italy came to visit

522
00:32:29.531 --> 00:32:33.370
this particular houses and it became their favorite and uh,

523
00:32:33.371 --> 00:32:38.140
so the silver wedding is actually a reference to them and to their marriage and

524
00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.530
so on and so forth.

525
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:44.900
It's a wonderful house and I think you can see how it conforms.
Again,

526
00:32:44.901 --> 00:32:48.740
it has a core that is very much,
they don't miss he tall like a core,

527
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:52.670
but it is another example of one of these houses that has been remodeled.

528
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.620
A because of the page,

529
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:58.160
the owner's interest in Helen Ising that house.

530
00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:00.650
We enter here through the foul case,
uh,

531
00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:04.200
there their cells on either side opening off the Fao case.

532
00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:08.910
That's an unusual arrangement.
Then over here,
the uh,
the uh,

533
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:14.090
atrium with the [inaudible],
the cubicles lie on either side,
the cell,

534
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:18.670
the uh,
ally or wings of the house,
a dining room over here,
uh,

535
00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:22.130
to peristyle courts,
one in the back,
a smaller one,

536
00:33:22.131 --> 00:33:25.970
and then a huge peristyle court over here on the left hand side.

537
00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:30.230
So for this family,
one was not enough.
They wanted double the garden space.
Uh,

538
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.860
and they've,
they've allotted a lot of space in this house to those gardens.

539
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:36.020
Then most interesting of all,

540
00:33:36.021 --> 00:33:39.330
I think about this house and the reason I chose it to show to you,
uh,

541
00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.580
is that we are starting to see the Hellenization of the Atrium as well because

542
00:33:43.581 --> 00:33:45.110
look what's happened to the atrium.

543
00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:50.570
They have placed four columns around the improved IOM in the atrium.

544
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:53.390
So it wasn't enough to have these two large Paris styles.

545
00:33:53.391 --> 00:33:57.960
They wanted columns everywhere and they place these four around the employee

546
00:33:57.961 --> 00:34:01.880
Veeham a an atrium that has four columns in it is technically called,

547
00:34:01.881 --> 00:34:05.600
and I put it on the monument list for you,
a tech risk style atrium.

548
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.950
This is a Texas style atrium.
Even that wasn't enough.

549
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.260
Look at that room in the upper left.

550
00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:16.710
That room in the upper left is a banqueting hall,
uh,

551
00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.000
and additional dining space,
but especial dining space.

552
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:25.210
Then you can see opens up very nicely off the smaller peristyle at the house.

553
00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:27.050
The opening is fairly wide,

554
00:34:27.051 --> 00:34:31.550
so it probably would have had some wonderful views of the peristyle garden.

555
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.900
And look,
there are four columns in there as well.
Uh,

556
00:34:35.901 --> 00:34:38.970
and this particular banqueting hall,
its technical name,

557
00:34:38.971 --> 00:34:41.920
it's got a kind of a funny name that I don't think you'll forget,
uh,

558
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:43.910
called an [inaudible],
o e c u s,

559
00:34:43.911 --> 00:34:47.770
and is even more amusing in the plural because the plural is OEC.

560
00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:52.240
I eeky eeky.
So,
uh,
this is an Ecos,
uh,

561
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:53.860
among Eeky,
uh,

562
00:34:53.861 --> 00:34:57.950
an eco is up there and you can see that it's an ecosystem that has four columns

563
00:34:57.951 --> 00:35:02.380
in it.
So we call it a tech style.
[inaudible] hi.

564
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.320
So now that we've had an opportunity to look at the plan of the House of the

565
00:35:06.321 --> 00:35:10.550
silver wedding,
I want to give you a sense of what the building looks like today.

566
00:35:10.551 --> 00:35:13.370
It's not as well preserved as the house of the Betty,
uh,

567
00:35:13.371 --> 00:35:16.970
but we can get a very good sense of what it was like an antiquity and the

568
00:35:16.971 --> 00:35:18.160
[inaudible],
uh,

569
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.440
which in some respects is the most important room in the house from our

570
00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:26.150
standpoint is very well preserved.
We're looking here at a view,

571
00:35:26.151 --> 00:35:31.151
we're standing again in the beginning of the atrium looking through the atrium.

572
00:35:31.191 --> 00:35:35.550
We see the emplouee beum of the house,
a lot of Mawson's of over,
you know,

573
00:35:35.551 --> 00:35:37.920
it's overgrown,
uh,
today.
Uh,

574
00:35:37.921 --> 00:35:41.820
but nonetheless you can see it there as well as the comp bluebeam above what's

575
00:35:41.821 --> 00:35:43.020
most important to us.

576
00:35:43.021 --> 00:35:48.021
As you can see that this is indeed a tetris style atrium with four columns that

577
00:35:48.691 --> 00:35:51.720
are surrounding the implant eum uh,

578
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:54.870
those columns and those columns supporting the ceiling.

579
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:59.100
And of course the comp bluebeam above also interesting is the way in which the

580
00:35:59.101 --> 00:36:00.150
columns are treated.

581
00:36:00.151 --> 00:36:04.500
You can see that they have been floated and then stuccoed over.

582
00:36:04.501 --> 00:36:08.190
Do you remember the temple at Corey that we looked at where we talked about the

583
00:36:08.191 --> 00:36:11.130
fact that uh,
the temple of Hercules at Cory,

584
00:36:11.131 --> 00:36:16.050
we talked about the fact that the columns were fluted part of the way and then

585
00:36:16.051 --> 00:36:19.860
down below those flutes were covered over with stucco and the Stucco was
painted.

586
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.040
We see the same thing here and if you look very,
very closely,

587
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.710
you can even see the remains of the red paint,

588
00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:30.120
the red paint that decorated the lower part of these columns.

589
00:36:30.121 --> 00:36:34.320
So some in correspondence as they are in terms of building practice.

590
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.110
You can also see here as we saw in the house of the Vte,

591
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:41.940
this wonderful vista from the Atrium of the house through what remains of the to

592
00:36:41.941 --> 00:36:45.540
bleed them into the garden of the house,
uh,

593
00:36:45.541 --> 00:36:47.370
at the peristyle garden of the house,

594
00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:51.780
which from the patrons point of view was one of the most important or if not the

595
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:56.850
most important part of the house.
This is the [inaudible] of the house,

596
00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.260
uh,
of the silver wedding.
And you can see it as extremely well preserved.

597
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.070
And you can also see how very interesting it is and all kinds of ways.

598
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:10.010
It is a tech restyle Egus.
Again,
a banqueting hall tetras style [inaudible],
uh,

599
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:14.580
with four columns.
Uh,
those columns are stuck out and painted over.

600
00:37:14.581 --> 00:37:18.510
The paint is very well preserved.
It's a reddish,
purplish color,

601
00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:23.430
probably meant to conjure up porphyry Por p,

602
00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:27.630
h y r y a porphyry which comes only from Egypt.

603
00:37:27.631 --> 00:37:30.220
It's only quarried and each of very expensive,
uh,

604
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.600
to bring it that great distance all the way to palm pay.
Uh,

605
00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:36.330
and of course this isn't poor free,
it's just a painted column.

606
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:39.430
But the whole idea of this from the point of the point of the pain,

607
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.970
the patrons point of view was to look like he,
uh,

608
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:47.610
he and she were very well healed,
that they could afford,
uh,

609
00:37:47.611 --> 00:37:48.660
to bring,
uh,

610
00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:52.320
that they're trying to make the illusion that they could afford to bring,
uh,

611
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:56.910
this expensive stone from very far away to use in their house here.

612
00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:01.980
Uh,
look also at the fact that the,
uh,
there's a barrel vault.

613
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.600
This is actually a wooden involved rather than a concrete vault here in this

614
00:38:06.601 --> 00:38:11.490
room,
but very nicely done.
And the walls are extensively painted.

615
00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:13.680
Uh,
they are weathered today.
Uh,

616
00:38:13.681 --> 00:38:17.010
but they give you a very good sense of the original of what would have been the

617
00:38:17.011 --> 00:38:20.010
original appearance of this room.
And as I mentioned,

618
00:38:20.011 --> 00:38:22.980
we'll talk in detail about Roman wall painting,

619
00:38:22.981 --> 00:38:26.790
especially because as you can see,
it does depict architecture.

620
00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:31.940
We'll begin that conversation on Thursday and continue into next week.

621
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.770
I want to turn now to what is surely,
uh,

622
00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:40.890
the most important surviving house at the city of palm pay.

623
00:38:41.561 --> 00:38:43.970
And this is the famous house of the phone.
If you have,

624
00:38:43.971 --> 00:38:47.110
if you're in Palm Bay and you only have time to see two houses,

625
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:51.520
you go to the house of the Betty and the house of the Fawn,
uh,

626
00:38:51.521 --> 00:38:52.780
the house of the phone.

627
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:57.780
As you can see from your monument list dates to the second century BC for the

628
00:38:57.941 --> 00:38:59.980
most part.
Uh,
and uh,

629
00:38:59.981 --> 00:39:04.981
we see a view of part of Pompei over here with a series of houses marked in

630
00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:06.934
yellow.

631
00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.300
And the reason that I show this to you is because the house or the phone is

632
00:39:10.301 --> 00:39:13.990
particularly large.
You can see from this plan that it takes up,

633
00:39:13.991 --> 00:39:18.991
in fact the entire block of an entire block of the city of palm pay.

634
00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:23.500
And it is much larger than some of the others.
For example,

635
00:39:23.501 --> 00:39:27.130
look at the house of the vets.
He over here,
it's,
it's almost,
it's,

636
00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:32.131
it's twice if not larger than that twice the size of the house of the Betty,

637
00:39:32.531 --> 00:39:37.510
if not even more than that.
So,
uh,
it's a very large house.

638
00:39:37.511 --> 00:39:41.680
Clearly no expense was spared either an accumulating the property,
uh,

639
00:39:41.681 --> 00:39:45.580
and also in enhancing the decor of the house.

640
00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.150
If we look at a plan of the house of the phone,

641
00:39:49.151 --> 00:39:53.270
we will see without question that it corresponds and it follows the hellenized

642
00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:57.460
don't miss type.
We enter over here.
Uh,

643
00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:02.550
we see it has a vestibule alum and vestibular them at Fau case to sell lie one

644
00:40:03.821 --> 00:40:07.090
on either side and atrium with an improved IOM.

645
00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:11.000
The cubicles are here on either side,
the wings or the ally,

646
00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:15.760
it does have a to bleed them.
You see it over here and then it has to,
uh,

647
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:19.990
to Paris style courts,
uh,
with columns in circling them,

648
00:40:19.991 --> 00:40:24.760
a smaller one,
and then a very large one in the back note.
Also,

649
00:40:24.761 --> 00:40:26.350
while this is on the screen,

650
00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:30.480
that there is a very interesting room that is located over here.
Uh,

651
00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:33.480
it's a rectangular room.
It has,
uh,

652
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:37.870
a couple of columns on bases and pilasters one on either side.

653
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:43.080
It opens right off the peristyle court and on the floor of that space,

654
00:40:43.511 --> 00:40:45.970
which we call the Alexander Exedra,

655
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:49.420
e e d r a after Alexander the great,

656
00:40:49.421 --> 00:40:54.250
because on the floor of that was the most famous mosaic that we have surviving

657
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.370
from antiquity.
That represents Alexander the Great,

658
00:40:57.371 --> 00:41:00.190
and I'll show you that momentarily.
First,

659
00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:03.310
let me show you what the house looks like from the outside.

660
00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:07.930
It's WellPreserved doesn't have its ceiling the way the house of the Betty he

661
00:41:07.931 --> 00:41:10.180
does,
but otherwise it's pretty well preserved.

662
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:13.060
We're looking down the street on which it finds itself.

663
00:41:13.061 --> 00:41:17.860
You see the polygonal masonry blocks,
you see the,
the,
um,
the,
uh,

664
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:18.910
the,

665
00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.410
you see the sidewalks here as well and how modern they look.

666
00:41:23.411 --> 00:41:28.411
You see the stepping stones and overhear the facade of the house of the font.

667
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:32.260
You can see the entrance way and you can see that the entrance way has on either

668
00:41:32.261 --> 00:41:36.890
side,
a Pilaster,
a pilaster with a Corinthian capital above.

669
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:41.950
And that's very important because it's announcing to us as did that ideal Helen

670
00:41:42.041 --> 00:41:43.850
has don't miss that I showed you before.

671
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.970
It's announcing to us that this is a patron.

672
00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:51.350
This is an owner of this particular house who guys leanings toward things,
Greek,

673
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:56.000
uh,
and wants us to know that even before we have entered into the house.

674
00:41:56.790 --> 00:42:00.980
If you go into the house,
uh,
and stand in the vestibule,
uh,

675
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:04.820
you will see that there is still quite a bit of decoration preserved.
Uh,

676
00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.820
the walls are painted with blocks.
What would it look like?

677
00:42:07.821 --> 00:42:12.170
Blocks of stone and illusion.
Uh,
is is an example of first style wall painting.

678
00:42:12.171 --> 00:42:15.080
We're going to talk about that on Thursday.
And then up here,

679
00:42:15.081 --> 00:42:17.050
a shrine is still preserved.

680
00:42:17.051 --> 00:42:21.860
A shrine that probably held statues are statuettes of some of the household gods

681
00:42:21.861 --> 00:42:24.020
and revered God's,
uh,
for this family.

682
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:28.640
This is an excellent view because it shows us again how if he entering this

683
00:42:28.641 --> 00:42:33.280
house,
you would stand in the vestibule,
you'd go from there into the Fao Ks,
uh,

684
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:34.340
then into the atrium,

685
00:42:34.341 --> 00:42:38.420
then into the peristyle that lay beyond the first smaller one,

686
00:42:38.421 --> 00:42:41.030
and then the larger one after that.
But it shows us again,

687
00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.080
the point that I've made so many times already just in this first part of the

688
00:42:45.081 --> 00:42:48.860
semester.
And that is this Roman interest in Vista or Panorama.

689
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:52.370
They've set up a view from the moment in which you enter the house,

690
00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:57.380
a view of a sequence of experiences from light to dark,
to light to dark,
uh,

691
00:42:57.381 --> 00:43:01.250
but also at a sequence of visual experiences that make,
uh,

692
00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:05.240
entering this house and walking through this house and extraordinary experience.

693
00:43:05.241 --> 00:43:09.650
One that they have helped enhance.
And you can also see again,
the capitols here.

694
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:12.500
Here's a view of the Atrium as it looks today,

695
00:43:12.501 --> 00:43:17.501
we are standing in front of the [inaudible] in that employ VM is a statuette and

696
00:43:17.601 --> 00:43:22.430
bronze of the dancing fon from which this house gets its name.

697
00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:25.850
The one that you see there now is a copy and the original is in the

698
00:43:25.851 --> 00:43:27.920
archeological museum in Naples.

699
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.330
This view also shows you the way in which you had the series of visual

700
00:43:32.331 --> 00:43:37.331
experiences from the foul case to the Atrium and ultimately toward the peristyle

701
00:43:38.661 --> 00:43:43.661
with its wonderful forest of columns done Allah Grech in the Greek style.

702
00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.360
Here's another interesting view where it's still in the atrium.

703
00:43:47.361 --> 00:43:50.990
You can see the dancing fon right here.
We're looking at the sidewall.

704
00:43:50.991 --> 00:43:53.840
If we're facing the fon,
this is the wall to the left.

705
00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:58.250
This is very helpful because it shows us exactly what it would,
what the,

706
00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:02.420
the cubicles that opened off the atrium would have looked like.

707
00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.040
You can see that they were very dark.

708
00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:08.360
Some of them had these tiny slit windows or perhaps slightly larger slit
windows,

709
00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.280
but for the most part they were very dark.

710
00:44:10.281 --> 00:44:14.510
Again meant only as a place to sleep at night and to be used for no other

711
00:44:14.511 --> 00:44:17.240
purpose than that.
You can also see from this,

712
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:21.980
this a view that this is a rubble wall that has been stuccoed over,
uh,

713
00:44:21.981 --> 00:44:26.000
and that reliefs painted different colors have been placed on that wall.

714
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.210
This is an example of so called first style Roman wall painting.

715
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:31.670
And we'll go into the,
into what that defined,

716
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:35.130
what that was and discuss it in more detail on Thursday.

717
00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:39.240
This is a wonderful restored view of what the house of the form would have

718
00:44:39.241 --> 00:44:43.910
looked like when all of its first style Roman wall painting was intact,
uh,

719
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:45.070
showing,
uh,

720
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:49.680
what it would've looked like to stand in the atrium and look back through what

721
00:44:49.681 --> 00:44:53.130
survived the,
to bleed them with these very large pilasters,
again,

722
00:44:53.131 --> 00:44:56.940
announcing the Greek leanings of this particular patron,

723
00:44:56.941 --> 00:44:58.630
and then the view,
uh,

724
00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:02.260
to toward the peristyle where you would also see the columns,
uh,

725
00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:04.380
that looked like they were very much in the Greek style.

726
00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:09.380
So here's clearly a person who not only is building his home to correspond to

727
00:45:09.721 --> 00:45:13.200
the latest and domestic architecture,
namely the Helen Hayes,
don't miss type,

728
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:17.400
but who just wants to make that point over and over and over again that he's

729
00:45:17.401 --> 00:45:19.830
cultivated,
that he knows things Greek,
uh,

730
00:45:19.831 --> 00:45:24.831
and that he has the funds to be able to incorporate those into his house.

731
00:45:25.891 --> 00:45:26.430
And indeed,

732
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:31.380
first style wall painting is we'll find out when we discuss it is also a style

733
00:45:31.381 --> 00:45:33.090
then is based on Greek prototypes.

734
00:45:33.091 --> 00:45:36.960
So another example of the Greek elements in this building.

735
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:41.350
What room do you think this is?
I can't,
oh,

736
00:45:41.351 --> 00:45:43.420
I didn't show you this on the plan.
I neglected to,

737
00:45:43.421 --> 00:45:44.860
but you can look at your monument list.

738
00:45:44.861 --> 00:45:47.050
You'll see that when you look at the plan,

739
00:45:47.051 --> 00:45:49.630
you'll see that this house had more than one atrium.

740
00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:52.900
It had two atria and this is one of them.

741
00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:56.800
It's a tech restyle a dream.
Cause you can see there are four columns,

742
00:45:56.801 --> 00:46:01.040
one around each of the,
uh,
of the um,
one,

743
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:05.740
one around each corner of the employee.
Theum.
So a house with two Paris dolls,

744
00:46:05.741 --> 00:46:07.500
a house with two atriums,
uh,

745
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:11.140
and even one of the atriums has four columns as you can see here.

746
00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:13.750
And this one is also very useful for the fact,

747
00:46:13.751 --> 00:46:17.590
one of you asked me a question when we were looking at the Basilica Pompei about

748
00:46:17.591 --> 00:46:21.040
why,
uh,
you know,
why the columns look the way they did.

749
00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:23.140
I think it was you and you can send,

750
00:46:23.141 --> 00:46:25.690
I mentioned that they were pieced and here you can see that very well.

751
00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:30.220
These drums placed one on top of another so that you can see over time how easy

752
00:46:30.221 --> 00:46:33.190
it would be for some of those to fall off or become dismantled.

753
00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:36.520
And for us to be left with the sort of thing that we're left with when we look

754
00:46:36.521 --> 00:46:39.700
at what remains in the basilica of Pompei.

755
00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:42.760
Here's a view obviously of one of the Paris styles here.

756
00:46:42.761 --> 00:46:45.940
You also see something interesting in terms of building technique.

757
00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:49.840
The columns in palm pay tend to be either of local stone,

758
00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:55.450
a local Tufa,
or made up these,
um,
brick,
these tiles that look like bricks.

759
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:58.420
But then in either case,
stuccoed over white,

760
00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:02.890
polluted to make them look once again,
like they aren't marble columns,

761
00:47:02.891 --> 00:47:06.820
the illusion that they are marble columns even though they are not,
uh,

762
00:47:06.821 --> 00:47:11.090
to underscore their Greekness.
Uh,

763
00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.690
this is a view of the,
um,
that Exedra,

764
00:47:14.691 --> 00:47:18.650
that Alexander Exedra that I mentioned to you before that opens off the first

765
00:47:18.651 --> 00:47:23.420
Paris style,
uh,
with two columns on bases here.
Note the red at the bottom,

766
00:47:23.421 --> 00:47:27.620
white at the top,
two pilasters painted red as you can see.

767
00:47:27.621 --> 00:47:30.970
And you can see the tourists there.
Gazing down there,

768
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:34.770
gazing down at a copy.
And this copy by the way of a,

769
00:47:34.771 --> 00:47:37.210
for a very long time in for as long as I remember going there,

770
00:47:37.211 --> 00:47:40.060
except for this last time I was there,
there was nothing there.

771
00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:44.380
And I think most people had no realization that this amazing mosaic originally

772
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.170
was on the floor.
Uh,

773
00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:50.260
but they have put a copy of the mosaic is now in the Naples archeological museum

774
00:47:50.261 --> 00:47:54.350
long ago.
Moved there,
but they finally put a copy down on the floor.
Uh,

775
00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:58.900
so that of the mosaic that was there so that people who visit the house of the

776
00:47:58.901 --> 00:48:03.700
phone realize,
oh,
this is where the Alexander Mosaic was located,

777
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:07.150
which is particularly important because this is a view of the,
of the mosaic,

778
00:48:07.151 --> 00:48:11.440
this extraordinary mural mosaic of Alexander the great that's now in the Naples

779
00:48:11.441 --> 00:48:12.790
archeological museum.

780
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:16.690
And of course you can see that they display it there as if it were a panel

781
00:48:16.691 --> 00:48:18.310
picture hanging on the wall.

782
00:48:18.311 --> 00:48:22.180
But that is not how it was displayed are meant to be displayed in the house of

783
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:26.320
the phone.
It was a floor pavement in the house of the form.
But look how nicely,

784
00:48:26.321 --> 00:48:30.700
at least in the museum they have recreated the ambiance by putting the columns

785
00:48:30.701 --> 00:48:35.080
and the pilasters and they tried to recreate the sense of the ECC Dra just as it

786
00:48:35.081 --> 00:48:38.260
is in the house.
It's just that they put the,
the mosaic and the wrong place.

787
00:48:38.261 --> 00:48:40.410
It should be on the floor.
Uh,

788
00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:43.210
nonetheless you can see it's an extraordinary work of art.

789
00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.550
I'm not going to go into it in great detail,

790
00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:50.410
but I did want to expose you to it because it is so important and so
magnificent.

791
00:48:50.411 --> 00:48:54.970
And I also want to make absolutely sure that you don't miss when you go to the

792
00:48:54.971 --> 00:48:56.650
Naples,
to the Palm Bay area.

793
00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:00.250
You do not miss going to the archeological museum in Naples.

794
00:49:00.251 --> 00:49:04.450
It's an amazing museum,
one of the greatest of all the museums in Italy.

795
00:49:04.451 --> 00:49:05.530
And it has,
of course,

796
00:49:05.531 --> 00:49:10.531
almost all the great stuff that comes from palm pay is at that museum today.

797
00:49:10.841 --> 00:49:15.760
So it's another one of those asterisks must sees a,
you look at it here,

798
00:49:15.761 --> 00:49:20.550
it represents the battle between Alexander and the Persian King Darius,
d a r I,

799
00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:25.150
U s at the famous battle of Isis I s s u s.
A.

800
00:49:25.151 --> 00:49:29.950
And uh,
at that battle,
Alexander was victorious.
Uh,
and uh,

801
00:49:29.951 --> 00:49:30.820
you see it here.

802
00:49:30.821 --> 00:49:34.300
And one of the reasons that it's so important for our understanding of the house

803
00:49:34.301 --> 00:49:39.301
of the Fawn is that we believe that this mosaic was a copy of an earlier last

804
00:49:40.841 --> 00:49:41.770
Greek painting,

805
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:47.160
a Greek painting of this same scene of Alexander and Darius done in around 300

806
00:49:47.771 --> 00:49:52.771
BC by a Greek painter that was copied for this house in mosaic,

807
00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:56.230
uh,
sometime in the second century BC.

808
00:49:56.230 --> 00:50:01.230
So it's another example of this patron of this owner of the house who is so

809
00:50:01.421 --> 00:50:06.421
besotted with Greek art that he wants to have as much of it around him as he

810
00:50:06.551 --> 00:50:11.410
possibly can.
And he clearly has the assets that enable him to,

811
00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:16.180
uh,
commission,
uh,
a mosaic assist to make this amazing painting.

812
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:19.960
Now,
there are a lot of people who talk about this,
this,
this mosaic,
excuse me.

813
00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:22.930
A lot of people that talk about this mosaic and they say,
well,
you know,

814
00:50:22.931 --> 00:50:26.440
it's such a pale reflection of what the painting would have been.
And you know,

815
00:50:26.441 --> 00:50:28.710
it's a typical derivative Roman art.

816
00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:31.190
Did that look at Greek art and derive from it?

817
00:50:31.191 --> 00:50:32.900
They couldn't come up with anything on their own,

818
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.080
but I would maintain that's absolutely untrue.

819
00:50:36.081 --> 00:50:41.081
But I would also maintain that to do this kind of work in mosaic rather than

820
00:50:41.331 --> 00:50:43.820
paint is much more difficult.
I mean,

821
00:50:43.821 --> 00:50:48.320
this is a true tour de force to be able to create this kind of active battle

822
00:50:48.321 --> 00:50:52.310
scene with collapsing horses and uh,
with,
um,

823
00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:56.840
with spears in the sky for shortened,
done for shortened weapons down here.

824
00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:00.620
This is an amazing thing to do in Mosaiq when you think of all of these

825
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:05.540
individual tests or these small stores,
small stones,

826
00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:09.380
multicolored stones that had to be brought together,
placed in mortar,
uh,

827
00:51:09.381 --> 00:51:13.880
to create this amazing tableau.
To me it seems like it is much,

828
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:18.910
much greater feat to have to achieve that and to achieve it so well in mosaic.

829
00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:22.220
Then in paint,
just quickly a couple of details.

830
00:51:22.221 --> 00:51:25.280
Here's the one of Alexander himself on his horse.

831
00:51:25.281 --> 00:51:29.680
It's an incredible characterization of the Great Hellenistic,
uh,
uh,

832
00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:34.250
general and King and you see him on his favorite horse boot capitalists here.

833
00:51:34.251 --> 00:51:39.110
And I think it's a wonderful characterization by this particular very talented

834
00:51:39.111 --> 00:51:41.660
mosaicism.
And his workshop,
uh,

835
00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:45.320
to capture the relationship of man and horse.
I mean,

836
00:51:45.321 --> 00:51:48.140
if you look at not only the eyes but also at the hair,

837
00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:51.050
the hair of Alexander tussled flowing in the wind,

838
00:51:51.051 --> 00:51:54.590
the Mane of the Horse so closely aligned with one another,

839
00:51:54.591 --> 00:51:57.560
the artists has really very effectively captured that.
Again,

840
00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.500
even just using these very small pieces of stone,

841
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.220
which you can see very well here.
Look at the way the shadows that are cast,

842
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:06.920
you know,
even by that stone,
it's,
it's incredible.

843
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:12.190
Here's the other detail that I'm going to show you of Darius on in his chariot.

844
00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:16.170
Uh,
he,
his driver,
as you can see,
he's looking toward Alexandra.

845
00:52:16.171 --> 00:52:21.110
He's mesmerized by the great Hellenistic king,
but he's at the same time afraid.

846
00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:25.340
Uh,
and he's beating a retreat because you can see that his driver has turned the

847
00:52:25.341 --> 00:52:26.300
chariot around.

848
00:52:26.301 --> 00:52:30.110
He's whipping the horse and he's heading in the other direction away from

849
00:52:30.111 --> 00:52:33.980
Alexander as is this figure.
Here we see his horse from the rear,

850
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:36.810
a real tour de force of depicting a horse.
Uh,

851
00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:39.560
but he too is looking at Alexander quite afraid.

852
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:43.310
And his horse is also turning to go off into the distance.

853
00:52:43.311 --> 00:52:47.950
So capturing this very dramatic moment and to me the most wonderful,
uh,

854
00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.390
detail is this one that you see down here,

855
00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.150
which is a view of one of the fallen Persians.

856
00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:58.180
The Shield is falling over on him,
but the shield is,
is,
is,

857
00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:03.200
is,
is polished to such a shine that he can see the reflection of his own face.

858
00:53:03.201 --> 00:53:06.500
I have a detail to show you of this.
He can see the reflection.

859
00:53:06.501 --> 00:53:10.040
You see it here of his own face in that shield.

860
00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.720
And this view is particularly good.

861
00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:16.700
I took this one very close up so that you could see,
uh,
the individual stones.

862
00:53:16.701 --> 00:53:18.800
You don't even it from a distance,
they blend,

863
00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:21.440
but when you go up close you can really see,
oh yeah,
that's,

864
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:24.350
that's a mosaic and it's,
it's really an extraordinary work of art.

865
00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:29.310
Very quick question because
they're very small,

866
00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:32.070
they're very small.
And the reason for that is in large parts of that,

867
00:53:32.071 --> 00:53:35.820
they will blend ultimately and from a distance it will have the feel of a

868
00:53:35.821 --> 00:53:37.680
painting.
Certainly when it's on the wall,

869
00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:41.220
probably less so when you stood and looked at it in its original location

870
00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:45.060
because you'd be looking down on it and you'd be closer to it than here.

871
00:53:45.061 --> 00:53:46.890
But it's an amazing work.
And again,

872
00:53:46.891 --> 00:53:50.550
remember that although the original painting done by the Greek painter was

873
00:53:50.551 --> 00:53:53.130
probably did hang on a wall,
uh,

874
00:53:53.131 --> 00:53:56.640
this one was meant as a floor mosaic in this house,
but again,

875
00:53:56.641 --> 00:54:00.180
a testament to the Greek leanings of this particular patron.

876
00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:04.470
Now I also wanted to show you that's not the only mosaic in palm pay.

877
00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:07.380
It's the greatest by far without question.

878
00:54:07.381 --> 00:54:10.580
And I think everyone who studies this stuff would agree with me that it's the,

879
00:54:10.581 --> 00:54:15.330
the finest surviving mosaic and the history of ancient Greek and Roman art.

880
00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:19.890
Uh,
but there are plenty of other modes mosaics preserved,
including at palm pay.

881
00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.570
And I want to show you just one.

882
00:54:21.571 --> 00:54:25.530
It's mentioned underneath the Alexander Mosaic on your monument list because

883
00:54:25.531 --> 00:54:29.250
it's so beloved,
it's even more beloved by most tourists to the site.

884
00:54:29.251 --> 00:54:30.420
Then the Alexander Mosaic,

885
00:54:30.421 --> 00:54:33.690
which after all you can't see on the site and you have to see it in Naples,

886
00:54:33.691 --> 00:54:38.190
at least the original.
But uh,
this is the so called Callway condom mosaic,

887
00:54:38.191 --> 00:54:41.280
and it belongs to the House of the tragic poet,

888
00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:46.550
a house that was put up between 62 and 79 a d and you see what's meant to be a

889
00:54:46.741 --> 00:54:49.080
very ferocious dog with his teeth bared.

890
00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:52.110
This one has done much more simply and only three colors,

891
00:54:52.111 --> 00:54:55.590
mainly black and white test Ari or small stones,
t.

892
00:54:55.591 --> 00:54:59.760
E.
S.
S.
E.
R.
A.
E.
It's what these small stones are called,
the test Iri,

893
00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:03.530
black and white,
basically black on white.
Uh,

894
00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:07.320
but you can see that there's one touch of red,
the color of the dog,

895
00:55:07.321 --> 00:55:10.080
and the dog is chained.
As you can see,
just like that poor,

896
00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:14.700
a plaster cast of the dog that we saw last time.
He's chained,

897
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:16.530
but he's meant to look very ferocious.

898
00:55:16.531 --> 00:55:21.270
He's baring his teeth and the whole point call icon and beware of dog is for you

899
00:55:21.271 --> 00:55:26.010
to be a war.
And of the fact that if you dare step any further than that,

900
00:55:26.011 --> 00:55:29.430
vestibule them and try to get into this house or try to steal anything or

901
00:55:29.431 --> 00:55:33.210
whatever,
this dog will attack.
So it's the same kind of,

902
00:55:33.211 --> 00:55:36.900
it's like a security alarm system actually for antiquity.
And you can,

903
00:55:36.901 --> 00:55:40.590
I bet you can tell me where in the house this a mosaic was located.

904
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:46.980
Neil in the,
in the vestibule and where the foul case of the house.
Yeah,

905
00:55:46.981 --> 00:55:50.340
probably the vestibule.
I'm actually indeed the vestibule of the house.

906
00:55:50.341 --> 00:55:53.100
So that even before you got into,
as far as the fal case,

907
00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:57.090
you were warned that you'd better be aware of the dog and this thing.

908
00:55:57.091 --> 00:55:59.610
I mean you will see this.
Any of you been to palm pay?
No.

909
00:55:59.611 --> 00:56:01.050
This and can attest that on,
right?

910
00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:05.640
Every single souvenir stand anywhere within any,

911
00:56:05.641 --> 00:56:09.440
any numbers of yards of Pompei is selling the call way cotton.

912
00:56:09.441 --> 00:56:13.830
I'm on everything you can possibly imagine the mugs,
the t shirts,
the hot plates,

913
00:56:13.831 --> 00:56:18.360
the whatever,
the tote bags,
you can get the call icon,
condom and every shape,

914
00:56:18.361 --> 00:56:22.920
size and possibility.
And I have one of those myself.
Only one,

915
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:25.810
one hot plate.
But that's it.
I dive.
I did it.

916
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:29.420
I did it like everybody else at one point years ago.
Uh,

917
00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:33.700
I want to show you briefly a couple of other houses just to make,
uh,
some,

918
00:56:33.701 --> 00:56:37.240
a few small points while important points,
uh,

919
00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:39.280
an important point or two about each of them.

920
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:43.810
The first one is the house of [inaudible] in palm pay,

921
00:56:43.811 --> 00:56:47.530
which dates to the second century BC and later,
uh,

922
00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:49.570
you see it in plan here,

923
00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:53.890
the house of the [inaudible] like everything else we've seen in the latter part

924
00:56:53.891 --> 00:56:56.260
of this lecture is a Hellenized Domus.
Uh,

925
00:56:56.261 --> 00:56:59.950
you can tell that because of the Paris style here,
in other respects,

926
00:56:59.951 --> 00:57:03.350
it's very similar to everything we've seen.
The usual foul k's,
atrium,

927
00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:06.830
cubic ulum to bleed them system,
the,
uh,

928
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:11.940
large Paris style up here and some dining spaces opening off that Paris style.

929
00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:14.440
What makes this particular house interesting.

930
00:57:14.441 --> 00:57:18.640
And the reason that I show it to you is it's a good illustration of what happens

931
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:23.670
when over time you remodel and also over time when other a property becomes

932
00:57:24.641 --> 00:57:26.080
available nearby.

933
00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:31.300
And we can tell from this plan that what happened here is that the core of the

934
00:57:31.301 --> 00:57:34.120
house was added to as property on either side,

935
00:57:34.121 --> 00:57:38.860
additional property became available and this owner purchased that property and

936
00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:43.690
added it,
uh,
and the plan becomes much more irregular obviously because of that.

937
00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:46.240
An addition over here,
in addition over here,
you know,

938
00:57:46.241 --> 00:57:50.800
some of that sense of axiology and symmetry is lost when you start to add to

939
00:57:50.801 --> 00:57:52.740
either side horizontally.
Uh,

940
00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:55.960
but there are lots of houses like this and it's one of the things one needs to

941
00:57:55.961 --> 00:57:57.940
keep in mind as one,

942
00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:03.460
as one visits the city and as one looks at each of these incredible structures.

943
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:06.580
Just very quickly with regard to the house,

944
00:58:06.581 --> 00:58:08.500
just as you have a sense of what it looks like today,

945
00:58:08.501 --> 00:58:12.820
it's named the house of Manana because of this painting of the poet,
uh,

946
00:58:12.850 --> 00:58:16.900
who sits on a chair over there on one of the walls of the house.
Uh,

947
00:58:16.901 --> 00:58:21.901
the part of the peristyle is actually quite well preserved as is the atrium

948
00:58:22.001 --> 00:58:25.890
we're standing in the atrium,
as you can obviously see with the employee beum.

949
00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:27.430
Looking back toward the garden.

950
00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.900
This is interesting because you can see again the the uh,

951
00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:35.520
cubicles opening off either side but also because of the incorporation justice

952
00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:38.740
in the house of the font of columns elsewhere.

953
00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:40.550
Then just in the Paris style,

954
00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:45.780
these in that transition place between the Atrium and the um,

955
00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:50.650
the garden,
the so called to bleed them space.

956
00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:55.060
These very large columns stuccoed over fluted and you can see in this case,

957
00:58:55.061 --> 00:58:56.380
not painted red at the bottom,

958
00:58:56.381 --> 00:59:00.610
but a kind of bright yellow to match the colors of the wall.
So again,

959
00:59:00.611 --> 00:59:04.390
this incorporation of Greek elements into houses like this one.

960
00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:05.650
This is also a good view.

961
00:59:05.651 --> 00:59:09.190
It's a very well preserved house and we're back in the atrium again,

962
00:59:09.191 --> 00:59:12.910
you can see the way in which the cubicles to the small cubicles are open off

963
00:59:12.911 --> 00:59:15.220
that you can see some of the paintings and you,

964
00:59:15.221 --> 00:59:17.110
here's the entrance way through the foul case.

965
00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:19.930
And you can see in this particular case a small shrine,

966
00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:23.780
this located in the corner of the purpose of that for the household to display

967
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:25.490
the household gods.

968
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:29.540
This is another interesting house that I just wanted treat fleetingly.

969
00:59:29.541 --> 00:59:34.541
It's the so called house of Panza in palm pay and it dates to the second century

970
00:59:35.091 --> 00:59:37.920
BC.
Uh,
and it's a very large houses.

971
00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:42.940
You can see like all the other hellenized a misses because we see that it has a

972
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:47.510
peristyle,
uh,
with columns here.
Uh,
it like all the others,

973
00:59:47.511 --> 00:59:51.290
it has everything that we've seen,
the vestibular and the foul case,
the atrium,

974
00:59:51.291 --> 00:59:55.610
the cubicles are the wings or all lie the to bleed them a dining room.
Uh,

975
00:59:55.611 --> 00:59:58.820
and uh,
a bevy of shops down here in fact,

976
00:59:58.821 --> 01:00:02.660
more shops than we have seen a be the case in most of the houses.

977
01:00:02.661 --> 01:00:06.980
We've looked at at least five if not six shops down here,

978
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:10.970
which gives us something of a clue to something that might be going on in this

979
01:00:10.971 --> 01:00:14.630
house.
If we go back to the peristyle and we take a look at that,

980
01:00:14.631 --> 01:00:18.780
we see that there's a pool in,
in between the columns and you might Spec,

981
01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:21.110
and I know how nice,
you know,
a nice,
pleasant pool.

982
01:00:21.111 --> 01:00:24.620
You could sit around and you could dip your hands or your feet into that pool

983
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:28.220
was nice,
pleasurable spot to enjoy.
Well actually it wasn't that at all.

984
01:00:28.221 --> 01:00:33.170
We think now that it was probably a pool that held fish and fish,
not fish,

985
01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:36.800
just attract the fish that one could admire but actually fish that one that were

986
01:00:36.801 --> 01:00:38.900
sold in one of the shops in front.

987
01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:43.490
One of the reasons we believe that is a scholar by the name of Wilhelmina,

988
01:00:43.491 --> 01:00:48.491
your Shamsky whose specialty is gardens of Pompei has spent her whole scholarly

989
01:00:48.501 --> 01:00:51.680
career and it was well worth it cause she's come up with some extraordinary

990
01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:56.360
things on studying the root marks,
uh,
of the gardens in palm pay.

991
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:59.840
And she's been able to demonstrate through studying those and working with

992
01:00:59.841 --> 01:01:03.350
experts on that sort of thing.
Just what was grown in these gardens.

993
01:01:03.351 --> 01:01:06.800
And you find that some of them were pleasure gardens with beautiful flowers and

994
01:01:06.801 --> 01:01:10.520
some of them were produced gardens and this one was a produce garden so that

995
01:01:10.521 --> 01:01:13.520
there would have been vegetables and fruits and so on that were,

996
01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:16.340
that were gardened here.
Uh,
and then you,

997
01:01:16.341 --> 01:01:19.730
and then they were sold in the shops that were located at the front.

998
01:01:19.731 --> 01:01:22.970
So here we see a wonderful example of the way in which,
uh,

999
01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:28.100
these houses could even be used by some owners as a means of income for them and

1000
01:01:30.021 --> 01:01:33.770
for their families.
And that was surely the case with the house of Panza.

1001
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:36.680
It also has a very WellPreserved peristyle.

1002
01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:41.540
We can see the column c are around that pool that was used to hold the fish that

1003
01:01:41.541 --> 01:01:45.630
were sold in one of the shops are the columns are extremely WellPreserved,

1004
01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.980
including some of the capital's ionic capitals,
as you can see here.

1005
01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:51.230
And the fluting.
And then the plane,
you know,

1006
01:01:51.231 --> 01:01:53.630
this stuccoed over at the bottom with the paint.

1007
01:01:53.631 --> 01:01:57.770
We can see in this case remains of the red paint that would have decorated the

1008
01:01:57.771 --> 01:02:00.320
bottom part of those columns.

1009
01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:05.060
Another very interesting house.
Uh,
well,
you know,

1010
01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:09.720
interesting house in one that's important for us because it marks a,
a,

1011
01:02:09.721 --> 01:02:14.721
a later development in a Roman house architecture in palm pay is the house of

1012
01:02:15.591 --> 01:02:17.810
Marcus Lorraine.
This timber,
Tina's,

1013
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:21.960
remember bar was the ancient word for Tivoli.

1014
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:26.760
And so it's likely that tee routine is in fact came from Tivoli move to Palm

1015
01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.260
Pompei and built this large house,
uh,

1016
01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.220
sometime between the earthquake and the eruption of Vesuvius.

1017
01:02:32.221 --> 01:02:34.470
So 62 to 79,

1018
01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:37.380
a d like the house of the phone.

1019
01:02:37.381 --> 01:02:41.430
It took up an entire city block.
Uh,
and,

1020
01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:45.990
but you can see that the owner has made a different decision then the owner of

1021
01:02:45.991 --> 01:02:47.160
the house of the Fawn,

1022
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:52.410
because the house itself takes up very little space and most of this space is

1023
01:02:52.411 --> 01:02:53.820
taken up by the garden.

1024
01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:57.580
We're less sure here whether this was a pleasurable garden there,

1025
01:02:57.581 --> 01:03:01.050
there are some indications that it might have been or whether it too was used as

1026
01:03:01.051 --> 01:03:03.540
a produce garden.
We don't have all those shops on the front,

1027
01:03:03.541 --> 01:03:05.730
so that seems less likely here.

1028
01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:10.710
But you can see it's another example of the way in which these houses are

1029
01:03:10.711 --> 01:03:12.570
becoming not only more personalized,

1030
01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:17.810
but also with much more emphasis on the garden and on the dining rooms that are

1031
01:03:18.001 --> 01:03:21.210
surrounding that garden.
We see one of those dining rooms here.

1032
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:25.140
What's particularly interesting about this house and one that helps us round the

1033
01:03:25.141 --> 01:03:29.010
circle to where I began at the beginning of the lecture when I talked about the

1034
01:03:29.011 --> 01:03:32.370
fact that it was between 62 and 79 that the,

1035
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:36.870
that the pump patients began to build second stories on their houses.

1036
01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:37.820
They,
they,

1037
01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:42.570
they began to expand vertically and we saw the Canaliculi of the via Dell

1038
01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.020
abundance of building.
We see the same thing happening here,

1039
01:03:46.021 --> 01:03:49.410
that a second story has been added around the living quarters.

1040
01:03:49.411 --> 01:03:53.040
Now here it was obviously really needed because they were giving much base to

1041
01:03:53.041 --> 01:03:55.770
the living quarters.
So they had to build up vertically for those.

1042
01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.320
And if you look very carefully at the restored view,

1043
01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:02.610
you will see that the windows of that second story open off,

1044
01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:03.450
uh,

1045
01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:08.450
and look out over onto the calm plutonium of the,

1046
01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:12.240
um,
of the atrium.
You see that they're the conclusion of the atrium.

1047
01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.840
And then around it you can see the second story,
uh,

1048
01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:19.620
with the windows looking out over the complete VM of the house.
Then the rest,

1049
01:04:19.621 --> 01:04:22.950
needless to say,
garden,
it's actually pretty well preserved.

1050
01:04:22.951 --> 01:04:24.360
It's fun to wander around.

1051
01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:28.160
You see these wonderful trellises and all kinds of of art,

1052
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:31.120
interesting architectural forms that form that,

1053
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:35.760
that are part of this incredible garden in the house of timber.
Tina's.

1054
01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:39.030
And you even see there this magnificent grotto,

1055
01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:43.170
which leads me to believe that we're beginning to see something interesting
here,

1056
01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:46.920
which is the incorporation of the sorts of things that you would tend to see in

1057
01:04:46.921 --> 01:04:49.320
villas,
not right in the center of a city,
uh,

1058
01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:54.350
but villas that were located either outside the city or a long or along the

1059
01:04:54.421 --> 01:04:57.960
coast or along the coast.
Uh,
and um,

1060
01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:03.480
and the reason I say that here is because we can see this grotto like effect,

1061
01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:07.800
uh,
where we have what looks like a pebbled effect on the back wall,

1062
01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:12.620
painted a two columns,
Corinthian columns with um,

1063
01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:16.950
uh,
a pediment above.
And then these two wonderful mythological paintings.

1064
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.960
One you probably recognize as the myth of Narcissus.

1065
01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:22.090
You can see his reflection in the water.

1066
01:05:22.091 --> 01:05:24.610
He's of miring himself and his reflection down below.

1067
01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.710
And then Pyramus and Thisbe over here.

1068
01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:30.460
What's important to us is not which myths but just that Greek myths are

1069
01:05:30.461 --> 01:05:32.440
incorporated into the scheme here.

1070
01:05:32.441 --> 01:05:36.370
So this a pretension toward things Greek but most important,

1071
01:05:36.371 --> 01:05:40.390
this sort of this grotto like element that you would tend to find in a villa

1072
01:05:40.391 --> 01:05:45.380
along the Amalfi coast or some such rather than in downtown palm pay.

1073
01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:45.800
Uh,

1074
01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.600
so we speak to see this interesting merging at least for the very well to do the

1075
01:05:49.601 --> 01:05:52.970
rich and famous as we the lifestyles of the rich and famous as this.

1076
01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:57.190
As this lecture is called.
Uh,
we began to see that in some of the houses,

1077
01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:59.110
especially in the later period.

1078
01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:03.490
I'd like to the La one of the second to last,

1079
01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:07.780
a building that I want to show you is an extremely important one.

1080
01:06:07.781 --> 01:06:10.630
The last one we'll just look at for a minute or so,
but this,

1081
01:06:10.631 --> 01:06:13.090
this one is an extremely important building.

1082
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:15.820
It is the Ville of the mysteries in Pompei.

1083
01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.280
It is indeed a villa a.

1084
01:06:19.290 --> 01:06:23.200
So it's a nice segue from the Laureus Teper Tina's house.
Uh,

1085
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:25.180
what started to happen in palm pay,

1086
01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:28.030
even though there was quite a bit of space initially,
as time went on,

1087
01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:33.160
things became more crowded and the really well to do began to move outside the

1088
01:06:33.161 --> 01:06:36.670
city to the,
to the suburbs,
so to speak,
right outside the city.

1089
01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:37.870
Interestingly enough,

1090
01:06:37.871 --> 01:06:41.530
right along those same streets that formed the cemeteries of the city.

1091
01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:46.330
So we see this villas in the cemeteries intermixing in a very natural way.
Uh,

1092
01:06:46.331 --> 01:06:49.870
but this very important villa was part of that development.

1093
01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:54.550
And I want to say it went through a couple of phases and I want to show you the

1094
01:06:54.551 --> 01:06:58.570
two phases here.
Uh,
the phase only phase two is on your monument lists.

1095
01:06:58.571 --> 01:07:00.340
I won't hold you responsible for phase one,

1096
01:07:00.341 --> 01:07:04.510
but I think it's important for us to look at it together because what we see

1097
01:07:04.511 --> 01:07:08.260
here is something very interesting.
Uh,
we looking at the top,

1098
01:07:08.261 --> 01:07:13.180
we see the entrance into the villa.
We see the peristyle there,
the atrium there,

1099
01:07:13.181 --> 01:07:17.500
and the to bleed them there.
Now what do you think about that?
I mean,

1100
01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:19.630
it's very strange.
We've never seen a house,

1101
01:07:19.631 --> 01:07:24.040
that house or villa that departed from the scheme that we talked about before

1102
01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:26.830
from this movement,
from the entrance way,

1103
01:07:26.831 --> 01:07:31.360
the foul ks into the peristyle first,
then into the atrium,
then into the,

1104
01:07:31.361 --> 01:07:34.680
to bleed them.
It's a different progression.
Uh,
we,
we might,

1105
01:07:34.681 --> 01:07:36.190
might think to ourselves,
well this must be the,

1106
01:07:36.191 --> 01:07:39.550
the whim of this particular patron,
but Bertrubias tells us otherwise.

1107
01:07:39.551 --> 01:07:40.384
But Truvia is,

1108
01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:44.770
tells us about villa design and he tells us the major distinction between Roman

1109
01:07:44.771 --> 01:07:49.771
villas and Roman houses in terms of their plan is that in Roman villas you enter

1110
01:07:49.811 --> 01:07:51.490
into the peristyle first.

1111
01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:55.480
So it shows again the growing interest in Paris styles,
uh,

1112
01:07:55.481 --> 01:07:56.860
and yet this Paris style very,

1113
01:07:56.861 --> 01:08:00.640
very early indeed because it belongs to the first phase,

1114
01:08:00.641 --> 01:08:03.640
which is even before the or or you know,

1115
01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:08.410
even before the early second century AED,
which is when the second century BC,

1116
01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:11.110
which is when the second phase is dated.

1117
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:16.200
We can also see here a great podium and I'll say a bit more about the podium.

1118
01:08:16.461 --> 01:08:20.240
As we look at phase two.
This is phase two of the house.

1119
01:08:20.241 --> 01:08:21.890
And this is the one that you have at the villa.

1120
01:08:21.891 --> 01:08:25.910
This is the one that you have on your monument list.
The main spaces are,

1121
01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:30.890
are labeled here.
You can see the entrance way,
the foul case,
the peristyle first,

1122
01:08:30.891 --> 01:08:34.430
a very large pallet Paris style,
the Atrium of the house here,

1123
01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.960
that to bleed them over here.

1124
01:08:35.961 --> 01:08:38.600
So this different order described by Vitruvian [inaudible].

1125
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:41.750
We can see also that it rests on a tall podium.

1126
01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:43.490
I'll show you what it looks like in a moment.

1127
01:08:43.491 --> 01:08:47.180
It is a podium that looks exactly like the Podio we saw for the great

1128
01:08:47.181 --> 01:08:49.970
sanctuaries at Tivoli and Palestrina.

1129
01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.380
We see that underneath that podium just as it,

1130
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:57.350
those are Jupiter anx or terror Cina just as a terror Cina we see there's a crip

1131
01:08:57.351 --> 01:09:00.980
to porticas or underground passageway underneath that podium.

1132
01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:04.510
It is barrel vaulted and the,
the,
um,

1133
01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:09.620
concrete is faced with opus and carrot and work just as we saw it in the

1134
01:09:10.190 --> 01:09:13.460
sanctuaries.
Why have this kind of podium here,
uh,

1135
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:18.350
to give the villa and even grander appearance to put it up high on top of a

1136
01:09:18.351 --> 01:09:21.540
podium and also to help to,
uh,

1137
01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:26.200
to muffle the sounds from the street.
Remember is a major street,
uh,

1138
01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:30.950
a thoroughfare that leads it's just left the city and has become an inter city

1139
01:09:30.951 --> 01:09:31.850
road,
uh,

1140
01:09:31.851 --> 01:09:36.260
to muffle the sounds at one would hear from that by raising the villa in a sense

1141
01:09:36.261 --> 01:09:37.094
away from them.

1142
01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:41.210
The most important point though that I can make about this villa and something

1143
01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:44.750
that speaks to the future is the fact that we are beginning to see.

1144
01:09:44.751 --> 01:09:49.751
We've talked about how enclosed and plain and severe the earlier exteriors of

1145
01:09:50.421 --> 01:09:53.870
Roman houses were even up through the hell of a nice dome is except perhaps for

1146
01:09:53.871 --> 01:09:56.810
the addition of a pilaster or a column here and there.

1147
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:59.420
Here we see something entirely new happening.

1148
01:09:59.421 --> 01:10:02.840
We see that the architect has designed these elements,

1149
01:10:02.841 --> 01:10:06.470
that project out of the,
uh,
the,

1150
01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:10.370
the rectangle of the villa plan,
uh,

1151
01:10:10.371 --> 01:10:14.540
and are curved.
And you can see one over here and most importantly one over here.

1152
01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:18.440
It's like a giant bay window,
uh,
with,
um,

1153
01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:24.050
with w with views,
uh,
that can be seen through that bay window.

1154
01:10:24.051 --> 01:10:29.051
So this projecting out into the viewers space and so on and also into the space

1155
01:10:30.111 --> 01:10:34.190
of those who live inside this building offering wonderful panoramas and vistas

1156
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:38.240
of the sea beyond the sea was closer to Pompei pay at that point than it

1157
01:10:38.241 --> 01:10:43.030
actually is today.
Beautiful views out onto the sea.
Uh,
and they,

1158
01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:43.851
they in a sense,

1159
01:10:43.851 --> 01:10:48.530
the exterior of the structure breaking out of it's out of it's rectangular

1160
01:10:48.531 --> 01:10:53.420
bonds,
uh,
to do something entirely different from what has come before.

1161
01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:57.560
This is a restored view of what that structure would have looked like in its

1162
01:10:57.561 --> 01:10:58.341
second phase.

1163
01:10:58.341 --> 01:11:03.170
And I think you can see that very well here resting on this tall podium arcades

1164
01:11:03.171 --> 01:11:04.560
just as at the sanctuaries.

1165
01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:09.580
These are blind arcades just as we saw their concrete opus and cared and facing.

1166
01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:13.770
But look at the difference that this having this bay window made.

1167
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:17.760
They've opened up the wall.
The windows are very large,
no more slit windows,

1168
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.730
big panoramic windows projecting elements.

1169
01:11:20.731 --> 01:11:25.230
Also with very large windows is hardly any wall there whatsoever.

1170
01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.630
The rest is the same.
The comp Blue Beam,

1171
01:11:27.631 --> 01:11:30.690
the parasol all look like they did in the Hella Nice Domus.

1172
01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.590
But this is a big change and one that,
uh,

1173
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:38.760
looks forward again to the future.
This is a view of it as it looks today,

1174
01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:39.750
the villa,
the mysteries,

1175
01:11:39.751 --> 01:11:44.250
you can see the great podium over here with its blind arcades as well as part of

1176
01:11:44.251 --> 01:11:48.090
the house.
And Look at how open that house is.
Now,
part of this is villas.

1177
01:11:48.091 --> 01:11:48.241
You know,

1178
01:11:48.241 --> 01:11:52.410
there's more of a desire when you build the villa to open it up more so than a

1179
01:11:52.411 --> 01:11:53.400
house in town.

1180
01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.240
But it's also an important development for architecture as a whole.

1181
01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:59.670
This is a view of the peristyle court.

1182
01:11:59.671 --> 01:12:02.610
It's little different than any other peristyle court we've seen.

1183
01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:07.850
Cause you can see they have embedded the columns into the wall of the,

1184
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:12.510
uh,
the wall.
There's a wall around it.
The columns are embedded into that,

1185
01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:17.510
which is a different motif.
And I thought she'd be amused to see that.
Um,
the,

1186
01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.230
the Ville of the mysteries is one of those.

1187
01:12:19.231 --> 01:12:21.330
And there are several places in Italy,

1188
01:12:21.331 --> 01:12:25.920
many places in Italy where people go in particular to take photos of after their

1189
01:12:25.921 --> 01:12:29.430
wedding to take photos of themselves,
photo op places.

1190
01:12:29.710 --> 01:12:31.830
And the villa Mr of the mysteries is one of them.

1191
01:12:31.831 --> 01:12:34.080
So you don't be at all surprised if you are there,

1192
01:12:34.081 --> 01:12:38.730
especially on a weekend if you see a wedding party taking photos and this was

1193
01:12:38.731 --> 01:12:40.140
one of the more discreet photos,

1194
01:12:40.141 --> 01:12:44.910
you can just imagine the kinds of poses that people take in,
in places like this.

1195
01:12:45.090 --> 01:12:46.980
I could've shown you all kinds of very music,

1196
01:12:46.981 --> 01:12:49.620
very loving photos of the bride and groom.

1197
01:12:49.621 --> 01:12:52.530
But here you just get a sense of awe and the photographer.

1198
01:12:52.531 --> 01:12:56.430
And there were several photographers the day I took this,
uh,
getting wonderful,

1199
01:12:56.450 --> 01:13:01.350
um,
uh,
images of this bride and groom after the happy event.

1200
01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:04.890
I just want to close just very briefly with the,
um,

1201
01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:09.150
with this last house or this Mosaic Fountain from this last house.

1202
01:13:09.630 --> 01:13:11.790
It's the so called House of the large fountain,

1203
01:13:11.791 --> 01:13:15.060
so called because of this extraordinary fountain that was found there.

1204
01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:19.770
And still exist dates to between the earthquake and the eruption of Vesuvius 62

1205
01:13:19.771 --> 01:13:22.860
to 79 a d it's very well preserved.

1206
01:13:22.861 --> 01:13:25.170
You see it here on the right hand side of the screen.

1207
01:13:25.410 --> 01:13:29.970
It shows you that mosaics could be applied to any kind of surface by these very

1208
01:13:29.971 --> 01:13:34.440
talented artists.
Uh,
this,
this case applied to a curved surface.

1209
01:13:34.441 --> 01:13:36.840
As you can see very well here.
Once again,

1210
01:13:36.841 --> 01:13:41.490
using multicolored test Iri as we saw in the Alexander mosaic.

1211
01:13:41.491 --> 01:13:44.850
And you can only imagine how lovely it was when there was actually a water

1212
01:13:44.851 --> 01:13:46.800
display and so on.
In fact,

1213
01:13:46.801 --> 01:13:51.801
so lovely that it was imitated almost exactly for the Getty villa and Malibu,

1214
01:13:52.321 --> 01:13:55.080
which I saw you on the left hand side of the screen.
Uh,

1215
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:58.560
many of you have probably been there.
The Getty villa,
it looks like Disneyland.

1216
01:13:58.561 --> 01:13:58.951
I know,

1217
01:13:58.951 --> 01:14:03.570
but it probably gives you a better sense of what a Roman villa looked like in

1218
01:14:03.571 --> 01:14:04.110
antiquity.

1219
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:08.220
Then anything else even that you can see in Rome because it's in such pristine

1220
01:14:08.221 --> 01:14:10.100
shape.
Uh,
and it really gives you,
it is,

1221
01:14:10.101 --> 01:14:11.830
it is based for any of you who don't know.

1222
01:14:11.831 --> 01:14:16.570
It is actually based on an on an on a villa from Herculaneum that was excavated.

1223
01:14:16.571 --> 01:14:18.760
We know it.
It's based very closely on it.

1224
01:14:18.761 --> 01:14:22.030
The so called bill of the Papiri at Herculaneum,
uh,

1225
01:14:22.031 --> 01:14:25.000
and then it picks and chooses,
you know,
it looks at other things as well,

1226
01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:28.630
incorporates them as it incorporated this fountain.
But it probably gives you,

1227
01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:30.030
it's in better condition.
Uh,

1228
01:14:30.170 --> 01:14:33.980
you can see that the water display is actually working unlike the one in Palm

1229
01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:34.120
Bay.

1230
01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.410
So it gives you a very good sense of what this thing would have looked like in

1231
01:14:38.411 --> 01:14:41.410
antiquity.
And just as a look forward,
uh,

1232
01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:44.380
one of the paper topics for this course actually is to,

1233
01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:49.060
as to talk about the bill of the Papiri and the context in part and being helped

1234
01:14:49.061 --> 01:14:53.290
by,
uh,
the REC reconstruction at the Getty Museum on Thursday.

1235
01:14:53.290 --> 01:14:57.250
We will move on to Herculaneum.
We will talk about the lives of the people there,

1236
01:14:57.251 --> 01:15:00.870
some of the houses that were built there between the eruption of a,

1237
01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:03.130
between the earthquake and Vesuvius.

1238
01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:08.140
And we will also begin our conversation about first style and second style Roman

1239
01:15:08.141 --> 01:15:09.450
wall painting.
Uh,

1240
01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:13.720
we'll have a few lectures on painting because it's so important as the interior

1241
01:15:13.721 --> 01:15:18.460
decoration of these homes.
And because as we'll see,
it depicts architecture.

1242
01:15:18.461 --> 01:15:21.940
And you can get a sense of that here in ways that are very intriguing.

1243
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:26.560
And the tell us even more about buildings than we already know.

1244
01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.470
Thanks everybody.
Or good afternoon.
Good morning..
