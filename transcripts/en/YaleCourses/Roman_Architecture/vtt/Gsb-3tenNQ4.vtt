1
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.460
Good morning.
It's Nog Aeration Day,

2
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:10.110
happy inauguration day to everyone.
And I,
I thought,

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.830
um,
that actually the inauguration of Barack Obama today,
uh,

4
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.170
and the particular lecture in this class are very well suited to one another

5
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.030
because although you see that the title of today's lecture technology is

6
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:26.820
technology and revolution in Roman art,

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.210
I could also call it something like the change the Romans believed in because

8
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:37.221
the change the Romans believed in the change the Romans believed in was a shift

9
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.860
from what we've called traditional Roman architecture to innovative Roman

10
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:46.650
architecture.
And that's what we're going to be talking about today,

11
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:50.100
what we call innovative and what we'll call in the course of this semester,

12
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.530
innovative Roman architecture.

13
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.890
We've already talked about what we've called traditional Roman architecture and

14
00:00:58.171 --> 00:01:02.670
I just want to look again with you to begin today.
Uh,

15
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:06.120
with the Temple of Port Tunis that we looked at last time,

16
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:09.800
the Temple of Port Tunis in Rome near the Tiber river.
Uh,

17
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.770
a temple that was put up in the late second,
early first century BC.

18
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.940
And we talked about the fact that this was a traditional Roman building.

19
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:21.390
Of This Day to traditional Roman building,
though that was quite derivative,

20
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.440
that looked back at Greek architecture,
Greek religious architecture,

21
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:29.640
and to trust skin religious architecture and drew from both of those two

22
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:30.181
elements,

23
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:35.181
from both of those and combined them together into what we termed a new Roman

24
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:40.620
creation.
At least in the traditional vein.
We talked about the fact that the,

25
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.300
the Etruscan elements of this particular monument where it's tall podium,

26
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.890
where it's deep porch,

27
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:51.891
where the freestanding columns in that porch were the single staircase and the,

28
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.520
uh,

29
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.440
the emphasis on the facade that having that single staircase achieved.

30
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.600
Uh,
we also talked about the fact that while there were columns all around the

31
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:07.550
structure,
which is actually a Greek,
uh,
Greek,
uh,

32
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.970
way of doing things,

33
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.990
that those columns where we're attached or engaged into the wall,

34
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.130
which still gave it a certain sense of flatness,
including on the back,

35
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.370
that was also characteristic of a trust in architecture.

36
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.240
We also talked about the Greek elements that were incorporated here,

37
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.000
and those included the fact that the building was made out of stone.
Uh,

38
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.090
and also the fact that one of the traditional Greek orders in this case,

39
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:37.110
the ionic order,
uh,
was used for the structure.

40
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:41.850
So this bringing together of Greek and a trust can elements in this thoroughly a

41
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:44.910
Roman building.
Uh,
but a building that again,

42
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:49.230
we would call a traditional Roman building.
And what do I mean by traditional?

43
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.180
All the traditional Roman building share in common,
the following features,

44
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.810
they have columns and they have walls.

45
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.860
And those columns walls serve a structural purpose and that is to hold up the

46
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:05.700
flat or the sloping ceiling,
uh,

47
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.570
and that the sloping roof and that is in fact exactly what you see here.

48
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.550
But at this very same time and the second century BC and into the first century

49
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:16.384
BC,

50
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.510
we begin to see a new kind of experimentation that is going on concurrently with

51
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:27.150
this,
uh,
and experimentation that grows up and some of the same towns,
uh,

52
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.820
that we see traditional buildings like this.
And what this,

53
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.850
what made this experimentation different than anything that had come before is

54
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:38.310
the fact that the Romans used,
uh,

55
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.980
for these buildings at completely new material.

56
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.080
And that material is concrete.

57
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.220
We talked about the fact that already in the temple of poor Tunis,

58
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.630
concrete was used,
but concrete was used only in the podium.

59
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:57.550
You can't see it.
It is inside the podium and serves to strengthen concrete,

60
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:01.480
has an indoor,
a great deal of strength and can sustain great weights.

61
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:05.770
And so it was placed in the podium for utilitarian purposes so that it could

62
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:10.600
help to support the temple that was located on top.
But again,

63
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:15.601
none of it's expressive possibilities were explored by the designer of the

64
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.120
Temple of Port Tunis or any of the other temples we looked at last time.

65
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.620
But what begins to happen also in the course of the second and fourth centuries

66
00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:28.540
BC is architects beginning to realize that this new,
uh,

67
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.600
concrete technology has an opportunity to transform a Roman architecture and

68
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:39.571
they begin to experiment with that transformation in order to understand the

69
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:43.240
concrete buildings that we're going to be looking at this morning,

70
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:46.870
which are absolutely fascinating.
And I hope you'll be as a,

71
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:49.300
as enthralled by them as I am.

72
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:53.860
And they again stand at the very beginning of this development of,
of uh,

73
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.900
innovative architecture in Rome.

74
00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.200
It's important to know a bit about concrete Roman concrete that is a,

75
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.040
and I want to make a few points about it.
Roman concrete,
the,

76
00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:10.780
the Latin term forward,
his opus [inaudible] mentee them as I've indicated here,

77
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.030
Roman concrete is different from what we think of today as concrete.

78
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.330
It's a composite of various natural elements that becomes a liquid mass when

79
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:26.881
mixed with water and eventually hardens into a very,

80
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.540
very strong substance,

81
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.040
much stronger than any of its ingredients are on their own.

82
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.910
Roman concrete was a mixture of stone rubble and liquid mortar and composed of

83
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:45.001
lime sand and something called Putz Solana Pot Solana being a volcanic

84
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:49.960
substance,
which was very plentiful in Italy,

85
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:53.860
especially around the area of uh,
Pompei Herculaneum.

86
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.860
The area of Campania concrete was used in Rome from the early second century BC

87
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:00.200
on,

88
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.120
but it was not until the end of the second century and the beginning of the

89
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:10.121
first century that the expressive possibilities of concrete began to be fully

90
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.880
realized.
Concrete.

91
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:17.360
I think this is also important to mention when you think about concrete

92
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:18.490
construction,
uh,

93
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.000
in relationship to a stone construction that we've already discussed.

94
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.320
A concrete is not cut or quarried the way stone is.

95
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.230
A concrete is cast in molds.

96
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.890
Concrete can be cast in any shape,

97
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.920
at least any shape that a carpenter can build with wood and like modern

98
00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:40.011
builders,

99
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:45.011
the Romans erected wooden frames for their walls and ceilings and they poured

100
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.720
concrete into those wooden frames.

101
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:53.000
What's most important for us in the context of this lecture and in this course

102
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:53.834
in general,

103
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.320
is that the introduction of Roman concrete into Roman architecture freed the

104
00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:07.271
Roman architect from the confines of a lack of a rectilinear architecture that

105
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:13.040
they had inherited from the Greeks.
The kind of rectilinear architecture,
uh,

106
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:17.240
that made up a temple,
like the temple of poor Tunis.

107
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:20.270
This is a very momentous change,
uh,

108
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.920
and one that will have a lasting impact on the buildings of the Romans.

109
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.700
Let me try to give you a sense of what I mean by this.

110
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.760
One could argue that the greatest,

111
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:35.660
a concrete structure built by the Romans was the pantheon.

112
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:40.010
And I remind you of the Pantheon on the right,
in fact,
the Dome of the Pantheon,

113
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:43.730
which would not have been possible without concrete construction.

114
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:49.090
But it's interesting to compare the Pantheon to a,

115
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:54.680
an attempt a that a trust can architects made to create something similar.

116
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.850
Uh,
but out of stone,

117
00:07:55.851 --> 00:08:00.260
I show you on the lefthand side of the screen and the trusts can tomb that dates

118
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:03.710
to 600 BC.
Uh,
so very early in time,

119
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:07.660
600 BC and a trust skin tomb at a place called,
it's not on your monument list,

120
00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:12.590
but at a place called Quinto,
Fiorentino Q.
U.
I.
N.
T,
O,
new word,

121
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:16.730
F,
I.
O.
R.
E.
N.
T.
I,
n.
O.

122
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.070
Quinto Fiorentino in a trust can territory.
Uh,

123
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:24.100
and what the architects have done here is to try to create a round tomb.

124
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:27.620
And they've used stone as you can see,
uh,

125
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.640
and they have laid those stones if they've cut and quarried the stones as usual.

126
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:37.160
Uh,
they've tried to cut them in the shapes that they need in order to make this

127
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:41.050
work.
And they piled them one on top of the other,
uh,

128
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.720
row after row after row until they've gotten,
didn't,

129
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.650
didn't it started out okay at the bottom.

130
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:50.200
But if they get further and further onto the top and it gets rounder and
rounder,

131
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.380
uh,
and Khloe and converges at the apex,
uh,

132
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.330
they start to have trouble as you can see.
And although it's a heroic,

133
00:08:57.331 --> 00:09:01.110
a valiant attempt on their part,
it isn't terribly successful,

134
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:04.170
at least to my mind,
aesthetically.
And in fact,

135
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:05.970
they were worried about it falling down.

136
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.840
So they even had to place a stone pier here,
uh,

137
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.690
to support the Dome to make sure that it didn't,
didn't drop.

138
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:16.290
And actually that was pretty successful because here it is still today looking,

139
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.300
looking pretty good in,
in that regard.
Uh,
but with the,
with the,

140
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.163
um,

141
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.760
introduction of concrete into architecture under the Romans,

142
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.630
building a dome like the Pantheon was simplicity itself.

143
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.470
All you needed to be able to do was to build one of these wooden models,

144
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.660
a wooden structures that you then poured concrete into a and Voila,

145
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:44.460
you have the dome of the Pantheon.
So simplicity itself,
transformational,

146
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:49.350
uh,
visa vi Roman architecture.
The only problem with concrete,

147
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:53.190
and there were two problems with concrete that the architects of this period had

148
00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:57.870
to contend with.
One of them was that,
uh,
concrete,
uh,

149
00:09:57.871 --> 00:10:02.370
is,
is,
uh,
has to be protected from moisture.
That's number one.

150
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.960
And number two,
that concrete is less attractive than stone.

151
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:12.360
The Roman architects of the second and first centuries BC solve these two

152
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:14.640
problems in the same way.

153
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.020
What they decided to do was when the concrete was still wet,

154
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.500
they put,
they attached a stone to it.

155
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:27.740
This could either be large ashler block stone blocks or it could be a small

156
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:29.520
pieces of stone,

157
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:34.170
that uncertain worker opus and carried them that we talked about last time

158
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:38.660
pressed into the concrete when it was wet and when it all dried,
uh,

159
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.810
that stone both,
both made the building look more attractive,
uh,

160
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.290
and also protected,
uh,
the building from moisture.

161
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.920
We looked last time at that opus and Keratin facing,

162
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:54.360
I remind you of the temple of Vesta at Tivoli,
which you see here.

163
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:59.280
And you will recall that the temple of Vesta at Tivoli had concrete both in its

164
00:10:59.281 --> 00:11:04.281
podium for utilitarian purposes and to support the great weight of the temple.

165
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:09.630
Uh,
but also that the architects explored making the seller wall,

166
00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:12.900
the curved seller wall also out of concrete.

167
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.850
And then when that concrete was wet,

168
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.740
they put in these small cut irregularly shaped stones called uncertain worker

169
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:22.830
opus and character them,
uh,
to protect that.

170
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.640
So we saw that already in the temple of Vesta,

171
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:30.900
even though it was a traditional temple based on Greek and a trust in models.

172
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.510
And we'll see it again today in several buildings.

173
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.160
And I show you just one example,

174
00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:38.610
the last structure that we'll talk to you to talk about today.

175
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:43.910
The sanctuary of Fortuna premed Jania at Palestrina and extraordinary structure

176
00:11:44.461 --> 00:11:49.461
built on a hillside that also used a opus and care to them as the facing.

177
00:11:49.891 --> 00:11:54.891
And you can see it used here for the wall and also the coffered ceiling above.

178
00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.030
Uh,
and,
uh,
so a [inaudible] stone,
a stone facing opus,
and carried them.

179
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.710
That was particularly favored in the second centuries BC and into the first

180
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:09.120
centuries BC over time,
uh,

181
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.320
the choice of facing changed,

182
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:15.030
although Ashleigh blocks too far,
uh,

183
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.870
two for travertine and opus and character and were popular in the second and

184
00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:23.080
first centuries.
As time goes on,
things change.

185
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:27.580
We'll see under the Roman Emperor Nerva,
there was a revolution,

186
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:31.630
another kind of revolution of sorts in Roman architecture.
Uh,

187
00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:35.290
and we'll talk about the reasons for that and so on later in the semester.

188
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.850
But with that revolution came and interest in the new facing material,

189
00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:44.020
namely brick brick that was originally stuccoed over.
And in fact,

190
00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:47.710
the opus and Keratin work and the two FA stone that we've talked about already

191
00:12:47.711 --> 00:12:50.860
today tended to be stuccoed over as well.
Uh,

192
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.350
but by the second century,

193
00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:56.770
we begin to see an appreciation for brick in its own right.

194
00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:57.940
The attractiveness of,

195
00:12:57.941 --> 00:13:02.941
of brick and the Romans begin to use the exposed brick as the facing for their

196
00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:06.880
buildings.
And I show you one example.
It's a detail of a warehouse.

197
00:13:06.881 --> 00:13:11.290
In the Roman port city of Ostia that we'll look at later in the term with this

198
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:13.330
exposed brick facing very attractive,

199
00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:16.110
different colorations and so on and so forth.
Uh,

200
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.390
but adjust just to alert you to the fact that again,

201
00:13:19.391 --> 00:13:23.470
the kind of facing that we're talking about today will not be the only facing

202
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.750
that is used by the Romans.
Over time.

203
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:31.360
I want to show you today a series of these concrete constructions,

204
00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:36.110
concrete experiments we might call them that begin to,
uh,
turn off,

205
00:13:36.111 --> 00:13:37.720
not only in Rome itself,

206
00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:41.770
but also in some of the cities close to Rome that we saw.

207
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.800
Rome began to colonize a in the republic and into the age of Augustus cities

208
00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:52.840
that either are the same or very close to the ones that we looked at last time.

209
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.520
And I'll show you a map momentarily.

210
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.490
I just want to begin with one in Rome itself.

211
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.020
This is the so called porticas Amelia in Rome.

212
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.570
The port at this Amelia was aware house,

213
00:14:04.571 --> 00:14:08.560
a very large warehouse on the banks of the Tiber river.

214
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:13.630
Uh,
the porticas Amelia,
um,
was,
uh,

215
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.620
built as you can see from the dates on your monument list,
very early on,

216
00:14:17.621 --> 00:14:22.621
one 93 BC and then restored in 174 BC.

217
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.940
Only a small fragment of the porticas Amelia survives today.

218
00:14:27.941 --> 00:14:29.860
But we have a lot of evidence,

219
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:33.750
a lot of clues that we can piece together through detect,

220
00:14:33.751 --> 00:14:37.600
do through scholarly detective work,
uh,
to determine,
uh,

221
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.820
what this building looked like in antiquity.

222
00:14:39.821 --> 00:14:43.810
And we can get a quite accurate sense.
We have,
for example,

223
00:14:43.811 --> 00:14:48.811
the words of the Great Roman historian Livie Livie who was writing in the age of

224
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:54.290
Augustus.
He tells,
uh,
that,
um,
the,
uh,

225
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.030
porticas Emilia,
he describes it,

226
00:14:56.031 --> 00:15:00.680
he mentioned support because Amelia and he tells us it was located on the east

227
00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:03.500
bank of the Tiber River.
Uh,

228
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:08.220
and that it was a south southwest west of one of Rome,

229
00:15:08.221 --> 00:15:11.900
seven hills,
the Aventine Hill,
south west of the Aventine Hill,

230
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.500
which is enormously helpful because it gives archeologists and so on,

231
00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:20.270
a clue as to where they might look for remains of this particular structure.

232
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:21.560
So we have that.

233
00:15:21.561 --> 00:15:25.730
We also have a fragment of the building we believe,

234
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:29.540
because it's located just in the right place.
And I show it to you here,

235
00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:33.980
it's not much.
It's a piece to essentially a hunk of concrete,
uh,

236
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.280
that includes a,
an arched doorway in some arched windows,

237
00:15:37.281 --> 00:15:41.180
but it's very important in terms of allowing us to reconstruct what the

238
00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:45.290
structure looked like in antiquity.
Uh,
but most significant of all,

239
00:15:45.291 --> 00:15:50.120
we have a fragment from what is known as the marble map of Rome.

240
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.420
The marble map of Rome called the Forma Orbis.

241
00:15:53.421 --> 00:15:55.550
And I put that word on the monument list,

242
00:15:55.551 --> 00:15:58.640
that title on the Monument List for you.
The form of Orbis.

243
00:15:58.641 --> 00:16:03.641
The form Orbitz was a great marble map that was made of Rome in the early third

244
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:04.881
century.

245
00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:09.620
Aidy under the emperor worship of Septimius severity and put up on a wall

246
00:16:09.621 --> 00:16:13.040
enrollment.
We'll talk about its location later on in the semester,

247
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:18.320
but it purported to represent all the buildings that were standing in Rome in

248
00:16:18.321 --> 00:16:22.850
the early third century,
obese in the early,
in the early third century.

249
00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:27.260
Aidy uh,
it is fragmentary today,
but there are a fair number of fragments.

250
00:16:27.261 --> 00:16:31.600
And fortunately a couple of those fragments are several of those fragments,
uh,

251
00:16:31.601 --> 00:16:35.290
are fragments that represent the porticas Amelia.
Uh,

252
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.390
so we can tell from that,
from that,
from Libby's description,

253
00:16:38.391 --> 00:16:40.700
from this a fragmentary remain,

254
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:44.750
we can piece together what it looked like and you can see it who are a very,

255
00:16:44.751 --> 00:16:46.790
very long rectangular,

256
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.930
a structure that went all along the bank of the river storage.

257
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.750
You need a lot of storage.
Your of your,
you know,
from the,

258
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.830
especially with the con,
as the Romans began to conquer the world,

259
00:16:57.831 --> 00:17:01.550
they were trading more extensively with other parts of the world and

260
00:17:01.551 --> 00:17:03.740
consequently they needed,
um,

261
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:08.630
they needed places along the Tiber river to store the goods that we're both

262
00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:12.880
going out and coming in.
So they build this gigantic warehouse,
uh,

263
00:17:12.881 --> 00:17:14.750
along the banks of the Tiber.

264
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:20.050
Now there's a fair amount of disagreement about some of the smaller details of,

265
00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:24.170
uh,
this,
uh,
warehouse and what it looked like in antiquity.

266
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.250
So we have to do the best that we can to bring that evidence together to

267
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.160
determine what it looked like.
But as I said,

268
00:17:31.161 --> 00:17:33.730
in some details you'll see there's variations.

269
00:17:33.731 --> 00:17:37.940
So several of the things I'm going to show you very slightly,
uh,

270
00:17:37.941 --> 00:17:41.390
but the only one that you'll be ultimately responsible for is the one that's on

271
00:17:41.391 --> 00:17:45.350
your monument lists.
But I just want you to be aware of the fact that,
uh,

272
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.550
that there are different,

273
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.920
that there are different interpretations of exactly what it looked like.
A,

274
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:53.700
what what we are sure of and what's most important for us today is that it was

275
00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:57.930
made of concrete and that it had barrel vaults.
What was a barrel vault?

276
00:17:57.931 --> 00:18:02.020
A barrel vault was a,
uh,
a Balt,
uh,

277
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.700
that was getting made out of concrete,
placed on a wall,

278
00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:10.830
and then had the bolt was shaped like the side of a barrel,
as you can see here,

279
00:18:10.831 --> 00:18:12.870
which is why it's called a barrel vault shape,

280
00:18:12.871 --> 00:18:17.220
like the side of the barrel resting on walls down below.
A fairly simple shape,

281
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:17.761
uh,

282
00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:21.090
that could not have been made or would be very difficult to make out of stone,

283
00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.260
uh,
but was easily able to be made out of concrete.

284
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.330
And we see a series of those barrel vaults placed one next to another,

285
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.040
uh,
for the warehouse for the Portico as Emilia in Rome.
It was placed.

286
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:36.890
And actually I,
I neglected to mention live.

287
00:18:36.891 --> 00:18:40.890
He also tells us that the Dickus Emilia had four tiers.

288
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.190
It was tiered in four levels.
Uh,

289
00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:48.220
and we see those four tiers here rising up ever so slightly along the slope of

290
00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.630
the Tiber River.

291
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.470
This is a cross section of what the,
uh,

292
00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:59.190
inside of the Basilica Melian might have looked like.

293
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.770
You see those great barrel vaults here.

294
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.630
You see that the architect has been adventurous in the sense that he has not

295
00:19:06.631 --> 00:19:11.250
placed the barrel vaults on solid wall as we saw on that diagram,

296
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:13.440
but has open those walls up,

297
00:19:13.441 --> 00:19:18.441
created peers and arches above those peers to create these arcades,

298
00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.630
uh,
which is quite ingenious,
uh,
and,

299
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:26.690
and very smart because what it does is enable there to be both axial movement

300
00:19:27.661 --> 00:19:30.000
through the building,
but also lateral movement.

301
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.650
You can walk not all only along each barrel vault,
uh,

302
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.290
but you can walk in between the peers,
which is,
as I said,

303
00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:41.100
creates a much more open,
a sense of much more openness,
uh,

304
00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.980
and and lateral as well as axial movement.

305
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.290
The other thing that you see here is our,

306
00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:50.220
the back walls where we can see just what we saw in that fragment of the

307
00:19:50.221 --> 00:19:50.940
building,

308
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.940
the arched doorways as well as the arched windows in the back walls,

309
00:19:57.151 --> 00:19:59.610
which of course allow light into the structure.

310
00:19:59.611 --> 00:20:03.090
Lots of activity needed to happen here as things were moved in and out,

311
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:07.560
and those who worked here needed to be able to see everything that they were

312
00:20:07.561 --> 00:20:12.180
doing.
The the view that you have on your monument list is this one.

313
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:17.220
It's a restored a view of what the porticas Emilia might've looked like in

314
00:20:17.221 --> 00:20:19.410
antiquity and it's very helpful.

315
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:24.410
It's a cutaway view which gives you most of the major features all in one place.

316
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.580
You can see that it is indeed tier.

317
00:20:26.581 --> 00:20:30.870
There are four tiers for this structure that they move up slightly as they move

318
00:20:30.871 --> 00:20:34.230
up the slope of the hill.
You can see the use of the barrel vaults,

319
00:20:34.231 --> 00:20:36.090
you can see the piers down below.

320
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.810
You can see the flat roof that these seem to have,

321
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.200
but as they rose up slightly along the slope of the hill,

322
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.030
you can see that the um,

323
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:50.300
that the designer has this small curved slit windows on each tier to allow,

324
00:20:51.971 --> 00:20:54.640
again,
additional light into the structure.

325
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:59.760
And you can also see from this diagram that it was made of concrete and faced

326
00:21:00.161 --> 00:21:02.860
with opus and care to them work these small,

327
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.180
a small irregular stones that we saw in the temple of Vesta,

328
00:21:07.181 --> 00:21:11.470
also used as the facing material here.
Here's one more,

329
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:16.000
a restored view,
which shows you roughly the same.
The four tiers,

330
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.420
the barrel vaults,
the windows on the various tiers.

331
00:21:19.421 --> 00:21:24.250
And then most importantly these,
um,
these doorways and windows in the back,

332
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:24.940
uh,

333
00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:29.940
as well as the general space that was available inside this extraordinary

334
00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.550
building.
I mentioned that while we'll look at a couple of buildings,

335
00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:37.780
several buildings in Rome,

336
00:21:37.781 --> 00:21:42.781
I also want to go out to some of the colonies that were founded by the Romans in

337
00:21:42.941 --> 00:21:46.870
the vicinity of Rome in the second and first centuries BC.

338
00:21:46.871 --> 00:21:50.890
And where they began to build.
As we saw when they began to plan towns,

339
00:21:50.891 --> 00:21:53.020
they began to put walls around those towns.

340
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:58.200
They began to put temples in those towns and they also began to put other

341
00:21:58.781 --> 00:22:03.430
structures including warehouses and sanctuaries and the like,

342
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:07.560
the ones that we're going to look at today,
here again,
Rome is at the star.
Uh,

343
00:22:07.561 --> 00:22:11.000
and we're going to look at buildings in terror,

344
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:16.080
Cina over here in Tivoli and also in Palestrina.

345
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:20.530
And you can see the proximity of those to others we talked about last time nor

346
00:22:20.531 --> 00:22:24.790
ba and Khoza.
And if a Larry Novi and so on and so forth,

347
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:25.990
it's not surprising.

348
00:22:25.991 --> 00:22:30.010
Again to see the Romans turning to their environments as they make these

349
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:35.040
earliest towns and as they start to fill these towns to make them into the kind

350
00:22:35.321 --> 00:22:40.060
of mini Rome's,
uh,
that they,
uh,
that they so desired.
So I'm going to,

351
00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:44.360
we're going to look at a series of these,
have different dates,
uh,
and of,
um,

352
00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.280
considerable interest in terms of what they Harold for.
Uh,

353
00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.410
the future of Roman architecture.

354
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.800
The first that we're going to look at is a market hall,

355
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.580
a market hall at a place called Ferintino.
Uh,

356
00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.410
Ferintino and it dates to,

357
00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:02.050
I may have neglected dimension to show you very [inaudible] on that map,

358
00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:06.910
but it's in with all the others there.
Verun TNO around 100 BC.

359
00:23:06.911 --> 00:23:08.650
It dates to,
uh,

360
00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:12.940
and you can see that it's essentially one giant barrel vault,

361
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.830
one giant barrel vault,
which was used as the market hall.
Uh,
the,
uh,

362
00:23:17.831 --> 00:23:20.420
you can see also that that giant barrel ball,

363
00:23:20.421 --> 00:23:23.650
which is made of concrete has opening off it on,

364
00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:28.680
on the sides a series of arched areas with also barrel vaulted on the inside.

365
00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:35.260
These were used as the market stalls inside this market place.

366
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.440
You can also see,
I believe very well,
uh,

367
00:23:38.441 --> 00:23:43.220
that the facing that is used for this concrete is opus and care to him,

368
00:23:43.221 --> 00:23:45.710
work for the walls and for the vaults.

369
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.720
And then what they've done to emphasize the location and the shape of the

370
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:51.291
arches.

371
00:23:51.291 --> 00:23:56.291
They have used stone around those also to give further solidity to this part of

372
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:01.800
the building.
Uh,
they have,
uh,
used stone.
Uh,

373
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.650
and you can see it's a combination of,
uh,

374
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.430
nicely cut ashler blocks down here,

375
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:12.080
but also if the booze Joar blocks that we've saw in the flairy Novi Gate used

376
00:24:12.081 --> 00:24:16.970
over the arches.
So this combination of both stone,
uh,
and,
uh,

377
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:19.130
of,
of,
of uh,

378
00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:23.470
Opas quadratus stone and also of opus and care to him,
uh,

379
00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.680
used as the facing for this particular structure.

380
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:32.910
Uh,
what's significant about this building is that it looks forward,
uh,

381
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:37.760
to things that we're going to see later on develop in Roman architecture.

382
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.750
Primarily.

383
00:24:38.751 --> 00:24:43.751
I showed you in the introductory lecture a glimpse of the markets of Trajan in

384
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:48.470
Rome.
And I remind you here of the Great Market Hall of the markets of Trajan,

385
00:24:48.471 --> 00:24:53.120
which is even more sophisticated in its use of concrete because it has rib bolts

386
00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:53.960
as you can see.

387
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.920
But this experimentation that we're going to see in the early second century,

388
00:24:57.921 --> 00:25:02.921
a d in Rome would not have been possible without the experimentation and

389
00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:08.090
concrete that took place,
uh,
in this very early stage in the second century.

390
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.840
And in the first centuries BC even more,

391
00:25:11.841 --> 00:25:16.210
much more interesting in fact is the building that I'd like to turn to.
Uh,

392
00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.173
now,

393
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.360
and this is the so called sanctuary of Jupiter anx or at Terror Cina.

394
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:27.380
It dates we believe to 100 to 70 BC.

395
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:32.030
And it is like so many Roman building spectacularly cited.

396
00:25:32.031 --> 00:25:34.100
I had mentioned this on several occasions.

397
00:25:34.101 --> 00:25:37.340
We looked at the medieval Hilltown of Corey,
for example,

398
00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.000
where the temple of Hercules was located.
At the very apex of the hill.

399
00:25:41.001 --> 00:25:46.001
The Romans had an incredible knack for choosing a extraordinary locations on

400
00:25:46.491 --> 00:25:50.480
which to cite their buildings,
locations that made those buildings,

401
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.360
that they accentuated those buildings from a distance,
uh,

402
00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:58.420
but also gave those who went to the building's amazing views out from those

403
00:25:58.731 --> 00:26:01.310
buildings.
This is one of those examples,

404
00:26:01.311 --> 00:26:04.820
the sanctuary of Jupiter anchor at Tara Cina.

405
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.240
The best view of this sanctuary is from the sea.

406
00:26:08.241 --> 00:26:12.440
If you happen to be fortunate enough to be floating on a boat somewhere near

407
00:26:12.441 --> 00:26:14.980
terror Cheena and it's a beautiful place to float,
uh,

408
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.090
you will see from a distance,
uh,

409
00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:22.150
the great podium of the sanctuary of Jupiter answer,

410
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:26.300
but you can also see it from the town,
which is where we're situated here.

411
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.190
We're standing in the town,
couple of decent pizzerias,
uh,

412
00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:34.070
right in front of us and we're looking up at the hill on which the sanctuary

413
00:26:34.071 --> 00:26:36.590
finds itself.
Now as you look up to that hill,

414
00:26:36.591 --> 00:26:39.710
all you can actually see is all that's actually up there now,

415
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:44.490
which is the podium of the sanctuary.
The temple is no longer there,

416
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.470
although there's some evidence up there,

417
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:51.780
some remains that give us a decent sense of what that temple looked like in

418
00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:52.614
antiquity,

419
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:57.710
but the podium is extremely well preserved and you see it again magnificently

420
00:26:57.871 --> 00:27:02.330
sited at the top of that hill.
This is a,
uh,

421
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.210
restored view of what the podium would have looked like and you see what we know

422
00:27:07.211 --> 00:27:10.560
with the podium,
what the podium does look like as we see it here.

423
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:15.920
And as it would have supported the temple on top a and also a back,

424
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:21.180
a columnar element over here that was roofed.
As you can see,

425
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:25.200
uh,
if we look at this plan and this restored view,
excuse me,

426
00:27:25.201 --> 00:27:27.450
we see several things that are worth noting.

427
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:32.220
One that the temple itself is very much a traditional,
uh,

428
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:37.230
building and one that is very much in the tradition indeed of the buildings of

429
00:27:37.231 --> 00:27:41.970
the temples that we've already discussed.
This combination of,
of,
of a trust skin,

430
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.650
uh,
plan and of Greek elevation that we saw in so many of these.
Uh,

431
00:27:46.651 --> 00:27:48.840
you can see,
for example,
they,
and again,

432
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:52.020
there's enough evidence for us to be pretty sure that this is what it looked

433
00:27:52.021 --> 00:27:56.400
like.
Hi podium,
single staircase,
emphasis on the facade,

434
00:27:56.401 --> 00:27:59.700
the porch freestanding columns in that porch.
Uh,

435
00:27:59.701 --> 00:28:03.420
but columns that seem to have encircled the monument.
Uh,

436
00:28:03.421 --> 00:28:08.040
so this combination of a and stone construction,
we think,
uh,

437
00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:13.041
so a combination once again of a trust can and Greek elements for the temple.

438
00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.280
You'll probably notice that the temple is slightly skewed.

439
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:21.420
The angle of the temple is skewed.
It's not straight on with the podium,

440
00:28:21.421 --> 00:28:23.950
which is very unusual for the Romans.
Will,

441
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:28.320
we'll see that the Romans were very interested in everything being exactly as it

442
00:28:28.321 --> 00:28:32.280
should be.
Axial symmetrical,
both sides matching.

443
00:28:32.281 --> 00:28:36.360
It's very unusual for them to skew something like this.
Why did they do it?

444
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.230
It probably has something to do either with something that was already on the

445
00:28:40.231 --> 00:28:41.910
site,
uh,
some,

446
00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:46.350
some other building that forced them to do this or having something to do with

447
00:28:46.351 --> 00:28:50.220
the particular God who was honored here on the location.
You know,

448
00:28:50.221 --> 00:28:53.950
the way they wanted that to be in relationship to,
uh,

449
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:58.170
various elements of the rights or a East,
west or you know,
whatever.

450
00:28:58.171 --> 00:29:03.171
And it was that there was something that caused them to put this in the position

451
00:29:03.421 --> 00:29:05.970
that they did.
And you can also see that it isn't,

452
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:10.020
it has this back colonnade behind it covered colonnade behind it,

453
00:29:10.021 --> 00:29:14.790
but it isn't attached to it in any way,
which is also unusual as we'll see.

454
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:15.240
Uh,

455
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:19.950
the podium you see down here made up of a series of arcades and you can see once

456
00:29:19.951 --> 00:29:24.951
again both axial and lateral access because just as in the poor dick is Amelia,

457
00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:30.831
they have created a smaller arcades in the side peers to allow this kind of

458
00:29:32.701 --> 00:29:37.530
axiology in the structure or movement through the structure in more than one
way.

459
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:43.250
The podium is extremely well preserved as you can see and extremely impressive.

460
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.850
It's an extraordinary place to go.
It's a lot of fun to go there to see this.

461
00:29:48.851 --> 00:29:50.860
It's off the beaten track to a certain extent,

462
00:29:50.861 --> 00:29:54.670
but it is on the road between a Roman Naples.
So that one,

463
00:29:54.671 --> 00:29:57.160
if one is going from Rome down to palm pay,
uh,
you know,

464
00:29:57.161 --> 00:29:59.980
this is the sort of thing one can stop and take a look at.

465
00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.350
And there's some other interesting things along the way as well.

466
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.580
We see here the great podium as it looks today.
It's made out of concrete.

467
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:08.680
You can see both the uh,

468
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:13.190
the large arcades and then these lateral ones that I mentioned before,
uh,

469
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:17.520
in the,
uh,
interior face of the peers.
Uh,

470
00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:22.560
you can also see that they have used opus and carrot him facing here.

471
00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:23.171
Uh,

472
00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:28.171
these irregular stones all bunched together to create an attractive appearance.

473
00:30:28.271 --> 00:30:30.460
Although this was probably stuck out in antiquity.

474
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:35.760
And then they have used a stone blocks to emphasize the juncture of each of

475
00:30:36.521 --> 00:30:37.354
these walls,

476
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:41.740
but also to help give the building a increased stability.

477
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.890
So this combination of stone,
well it's all stone,

478
00:30:44.891 --> 00:30:48.910
but this combination of blocks of stone and a smaller opus and carrot them

479
00:30:48.911 --> 00:30:53.710
stones for the facing of the podium.
And here's a wonderful view,
I think,

480
00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.630
uh,
that shows you a,

481
00:30:55.631 --> 00:31:00.631
a panorama through a number of these lateral arches and gives you some sense of

482
00:31:01.091 --> 00:31:06.091
how carefully orchestrated this was by the architect who is responsible for

483
00:31:06.191 --> 00:31:08.890
this.
It's never too early for me to emphasize it.

484
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:13.891
The Romans were very concerned with creating vistas and panoramas from one part

485
00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:18.640
of a building to another from one part of a complex to another.
And they never,

486
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.430
they never lost an opportunity to do that.
Uh,

487
00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:26.560
so that as you stand and look through a series of these lateral arches,

488
00:31:26.561 --> 00:31:30.580
you can see how carefully arrange that was to pay attention,

489
00:31:30.581 --> 00:31:34.660
not only to the way in which the arches,
um,

490
00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.130
yeah,
you can see them in a series a,
as you can see here,

491
00:31:39.131 --> 00:31:43.360
looking almost as if they're diminishing in size,
although they aren't really,
uh,

492
00:31:43.361 --> 00:31:48.280
but also this idea of creating exciting visual experiences as you walk through

493
00:31:48.281 --> 00:31:53.050
something,
not just to walk through it,
but to see something,
uh,
that really,
uh,

494
00:31:53.051 --> 00:31:55.570
amazing as you.
And that fascinates you and that,

495
00:31:55.571 --> 00:31:58.220
that creation of Vista and Panorama,
uh,

496
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.510
both panorama out onto the countryside from the hilltop,

497
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.920
but also a panorama or vista through a building is something quintessentially

498
00:32:05.921 --> 00:32:06.340
Roman.

499
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:10.930
And we'll see it turning up again and again and again in as an as a major

500
00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:14.180
objective of Roman architecture.
Uh,

501
00:32:14.181 --> 00:32:17.800
a view once again of the restored view of the sanctuary.

502
00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.250
The sanctuary had below it,
uh,

503
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.180
a underground passageway called a crypto porticos.

504
00:32:25.181 --> 00:32:27.280
And I put that word on the monument list for you,

505
00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:32.620
a Crypto porticas that was used essentially for storage for storage purposes,

506
00:32:32.621 --> 00:32:37.450
for,
uh,
this sanctuary.
And believe it or not,
we actually have the crip deport.

507
00:32:37.451 --> 00:32:39.950
It goes still preserved and we can look at it.

508
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:41.870
And it's interesting because here too,

509
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:45.350
we see the architect's using concrete construction,

510
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.260
creating a barrel vaulted Carter,
uh,

511
00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:51.110
in this case with windows on the end.

512
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.710
And then a few doorways and some slip windows.
All of them arched,

513
00:32:54.711 --> 00:32:59.180
as you can see here,
to allow light into the structure.
It was used,
as I said,

514
00:32:59.181 --> 00:33:03.280
for storage purposes,
a storage having to do with the cult.
Uh,

515
00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:06.020
and so on and so forth.
It's very important.

516
00:33:06.021 --> 00:33:09.410
We're going to look at a couple of other sanctuaries as well to keep in mind

517
00:33:09.411 --> 00:33:11.210
that these sanctuaries,
uh,

518
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.660
meant there were different than an individual temple in a,
in a forum,

519
00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:18.640
inside an urban complex.
They were meant to draw pilgrims from,
uh,

520
00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.240
from far and wide,

521
00:33:20.241 --> 00:33:24.140
which is one of the reasons that they were placed in such prominent positions on

522
00:33:24.141 --> 00:33:27.190
tops of mountains that you wouldn't,
has it,
you know,
if you were dry,

523
00:33:27.191 --> 00:33:31.870
even driving by if you were going by in your cart or whatever,
uh,
and,

524
00:33:31.871 --> 00:33:35.780
and saw this from a distance or coming by sea in a boat,
uh,

525
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:37.760
seeing it from a distance you would be drawn,

526
00:33:37.761 --> 00:33:40.730
it would be like a mecca that you would be drawn to a,

527
00:33:40.731 --> 00:33:45.410
so these sanctuaries where meant to attract large numbers of people to them.

528
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:49.940
So they needed to provide not just the temple itself,
but other things.

529
00:33:49.941 --> 00:33:53.630
And they often,
they were like malls.
They often included shopping areas,

530
00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:55.610
souvenir shops,
a shop,

531
00:33:55.670 --> 00:34:00.580
shopping in stores for a local specialties and that kind of thing.
Uh,

532
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:04.040
in order to encourage people to visit.

533
00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:11.160
I'd like to turn to another also very interesting sanctuary that was put up,

534
00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:16.610
uh,
at around this time.
This is the sanctuary of Hercules at Tivoli.

535
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:18.950
Uh,
and it was erected,

536
00:34:18.951 --> 00:34:23.951
we believe sometime between 75 and 50 BC in Tivoli.

537
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.080
It is an incredible place.

538
00:34:27.081 --> 00:34:30.800
It is not so different from the sanctuary of Jupiter ANC,

539
00:34:30.801 --> 00:34:35.360
sir and its general intentions.
His whole idea of creating this,
uh,

540
00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:40.390
this Mecca for a religious activity and also just a place that people would

541
00:34:40.911 --> 00:34:44.850
enjoy coming to and gathering together.
And uh,
you know,

542
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.360
in for social interaction,
uh,

543
00:34:47.361 --> 00:34:51.350
we see a restored view of what it looked like in antiquity.

544
00:34:51.351 --> 00:34:55.940
It is similar to and different from uh,
the Jupiter Anc sir sanctuary,

545
00:34:55.941 --> 00:35:00.170
just like the Jupiter angular sanctuary.
It rests on a very tall,

546
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.890
on a tall and large podium.
As you can see,

547
00:35:03.891 --> 00:35:08.690
the temple doesn't stand in isolation,
but it's raised up on this large podium.

548
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.110
Uh,
you can see that it has a temple in the center.

549
00:35:12.111 --> 00:35:17.111
This one completely pushed up against the back wall and completely straight.

550
00:35:17.931 --> 00:35:22.931
So axial and created acts in axial relationship to the podium.

551
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:29.930
The temple we believe was also one of these traditional types of temples with

552
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:34.820
the tall podium with the staircase on one side with columns going around at

553
00:35:34.821 --> 00:35:39.570
least three sides.
The porch freestanding columns in that porch raised up on,

554
00:35:39.571 --> 00:35:43.950
it's all on its own podium and then the larger podium down below.

555
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:48.310
The,
one of the features that we see here that we did not see in the Jupiter Anc,

556
00:35:48.311 --> 00:35:53.311
Sir Sanctuary is the use of the circular staircase here,

557
00:35:54.301 --> 00:35:56.670
which adds drama to the design.

558
00:35:56.671 --> 00:36:01.320
It's also on axis with the staircase of the temple itself,

559
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:05.970
but it also serves as a kind of,
it's shaped like a theater,
a theater,

560
00:36:05.971 --> 00:36:10.500
a Cabi,
and we call it a copy of the seating ca VA.
The caveat of a theater,

561
00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:13.050
it's shaped just like that.
As you can see here,

562
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.970
and we believe it's purpose was not so much as a monumental entrance way or

563
00:36:17.971 --> 00:36:21.180
monumental staircase,
although it served that purpose to a certain extent,

564
00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:26.130
but also as a place where people could gather and could sit and probably watch

565
00:36:26.131 --> 00:36:26.940
performances.

566
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:31.620
Religious performance is perhaps or perhaps other kinds of performances in front

567
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.610
of this,
uh,

568
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:38.780
in front of the temple of Hercules and there may have been some kind of a stage

569
00:36:38.851 --> 00:36:40.260
building.
There was a wall here,

570
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.850
so there may have been also some kind of stage building in front of that,

571
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.340
a semicircular seated area.

572
00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:53.700
This is a nother,
this is another restored view showing you the same.

573
00:36:53.701 --> 00:36:57.670
You can perhaps see that theatrical area better here,
again,

574
00:36:57.671 --> 00:37:01.020
serving as a dramatic staircase but at the same time as a place where

575
00:37:01.021 --> 00:37:05.130
performances could take place,
uh,
at this,
um,

576
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.300
at this structure.

577
00:37:06.301 --> 00:37:09.600
But all the other features are a parent and I want you to pay a special

578
00:37:09.601 --> 00:37:10.081
attention,

579
00:37:10.081 --> 00:37:14.790
special attention to the fact that we have the temple pushed up against the back

580
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:16.890
wall,
not one of the short back walls,

581
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:21.210
but while none of them are short here but against a long back wall as you can

582
00:37:21.211 --> 00:37:24.840
see,
but pushed up against it,
dominating the space in front of it.

583
00:37:24.841 --> 00:37:29.720
We're going to see when we turned upon pay on Thursday that this same idea of

584
00:37:29.721 --> 00:37:34.650
pushing a temple against the back wall is characteristic of forum.
The design,

585
00:37:34.651 --> 00:37:37.860
the design of meeting and marketplaces as it is,
uh,

586
00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.110
for sanctuary design.

587
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:47.400
The sanctuary of Hercules at Tivoli,
uh,
has,

588
00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:51.120
um,
has,
is,
is,
is preserved in part.

589
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:55.440
And I can show you one very interesting detail which is what you see now on the

590
00:37:55.441 --> 00:38:00.270
screen.
We are looking at part at,
at uh,
we may have been,

591
00:38:00.271 --> 00:38:05.070
let me go back for a second.
Just to
point this out.

592
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.670
If you look at the back,
if you look at along the sides and the back,

593
00:38:08.671 --> 00:38:12.840
you will see that there are columns above and then columns with art.

594
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.780
With arcades,
arcades and columns in the first story,

595
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:19.050
and then columns on their own in the upper story.

596
00:38:19.051 --> 00:38:24.051
So what I'm going to show you now is a section of the lower story of the

597
00:38:24.451 --> 00:38:26.580
sanctuary of Hercules at Tivoli.

598
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:32.060
And we can see that what we have here is it very important combination and it's

599
00:38:32.191 --> 00:38:37.191
the first time we've seen this today of arches with columns intersperse columns

600
00:38:37.271 --> 00:38:41.660
placed,
engaged or attached into the wall in between,
uh,

601
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:46.930
these arcades,
as you can see here,
uh,
the construction is concrete.

602
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:51.580
The facing is a combination of stone.
Look at the blocks,

603
00:38:51.581 --> 00:38:55.330
the Ashler blocks and the booze wars above the arches,
uh,

604
00:38:55.390 --> 00:39:00.010
and opus and character work,
uh,
for the walls as you can see here.

605
00:39:00.011 --> 00:39:04.360
But this scheme of columns in between arcades extremely important.
This is,

606
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.370
this is,
uh,
this is,
uh,

607
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:11.020
this is setting in place the kind of scheme that we're going to see use for

608
00:39:11.021 --> 00:39:14.440
buildings like the Colosseum in Rome.
So extremely important.

609
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.590
There's one detail here,
this one detail about the columns though.

610
00:39:17.591 --> 00:39:21.340
I wonder if anyone notices that make them different than any other columns that

611
00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:24.640
we've seen thus far this term.
Does anyone see what that is?

612
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.983
<v 1>Okay.</v>

613
00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.540
<v 0>They definitely don't.
Yes.
Good point.
I that wasn't the one I had in mind,</v>

614
00:39:33.541 --> 00:39:35.490
but you're absolutely right.
And it leads to a very,

615
00:39:35.491 --> 00:39:38.190
into another point I'm going to make in the not too distant future.

616
00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.650
They don't support anything.
They are used here.

617
00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:44.670
The building is supported by the concrete construction.
Uh,

618
00:39:44.671 --> 00:39:47.820
the columns don't have any support role whatsoever.
They're,

619
00:39:47.821 --> 00:39:51.330
they're entirely for decorative purposes.
So excellent point.

620
00:39:51.331 --> 00:39:54.240
And it's still one more.
Look at the facing of the column.

621
00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:57.030
What does that tell you?
What is it?
What kind of facing

622
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:02.650
opus and care to them opus and care to them,
which means what?

623
00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:09.120
The columns are made of.
Concrete.
Two columns are not made out of stone,

624
00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.430
but the columns in this instance,
it's unusual,

625
00:40:11.431 --> 00:40:16.140
but the columns in this instance made out of concrete and also faced with opus

626
00:40:16.141 --> 00:40:20.190
and Keratin work.
Uh,
a view,
again of the complex,

627
00:40:20.191 --> 00:40:23.820
just to make the point that as at the sanctuary of Jupiter,

628
00:40:23.821 --> 00:40:28.620
anx banks are at Terra Cina.
There is an underground passageway,
a crip deport,

629
00:40:28.621 --> 00:40:31.650
it goes,
uh,
but in this case,
and you can see it's on the left,

630
00:40:31.651 --> 00:40:35.880
underneath the left side of the sanctuary.
But in this instance,

631
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:39.600
in this instance,
interestingly enough,
this isn't just a storage area,

632
00:40:39.601 --> 00:40:40.890
it's actually a street.

633
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:45.600
The ancient name for a Tivoli was teaboard Tib you are,

634
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:49.800
there was a street called the via t Bertina that made its way from Rome to

635
00:40:49.801 --> 00:40:52.200
Tivoli.
Uh,
and uh,
this,

636
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:56.700
this underground passageway was actually the street the street ran underneath

637
00:40:56.701 --> 00:40:58.080
the sanctuary.
Uh,

638
00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:01.620
that street or that part of the street that ran under the sanctuary can still be

639
00:41:01.621 --> 00:41:05.930
seen today.
Uh,
and you can see,
uh,
it looks almost like,
you know,

640
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:10.510
an underground subway or something like that.
You can see barrel vaulted area,
uh,

641
00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:14.310
with a series of niches over here probably for shops.

642
00:41:14.311 --> 00:41:18.450
So that along the way you could stop and shop at the,
uh,

643
00:41:18.451 --> 00:41:20.490
at beneath the sanctuary.
So,

644
00:41:20.491 --> 00:41:25.491
and a street in this case that is part of the via t Bertina leading from Rome to

645
00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.133
a Tivoli.

646
00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:33.060
I'd like to turn now to a couple of buildings in Rome,

647
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.370
back to Rome.
Uh,
to look at first,
uh,

648
00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:42.320
a building called the Tabula Laurium that dates to around 78 BC.

649
00:41:42.321 --> 00:41:45.770
That was a very important building in Rome because it was used to house the

650
00:41:45.771 --> 00:41:50.750
state archives at that particular juncture.
It was put up by a man.

651
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:54.620
We a know who put it up.
A man by the name of Quintess [inaudible] could tell us,

652
00:41:54.621 --> 00:41:57.810
and I put his name on the monument list for you.
Uh,

653
00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:02.950
and it was located on the north side of the forum of the Roman Forum and the

654
00:42:04.911 --> 00:42:08.930
south slope of the capital line hail.
And here I show you one of these excellent,

655
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.110
uh,
Google Earth flyover views of,
uh,

656
00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:15.070
this part of ancient Rome or what ancient,
what,

657
00:42:15.071 --> 00:42:17.720
what this part of ancient Rome looks like today.

658
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.540
And we see the landmarks that we've already pointed out,

659
00:42:20.541 --> 00:42:25.250
the call theme at the very top,
the Roman forum lying in front of the coliseum.

660
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.570
Mussolini's via day Fori Imperioli the imperial for over here,

661
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:33.950
the Palatine hill up here,
the circus maximus here,

662
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:39.020
the wedding cake,
so called a Victor Emmanuel,
the modern building,

663
00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:42.800
19th century building over here.
And then the,
um,

664
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:48.230
the capitalized hill redesigned by Michelangelo with the Oval Piatsa.

665
00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.680
The top,
you Laurium is located right here.

666
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:56.300
It is again facing the forum or the Roman Forum.

667
00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:01.530
Uh,
but it is the back wall of one of Michelangelo's,
uh,

668
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:05.270
palaces,
the so called senatorial palace designed by Michelangelo.

669
00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:09.080
What Michelangelo did is what was done so often by later architects.

670
00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:13.360
It didn't tear down the earlier Roman Tabi Larian,

671
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:18.370
but incorporated it's wall as the back wall of his senatorial palace.

672
00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:21.890
Uh,
and that's exactly what it remains today.

673
00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:27.860
Here we see a view of the Tabula and we're standing on the forum side looking at

674
00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:31.520
the what remains of the Tabi Laurium.
Uh,

675
00:43:31.521 --> 00:43:35.630
and we can see some of the features that we've already been discussing today.

676
00:43:35.631 --> 00:43:38.600
First of all,
let me point out that it is made out of concrete,

677
00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:42.680
is made out of concrete building is concrete,
but here in Rome,
uh,

678
00:43:42.681 --> 00:43:47.360
they decided not to use opus and carried him work was not a the rage in Rome.

679
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:52.630
Instead they were much more interested in cut stone cuts stone and you can see

680
00:43:53.001 --> 00:43:57.050
that they have used a cut stone in this structure.

681
00:43:57.051 --> 00:43:59.590
Cut Tufa stone I think you can recognize this,

682
00:43:59.591 --> 00:44:04.190
don't as to for remember to a is indigenous to the city of Rome.

683
00:44:04.191 --> 00:44:09.170
Rome has a lot of fairly decent Tufa.
They've used to fa here.
Uh,
and uh,

684
00:44:09.171 --> 00:44:14.171
they have used Tufo work also for the arcades above and for the columns.

685
00:44:15.531 --> 00:44:16.770
The capitols are done in Cha,

686
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:20.660
travertine added and travertine and considered the most important parts of,

687
00:44:20.661 --> 00:44:23.090
they use the more expensive material there.

688
00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:28.180
But you can see here as at the sanctuary of Hercules at Tivoli that we have this

689
00:44:28.851 --> 00:44:33.851
combination of arcades and columns and once again is as was already pointed out,

690
00:44:34.231 --> 00:44:36.780
columns that have no structural purpose whatsoever.

691
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.990
Columns that are there for pure decoration.

692
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:44.730
And this scheme of arcades with columns is going to come become extremely

693
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.400
important,
uh,
in the future.
One can go inside the top,

694
00:44:49.401 --> 00:44:51.120
you Laurium today,
uh,

695
00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.930
and see what remains of this state archives.
Uh,

696
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.710
there are some very interesting Carter's and vaulting that one can see.

697
00:44:58.711 --> 00:44:59.341
And by the way,

698
00:44:59.341 --> 00:45:03.930
it's a nice place to go because there's also a panoramic window on which one can

699
00:45:03.931 --> 00:45:08.931
get some spectacular views down over the Roman forum and some great pictures as

700
00:45:09.331 --> 00:45:11.460
well.
Photographs as well.
Uh,

701
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:15.550
we're looking here at one of the carters of the tabular IOM.

702
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.600
You can see that the arches are made out of stones supported by columns,

703
00:45:20.671 --> 00:45:24.060
but in between them,
there are a series of bays as you can see here.

704
00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:29.360
And in between them we have domical ceilings that are made out of concrete.

705
00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:33.210
So concrete use tier combined concrete for the domes,

706
00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.370
a combined with stone.

707
00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:39.000
The Romans were very handsome stone that the Romans,

708
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:44.300
those in Rome itself favored a use for the arches and used to decorate the walls

709
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:50.790
as well.
And what's interesting is that we find in these carters,

710
00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:55.440
some s a series of ramps and a series of steps,

711
00:45:55.441 --> 00:45:58.500
and there's actually one staircase that has 66 steps.

712
00:45:58.501 --> 00:46:02.610
I've counted them 66 steps,
uh,
as well as ramps.

713
00:46:02.611 --> 00:46:06.180
And what we see happening here,
and these are again covered by barrel vaults.

714
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.770
What we see happening here is the Romans paying a lot of attention to varying

715
00:46:10.771 --> 00:46:13.810
the experience that you have when you walk through building.

716
00:46:13.811 --> 00:46:16.410
Sometimes you're going to be walking on a straight path.

717
00:46:16.411 --> 00:46:18.150
Sometimes you're going to be walking on a ramp,

718
00:46:18.151 --> 00:46:22.230
sometimes you're going to be walking on stairs to very that experience.
So,

719
00:46:22.231 --> 00:46:26.100
and you're going to see panoramas and so on along the way to make it an

720
00:46:26.101 --> 00:46:30.240
experience to go into a building and to wander around that building.

721
00:46:30.241 --> 00:46:31.980
But we're also going to see,

722
00:46:31.981 --> 00:46:35.160
and I'll show you this particularly in the last structure we talk about today,

723
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:40.400
we're also going to see the Romans not hesitating to be the controlling force

724
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.110
that they very much were.

725
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:47.730
And to establish certain predetermined paths that you have to take.

726
00:46:47.731 --> 00:46:49.320
So you're having a varied experience,

727
00:46:49.321 --> 00:46:53.940
but you're kind of having it in the way that the Romans want you to have it.

728
00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:58.140
And that's an interesting phenomenon that I hope will think about,
uh,

729
00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:02.700
together in the,
as we converse,
uh,
in the,
in the online forum.

730
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:09.010
I want to show you one last building in Rome today before I show you the,
the,

731
00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:12.430
the real ps to raise this dawns of concrete architecture of,

732
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.900
of this early period.
I'd like to show you one more building in Rome.

733
00:47:15.901 --> 00:47:19.560
It's a later building and in some respects it belongs in a later lecture.

734
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.110
It's the theater of Marselis and Rome.
Uh,

735
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:26.670
a theater that was put up by Rome's first emperor Augustus,
uh,

736
00:47:26.671 --> 00:47:31.480
after the death of his nephew and son in law.
Marselis.
Uh,

737
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.210
he seems to have put it up.
That is Augustus seems to put it up.

738
00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:37.870
He was great grief at the loss of this young man because he had hoped that

739
00:47:37.871 --> 00:47:42.670
Marcel is,
would succeed in Marcellus,
was married to Augustus,
his daughter Julia.

740
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:44.650
You'd hope that Marcellus would succeed him,

741
00:47:44.651 --> 00:47:46.930
but Marcella's unfortunately died very young.

742
00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:51.430
Augustus was an incredible grief and he put up this theater in Rome,

743
00:47:51.431 --> 00:47:55.000
this stone theater in Rome,
in honor of Marcellus.

744
00:47:55.001 --> 00:47:59.440
The theater was put up as I mentioned,
either in 13 or in 11 BC.

745
00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:00.820
So I could talk about this.

746
00:48:00.821 --> 00:48:04.360
We have several lectures on Augustus and I could talk about this in that
lecture,

747
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.760
but I decided to put it here,
uh,

748
00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:11.080
because it really is the culmination in a sense of some of the experiments we've

749
00:48:11.081 --> 00:48:12.430
been talking about today.

750
00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:17.320
And I wanted you to see it in this context.
For that reason,

751
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:21.840
we are looking at the theater of Marcellus as it looks today.
Uh,

752
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.340
parts of it are extremely well preserved.

753
00:48:24.341 --> 00:48:27.040
As you can see at least these first two tiers here.

754
00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:31.300
The main reason that the building has survived,
and you can see,
well,

755
00:48:31.301 --> 00:48:32.890
I'll talk about the details in a moment.

756
00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:35.920
The main reason that the building has survived,
and I,

757
00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.470
I believe I mentioned this in the introductory lecture,

758
00:48:38.471 --> 00:48:43.090
is that it was reused over time.
It was reused as a,
um,

759
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:48.310
as a fortress in the middle ages.
It was used as a palace in the renaissance.

760
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.950
And it was used as a and most recently,

761
00:48:50.951 --> 00:48:55.540
and it's still being used as a very luxurious a condominium today.

762
00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.710
This is where Google earth really comes in handy.
Uh,

763
00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:03.310
you can go if you go onto Google earth because it's very difficult to get a

764
00:49:03.311 --> 00:49:06.290
sense of the way in which this ancient,

765
00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:11.230
the ancient part of the structure relates to the rest of the structure today,

766
00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:14.020
uh,
without going up above it.

767
00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.470
And by going up above it and looking at it both from above and,

768
00:49:17.471 --> 00:49:20.710
and Google Earth now allows you to do three d at the same time.

769
00:49:20.711 --> 00:49:25.290
So you can do three d and up above at the same time.
Uh,
you,

770
00:49:25.291 --> 00:49:30.220
you can see the relationship of this building to its modern locale.

771
00:49:30.221 --> 00:49:34.690
And by the way,
it's just in the shadow.
It's very close to the capital on hill.

772
00:49:34.691 --> 00:49:38.980
It's a hop,
skip and a jump from the Capitoline hill.
Uh,
this area of Rome,

773
00:49:38.981 --> 00:49:42.340
it's actually the so called Jewish ghetto area of Rome.

774
00:49:42.341 --> 00:49:45.250
It served as a ghetto and in times past,

775
00:49:45.251 --> 00:49:47.710
and it's still referred to it that way today.

776
00:49:47.711 --> 00:49:49.780
And it has some of the best restaurants in Rome.

777
00:49:49.781 --> 00:49:54.490
If you have never had Carciofi Alla Judea Jewish artichokes.

778
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.110
Wow.
They are incredible.

779
00:49:56.111 --> 00:49:58.900
And there are several lots of restaurants in this area that has them.

780
00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:01.240
They're a real,
a real Roman treat.

781
00:50:01.241 --> 00:50:06.220
It's considered a part of a very characteristic part of the cuisine of ancient

782
00:50:06.221 --> 00:50:08.650
Rome.
And it's definitely something to experience.

783
00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:13.840
But we see the theater of Marcellus right here and you can see,
uh,
both,

784
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:18.130
uh,
the facade,
which is the ancient part of it,

785
00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:22.180
but also the rest of the building and the way in which it is used today as a

786
00:50:22.181 --> 00:50:24.580
condominium with apartments opening off,
uh,

787
00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:29.450
these lovely courtyards with trees and plants and flowers and all sorts of,

788
00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:33.230
of things there.
And there's another famous temple,

789
00:50:33.231 --> 00:50:35.510
the temple of Apollo that is located right outside.

790
00:50:35.511 --> 00:50:38.570
There are only three columns preserved of that temple,

791
00:50:38.571 --> 00:50:43.370
but also it's podium right in front of the theater of Marcellus.

792
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:45.080
This is again Google earth.

793
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:47.990
You can look not only at what the building looks like today,

794
00:50:47.991 --> 00:50:52.340
but you can recreate a,
now all of you know,
in these last couple of months,

795
00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:55.880
they've enabled us to recreate ancient Rome as well.

796
00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:59.300
And one can do that for all of the buildings that we'll be looking at this

797
00:50:59.301 --> 00:51:02.870
semester.
And this one is their recreation.
It's fairly simple,

798
00:51:02.871 --> 00:51:06.170
but their recreation of the theater of Marcellus.

799
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:11.200
And it allows us to look at some of the features of that building.

800
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:12.291
Again,

801
00:51:12.291 --> 00:51:15.950
sorry that I have to talk about so much about terminology at the beginning,

802
00:51:15.951 --> 00:51:18.710
but as I mentioned,
once we get through this the first couple of weeks,

803
00:51:18.711 --> 00:51:20.960
we won't have to do much of that anymore.
Uh,

804
00:51:20.961 --> 00:51:25.961
but the basic components of a Roman theater where the seating,

805
00:51:26.001 --> 00:51:29.800
which is called the coffee,
I see Ava,
which is this,
um,

806
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:32.180
semicircular seating that we see here.

807
00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:36.710
The coffee is usually divided into a series of wedge-shaped sections,

808
00:51:36.711 --> 00:51:39.530
which you cannot see here.
But I'll show you in another view in a moment.

809
00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:43.430
Wedge-Shaped sections that are called each year called the Coonass,

810
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:47.630
c u n e u s a coonass.

811
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:51.650
And then there is a stage building.
We're seeing the back of that here,

812
00:51:51.651 --> 00:51:56.510
but a stage building facing the seating,
uh,
called a scan I fronds,

813
00:51:56.620 --> 00:52:01.550
Sca,
e n.
A.
D e.
F.
R.
O.
N.
S.
A.
Skein I fronds.

814
00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:06.730
Uh,
what's important to us here in the context of this lecture is that wild,

815
00:52:06.731 --> 00:52:11.731
the Greeks built their theaters and Greek theaters were the base with a main,

816
00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:12.800
um,

817
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:17.450
prototype for Roman theaters while the Greeks built their theaters on hillsides.

818
00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:22.730
Uh,
the Roman Roman's.
We're not content,
uh,
as a,
as an urban,
as,
as,

819
00:52:22.731 --> 00:52:27.200
uh,
as a,
a civilization that was interested primarily in urban centers.

820
00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:31.370
The Romans were not content to build their,
their theaters on hills.

821
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:35.420
They didn't want to be constrained by having to build their theaters with hills

822
00:52:35.421 --> 00:52:39.380
happen to be.
And so now with concrete construction,
what,
what,

823
00:52:39.381 --> 00:52:43.430
what they were able to do instead was to build a hill out of concrete anywhere

824
00:52:43.431 --> 00:52:45.920
they wanted to build a hill out of concrete,

825
00:52:45.921 --> 00:52:49.280
right in the center of downtown Rome.
And then hollow,
uh,

826
00:52:49.281 --> 00:52:54.281
that concrete out in order to create the entrances and exits from that

827
00:52:54.411 --> 00:52:58.670
structure.
And that's exactly what they did for the theater of Marcellus.

828
00:52:58.850 --> 00:53:02.690
If we look at this detail of the outside of the theater of Marcellus,

829
00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:07.580
we will see that this building made out of concrete is like the others we've

830
00:53:07.581 --> 00:53:10.280
talked about today,
faced with uh,

831
00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:15.350
some kind of stone.
In this case,
the stone is travertine.

832
00:53:15.351 --> 00:53:19.220
The decision of Augustus was to get this more expensive stone,
bring it from,

833
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:23.900
from uh,
from a Tivoli and use it for this structure,

834
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:27.900
uh,
blocks of stone,
Ashleigh blocks of stone as you can see here.

835
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:32.430
And interspersing among the arcades,
uh,
columns,

836
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:35.640
columns that was as we're well pointed out before,

837
00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:38.220
have no structural purpose whatsoever.

838
00:53:38.221 --> 00:53:43.020
Columns that served only as decoration and the fact that they were decoration,

839
00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:47.640
uh,
is,
uh,
is a parent in the fact that they have a varied the orders.

840
00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:52.640
Here we see the doric order use for the first story and the ionic order use for

841
00:53:53.131 --> 00:53:57.030
the second story.
And we think there may have been a third story today.

842
00:53:57.031 --> 00:54:00.380
What you see up there is part of the later construction.
Uh,

843
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:04.170
but if there was a third story,
whether that had columns or Pilasters,

844
00:54:04.171 --> 00:54:06.990
which you'll remember a flat columns if it had those,

845
00:54:06.991 --> 00:54:11.280
those were probably of the Corinthian order because that is exactly the scheme

846
00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:16.170
that we see on the later coliseum.
Doric ionic and ultimately Corinthian,

847
00:54:16.171 --> 00:54:19.470
but we're sure at least of the doric and the ionic.
Uh,

848
00:54:19.471 --> 00:54:22.290
so these columns had no structural purpose whatsoever.

849
00:54:22.291 --> 00:54:26.520
Purely decorative in a sense.
They're kind of the icing on the cake.

850
00:54:26.521 --> 00:54:30.240
They don't hold up the building,
uh,
but they decorate it in a very nice way.

851
00:54:30.241 --> 00:54:34.170
And it shows you that the Romans are beginning to use what the Greeks used as

852
00:54:34.171 --> 00:54:38.550
structural components of their buildings,
namely columns to hold up walls,

853
00:54:38.551 --> 00:54:42.680
to hold up roofs.
They are using them for purely decorative purposes,

854
00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:47.610
playing around with their original purpose and using them in a different way.

855
00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:52.260
And we see that happening,
uh,
in spades here.
If you go into the building,

856
00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:55.530
you will see the carters,
uh,
of the,
uh,

857
00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:57.900
of the theater of Marcellus.
Uh,

858
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:02.280
you will see what first looks like a barrel vault done out of concrete

859
00:55:02.281 --> 00:55:06.200
construction,
resting on stone,
on travertine peers.
Uh,

860
00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.490
but you see that that barrel vault curves,

861
00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:12.120
a curving barrel vault is technically called an annular vault.

862
00:55:12.121 --> 00:55:17.121
A andN ,U l a r you see an annual or volunteer or a diagram of an annular

863
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:21.540
volunteer.
It's essentially,
again,
a barrel vault that curves.

864
00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:25.590
We sometimes refer to it as a ring vault because of its shape.

865
00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:30.570
So you see those annular vaults used in the theater of Marcellus.

866
00:55:30.571 --> 00:55:34.710
These are the same bolts that will be used ultimately in the coliseum.

867
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:39.210
A quick view of a typical Roman theater,

868
00:55:39.211 --> 00:55:42.390
the theater of Marcellus in Rome,
and a typical Greek theater.

869
00:55:42.391 --> 00:55:47.391
This is the famous theater at Epidaurus of the mid fourth century BC in Greece a

870
00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:50.880
and I show you just wanted to point out the main differences.

871
00:55:50.881 --> 00:55:54.690
They look superficially alike,
uh,
in that,
uh,

872
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:59.280
both of them have an orchestra,
they have a area of seats,

873
00:55:59.281 --> 00:56:03.630
they have a stage building.
Uh,
but there are some important differences.

874
00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:05.850
One is,
and you can't see that over here,

875
00:56:05.851 --> 00:56:08.670
but the Greek theater had a round orchestra.

876
00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:11.970
The Roman theater always has a semicircular orchestra.

877
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:16.520
Both of them have seats.
The Kavya here you can see these wedge shapes,

878
00:56:16.521 --> 00:56:19.510
sections of seats,
seats called the Coonass,
uh,

879
00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:23.950
that both Greek theaters and also Roman theaters had both of them have stage

880
00:56:23.951 --> 00:56:28.000
buildings.
All of the stage building is more prominent in the Roman context,

881
00:56:28.001 --> 00:56:31.660
but the most important distinction is the one I've already drawn.
And that is,

882
00:56:31.661 --> 00:56:35.490
as you can see it Epidaurus the Greeks build their theaters on hilltops.

883
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:38.890
You can see the trees and part of the hill very clearly here.

884
00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:43.420
The Romans build theirs on hills,
made out of concrete,
not always.

885
00:56:43.421 --> 00:56:46.960
There are some exceptions to that and we do have some Roman theaters built on

886
00:56:46.961 --> 00:56:50.680
hills when the hill happened to be in a good location and and particularly

887
00:56:50.681 --> 00:56:51.960
beautifully sited a,

888
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:55.990
but for the most part Romans build them on their own concrete construction.

889
00:56:56.710 --> 00:57:00.580
I've mentioned the monument of Victor Emmanuel,
the Victoriano.

890
00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.150
And I just wanted to say a couple more words about it because,

891
00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:07.540
and you'll see how it fits into the context here in a moment.
Uh,

892
00:57:07.541 --> 00:57:12.310
because it's a 19th century building and it's a building that was put up to

893
00:57:12.311 --> 00:57:17.311
honor the first king of the Kingdom of Italy.

894
00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:22.330
Uh,
his name was Victor Emmanuel,
the first Victor Manual,
the first,

895
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:25.800
it was put up in 1885.
Uh,
and you see it here,

896
00:57:25.801 --> 00:57:29.710
get a major landmark in the city.
This is a Google earth image once again,

897
00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:34.840
but the reason I show it to you in this context today is that it is in a sense,

898
00:57:34.841 --> 00:57:37.810
terrorist on the slope of the capital line.
Hail.

899
00:57:37.811 --> 00:57:42.220
You'll see Michelangelo's oval pops up,
they're slow.
It's terrorist on the slope,

900
00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:43.690
a series of levels,

901
00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:47.830
staircases leading to terrorist is leading to other terrorist is leading up to

902
00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:50.230
the top of the building,
decorated with statuary.

903
00:57:50.231 --> 00:57:53.890
It's a real experience to climb up it.
It's an amazing place to go.

904
00:57:53.891 --> 00:57:58.360
It has the tomb of the Italian unknown soldier,
uh,
here,
uh,

905
00:57:58.361 --> 00:58:02.620
and uh,
w with guards and eternal flame and all of those things.

906
00:58:02.621 --> 00:58:07.621
And I must add for any of you who have not been in Rome in the last year,

907
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:12.340
uh,
and two,
we're hoping to go sometime soon or whenever in the future.

908
00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:15.420
They have just added on top of the victor.
It was,

909
00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:18.370
it was always a great place to climb up and see great views of Rome,

910
00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:20.620
but they have just added an elevator,

911
00:58:20.621 --> 00:58:24.400
a modern elevator that they've created that you can now take up taking you even

912
00:58:24.401 --> 00:58:27.040
higher than you were ever able to go before.

913
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:31.840
The views of Rome from there are among the most spectacular that one can see in

914
00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:35.470
the city.
So I happened,
unfortunately when I was there this past June,

915
00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:40.030
it was raining and it doesn't rain in Rome that often at that time of year,

916
00:58:40.031 --> 00:58:44.800
but it was a,
so many of the pictures that I took,
um,
are,

917
00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:47.920
you know,
sort of do this sort of gray background and so on and so forth.

918
00:58:47.921 --> 00:58:48.690
But nonetheless,

919
00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:51.820
it some of the most spectacular views you can you see of the city.

920
00:58:51.821 --> 00:58:54.880
So don't miss out on that opportunity.

921
00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:59.200
But I show it to you in this context because of all of this terracing up a hill.

922
00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:04.590
The idea for this kind of thing goes way back to the second century BC,

923
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:08.650
uh,
and comes from buildings like this one.
This is without any question.

924
00:59:08.651 --> 00:59:12.460
The masterpiece of Roman concrete architecture,

925
00:59:12.461 --> 00:59:15.550
concrete construction,
sanctuary design,
uh,

926
00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:18.100
in the second and first centuries BC,

927
00:59:18.101 --> 00:59:21.740
we're not absolutely sure of its date for a long time is by the way,

928
00:59:21.741 --> 00:59:26.741
the sanctuary of Fortuna Prima Jania at a town called Palestrina.

929
00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:29.740
The date is very controversial.
Uh,

930
00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:34.640
there are many who long associated it with the Roman General Sola and said that

931
00:59:34.641 --> 00:59:37.340
it dated to ADBC.
Uh,
there's,

932
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:40.790
there are others who have contended that it's much earlier than that updates to

933
00:59:40.791 --> 00:59:44.480
the second century BC.
And if it dates to the second century BC,

934
00:59:44.481 --> 00:59:48.260
it's even more amazing because that means it comes at the beginning rather than

935
00:59:48.261 --> 00:59:52.860
at the end of this second and first century BC development.
Uh,

936
00:59:52.861 --> 00:59:55.220
I tend to now,
I've gone back and forth.

937
00:59:55.221 --> 00:59:58.550
I taught it as a solid building for quite a while now.

938
00:59:58.551 --> 01:00:01.250
I've been teaching it last few years is a second century building.

939
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:05.060
It probably doesn't matter all that much a dates to one or the other and it's an

940
01:00:05.061 --> 01:00:08.750
example of what was going on at that particular time.
Uh,
but I'm,

941
01:00:08.751 --> 01:00:12.770
I'm giving you a date,
uh,
this year as a second century BC,

942
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:16.220
which I think at this juncture is probably my personal opinion is that's

943
01:00:16.221 --> 01:00:20.750
probably where it belongs.
A,
you're looking at it here.

944
01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.350
It is an incredible,
it is part of an incredible Hilltown just like Corey.
Uh,

945
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:29.910
the city of,
um,
Palestrina is a beautiful hill town.
Uh,

946
01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:32.270
you can see it here with all the wonderful,

947
01:00:32.271 --> 01:00:36.650
the red roofs of the town that tie the,
the design of the town together.

948
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:37.310
Uh,

949
01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:42.310
the culminating monument of that town is still the sanctuary of Fortuna Prima

950
01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:43.880
Jania at once again,

951
01:00:43.881 --> 01:00:48.350
the Romans have found a spectacular locale for this sanctuary.

952
01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:53.210
Come theater,
come shopping mall,
a Mecca for Romans,
uh,

953
01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:57.410
of its day on this hillside.
They have a,
once again,

954
01:00:57.411 --> 01:01:00.350
they have in fact taken over the entire hillside.

955
01:01:00.351 --> 01:01:02.990
They have terrorist the hillside as we can,
as we can see.

956
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:07.550
And they've essentially poured concrete on that hillside to create a system of

957
01:01:07.551 --> 01:01:11.930
ramps and stairways.
And with the temple at the very apex,

958
01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:15.500
it is pretty well preserved today.
You can see there's an awful lot of,

959
01:01:15.501 --> 01:01:19.670
it's still there.
Uh,
you can either,
if you're coming by car,

960
01:01:19.671 --> 01:01:22.610
you can either park down here or up there,
uh,

961
01:01:22.611 --> 01:01:27.500
and you can make your way up the ramps up the staircase to the various levels.

962
01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:32.030
And then up to the theatrical entrance,
way into the upper most part.

963
01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.580
This is the temple of for tuna herself,

964
01:01:34.581 --> 01:01:39.170
which was at the apex and was located probably in what may have been a kind of

965
01:01:39.171 --> 01:01:42.500
mountain alcove at that particular time.
Uh,

966
01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:47.030
was transformed in the 17th century by the famous Barberini family.

967
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:51.590
They Miss Italian family.
Pope's came from that family and so on,
uh,

968
01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:52.670
transformed into,

969
01:01:52.671 --> 01:01:56.480
they were very smart to transformed into a nice little palace that they could go

970
01:01:56.481 --> 01:01:59.240
and stay in when they felt like at a small palace.

971
01:01:59.241 --> 01:02:03.890
But one that takes the exact shape of that upper most part of the sanctuary.

972
01:02:03.891 --> 01:02:07.520
I'll show that to you in a moment.
Uh,
here's a view from Google earth.

973
01:02:07.521 --> 01:02:09.440
You can see Google or it doesn't always work.

974
01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.840
When you go out to some of the smaller places,

975
01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:16.600
it's hard to zero in on it well enough to get a decent focus.
Uh,

976
01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.230
but you can see it actually here.

977
01:02:18.231 --> 01:02:22.110
You can go to Palestrina and see it on Google Earth.
Uh,
this is,
you know,

978
01:02:22.111 --> 01:02:24.840
these are the,
the various tiers with the,
uh,

979
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:29.220
with the palace at the upper most part.
Here's a restored view.

980
01:02:29.221 --> 01:02:30.620
It's on your monument list.
Uh,

981
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:35.050
that gives you a sense of what the building looked like in antiquity.
Uh,

982
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:39.240
you can see the entrance way was down here,
a small arched entrance way,

983
01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:44.010
but you really needed to go up the ramp so you could go up on either side.
Uh,

984
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:47.310
so we see this,
this,
this composite,
just like we saw at the top.

985
01:02:47.311 --> 01:02:52.311
You Laurium is combination of ramps and staircases,

986
01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:56.130
uh,
to make your way up,
uh,
buried experiences.

987
01:02:56.131 --> 01:02:59.080
But at the same time a predetermined path,
uh,

988
01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:01.740
because while you had some choice when you first arrived,

989
01:03:01.741 --> 01:03:05.160
you could go up the ramp on either left and right and you can see it was a

990
01:03:05.161 --> 01:03:08.970
covered ramp and antiquity.
But when you got here,
you had one choice.

991
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:12.690
You had to go up the stairway to this level.
And then there,

992
01:03:12.691 --> 01:03:14.340
there some shops here you could explore.

993
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:16.020
But then if you want it to go up to the next level,

994
01:03:16.021 --> 01:03:19.320
you have to go back to the central stairway,
up to this level,

995
01:03:19.321 --> 01:03:20.760
back to the central stairway,

996
01:03:20.761 --> 01:03:25.650
and then to the stairway in the shape of a theater at the upper most parts.

997
01:03:25.651 --> 01:03:29.860
So again,
experiences stress,
your experience of the building with stress.

998
01:03:29.861 --> 01:03:34.440
But at the same time,
your path was determined by the Roman designer.

999
01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:38.970
This is another view of the same where we can see the entrance way,

1000
01:03:38.971 --> 01:03:42.690
the ramps,
the staircase leading you from one to the other,

1001
01:03:42.691 --> 01:03:47.130
the upper most staircase.
Here you can well see the theatrical,
uh,

1002
01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.620
the,
the way in which the theater,

1003
01:03:49.621 --> 01:03:52.980
the semicircular theater is used both as a,

1004
01:03:52.981 --> 01:03:56.400
an attractive entrance stairway to the structure,

1005
01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:00.540
but at the same time as a place where performances could actually take place.

1006
01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:05.090
Then a,
what's called a Hemi cycle.
You see several Hemi cycles here,

1007
01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:09.240
AGM I cyc,
l,
e,
these curved areas.

1008
01:04:09.241 --> 01:04:11.070
The columns follow that curve.

1009
01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:16.140
You see that Hemi sick send me cycle at the very top.
And then at the ultimate,

1010
01:04:16.141 --> 01:04:19.410
the,
at the,
at the apex of the structure,
uh,

1011
01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:24.330
the shrine of Fortuna tuna herself,
a small round tron.
In fact,

1012
01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:25.680
it's almost a,

1013
01:04:25.681 --> 01:04:30.030
an anticlimax to see how small the shrine at the upper most part of the

1014
01:04:30.031 --> 01:04:34.810
structure is.
How did the Romans achieve this?
They,
uh,

1015
01:04:34.811 --> 01:04:38.010
they,
they created,
as you can see here,
a series of,

1016
01:04:38.011 --> 01:04:42.830
they converted the hillside into a series of manmade terraces.
A,

1017
01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:47.010
they've built those terraces up in some instances by barrel vaults.

1018
01:04:47.011 --> 01:04:51.630
You can see the series of concrete barrel vaults here as they have built some

1019
01:04:51.631 --> 01:04:56.250
elements up along the way.
And the ultimate,

1020
01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:59.400
uh,
ultimate result was what you see here.

1021
01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:02.880
The same sort of thing we saw before,
the ramps,
the staircase,

1022
01:05:02.881 --> 01:05:06.570
the hemi cycles with columns supporting a curved wall,

1023
01:05:06.810 --> 01:05:08.770
a series of shops.
Uh,

1024
01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:13.080
the spectacular estate is theater like and a staircase,

1025
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:17.980
the curved heavy cycle at the upper most part and then peaking up at the top,

1026
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.890
the,
a set of the temple of four to know herself.

1027
01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:23.980
It's hard to conjure up in a classroom in new haven,

1028
01:05:23.981 --> 01:05:28.810
the actual experience that one has when one goes to Palestrina and climbs

1029
01:05:28.811 --> 01:05:32.860
through this structure and is not as well preserved today as it once was

1030
01:05:32.861 --> 01:05:35.920
obviously an antiquity.
But in the few minutes that remain,

1031
01:05:35.921 --> 01:05:40.750
I want to try to recapture or try to take you through that experience where

1032
01:05:40.751 --> 01:05:44.500
obviously and to get in to show you how arduous it actually was.
It's,
it's a,

1033
01:05:44.501 --> 01:05:47.860
it's a climb up there.
And in fact,
this is one of those examples in there,

1034
01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:51.550
many in Italy that one likes to call,
um,
uh,

1035
01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.580
stair masters made by nature essentially.

1036
01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:57.340
I mean places that you can go and you can,
you put an,

1037
01:05:57.430 --> 01:06:01.900
exert a lot of effort into to making your way to the top of this sanctuary,

1038
01:06:01.901 --> 01:06:05.650
the best,
the best natural stare,
a stairmaster.
And um,

1039
01:06:05.970 --> 01:06:09.010
Italy is of course a lot.
Any of you have been along the Amalfi coast.
You know,

1040
01:06:09.011 --> 01:06:12.550
there's nowhere on the Amalfi coast that you don't have to climb up and down

1041
01:06:12.551 --> 01:06:16.900
with multiple times a day.
Uh,
and that's exactly what's happening here.

1042
01:06:16.901 --> 01:06:18.570
And you can see how steep,
uh,

1043
01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:23.610
this path up the up the ramp was a and we're going up the ramp again,

1044
01:06:24.101 --> 01:06:28.870
it was covered in antiquity,
it's open to the sky today as we go along the ramp,

1045
01:06:28.871 --> 01:06:33.060
we see the remnants of some of the capitals.
These are,
uh,

1046
01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:37.630
travertine capitals as you can see here,
a fallen down.

1047
01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:40.540
But if you look at some of these capitals in detail,

1048
01:06:40.541 --> 01:06:42.130
you see something quite extraordinary.

1049
01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:46.660
And that is the capital isn't straight the upper most part of the capitol
slopes.

1050
01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:48.370
And now why is that?

1051
01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:52.090
The reason that is is because if you're going to put columns along the inner

1052
01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:55.630
wall of the ramp,
which is what they did,
the column,

1053
01:06:55.631 --> 01:06:58.630
the capital's have to conform,
uh,
to the,

1054
01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:02.800
to the incline of the,
uh,
of the ramp.
And so they have,

1055
01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:07.980
they have,
um,
slanted those capitals.
The whole idea though of,

1056
01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.930
of changing and the Greeks would never do something like that.
I mean,

1057
01:07:10.931 --> 01:07:14.920
it would be sacrilege to change the shape of a capital a,

1058
01:07:14.921 --> 01:07:17.380
but this Roman architect has done that with a band in here.

1059
01:07:17.381 --> 01:07:19.720
He needed to do it because they needed to fit it into the scheme,

1060
01:07:19.721 --> 01:07:21.190
although he could have not had columns there,

1061
01:07:21.191 --> 01:07:24.880
but he wanted to have columns there.
So he slandered them.
This,
this whole,
this,

1062
01:07:24.881 --> 01:07:28.840
this sort of sacrilegious approach,
uh,
to traditional Roman architecture,

1063
01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.960
traditional Greek and a trust in architecture.
The willingness to,

1064
01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:35.080
to change things,
to experiment told us as a change,

1065
01:07:35.081 --> 01:07:38.890
you believe in the willingness to change,
to change these things,

1066
01:07:38.891 --> 01:07:42.700
to experiment with them in ways that had never been done before.
Uh,

1067
01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:46.840
to go against the tenants of traditional ancient architecture,

1068
01:07:46.841 --> 01:07:50.440
namely that of the Greeks and a trust gives is something quintessentially Roman

1069
01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:54.040
and something that we see happening here.
And again,
Harold's a,

1070
01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:58.630
a very innovative future.
Here we see again the ramp,
we see the capital's,

1071
01:07:58.631 --> 01:08:02.500
the slant of the capitals and we see that the work here was done,

1072
01:08:02.501 --> 01:08:07.270
was concrete faced with opus and carried them both for the walls and also for

1073
01:08:07.271 --> 01:08:10.750
the ceilings as one makes one's way up the ramps.

1074
01:08:10.751 --> 01:08:14.110
We see these alcoves all of this done,
you know,

1075
01:08:14.111 --> 01:08:18.200
but the various shops alcoves all of it done with concrete faced with opus and

1076
01:08:18.201 --> 01:08:21.380
carried them.
We see the remains of the Hemi cycles.

1077
01:08:21.381 --> 01:08:26.381
You can see the columns made of Tufa with travertine capitals supporting this

1078
01:08:26.721 --> 01:08:29.930
curved attic of the Hemi cycles.
Uh,

1079
01:08:29.931 --> 01:08:34.460
we see the bolting a width,
it's concrete construction.

1080
01:08:34.461 --> 01:08:36.700
This is an annual or volt.
Once again,
uh,

1081
01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:41.740
where we can see the facing is in the coffers is opus and them work.

1082
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:44.540
Another view of that,

1083
01:08:44.541 --> 01:08:49.320
both the wall and the annual or vault decorated with,
uh,

1084
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:53.810
opus and carried him work at detail of that opus and carried them work to show

1085
01:08:53.811 --> 01:08:55.700
you how very attractive it was.

1086
01:08:55.701 --> 01:09:00.050
It's a pity that it was stuck over in ancient Roman times.
A view that I took.

1087
01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:02.930
Again,
just to give you a sense of how steep the climb is,

1088
01:09:02.931 --> 01:09:05.660
you've made it up the ramp.
Now you're at that central staircase,

1089
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:09.560
you're on your way up.
It's very,
very steep.
The,
the stairways,

1090
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:13.700
stairways are pretty narrow,
pretty,
uh,
uh,
you know,

1091
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:17.660
are short so that it's a very arduous trip up as I said.

1092
01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:21.650
And then you can get a sense of the fact that you would have seen the sanctuary

1093
01:09:21.651 --> 01:09:26.300
of fourtune at the top.
Now you see the embracing arms of the Barberini Palace,

1094
01:09:26.301 --> 01:09:30.800
but you can see those arms follow the exact shape of the original hemi cycle

1095
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:32.150
that was once there.

1096
01:09:32.151 --> 01:09:36.200
And you can also see the theater staircase very well preserved.

1097
01:09:36.201 --> 01:09:40.890
And I show you a detail of that,
the inner staircase leading into,
uh,

1098
01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:44.000
the,
uh,
doorway into the museum today.

1099
01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:47.760
And just in closing a return to the,
uh,

1100
01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:52.550
restored view of the structure itself with the sanctuary of,
um,

1101
01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:57.050
with the temple or the shrine of Fortuna at the very apex,

1102
01:09:57.051 --> 01:09:59.600
the shrine that unfortunately no longer survives.

1103
01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:03.740
But I think as you look at this last view of this monument,
uh,

1104
01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:07.910
you can see that what the architects have created through this terrorist thing

1105
01:10:07.911 --> 01:10:12.911
through pouring concrete on this spectacular hillside is a kind of a pyramid,

1106
01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:16.100
a kind of a pyramid with the,
uh,

1107
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:21.250
with the goddess at the apex of pyramid that I would contend a was more

1108
01:10:21.561 --> 01:10:25.700
extraordinary through what the Romans did with concrete,
uh,

1109
01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.080
than what nature itself had provided in the form of this mountain.

1110
01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:34.850
And it gives you an incredible sense of what the Romans were capable of doing in

1111
01:10:34.851 --> 01:10:36.260
the second and first centuries.

1112
01:10:36.261 --> 01:10:40.310
BC Visa VI concrete architecture experiments that again,

1113
01:10:40.311 --> 01:10:43.620
are going to have a lasting impact on,
uh,

1114
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:47.120
the architecture that we'll be studying in the course of this term.
Thank you.
