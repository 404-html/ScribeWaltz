1
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.800
Good morning everybody today.

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.610
I am going to,
well actually let me step back for a second.

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.360
I have been mentioning to you in the last several weeks,

4
00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:17.040
I've been mentioning to you more than once,
the fact that we are,
uh,

5
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:21.690
we have been beginning to see what I've described as the baroque element in

6
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:25.920
Roman architecture,
the baroque element in Roman architecture.

7
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.250
And I want to concentrate on that particular aspect of Roman architecture today,

8
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.940
which is why I called the lecture Baroque extravaganzas.

9
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.770
I want to make that the beginning at the outset.
I want to make a few points.

10
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:45.771
I want to highlight what I see as the three major features of a baroque

11
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:49.860
architecture in the Roman period.

12
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.300
The first of these is that those buildings that are baroque or at least the

13
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:59.301
architects and patrons who designed buildings that we think of today as Baroque

14
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:03.450
or we might define as baroque buildings.
Uh,
they,

15
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.530
they use the traditional vocabulary of architecture.

16
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.570
They use the traditional vocabulary of architecture.
And by what,
by that I mean,

17
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.550
uh,
the traditional vocabulary of Greek and a trust in architecture for the most

18
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:20.040
part.
I'm speaking now of columns.

19
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.100
I'm speaking of pediments and I'm also speaking of lintels and in tablatures and

20
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:29.490
the like,
they use all of that traditional vocabulary,

21
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:33.240
but they use it in a very different way.
That's number one.

22
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.900
Number two is that Baroque Roman,
Roman,

23
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.750
ancient Roman Baroque buildings,
uh,

24
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.590
tend to be decorated in a very ornate fashion,

25
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.780
almost two or nature.
In fact,

26
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:49.380
we'll see that these buildings are covered with decoration.

27
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.030
So much so that they seem to dematerialize,
uh,

28
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.870
some of the architectural elements,

29
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:59.871
including those ones that make up that traditional vocabulary of architecture.

30
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.720
The third,
uh,

31
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.390
and in some respects the most important is the fact that they use these

32
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:10.110
traditional elements of architecture to,

33
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.860
they use them in a way to Enlive in the surface to create motion,

34
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:17.970
to create a sense of undulation I and that in and out the,

35
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:22.650
in and out a projection and recession that I mentioned on a few occasions.

36
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
We see that interjected into these works of architecture of the so called

37
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:30.270
Baroque style.
So keep those three,

38
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.600
those three characteristics in mind as we look at a host of buildings today.

39
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.310
I also want to mention that we'll focus primarily today on the eastern part of

40
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:46.311
the empire where we see a particularly large number of these baroque buildings

41
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:51.480
in large part because there was a strong tradition in that part of the world for

42
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.040
using that traditional vocabulary of architecture because of the very strong

43
00:02:56.041 --> 00:03:01.000
impact of Greece and Greek architecture and have the very,
uh,

44
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.540
have access to,
um,
to,
uh,

45
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.540
high quality marble from that part of the world,

46
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:11.380
which of course is needed for columns and the light.

47
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.800
So we'll focus on the eastern part of the empire.

48
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.490
I also want to,
um,
want to make the point that one,

49
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.140
when one thinks about baroque architecture in general,

50
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.600
one thing's not a Roman antiquity,

51
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:28.720
but rather of the 17th century in Italy,

52
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.290
one thinks in particular have to master architects to great architectural giants

53
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:40.150
who were on the world stage at that particular time.
And that is,

54
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.830
uh,
uh,

55
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.890
Vr Bernini John Lorenzo Bernini and also a Francesco Borromini Francesco

56
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:51.550
Borromini Bernini and Borromini,
uh,

57
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.350
who were themselves rivals architectural rivals,
uh,

58
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.560
put up buildings in fact that are often in dialog with one another.

59
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:04.450
I think in particular of the Piazza Navona where we have Bernini's four Rivers

60
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:08.940
Fountain and borrow Minis Church on Sunday on gays,

61
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.870
they're in a Gonyet,
uh,

62
00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:14.380
and the way in which they were set up to speak to one another.

63
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:15.370
I don't know if any of you,

64
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.150
I'm sure many of you know the four Rivers Fountain where one of the rivers has

65
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:23.300
his hand up like this to protect himself a friend.

66
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.760
The implication is he needs to protect himself.
He's facing Bernie's building.
Uh,

67
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.130
uh,
he's,
he's facing,
he,
excuse me,

68
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:33.850
he's facing Borromini his church and he needs to protect himself.

69
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:37.960
That is Bernini's river needs to protect himself from Bara mini's church.

70
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.210
The implication being that if he doesn't,

71
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:43.540
if he needs to hold up his hand because Borromini his church is going to

72
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:46.600
collapse because it's so poorly executed.

73
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.950
So there's very interesting dialogue between the two men.
And again,

74
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:53.710
we think of that primarily when we think of Baroque.

75
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.820
And just a couple of examples I show you here and I'll show you a number of them

76
00:04:57.821 --> 00:05:02.200
in the course of the lecture today,
especially Bar Munies work.
Uh,

77
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:07.201
but I wanted to focus right at the moment on Saint Peter's on Pa Dro.

78
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.160
Uh,
you see it here,
the Saint Peters as designed,

79
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:15.640
the Dome is designed as we've discussed before by Michelangelo.
Uh,

80
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.370
the facade designed by Carlos Moderno,

81
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:20.830
also 17th century architect,

82
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.260
but most interesting are the embracing oval arms,
uh,

83
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.190
Bernini's colonnade.
And you can see that so well in the view on the upper left,

84
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.080
the embracing arms of that colonnade and all the motion and the in and out

85
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.560
movement that we find both on the facade,
uh,

86
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.590
and in the embracing arms is characteristic of 17th century baroque

87
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:44.680
architecture.

88
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.970
But I want to maintain today as I've maintained in the course of the semester,

89
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:52.890
that the Romans,
there wasn't anything that the Romans didn't do first,
uh,

90
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.900
and that it is Roman Baroque architecture as we're going to it today.

91
00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.330
Or that had a huge impact on architects like Borromini and Bernini.

92
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.460
And I remind you of a couple of instances of that.
Think back,
I mean this,

93
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.630
the whole idea of using hemi cycles,
curves and architecture,
uh,

94
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:16.160
is begun by the Romans of course in such buildings as the,
uh,

95
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.420
sanctuary of 14 for two and a premed Jania Palestrina where you see one of the

96
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:22.550
Hemi cycles up there.
Uh,

97
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.950
and you'll remember that from our discussion of the paper topics that Injera
Asa,

98
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.230
uh,
there was an Oval Piatsa or oval forum,
uh,
well before,
uh,

99
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.050
the oval colonnade of Bernini.
So again,

100
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:40.430
what I'm going to try to demonstrate today is how important this baroque

101
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:44.720
architecture in Roman antiquity is not only in its own right,

102
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.930
but also as a model and a spur to the architects of the 17th century in Italy.

103
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.580
We have touched upon the,
uh,

104
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.950
the beginnings of Roman Baroque architecture incipient,

105
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.760
we might call it incipient Roman Baroque architecture in a few instances.

106
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:07.160
And I just want to remind you of those today.

107
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.640
I think back to second style Roman wall painting,

108
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:14.860
I remind you of the room of the masks and the house of Augustus,
uh,

109
00:07:14.861 --> 00:07:16.430
where you see,
uh,

110
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:21.450
this theatrical facade done in paint that represents columns,

111
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.570
uh,
with a,
uh,

112
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.460
with projecting and projecting elements or lentils on either side.

113
00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:31.730
And then a kind of a pediment above.

114
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.910
We saw our first explorations of this kind of thing in painting already in 60 to

115
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:42.140
50 BC and then in this case in the 30s to 20 BC.

116
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.460
And we maintained at that point that there was probably a direct relationship

117
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.780
between three theatrical architecture and these kinds of paintings,

118
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.390
but we don't have much in the way of preserved,
uh,

119
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.430
built architecture at that time that partakes of some of these characteristics.

120
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.340
But we think it's possible that there may have been,

121
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.310
as I mentioned then some wooden,
some uh,
some,
uh,
skein.

122
00:08:05.311 --> 00:08:07.100
I frons with this,

123
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.000
these kinds of effects done in wood that no longer survive today.

124
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.300
You'll remember also a,

125
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.840
that we looked at the form transitory IOM in Rome of the forum,

126
00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:20.180
first of demission and then completed by nerve.

127
00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:22.160
And I show you a detail of that again,

128
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:27.290
and this is when we really begin to see in built architecture,
uh,
this,
this,

129
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:27.441
uh,

130
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:32.441
this move toward what we're defining today as the baroque enrollment

131
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:37.160
architecture.
Uh,
and you can see that what we have here are the traditional,

132
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:40.430
the traditional vocabulary of architecture columns in this case,

133
00:08:40.431 --> 00:08:44.810
Corinthian columns with projecting and tablatures on top,
uh,

134
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.870
creating a system of a receiving and progressing bays across this across the

135
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:51.644
surface,

136
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.700
which created a kind of undulating movement across the sides of the forum.

137
00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.330
Uh,
and then you'll remember also if you look at the freeze that the freeze

138
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:05.100
continues,
uh,
along the sides of the columns columns as well.

139
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.330
And then in the,
uh,
a relief of Minerva up on top,

140
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:14.480
it's not quite,
I wouldn't call it overly ornate quite yet.
Uh,
but it is ordinate.

141
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.640
And you'll remember that during the Flavian period,
for example,

142
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:20.280
there was a lot of interest in ornate decoration.

143
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:24.540
So we're beginning to see some ex exploration of this kind of thing.

144
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.620
And then it comes full blown.
In the early third century.
Aad,

145
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.740
the CEP disodium,
the facade that was designed for Septa,

146
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:37.750
me a severity for the pallet to add to the Palatine palace that had been built

147
00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:38.970
by demission,

148
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.410
this incredible facade a that is more show than anything else.

149
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:46.710
We think it may also have served as a fountain,
as I mentioned,

150
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.690
very much looking like a theater set with two with three very large niches,

151
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.990
uh,
columns on the curve.
Uh,

152
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:59.080
and then a series of columns placed in three tiers with wings on either side.

153
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.800
And we have a sense that this too was quite decorative.
So all of those elements,

154
00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:09.270
the use of the traditional language of architecture,
columns,
lintels and so on,

155
00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.410
uh,
uh,
uh,
an interest in a very decorative surface.

156
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.380
And then above all this,
uh,
this interjection of motion,
uh,

157
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.830
into the structure projecting bay receiving bay,
projecting day,
receiving bay,

158
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:27.150
all using the traditional language of architecture,

159
00:10:27.151 --> 00:10:31.380
the traditional vocabulary of architecture,
namely columns and the like.

160
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.470
Then I also showed you the tomb,

161
00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:36.960
the second century tomb of the titanic.

162
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.980
He under the Vatican in Rome and we looked at this accident metric view and ward

163
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:46.390
Perkins showing the brick faced a brick face,

164
00:10:46.391 --> 00:10:48.470
concrete facade with express,

165
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.380
with exposed the exposed brick that was popular at that time.

166
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.940
But we focused in on the interior of the structure where I mentioned the through

167
00:10:56.941 --> 00:11:01.720
architect tonic means the architects had,
had um,

168
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.400
had had a embellished this surface and created a interesting motion in that

169
00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:09.150
surface.

170
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:13.860
And you see here this same idea of split as we see in the paintings of the

171
00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:18.861
second style triangular pediment has been split apart to reveal another

172
00:11:19.201 --> 00:11:23.880
triangular pediment inside a with a niche as you can see and the rest of the

173
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.670
wall embellished with columns.
So once again,

174
00:11:26.671 --> 00:11:31.671
the sense of in and out movement across the sides of that wall and walls.

175
00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:35.490
And here you see a view of it as it looks today,
the,

176
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.130
the columns and so on are no longer there.

177
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.600
But you can reconstruct them in your mind's eye underneath these capitals and

178
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:45.840
get a very good sense of this articulation,

179
00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:50.040
what we might call a kind of baroque articulation of the walls.

180
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.780
I mentioned already that most of our best examples of a Roman ancient Roman

181
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:02.260
Baroque architecture can be found in the eastern part of the empire.

182
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.350
And I'd like to concentrate on those today,
although we'll look,

183
00:12:05.351 --> 00:12:06.910
we won't look at those exclusively.

184
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:11.140
I do have a couple of examples from the West as well.

185
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.630
I'm going to actually start in the west,
uh,

186
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:18.631
at a place called Santa Maria Cappola Vater Ray and I show it to you on the map

187
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:25.600
here.
It is close to all the sites in Campania that we'd been talking about this

188
00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:26.410
semester.

189
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:31.210
You see on pay and Herculaneum and a plant is and via for example,

190
00:12:31.211 --> 00:12:34.390
and Ben Event and over here Naples.

191
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.600
And you can see the proximity of Santa Maria Cup or bay tray to all of those

192
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.170
that we've already covered.
A and in Santa Maria,

193
00:12:44.171 --> 00:12:48.490
capo of Hra has been found an extremely WellPreserved Roman tomb.

194
00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:51.220
And you see it here in the center of the screen,

195
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.540
a Roman tomb that dates to the late first century,

196
00:12:55.541 --> 00:13:00.520
a d it is very clear that it is made of concrete construction,
uh,

197
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.460
and that it is faced with opus.
And Keratin work,

198
00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:05.320
which you can see here very clearly,

199
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.600
but you can also see that some brick has been used,
uh,

200
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.170
around the,
uh,
niches,
uh,

201
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.750
and as a molding both for these cylinders and for the throw laws above.

202
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:21.700
This is confused scholars.
They don't know when to date this.

203
00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:25.780
Also because of these so called burrow characteristics where you see this

204
00:13:25.781 --> 00:13:29.680
undulating facade with the use of,
well,
they're not really,

205
00:13:29.681 --> 00:13:32.140
columns are more like cylinders and in that sense,

206
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.800
similar to the cylinders that we saw in the tomb of the baker,

207
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:40.990
these cylinders with the undulating,
the sod,
the use of architectural elements,

208
00:13:40.991 --> 00:13:44.500
the interest in deck declaration,
uh,
and,
uh,

209
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:48.160
the cylinders have have confused fellers as I said,

210
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:53.100
and they have been betwixt in between when to date this thing.
Uh,

211
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.740
and some have said that it dates at the time of the,
uh,

212
00:13:56.741 --> 00:14:01.210
of such buildings as the sanctuary of for two and a Prima Janie at Palestrina

213
00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:02.680
because of the opposite and carry them.

214
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.860
Others have said because of the use of brick here,
uh,

215
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.350
which we actually think in this case was stuccoed over,
uh,

216
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.270
that it might be later,
second century had.
Uh,
but I think,

217
00:14:13.271 --> 00:14:18.010
but this is actually more like the tile brick that we saw in Pompei,
uh,

218
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.560
rather than the kind of brick that we see in Ostia.

219
00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:24.970
So I favor the first century date for essentially for a century,
a d date,

220
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:29.710
but we have to think it is very proficient of what is to come experimenting as

221
00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:33.010
did some of those other buildings that I just showed you the forum transitory

222
00:14:33.011 --> 00:14:34.090
them,
for example,

223
00:14:34.091 --> 00:14:38.080
with the sort of thing that is going to become particularly popular in the

224
00:14:38.081 --> 00:14:42.570
second and third centuries.
A D.
Now I juxtapose this to,

225
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.870
and by the way,
this tomb,

226
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.580
the nickname of this to him as you can see from your monument list is La

227
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:52.610
[inaudible] Nokia lock a Nokia means the distaff and a distaff is used in

228
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:57.770
spinning and weaving.
Uh,
so a spinning thread primarily.

229
00:14:57.771 --> 00:15:02.410
So I,
and it looks like an ancient distaff.
Uh,
so some,
some soaks.

230
00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.930
That's when,
that's how it got its nickname.
Laca Nokia.

231
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:10.550
Whether that means that that was intended by the designers and that this was a

232
00:15:10.551 --> 00:15:14.020
tomb of a perhaps a woman,
uh,
who was,
you know,
or,

233
00:15:14.021 --> 00:15:18.860
or a man working in a factory who,
um,
who spun thread.

234
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.680
I think that's very far fetched.
I think it's highly unlikely,

235
00:15:21.681 --> 00:15:25.580
but I just throw it out there.
Uh,
but uh,
that is what its nickname is.

236
00:15:25.581 --> 00:15:29.630
But you can see by the juxtaposition of it with the tomb of the baker on the

237
00:15:29.631 --> 00:15:34.310
right and with the monument of the Julie and Savanah me in the south of France,

238
00:15:34.311 --> 00:15:37.040
which we haven't looked up at,
which we will look at a,

239
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:41.740
in a lecture next week on a Roman architecture in,

240
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.540
in the south of France primarily.
Uh,

241
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.650
you will see that it makes a reference to both of these,

242
00:15:48.651 --> 00:15:50.990
both of these earlier.
This is,
as you know,
Augusta,

243
00:15:50.991 --> 00:15:55.010
and the one on the left is from the late time of Julius Caesar.

244
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.290
And you can see that it takes elements,

245
00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:59.480
I'm not saying it looked at these in particular,

246
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.260
but just that these kinds of elements were already,
uh,
in,
in the air,
uh,

247
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.690
when this building was built in the light for a century and the great cylinders

248
00:16:08.691 --> 00:16:10.010
of the tumor of Rissa keys,

249
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.660
but it is more similar actually to this one because the jewelry he monument and

250
00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:19.580
also lock a Nokia are examples of what we call the tower tomb type.

251
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.480
The tower tomb type is taller than it is wide.

252
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.080
It has a series of stories in this case,
a plane story.

253
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.220
I then a central story with the cylinders and then the full loss at the top.

254
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.660
And we see the same sort of thing.
And the Juilliard Monument stepped base,
uh,

255
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.800
softball here with sculptural decoration,
a quadro fronds,

256
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.950
and then a thorough loss at the very apex.

257
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.050
But it's interesting to see the differences between the two,
uh,

258
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.730
because what we see in this monument,
again,

259
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.900
is much more what we would call a baroque in the sense that we have the

260
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.990
undulating facade.
We have the use of what looked like in,

261
00:16:57.991 --> 00:16:59.210
in a general way,

262
00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:03.950
the originally traditional vocabulary of architecture with these cylinders,

263
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.960
with the niches,
with the pediments.

264
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:08.120
But look at the way the thought of loss is treated.

265
00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:10.550
When you look at the thought of loss in the Julie Monument,

266
00:17:10.551 --> 00:17:14.900
you see that it really does look like a shrine and it has statues inside like a

267
00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:19.820
shrine would,
uh,
this one has blind windows,
as you can see,

268
00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:22.100
you can't see into it.
There's nothing inside.

269
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.820
So they're treating the thaw loss more as a decorative motif,

270
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.120
a than they are treating it as something that can have,

271
00:17:29.121 --> 00:17:32.030
that has the purpose of holding a,
some,

272
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:37.060
some either religious items or statues or honorific statues as it does in this

273
00:17:38.241 --> 00:17:42.500
particular case.
Another view of Lacan Nokia,
a detail,

274
00:17:42.501 --> 00:17:46.940
which I think shows you what I mean about a motion being,
uh,

275
00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:51.290
being introduced into monuments like this.
This,

276
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.230
in this case,
we are dealing with concrete and that is somewhat different.

277
00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:59.670
The use of concrete to create undulation,
then the use of,
uh,

278
00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:03.840
of the traditional vocabulary of architecture.
But here we see a combination,

279
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.050
the concrete wall faced with the opposite and care to him,

280
00:18:07.051 --> 00:18:10.560
the great cylinders on the edge.
Uh,
and then the,
uh,

281
00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.920
Idig Ula here with the pediment and the niche below.

282
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:18.930
And you can also see very well the cylinders that are located between the blind

283
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:23.710
windows as well as this combination of opus and care to him work.
And also,
uh,

284
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.370
the tile brick that is used to,
uh,

285
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.130
represent the moldings and the like.

286
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.550
I want to compare,
uh,

287
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:37.580
the central zone of Lacan oh Kia with a 17th century baroque building in Rome.

288
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:44.370
This is Francesco Borromini Sundt Evoh in Rome,
uh,

289
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.400
taken from an angle that accentuates the curvature of the facade and the

290
00:18:50.401 --> 00:18:55.401
contrast between the con cavity of that curvature and the convexity of the

291
00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.690
outside of the dome that you see up above the same sort of thing here.

292
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.160
So once again,

293
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:07.310
architects of the 17th century very much inspired by these.

294
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.071
Uh,
the,

295
00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:13.071
these kinds of motifs that survived from a Roman antiquity on the left hand side

296
00:19:14.311 --> 00:19:16.080
of the screen,
you'll all remember this,

297
00:19:16.081 --> 00:19:21.081
this is the elliptical fountain from the Palace of Demission on the Palatine

298
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.360
Hill that was located,

299
00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:28.710
that he could see through his window out of the trickling IOM when he dined.

300
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:29.461
And no,

301
00:19:29.461 --> 00:19:33.900
remember here also in this case made out of concrete construction designed by

302
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:39.080
areas you see the elliptical wall and the convexity of that elliptical wall,

303
00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.250
the central element also convex.
Uh,

304
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:47.160
but with these interesting a con cavities,
scallops,
uh,

305
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.370
that [inaudible] has created through concrete,

306
00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:54.710
faced with brick around the structure.
So in that case,
you know,

307
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.920
all I'm trying to do here is show you that you can create similar effects either

308
00:19:58.921 --> 00:20:02.190
in concrete or through columnar architecture.

309
00:20:02.191 --> 00:20:04.400
But what separates concrete con,

310
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:08.400
the revolutionary concrete architecture as we've discussed it today,

311
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.740
and Baroque architecture as I'm going to define it this morning,
uh,

312
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:16.380
is that in Baroque architecture,
they're relying on the traditional vote,

313
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:20.190
not on concrete,
but on the traditional vocabulary of architecture.

314
00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:24.000
Namely of course,
columns pediments and the like to create their effects.

315
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.520
And in a place where it all comes together,

316
00:20:26.521 --> 00:20:29.970
you'll recall is at Hadrian's villa at Tivoli.

317
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.600
We're looking here at the Piatsa,
Doro plan of the Piatsa,
Doro,

318
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:38.580
the octagonal vestibule,
the great open rectangular space that you can see here.

319
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.450
And then the hour law or the audience hall on the far right.

320
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.470
And you'll remember the Allah had these wonderful undulating walls.

321
00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:50.380
But what separated the outflow from other undulating walls that we had seen

322
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:54.130
earlier is that it was not done with concrete,
uh,

323
00:20:54.131 --> 00:20:55.750
but was done with columns.

324
00:20:55.751 --> 00:21:00.370
You'll remember the columns were placed in such a way that they followed the

325
00:21:00.371 --> 00:21:04.510
curved shape,
uh,
and then they supported a concrete dome.

326
00:21:04.511 --> 00:21:08.980
So this wonderful combination of the use of traditional language of architecture

327
00:21:08.981 --> 00:21:11.840
along and undulating form.
Uh,

328
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:16.750
and then with the concrete at the top so we can see already in the Adriatic

329
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.690
period,
further exploration of this kind of thing.

330
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:25.330
I also want to show you a very interesting painting,
painted a room.

331
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:30.380
And this is in the house of the labyrinth at palm pay.
It's early in date,

332
00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:34.450
dates to 50 BC,
but it's an extraordinary room.

333
00:21:34.451 --> 00:21:35.950
It's the atrium of the house.

334
00:21:35.951 --> 00:21:39.130
And we talked about several different kinds of atria.

335
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:43.010
We talked about the atrium that had a no columns at all.
Uh,

336
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.850
and we talked about the tech style atrium,

337
00:21:45.851 --> 00:21:49.000
which had four columns around the central basin.

338
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:54.330
What you see here are a host of columns surrounding that central base.

339
00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:58.270
And then when you have a number of columns like this,
more than four a,

340
00:21:58.271 --> 00:22:02.920
we call it a,
um,
a,
a Corinthian atrium,

341
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.590
a Corinthian atrium with lots of columns.

342
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:10.630
And what you can see the artist and patron have done here is to orchestrate the

343
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:15.631
relationship of those real columns with the fictive architecture that is painted

344
00:22:15.761 --> 00:22:19.000
on the wall and to play them up in such a way that is,

345
00:22:19.001 --> 00:22:23.300
you're standing in the room,
you are,
you are looking through the real columns,
uh,

346
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.800
to see this view that lies behind of Othello loss,

347
00:22:26.801 --> 00:22:29.890
which you can view through the broken triangular pediments.

348
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.320
I show it to you for a couple of reasons.
One,

349
00:22:32.321 --> 00:22:36.610
just to remind you that we saw this kind of thing in painting very early on.

350
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:40.930
This is again,
50 BC in the republic steel.
As we,

351
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:45.990
as we see the architects taking the traditional vocabulary of architecture and

352
00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:49.150
playing with it,
breaking it up,
opening it,
uh,

353
00:22:49.151 --> 00:22:53.260
and revealing something that lies behind,
in this case,
the throw loss.

354
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:57.790
But look also at the way in which the throw loss looks like it's in the
distance.

355
00:22:57.791 --> 00:23:01.150
You get the sense that you are looking through an opening in the wall,

356
00:23:01.151 --> 00:23:03.900
a window in which you can see that though loss.

357
00:23:03.901 --> 00:23:07.300
It seems to lie behind the broken triangular pediment.

358
00:23:07.301 --> 00:23:11.980
The pediment has been broken open to allow you to see a vista that lies behind.

359
00:23:11.981 --> 00:23:14.200
And you get the sense as you look at this painting,

360
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:18.190
that the throw loss is surrounded by a peristyle and that there's also some

361
00:23:18.191 --> 00:23:20.770
greenery.
And so,
so on out there.

362
00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:24.340
And then to accentuate this idea of the view through the wall,

363
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:28.490
they have then added the columns here so that you're looking through the car,

364
00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:29.650
through real columns,

365
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.970
to fictive columns to broken triangular pediment to the thought of loss,
uh,

366
00:23:33.971 --> 00:23:38.470
that lies behind.
You'll see the relevance of this.

367
00:23:38.471 --> 00:23:42.580
When we look at some additional monuments.
I want to move.

368
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.370
I want to now go east,
uh,

369
00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.890
to look at some of the most spectacular examples that survive,

370
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:54.050
uh,
what we are calling a baroque architecture in Roman antiquity today.

371
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.730
And I want to begin in a site that is,
that is,

372
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.600
that is in modern Jordan.

373
00:23:59.601 --> 00:24:03.560
I'm showing you a map of the eastern Roman empire.
Uh,

374
00:24:03.561 --> 00:24:07.100
and we see the site in question Piedra or some say Petra.

375
00:24:07.101 --> 00:24:11.590
You can call it either one pietra or Petra.
You see Pietra over here,
uh,

376
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.990
which is in,
uh,
Jordan today.
Uh,

377
00:24:14.991 --> 00:24:18.680
and you can see its relationship to the Red Sea,
to Egypt,

378
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:23.990
to Alexandria,
uh,
to uh,
Yudaya modern Israel,
uh,

379
00:24:23.991 --> 00:24:26.660
and to some of these other sites.
One,
in fact,

380
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:31.000
a couple of others that we'll look at Baalbek today.
And the site of Jerica,

381
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:34.580
which is where that Oval Piatsa or forum comes from.

382
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:40.300
Here's another map of Peatra just to show you where it is located today within

383
00:24:41.031 --> 00:24:45.170
Jordan,
its relationship to Amman and to the ancient side of Gera sets.

384
00:24:45.171 --> 00:24:46.490
You can see up at the bottom,

385
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:51.820
a fairly close to the Israeli border as you can see,

386
00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:54.200
as well as to Alcapa down below.

387
00:24:55.490 --> 00:25:00.230
Just to get you in the mood for Peatra.
Uh,
we are walking here,

388
00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:04.940
there are incredible cliffs,
uh,
here as well as desert credible cliffs.

389
00:25:04.941 --> 00:25:09.230
And we're walking here through what is known as the Sikh in Petra.

390
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:14.700
And I want to mention that this is one of those interesting provinces where,
uh,

391
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:18.890
in order to understand the architecture that was built during the Roman period,

392
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:22.970
you have to have a sense of the local customs of what happened to you before the

393
00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:25.880
buildings that were built prior to the Roman period.

394
00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:30.320
And we know that the so called Nabateans,
n a,
B,

395
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.760
a t nabet and a B a,
t,
t,

396
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:38.780
a,
e a,
n,
s,
Nabataeans,
uh,

397
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.800
live to your inhabited this part of the world before the Romans got there.

398
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.370
And we know that the Nabataeans built architecture and that they build

399
00:25:46.371 --> 00:25:50.820
architecture primarily out of the stone of the cliffs,
uh,

400
00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.240
and also out of mud.
Uh,

401
00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:57.080
and one can imagine the kinds of things that you see here.

402
00:25:57.081 --> 00:26:01.550
The Rock cut tombs already begun during the NAB T in period.

403
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:06.470
And it's interesting if you look very closely at some of the detailed decoration

404
00:26:06.471 --> 00:26:07.261
here.
Uh,

405
00:26:07.261 --> 00:26:10.670
you can see something that any of you who wrote your paper on the temple of bell

406
00:26:10.671 --> 00:26:13.820
at Pal Myra,
remember the sort of stepped,
uh,

407
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.470
the step of motif decoration.
We see the same sort of thing here,

408
00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:22.100
but just important for you to know that the Nabataeans were building with stone

409
00:26:22.101 --> 00:26:25.460
and with,
uh,
with mud before the Roman period.

410
00:26:25.461 --> 00:26:29.060
And so when the Romans came in and began to build their own architecture,

411
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:34.140
obviously the impact of what had been built there earlier had,
uh,

412
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.080
made an impression on them.

413
00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:41.860
They too decided to build their tombs out of the living rock of Petra.

414
00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:48.320
And they are among the most spectacular and unusual tombs that survived from the

415
00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:52.260
Roman period.
And I want to show two of them to you today.

416
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.970
The so called day or d I r and the so called [inaudible],
k.

417
00:26:56.971 --> 00:27:01.830
H.
A.
Z.
E.
N.
E.
We will look at both of them with the day year first.

418
00:27:01.831 --> 00:27:06.270
And if you look at the day year and the way that in which it has been created,

419
00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:09.360
by carving it out of the living rock,

420
00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:14.400
you should not only be impressed,
uh,
but you should say to yourself,
wow,

421
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:19.580
this is Roman facade is at its greatest at its most obvious as well.

422
00:27:20.521 --> 00:27:24.690
This is really Roman facade ism because all there is is the facade.

423
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:29.430
There's nothing else.
The tomb itself is located inside the rock.

424
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.470
The tomb chambers are inside the rock.

425
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:35.850
They didn't do anything to them except hollow them out,
nothing much else there.

426
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.300
They've concentrated all of their efforts on the facade,

427
00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.590
which seems to grow out of the rock almost as if by nature.

428
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.940
And if you look at,
uh,
at,
at this tomb,
the day year,

429
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:52.950
you should also be struck immediately by the way in which,
uh,

430
00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:58.010
what the Romans have created here is a version and built architecture of what we

431
00:27:58.711 --> 00:28:03.711
saw already in 60 to 50 BC in second style Roman wall painting.

432
00:28:04.831 --> 00:28:07.500
It is exactly the same kind of thing.

433
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:12.770
This idea of breaking a triangular pediment open to reveal a full loss,

434
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:18.270
uh,
that lies inside,
uh,
in,
in this case.
On a second story,

435
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:22.950
we see all of the elements that I've already mentioned or most of the other

436
00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:24.480
elements that I've already mentioned.

437
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:29.190
We see here in this facade the use of the traditional vocabulary of

438
00:28:29.191 --> 00:28:32.010
architecture,
the columns,
uh,

439
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.040
the tablature above,
uh,

440
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:39.930
and we and pediments and so on down here,
triangular pediments down here.

441
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:45.080
We see all of those but used in a way that the Greeks would never have done.
Uh,

442
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.520
and we see we see less than this one.

443
00:28:47.521 --> 00:28:51.150
I'll show you better examples of this interest in over ornamentation.

444
00:28:51.151 --> 00:28:54.000
There is ornamentation here,
but it's actually fairly simple.

445
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:58.410
So this one doesn't partake of that as much as other others that I can show you,

446
00:28:58.790 --> 00:28:59.430
uh,
but it,

447
00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:03.900
but it does definitely by using the traditional vocabulary of architecture,

448
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:09.080
the surface is enlivened by creating elements that project look at these columns

449
00:29:09.541 --> 00:29:13.950
on either side with their projecting and tablatures standing alone or more

450
00:29:13.951 --> 00:29:17.070
pilasters and columns.
In this case,
standing alone,

451
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:21.690
projecting or receiving bay,
a projecting bay or receiving bay,
a Projecting Bay,

452
00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:22.230
uh,

453
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:27.230
instilling motion across this surface by means of the traditional vocabulary of

454
00:29:28.381 --> 00:29:32.310
architecture.
Again in this case on two levels.

455
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:38.510
Here's another view of the facade of the day year on the lefthand side of the

456
00:29:39.241 --> 00:29:42.730
screen and you can see the material used is obviously the rock itself.

457
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.840
This has been literally carved out of the living rock so that it's obviously the

458
00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:50.990
same stone and the same color as the rock.
That's still a,

459
00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:55.960
that still serves as its backdrop.
And then over here the house of the labyrinth.

460
00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:58.590
Again just to show you again the close,

461
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:03.800
the close resemblance of this sort of thing in the mid second century.

462
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.250
Aidy in what is now Jordan,
uh,

463
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:10.780
two second style Roman wall painting.

464
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:15.810
And I show you again the throw laws within the broken triangular pediment but

465
00:30:16.301 --> 00:30:19.840
the main difference between the two and here is where we do get into this whole

466
00:30:19.841 --> 00:30:22.630
concept of decoration and even over decoration.

467
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:26.440
The main difference between the two is when you're standing again in the house

468
00:30:26.441 --> 00:30:27.274
of the labyrinth,

469
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:32.520
looking through the actual columns toward the painting and you see that the,

470
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:35.860
the triangular pediment has been broken to reveal the laws.

471
00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:37.240
As I mentioned before,

472
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.810
you still have a sense of space and you still have a sense of reality.

473
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.510
Even though the pediment has been broken,
you seem to be,

474
00:30:43.511 --> 00:30:47.260
you are looking at Athol loss and you're meant to think that that throw laws

475
00:30:47.261 --> 00:30:52.261
lies inside a peristyle corridor or a garden that is outside the house that

476
00:30:53.141 --> 00:30:56.580
you're seeing through a window.
So you read the full laws,

477
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:59.980
or at least I read the thought of loss as further back than the broken

478
00:30:59.981 --> 00:31:04.720
triangular pediment that is entirely different here.
Yes,
there's a thought loss.

479
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:05.081
Yes,

480
00:31:05.081 --> 00:31:10.081
there's a broken triangular pediment but the throw loss has been turned into a

481
00:31:10.241 --> 00:31:14.170
decorative motif among many.
Uh,
it is a thorough loss,
yes,

482
00:31:14.171 --> 00:31:16.810
but it doesn't look like a working throw law,
so to speak.

483
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.920
You can see that it has a niche in the center of it.

484
00:31:19.921 --> 00:31:24.921
Just like the other bays have niches that probably held a statue,

485
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.350
but you don't have a sense that there is any space in there.
Uh,
it is,

486
00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.720
it is a decoration on the surface,

487
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.540
on the facade of this structure,

488
00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.150
just like all the other decorations.

489
00:31:37.151 --> 00:31:41.290
And that is a major difference between the way in which the [inaudible] is used

490
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:46.360
in the day year and the throw loss is used in typical second style Roman wall

491
00:31:46.361 --> 00:31:47.194
painting.

492
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.430
You may also have noticed some of the decoration and I'm going to show you some

493
00:31:51.431 --> 00:31:54.640
details now so that we can look at those together.

494
00:31:54.641 --> 00:31:59.530
Here you get a very good sense of the color of the stone,
of the rocks of Peatra.

495
00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:04.360
Uh,
but you also see here at Capitol that is unlike any capital that we have seen

496
00:32:04.361 --> 00:32:08.440
before.
And this is where we see the influence of the Nabataeans.

497
00:32:08.441 --> 00:32:12.370
The Nabataeans were building buildings that had capitals that look like this

498
00:32:12.371 --> 00:32:17.110
sort of interesting undulating capitols,
but very plain plain with a,
with a,

499
00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.730
a con concave side,
uh,
and then a kind of Knob in the center.

500
00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:22.840
As you can see here,

501
00:32:22.841 --> 00:32:27.841
these are navety and capitals and in this mid second century Aidy tomb,

502
00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:32.620
you can see that they are looking,
they're clearly looking at models from Rome.

503
00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.540
Uh,
they are clearly looking at the kinds of paintings that I have already,

504
00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:41.370
uh,
reminded you of,
but at the same time or,

505
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:45.770
or let's say drawings made from those paintings that are circulated or the

506
00:32:45.771 --> 00:32:50.270
architects may have access to,
but they are combined with local elements.

507
00:32:50.271 --> 00:32:52.220
In this case,
the Nabataeans capitals.

508
00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.830
And then if you look at this detail over here,

509
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.880
you will see that they've used a kind of triglyceride and Mehta piece system

510
00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:00.200
with the panels.

511
00:33:00.201 --> 00:33:04.880
And then the triple strided bands that we saw was characteristic of Greek doric

512
00:33:04.881 --> 00:33:08.070
architecture that's used here.
But look at what's in the metal piece.

513
00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:12.860
We don't see anything like this in Greek or Roman architecture or the metaphors.

514
00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:17.390
In fact,
in Greek architecture usually filled with figural scenes,
figural panels.

515
00:33:17.391 --> 00:33:22.340
But here we see these large discs and a disc and each one of these,

516
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.110
uh,
of these square panels,
these are navety and discs,

517
00:33:27.111 --> 00:33:30.920
they are used in earlier Nabataeans architecture.
So,
once again,

518
00:33:30.921 --> 00:33:35.921
this very interesting and very fruitful coming together of nab a t and elements

519
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:37.040
and,
um,

520
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:41.360
Roman elements in this extraordinary tomb of the mid second century.

521
00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.210
And then I show you on the lefthand side of the screen,

522
00:33:44.211 --> 00:33:47.600
the finial that caps the thought loss,
uh,
and an a,

523
00:33:47.601 --> 00:33:51.770
a fellow sitting over here at the base of the finial is very helpful to us

524
00:33:51.771 --> 00:33:54.410
because he gives us a sense of human scale.

525
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.600
This is this Mandi small compared to the finial.

526
00:33:57.601 --> 00:34:01.820
So you can imagine how small he is in relationship to the tomb as a whole.

527
00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:05.570
So once again,
bitter bigger is better reign supreme,
uh,

528
00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.080
in Jordan as it did in Rome,
uh,

529
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:12.980
where we can see that the Romans are building very large,
uh,

530
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.220
in the second century.
If we look at this finial here,

531
00:34:16.221 --> 00:34:17.990
this decoration at the apex,

532
00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:23.120
we see that they have used one of these Nabataeans capital's a again here and

533
00:34:23.121 --> 00:34:27.530
that that supports a kind of fat of vase on the top with a,

534
00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:32.080
with a top on it,
uh,
and that,
that you see that sort of thing in,

535
00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:36.430
in Roman art.
Uh,
you see it sometimes in the second style Roman wall paintings,

536
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:41.500
probably a Greco Roman motif that has been combined with the nabbit t and

537
00:34:42.441 --> 00:34:43.670
capital here.
Uh,

538
00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:47.000
and you can also see from looking at this as well as a tomb as a whole,

539
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:51.980
that the architect is really treating these buildings almost more as sculpture,

540
00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:56.090
then his architecture molding them in a way that a sculptor might,
uh,

541
00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:00.020
and that's not so different from what we saw were Iberia's for example,
doing,
uh,

542
00:35:00.021 --> 00:35:01.070
in his,
uh,

543
00:35:01.071 --> 00:35:06.071
octagonal room and in the fountain at the Palace on the Palatine Hill here

544
00:35:06.471 --> 00:35:10.000
again,
Borromini Francesco Borromini,
Santiko,
uh,

545
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.990
the upper most part of that,
just to show you again,
the kind of these are,

546
00:35:13.991 --> 00:35:18.290
and by no means,
you know,
there's no exact relationship between these two at all.

547
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:20.420
And this one has different features than that.

548
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:25.340
But just to show you that it's this kind of thing that unquestionably inspires

549
00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:29.850
architects like Barmini in the 17th century,
in Italy,
uh,

550
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:33.290
to create the kind of,
of,
um,
of,

551
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:38.250
of lanterns and so on.
But they do a for the,
that they design.

552
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:43.170
Here's another interesting comparisons is a wonderful view of the day,

553
00:35:43.171 --> 00:35:45.390
year in Pietra,
which shows you,

554
00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:50.391
I guess best of all the way in which it is carved out of and still embedded into

555
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.080
the rock,
uh,
of Peatra itself.
Magnificent.

556
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.620
And I compare it here too to another Borromini church.

557
00:35:58.621 --> 00:36:03.440
This is the famous church of San Carlo.
All a Quattro Fontana,
uh,

558
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:07.990
most,
most better known his son Carlino with a little Sun Carlo.

559
00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:12.360
So on Carlino as you see here and you see what Borromini has done,

560
00:36:12.361 --> 00:36:14.610
he has an undulating facade.

561
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:18.900
He's using the traditional vocabulary of architecture just like these architects

562
00:36:18.901 --> 00:36:19.261
are,

563
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:24.261
these nameless architects are the columns and the tablature is and the pediments

564
00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:29.150
and so on and so forth.
He's using all of those here even as a full loss,
uh,

565
00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:33.120
in the second and the upper story right there.
Uh,

566
00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.550
but he is used any is,

567
00:36:34.551 --> 00:36:38.580
and he is also very taken with the whole idea of the have an actual undulating

568
00:36:38.581 --> 00:36:42.310
wall as you can see also in this view.
Uh,

569
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:46.830
but he is doing the same sort of thing,
uh,
that we see architects doing here.

570
00:36:46.831 --> 00:36:51.270
And I don't think there's any question that the sort of building that we see on

571
00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:56.040
the right,
the day year,
uh,
was,
had impact on architects in the 17th century.

572
00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:59.580
We know that some of them traveled to this part of the world.

573
00:36:59.581 --> 00:37:02.520
We know that drawings were made,
that books were made,

574
00:37:02.521 --> 00:37:06.720
that these were brought back and these were seen by people in Rome in the 17th

575
00:37:06.721 --> 00:37:10.550
century.
And of course they had local things to see as well in Italy.
Uh,

576
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:14.670
and that they were influenced by what they saw.
The other rock cut tomb,

577
00:37:14.671 --> 00:37:17.850
the other very impressive raw there,
many of them in pizza.

578
00:37:17.851 --> 00:37:21.990
I'm only showing you two out of a fairly nice variety.
Uh,

579
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.580
but I want to show you the other most famous one,
the cause nay in um,

580
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:31.110
in uh,
Peatra also dates to the mid second century.

581
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:36.120
A D once again carved out of the living rock.
Once again,

582
00:37:36.121 --> 00:37:40.090
pure facade ism.
This is nothing more than a facade.
A,

583
00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:44.850
you can see,
uh,
how um,
in this case,
once again,
second,

584
00:37:44.851 --> 00:37:46.090
two storied,
very,

585
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:51.200
very similar scheme to what we saw at the day or two stories with a temple front

586
00:37:51.241 --> 00:37:53.700
down below and a full loss above.

587
00:37:53.701 --> 00:37:58.650
It is revealed by the splitting of the triangular pediment.
As you can see.

588
00:37:58.651 --> 00:38:03.510
Well,
uh,
once again,
the full loss definitely treated as a decorative motif.

589
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:06.000
Yes,
in this case it has a statue on a base,

590
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.270
but a statue on a base that is not a real statue on a base,

591
00:38:09.271 --> 00:38:13.080
but a statue on a base that is carved onto the,
uh,

592
00:38:13.081 --> 00:38:15.600
onto the stone.
So once again,

593
00:38:15.601 --> 00:38:19.740
we get a sense that this is a decorative motif rather than an actual statue

594
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.240
standing in the thought of loss.

595
00:38:21.241 --> 00:38:25.200
And the same for the items on the basis on either side,

596
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:27.720
you can see the triangular pediment very well.

597
00:38:27.721 --> 00:38:31.860
You can see the way it has been split aside to reveal the thaw loss.

598
00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:35.100
You can see down below a real temple front.
In this case,

599
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.740
one is much closer to its Roman,
uh,

600
00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:42.610
prototypes in the sense that even the decorative motifs are Roman,

601
00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:45.970
unlike in the day year where we saw the Nabataeans capitals and the discs.

602
00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.890
Here we see actual,
uh,

603
00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:52.240
versions of the Corinthian order use the Corinthian order used here.

604
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:56.710
This looks very much like a real temple front with an actual pediment sculptural

605
00:38:56.711 --> 00:39:00.880
decoration of freeze as well.
We're beginning to see in this one,

606
00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:04.240
not only the use of the traditional vocabulary of architecture,

607
00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:06.580
not only the enlivening of the surface,

608
00:39:06.581 --> 00:39:10.750
using that traditional vocabulary of architecture through these,

609
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:15.430
through in such a way that it creates motion projection,
recession,

610
00:39:15.431 --> 00:39:17.590
projection,
recession.
Uh,
but,

611
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.250
but we also are seeing here in a way that we did not end the day year,

612
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:25.000
this interest in excess ornamentation.

613
00:39:25.001 --> 00:39:29.620
Ornamenting every service that you possibly can,
uh,
with sculptural freezes,

614
00:39:29.621 --> 00:39:31.750
with Pedimento sculpture,
with,
uh,

615
00:39:31.751 --> 00:39:36.520
with statuary carved into the stone in all of the niches.

616
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:38.160
Uh,
and,
but then again,

617
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:42.820
much closer relationship to earlier Roman precedents by the temple front,

618
00:39:42.821 --> 00:39:47.440
by the use of the Corinthian order.
Uh,
but this one to a very similar,

619
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.280
a finial at the top of the throw loss,
uh,

620
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.320
but using a kind of Corinthian capital with one of those vases on top vases by

621
00:39:55.871 --> 00:39:59.500
the way,
that we often see in second style Roman wall painting.

622
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:04.660
Once again,
one could come up with a lot of comparisons for the cause,

623
00:40:04.661 --> 00:40:06.250
nay with monuments,

624
00:40:06.251 --> 00:40:10.000
with the 17th century Baroque buildings in Rome.

625
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:11.680
This may not be the best,

626
00:40:11.681 --> 00:40:15.100
but it's one of my favorites and I decided to show it in this context,

627
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:18.750
but it's the Church of Santa Maria is written to the Piazza Navona Santa Maria

628
00:40:18.751 --> 00:40:23.560
del a Paci designed by Pietro.
Dot.
Tortona same sort of idea,

629
00:40:23.561 --> 00:40:25.510
you know the temple front down below.
Yes,

630
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:29.290
this is a different kind of temple front cause it's around temple and not one

631
00:40:29.291 --> 00:40:33.100
with a pediment,
but the same general idea of having a temple front below.

632
00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:37.630
And then a second story above all of this enlivened with a traditional

633
00:40:37.631 --> 00:40:40.330
vocabulary of architecture columns,
columns,

634
00:40:40.331 --> 00:40:44.410
pilasters a window in the niche right up there.
Very interesting.

635
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:48.250
A segmental pediment inside of triangular pediment.
Uh,

636
00:40:48.251 --> 00:40:53.170
just to show you that this kind of experimentation that we see in 17th century

637
00:40:53.171 --> 00:40:57.490
Baroque architecture mostly in church building,
but also in palaces,
uh,

638
00:40:57.491 --> 00:41:02.380
is so clearly,
uh,
so clearly inspired,
let's say,

639
00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:06.610
uh,
by the,
uh,
Baroque architecture of Roman antiquity.

640
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:09.680
Couple of more details here.
Here's a wonderful view,
uh,

641
00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:14.020
from down below showing you the throw loss of the cause,

642
00:41:14.021 --> 00:41:18.230
nay at Peatra,
uh,
and comparing it to once again,
uh,

643
00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:23.370
some of the confections of baroque architects in Rome of the 17th century,

644
00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:28.870
namely Sonde Evo,
again,
uh,
with its curved facade and,

645
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:33.320
um,
and,
and wonderful,
uh,
eight sided dome,
uh,

646
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:37.880
and some of the interior decoration also have sand ebo above

647
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:44.450
staying on the,
staying in the eastern empire.
Uh,
I want to go now to,

648
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:49.790
uh,
to ancient Asia minor to two sites on the coast,

649
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.880
on the western coast of what is now Turkey Ephesus and my leaders emphasis in my

650
00:41:57.021 --> 00:41:58.760
leaders.
And I want to begin,
uh,

651
00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:02.840
in Ephesus to show you one building there of considerable interest,

652
00:42:02.841 --> 00:42:06.950
I think in terms of its relationships to Rome.

653
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:11.170
Uh,
it is the temple of Hadrian,
so called,
uh,

654
00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:15.770
that dates to around one 20 to 138 D in Ephesus.

655
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:18.160
We know Hadrian visited emphasis.
Uh,

656
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:23.030
we know that those who lived there wanted to honor him by building a temple a to

657
00:42:23.031 --> 00:42:27.290
him,
it's actually more a shrine than a temple.
This is not a bigger is better.

658
00:42:27.291 --> 00:42:30.080
This is actually a fairly small structure,
as I said,

659
00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:34.490
Morris shrine than it is a temple.
It's a kind of street side,
a temple.

660
00:42:34.491 --> 00:42:36.670
You're walking along the street and then they're there.

661
00:42:36.671 --> 00:42:38.240
They're all of a sudden it is.

662
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:43.450
But what's interesting about it is the fact that it makes use of the RQ weighted

663
00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:47.150
lintel as you can see here,
straight and curved,

664
00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:51.110
just as we saw it used at the Canopius at Hadrian's villa.

665
00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:54.290
So a motif that we see in Italy,
uh,

666
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:58.910
being used also in Asia minor for a nother Hadrian Anik building.

667
00:42:58.911 --> 00:43:03.911
So it's becoming associated in the minds of designers with Hadrian himself.

668
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:09.450
So traditional vocabulary of architecture,
but,
but,
uh,
used in a,

669
00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.040
in a different way by using the straight and RQ weighted lintel together.

670
00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:17.180
This is a very good example of this interest in over ornamentation.

671
00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.120
Every single square inch,
uh,
of,
of,
of,
of,

672
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:26.180
of is used by the architects,
uh,
to decorate as you can see,

673
00:43:26.181 --> 00:43:30.360
the architrave,
uh,
and also the lintel and the back.
Uh,

674
00:43:30.361 --> 00:43:33.140
and the pilasters and the back.
All of them,
uh,

675
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:36.460
decorated to the point where the decoration,
uh,

676
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:40.340
almost dematerializes the architectural members.

677
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:45.590
Another detail where I think you can see that particularly well here on the

678
00:43:45.591 --> 00:43:50.270
right,
this dematerialization of the architectural members through sculpture.

679
00:43:50.271 --> 00:43:52.200
And you'll remember this same,
uh,

680
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:57.360
the same approach in the Severen basilica in leftist Maga.
Uh,

681
00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:01.970
this is a detail of the peers that we believe were added during the time of

682
00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:05.510
Caracalla.
So round two,
16,
[inaudible],
uh,

683
00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.240
obviously much later in date,

684
00:44:08.241 --> 00:44:12.230
but we see already here this interest in this sort of thing that's going to

685
00:44:12.231 --> 00:44:14.780
culminate at places like Leptin.

686
00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:19.360
And also just to make the point that this same use of the straight and RQ

687
00:44:19.361 --> 00:44:24.361
weighted lintel that we see in Adrianic architecture turns up also in 17th

688
00:44:24.921 --> 00:44:26.240
century Baroque Rome.

689
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:30.860
I show you the interior of Sun Carlino here where you can see again the strait

690
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:35.550
and RQ weighted lintels combined.
So clearly 17th century Baroque architects.

691
00:44:35.551 --> 00:44:38.550
Looking back at Roman [inaudible] examples,

692
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:42.240
I want to show you briefly a gate at my elitists.

693
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:45.330
Also as you saw in ancient Asian minor,

694
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:50.750
it's the gate to the South Agora or marketplace of my leaders and a dates to

695
00:44:52.171 --> 00:44:56.910
around a d two,
160.
It is no longer in my leaders.

696
00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:01.400
It was moved,
uh,
some years ago as antiquities sometimes are,
uh,

697
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:05.250
from its country of origin to Germany.
It's now can be seen.

698
00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:07.000
The museum in Berlin,
uh,

699
00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:11.880
they also have a great model in Berlin that shows you the relationship of the

700
00:45:11.881 --> 00:45:16.880
gate to the rest of the Roman city and you can see the gate way up there and

701
00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:20.640
incredible showpiece for the city.
This gate,

702
00:45:20.641 --> 00:45:23.430
that end that allowed one to enter into the South Agora.

703
00:45:23.431 --> 00:45:27.780
I show it to you as reconstructed in the museum in Berlin.

704
00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:30.300
It is quite an impressive piece.

705
00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:34.710
You can see here it is that it is a gate and it shows that you can apply these

706
00:45:34.711 --> 00:45:38.070
baroque facades to just about any kind of architecture.

707
00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:43.020
You see that the gate has a triple opening down below three blind windows.

708
00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:46.440
Uh,
on top.
It is made entirely out of stone.

709
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:51.090
It uses the traditional vocabulary of architecture,
uh,

710
00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:56.070
columns and capitals.
You can see the capitols in this case are uh,
seem to be um,

711
00:45:56.490 --> 00:46:00.150
composite capitals and it is very much the theater,

712
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:05.180
the theater skein I fronds idea with a series of projecting elements on top of

713
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:09.840
two columns with wings on either side.

714
00:46:09.841 --> 00:46:13.320
Also projecting down below the lintels are straight,

715
00:46:13.321 --> 00:46:18.321
but up above they have combined full triangular pediments in the wings with a

716
00:46:18.961 --> 00:46:21.480
broken triangular pediment in the center.

717
00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:25.380
And the broken triangular pediment is in the center is particularly interesting

718
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:29.100
because you can see the two sides left and right up above.

719
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:33.150
But you can also see that they've included the center of the pediment,

720
00:46:33.151 --> 00:46:37.640
but in a plane that is further back,
so you get this kind of zigzag,

721
00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:42.000
a motif where you begin,
the pediment begins in the front,
uh,

722
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:46.720
front zone,
and then Zig zags to the backs zone,
uh,
which,

723
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.420
which injects even further,

724
00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:52.890
even a greater motion into the overall scheme.
Once again,

725
00:46:52.891 --> 00:46:55.620
we see the projection,
that recession projection recession,

726
00:46:55.860 --> 00:47:00.810
all using the traditional vocabulary of architecture.

727
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:06.330
It's interesting to compare this to a much earlier gate in Greece.

728
00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.100
I show you the proper Aleya,

729
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:12.930
the gateway to the Athenian Acropolis Fifth Century BC where you can see it's

730
00:47:12.931 --> 00:47:15.730
all function.
They've used the doric order here,
uh,

731
00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:20.220
and the columns support the roof above try glyphs and Mehta piece.

732
00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:22.800
The whole idea.
I mean,
it's very beautiful.
Uh,

733
00:47:22.801 --> 00:47:27.420
but the whole idea is to use these columns functionally very different in this

734
00:47:27.421 --> 00:47:31.000
gate,
uh,
in my latest in the second century,

735
00:47:31.001 --> 00:47:35.470
a d out where you can see that the columns are no longer used for structural

736
00:47:35.471 --> 00:47:36.304
purposes,

737
00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:41.340
but mainly to decorate and to enliven and to add motion to the structure.

738
00:47:41.921 --> 00:47:46.750
In a way that is entirely out of keeping with these important Greek precedents.

739
00:47:46.751 --> 00:47:51.670
Here you see a detail,
uh,
some tourists,
uh,
looking at the,
uh,

740
00:47:51.671 --> 00:47:54.970
at this and other things in the museum in Berlin,
which gives you,
again,

741
00:47:54.971 --> 00:47:58.030
a sense of the colossal scale of this structure.

742
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.350
Here you can see also very well,
uh,

743
00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.990
the composite capitals as well as once again,
this interest in,
uh,

744
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.670
an almost overly decorative surface that is so characteristic of baroque

745
00:48:09.671 --> 00:48:10.510
architecture.

746
00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:16.290
A number of you embarked on the library of Calcis as your paper topics,

747
00:48:16.301 --> 00:48:19.750
so I'm sure you know everything there is to know about that,

748
00:48:19.751 --> 00:48:24.430
but I want to show it to you quickly in the context of this lecture because it's

749
00:48:24.431 --> 00:48:27.520
an important monument for all of you to be aware of.
Less.

750
00:48:27.521 --> 00:48:30.370
Do think that it has always looked the way it looks.
Now,

751
00:48:30.371 --> 00:48:35.371
I show you a view that was taken well by now 25 years ago or so,

752
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:39.880
uh,
before the building was redirected a,

753
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.410
which it has been since that the building,
this is,

754
00:48:43.411 --> 00:48:48.400
this is what the library of Kelsey's looked like a 25 or so years ago.

755
00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:53.200
Uh,
and,
but fortunately,
even though everything had fallen down,
it was all there.

756
00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.900
As you can see,
there were fragments strewn everywhere,

757
00:48:55.901 --> 00:49:00.901
hundreds and hundreds of fragments strewn around the site and enough fragments

758
00:49:01.871 --> 00:49:02.830
so that the,

759
00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:07.300
basically the building was there and what they eventually decided to do was use

760
00:49:07.301 --> 00:49:08.920
those fragments to redirect it,

761
00:49:08.921 --> 00:49:12.610
which took a number of years and the results have been truly spectacular.

762
00:49:12.611 --> 00:49:17.020
I show you a view,
uh,
of emphasis as it looks today,

763
00:49:17.021 --> 00:49:21.910
looking back toward the rear erected library of Kelsey's and then a better view

764
00:49:21.911 --> 00:49:24.670
here where you can see what all of those pieces,

765
00:49:24.671 --> 00:49:29.120
the giant jigsaw puzzle that all of those pieces ultimately made a,

766
00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:33.100
you can see here this incredible facade of the,
uh,

767
00:49:33.101 --> 00:49:35.260
of the library of Kelsey's in emphasis.

768
00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:40.060
And you can see the scheme is the same as I just showed you in the South Agora

769
00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:44.660
market gate at my lead us in this case to tears.
Uh,

770
00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.430
the bottom tiers,
very similar to what we saw there.

771
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:52.150
Just two columns supporting a straight A and tablature above.

772
00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.040
And then in the second story,

773
00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:59.050
the addition of more decorative elements with segmental to segmental pediments

774
00:49:59.051 --> 00:50:04.051
flanking a rectangular one in the center with separate individual columns at

775
00:50:05.351 --> 00:50:08.620
either end,
like we saw on the day year,
uh,
with supporting,

776
00:50:08.621 --> 00:50:11.410
projecting and tablature,
uh,
once again,

777
00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:15.880
using the traditional vocabulary of architecture to create motion across the

778
00:50:15.881 --> 00:50:20.440
service projection,
recession,
projection,
recession.
Uh,
and,
but here,

779
00:50:20.441 --> 00:50:24.820
one very interesting feature is that if you look at the second story and the

780
00:50:24.821 --> 00:50:29.150
placement of those second story on top of those below,

781
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:34.070
you can see that the ones at the top are not directly above the ones at the

782
00:50:34.071 --> 00:50:38.780
bottom as we saw on the market gates gate.
But they straddle the space below,

783
00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.190
which is very interesting.

784
00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:45.440
So instead of having the two co two columns with a pediment above right above

785
00:50:45.441 --> 00:50:49.160
this,
you can see the columns with the pediment above or right above this space.

786
00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:52.910
So they're straddling the spaces,
which if you look at it for a while,
you'll see,

787
00:50:52.911 --> 00:50:57.560
adds an additional sense of motion,
uh,
to the surface of this structure.

788
00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:00.280
I think you can also see from this general view,
uh,
the,

789
00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.600
the interest in ornamentation,

790
00:51:02.601 --> 00:51:05.690
you can see that perhaps much better here in these details.

791
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:07.700
Here's a detail of one of the niches.

792
00:51:07.701 --> 00:51:11.300
Some of the statues are still preserved with the names of the figures.

793
00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:13.250
In a Greek down below,

794
00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:17.990
you can see the way in which they have essentially dematerialize the peers by

795
00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:20.300
decorating them.
So extensively.

796
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:25.510
And this wonderful view up where you can see the very gated marble that is used

797
00:51:25.731 --> 00:51:27.620
here.
You can see the coffered ceiling,

798
00:51:27.621 --> 00:51:32.621
you can see the deep cut undercutting of the capitals and the tablets are and

799
00:51:32.991 --> 00:51:37.100
how overly ornamental it actually is.
Uh,
and uh,

800
00:51:37.101 --> 00:51:39.620
you can also see that in the upper most part,

801
00:51:39.621 --> 00:51:43.850
actually what they've created here in this particular building is something that

802
00:51:43.851 --> 00:51:47.690
looks very much,
I think like the architectural cages at the,

803
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:50.150
at the upper tier of the fourth style.

804
00:51:50.151 --> 00:51:54.710
And I remind you of a detail of one of those from that fragment from Herculaneum

805
00:51:54.711 --> 00:51:58.360
that shows the same sort of a coffered ceiling and uh,

806
00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:02.480
elements as well as the split a triangular pediment,
uh,

807
00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:07.070
that we see also in built architecture in the second century.

808
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.470
Aidy in Ephesus.
Uh,
the inside of the structure looked like this.

809
00:52:12.471 --> 00:52:15.530
This is from Ward Perkins showing you one main niche,

810
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:20.390
a couple of other tiers with columns,
much simpler inside as you can see,
uh,

811
00:52:20.391 --> 00:52:21.140
the,
uh,

812
00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:25.220
the niches where you had shelves and this is where the scrolls were kept in the

813
00:52:25.221 --> 00:52:27.570
library.
Uh,
and here,
uh,

814
00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:32.680
a niche that beneath which was a place for the last resting place of Kelsey's.

815
00:52:35.991 --> 00:52:39.920
I mentioned this to you when we talked about the paper topics that kills wanted.

816
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:44.090
He built this library as a benefaction to his city,
uh,

817
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:49.160
to benefit the citizenry obviously of the city as well as seven building to put

818
00:52:49.161 --> 00:52:49.821
his name on.

819
00:52:49.821 --> 00:52:53.120
But he liked it so much and it meant so much to him that he decided to make it

820
00:52:53.121 --> 00:52:57.860
his own too.
He was buried in his library.
The neath,
that Central Niche,

821
00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:02.390
uh,
you see in plan here,
the location of that central niche.
Uh,
so,

822
00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:03.800
so as he could be,

823
00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:09.700
he could be in the midst of this extraordinary building that he built in

824
00:53:10.221 --> 00:53:12.630
perpetuity.
A,

825
00:53:12.631 --> 00:53:15.410
another show piece done in the same row.

826
00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.800
Ancient Roman Baroque style [inaudible] is the one that you see here in a

827
00:53:18.801 --> 00:53:21.590
restored view from the word Perkins Textbook.

828
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.990
It dates to the early second century,

829
00:53:23.991 --> 00:53:28.991
a D it's a Nymph Fam or a fountain located at and my leaders in Turkey,

830
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:34.210
uh,
we see it here.
And,
uh,
it,

831
00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:36.970
it was also an extraordinary structure.
Uh,

832
00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:40.050
it was much more ostentatious than it needed to be.

833
00:53:40.051 --> 00:53:42.740
It could get the job done with a lot less.
Uh,

834
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:44.460
its purpose was to serve as a fountain.

835
00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:48.630
You've got the base and down below you could do this with a single story,

836
00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:52.860
certainly.
Uh,
but they built up three stories in this particular place.

837
00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.380
They've been as ostentatious as they possibly can.

838
00:53:55.381 --> 00:53:57.960
They spent as much money as they possibly can.
Uh,

839
00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:01.710
because I think it was a form of oneupsmanship from one city to the next,

840
00:54:01.711 --> 00:54:03.420
you know,
I have a better fountain then you've got,

841
00:54:03.421 --> 00:54:04.830
or I've got a more ornate fountain.

842
00:54:04.831 --> 00:54:09.160
Then you've got a was the whole idea our city is doing particularly well.
Uh,

843
00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.670
because you can see what,
uh,
what,
what,

844
00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:16.470
what prosperity has wrought by this amazing fountain that we've been able to

845
00:54:16.471 --> 00:54:20.970
build for the benefaction of the people of the city,
of my leaders.
Uh,

846
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:22.980
and you can see that this game is the same.

847
00:54:22.981 --> 00:54:27.120
It looks back certainly to the theatrical architecture to the second style

848
00:54:27.121 --> 00:54:30.670
painting and fourth style painting that we've talked about here.
Uh,

849
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.870
the same general idea with the first story,

850
00:54:33.871 --> 00:54:38.871
a series of double columns with a straight in tablature is above in the second

851
00:54:40.321 --> 00:54:40.801
story,

852
00:54:40.801 --> 00:54:45.540
the addition of pediments in this case triangular pediments combined with these

853
00:54:45.541 --> 00:54:50.130
interesting scroll motifs over some of the pairs of columns.

854
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:55.400
And then in the upper most a story triangular pediments once again a niches

855
00:54:56.550 --> 00:55:00.990
behind them and between them with statuary as you can also see.

856
00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:05.700
And then pilasters decorative pilasters on the wall.
This one also has wings,

857
00:55:05.701 --> 00:55:09.420
but you can see that the wings are even more elaborate than the wings we've seen

858
00:55:09.421 --> 00:55:11.500
in any of the other structures.
Uh,

859
00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:16.410
and they in fact have pediments that face in toward the central part of the

860
00:55:16.411 --> 00:55:18.440
structure and toward the fountain.

861
00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:23.250
Proper Perkins has added a few figures here that give you a sense once again of

862
00:55:23.251 --> 00:55:27.520
the enormity of the scale of this,
uh,
amazing,
uh,

863
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:30.390
fountain in the city of my leaders.

864
00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:36.180
I mentioned that although I was going to concentrate today on Baroque

865
00:55:36.181 --> 00:55:39.930
architecture and the eastern part of the empire,
I would not,

866
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:44.990
I would show you at least an at one example from the west and I show that to you

867
00:55:45.091 --> 00:55:49.950
here.
Uh,
it takes us back to North Africa to a place called sub Rotha,

868
00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:55.190
which is located in between Tim Gad and leftist Mon that we looked at last time.

869
00:55:56.100 --> 00:56:01.100
Here's the side of sub Rotha and you can see that it too is located on the sea.

870
00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:04.740
And extraordinary theater was built there.

871
00:56:04.741 --> 00:56:09.300
And it's another example of the way in which these baroque facades could be used

872
00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:13.340
for a whole host of buildings.
It could be used for,
uh,

873
00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:17.850
for theaters and for temples and for fountains and for libraries,
uh,

874
00:56:17.851 --> 00:56:22.680
and uh,
and uh,
so on and so forth.
And,
but theater,
theater,

875
00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:25.630
architecture,
it was particularly appropriate for,

876
00:56:25.631 --> 00:56:30.631
because we've seen from the very beginning of Rome that these kinds of ornate a

877
00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:33.790
columnar,
uh,

878
00:56:33.791 --> 00:56:37.960
schemes were used quite frequently in theatrical architecture.

879
00:56:38.250 --> 00:56:42.640
We are looking at the exterior of the theater at Sobrato.

880
00:56:42.641 --> 00:56:47.420
What you can see from your monument list dates to around 200.
Uh,

881
00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.500
it has been redirected,
much of it had fallen down,
but once again,

882
00:56:50.501 --> 00:56:54.490
there was quite a bit of this stone was there.
And so they redirected the facade.

883
00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:58.480
You can see that it like pretty much everything we've looked at today has,

884
00:56:58.481 --> 00:57:00.610
was made out of local stone.
Uh,

885
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:05.020
and you can also see two tears and you can see that although it's made out of

886
00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:05.741
local stone,

887
00:57:05.741 --> 00:57:10.210
it is very similar to the sort of thing we saw much earlier in Rome itself.

888
00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:13.210
Think of the theater of Marcellus.
Think of the Coliseum,

889
00:57:13.211 --> 00:57:16.770
the scheme of arches with uh,
with uh,

890
00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:21.640
pilasters or columns in between them engaged into the wall.
As you can see,

891
00:57:21.641 --> 00:57:25.300
so well here,
if you look at the view on the left,
you will see however,

892
00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:30.130
the stage building of the theater at sub Brotha is particularly well preserved.

893
00:57:30.131 --> 00:57:33.790
And I want to show you two views too,
spectacular views.
This one in particular,

894
00:57:34.110 --> 00:57:34.421
uh,

895
00:57:34.421 --> 00:57:38.710
which shows you what this structure looked like in antiquity and what it looks

896
00:57:38.711 --> 00:57:43.210
like now.
And it is another one of these extraordinary baroque facades.

897
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:46.780
Again.
So typical for theatrical architecture.

898
00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.600
We see the three great niches as we often do.

899
00:57:49.601 --> 00:57:53.830
Think of the plan of the Augustan theater at a leftist Magnar for example,

900
00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:58.300
three great niches.
These columnar elements on either side,

901
00:57:58.301 --> 00:58:00.310
in three stories,
no straddling here,

902
00:58:00.311 --> 00:58:03.640
just they are just on top one another as you can see,
well,

903
00:58:03.641 --> 00:58:08.020
but a series of four instead of the usual two.
But then within the niches,

904
00:58:08.021 --> 00:58:11.920
they've also created a,
these elements in this case with two columns,

905
00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:15.340
that project,
they're inside the niche.
They're contained inside the niche,

906
00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:18.130
but they project in front of the niche,

907
00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:23.340
adding even more enlivenment meant to the structure look down below also.

908
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:28.270
And we don't,
we rarely have the bottom of the stage preserve,

909
00:58:28.271 --> 00:58:31.720
but we have it preserved here in preserved extremely well.
Uh,

910
00:58:31.721 --> 00:58:33.820
the bottom of the stage has been scalped.

911
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.830
It has projecting elements with columns and the whole thing is decorated with

912
00:58:38.831 --> 00:58:39.351
sculpture.

913
00:58:39.351 --> 00:58:44.351
So many figures that those figures even seem to almost d materialize the stone a

914
00:58:44.891 --> 00:58:48.580
crowd if you're not,
not just a few figures that you can read very well,

915
00:58:48.581 --> 00:58:51.940
but a whole host of crowds of figures that show,
again,

916
00:58:51.941 --> 00:58:56.920
this interest in over decoration in these baroque building sees another view.

917
00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:58.840
Uh,
not quite as clear,

918
00:58:58.841 --> 00:59:02.500
but I think a very good one that also gives you a very good sense not only of

919
00:59:02.501 --> 00:59:06.850
the stage decoration but at the scale of this structure because we've got a few

920
00:59:06.851 --> 00:59:11.670
tourists standing here would show you that once again,
a bigger is better.
Uh,

921
00:59:11.810 --> 00:59:15.820
is clearly the rallying call of the day.

922
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:19.900
Here's a detail of some of that decoration,

923
00:59:19.901 --> 00:59:24.350
gods and goddesses and the like.
We see the three graces here for example,

924
00:59:24.351 --> 00:59:29.120
but you can see the way they are crowded in a,
to give one a sense of um,

925
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:31.880
of uh,
a kind of excess ornamentation,

926
00:59:31.881 --> 00:59:35.090
which was obviously very popular during this period.

927
00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:40.070
The last set of buildings that I want to show you are in many respects the most

928
00:59:40.071 --> 00:59:41.210
interesting of all.

929
00:59:41.211 --> 00:59:45.800
And this is a group of buildings that are part of a complex in what is now

930
00:59:45.801 --> 00:59:50.450
Lebanon.
Uh,
the city of ball back the so called sanctuary of Jupiter,

931
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:53.390
Helio Paula Polatis at Baalbek,

932
00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:58.560
which was constructed over a 200 year period from the mid first century,

933
00:59:58.561 --> 01:00:02.960
had to the mid third century,
a d,
uh,

934
01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:07.520
the location of Baalbek is right over here,
as I said,

935
01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:09.290
in modern Lebanon.

936
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:14.900
And the remains are incredible.
The remains are incredible.

937
01:00:14.901 --> 01:00:18.530
Every so often there's often fighting.
This is in the Bekaa valley,

938
01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:22.490
so there's often fighting that breaks out in this particular part of the world.

939
01:00:22.491 --> 01:00:25.730
And one worries about these monuments.

940
01:00:25.731 --> 01:00:29.510
But so far they seem to have withstood some of the,

941
01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:33.380
of the,
um,
the difficulties that,
that,

942
01:00:33.381 --> 01:00:36.260
that area has experienced in recent years.

943
01:00:36.261 --> 01:00:41.120
And you see some of them here in the nicely silhouetted against the landscape,

944
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:45.440
but this gives you a better idea of what the complex looked like in antiquity.

945
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:49.880
And I show it to you here again,
it was built over a series of years,

946
01:00:49.881 --> 01:00:53.240
but let's just talk about it as a whole and then I'll break down the chronology

947
01:00:53.241 --> 01:00:54.020
for you.

948
01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:58.780
It had a grand entrance way with a single staircase facade orientation,
uh,

949
01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:03.590
with a RQ and RQ weighted lintel here contained within a pediment.

950
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:05.570
Then interestingly enough,

951
01:01:05.571 --> 01:01:10.060
you went from that entrance way into a hexagonal court,
uh,

952
01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:15.090
open to the sky from the hexagonal court into this great open rectangular space

953
01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.270
surrounded by columns,

954
01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:22.620
a very large altar right here to Jupiter because the main temple in this complex

955
01:01:23.571 --> 01:01:28.130
was the temple to Jupiter.
And you see it also in the restored view at the back.

956
01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.470
So the Alternate Jupiter,
the Temple of Jupiter.

957
01:01:30.471 --> 01:01:32.480
If you look at the temple to Jupiter,

958
01:01:32.481 --> 01:01:36.530
you will see it's very similar to the temples that we've been looking at out of

959
01:01:36.531 --> 01:01:39.180
the course of the semester.
Very tall podium,

960
01:01:39.181 --> 01:01:42.830
single staircase facade orientation,
uh,
deep porch,

961
01:01:42.831 --> 01:01:45.290
freestanding columns in that porch and the like.

962
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:49.910
And you can also see that there is a nother temple right outside the walls of

963
01:01:49.911 --> 01:01:52.670
this one.
This is so called Temple of Bacchus,

964
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.850
which is one of the three that was part of this complex.

965
01:01:55.851 --> 01:02:00.470
It also seems to have had its own little courtyard and then down here out of the

966
01:02:00.471 --> 01:02:04.430
picture,
a round temple to Venus that we're also going to look at.

967
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:08.090
This is a restored view of the same showing you the infant's way,

968
01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:10.730
the hexagonal court,
the large temple to Jupiter,

969
01:02:10.731 --> 01:02:14.870
the smaller temple to Baucus and the forecourt that it to would have had as well

970
01:02:14.871 --> 01:02:19.800
as this much less elaborate entrance way into the temple of Baucus.

971
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:23.940
This is perhaps the most spectacular view I've shown you all semester of

972
01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:27.210
anything.
I mean,
this is really an awesome photograph,

973
01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:29.760
I think taken from the air.
Needless to say,

974
01:02:29.761 --> 01:02:33.130
I can't like credit to this and it was taken from the air.
Uh,

975
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:36.060
but you see it here and it is amazing,
uh,

976
01:02:36.061 --> 01:02:40.080
amazing photograph that really gives you a better sense than anything else might

977
01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:44.550
have the current remains where you can see the end France gate.
Uh,

978
01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:48.360
you can see that the,
the staircases is a shadow of what it once was.

979
01:02:48.361 --> 01:02:52.150
It was one much wider.
You can see the hexagonal court from above.

980
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:54.720
You can see the open rectangular space.

981
01:02:54.721 --> 01:02:57.390
You can see the bear remains of the altar.

982
01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:01.890
And you can see the temple of Jupiter,
which has its podium,

983
01:03:01.891 --> 01:03:06.270
not much of it staircase and only six columns still surviving.
But the temple,

984
01:03:06.271 --> 01:03:08.100
a Baucus outside the walls,

985
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:12.960
much better preserved and gives us a very good sense of these temples as a

986
01:03:12.961 --> 01:03:17.100
whole.
Uh,
a plan over here showing the same,
the entrance court,

987
01:03:17.101 --> 01:03:21.630
the hexagonal and France way,
the open rectangular space at a,

988
01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:25.190
the temple of Jupiter,
be the temple of Baucus and here,
uh,

989
01:03:25.191 --> 01:03:28.680
and engraving showing the entrance way.
With this,
uh,

990
01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:34.010
with this RQ weighted lintel just as we saw a popular in the Adriatic period and

991
01:03:34.261 --> 01:03:39.261
the pediment now the chronology is that the temple of Jupiter was built first in

992
01:03:39.361 --> 01:03:41.370
the mid first century ID.
That's way back.

993
01:03:41.371 --> 01:03:45.950
That's like the time of Claudius and Nero mid first century had,
uh,

994
01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:50.670
then,
uh,
in the second century there were um,

995
01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:51.630
uh,

996
01:03:51.631 --> 01:03:56.631
other additions and it was in the third century that the provolone and the

997
01:03:57.090 --> 01:03:58.050
hexagonal chord,

998
01:03:58.051 --> 01:04:01.650
the second century actually was the open rectangular space was added in the

999
01:04:01.651 --> 01:04:02.461
second century.

1000
01:04:02.461 --> 01:04:06.950
And then in the third century they added the hexagonal court and the entrance

1001
01:04:06.951 --> 01:04:10.230
way.
So moving from the back toward the front,

1002
01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:15.450
these are the six columns that are preserved of the temple of Jupiter at
Baalbek.

1003
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:20.370
Uh,
they are incredibly,
the whole structure is incredibly large and this is the,

1004
01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.870
this is the biggest building we've seen thus far.
Uh,

1005
01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.140
we know there were 10 columns in the front,
19 on the sides there again,

1006
01:04:28.141 --> 01:04:30.870
made out of honey colored local limestone.

1007
01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:34.830
I think as you can see so well in both of these views.
In this case,

1008
01:04:34.831 --> 01:04:38.820
the podium was 44 feet tall,
44 feet tall,

1009
01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:42.920
the podium at the temple of the temple of the DDI.

1010
01:04:42.921 --> 01:04:47.921
We at the forum at leptos magnet was 19 feet tall and we thought that was big.

1011
01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:54.740
This is 44 feet tall and the columns were 65 feet tall.

1012
01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.010
Uh,

1013
01:04:56.010 --> 01:05:01.010
and remember those columns that sell a stole from grease 55 feet tall for the

1014
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:06.300
temple of Jupiter Omc.
These are 10,
you know,
are much taller than that.

1015
01:05:06.301 --> 01:05:10.500
So it gives you some sense of the incredible scale of this structure.

1016
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:13.080
Here's the plan of the temple of Baucus,

1017
01:05:13.081 --> 01:05:16.740
the second temple that I want to show you,
that dates to the mid second century,

1018
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:18.970
a d a,
we see it here.

1019
01:05:18.971 --> 01:05:22.090
You can get a very good sense of its structure and you can see the way in which

1020
01:05:22.091 --> 01:05:25.510
it combines.
Typical Roman with a Greek features,

1021
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:28.720
single staircase facade orientation,
deep porch,

1022
01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:31.570
freestanding columns in the porch,
single cell.
Ah,

1023
01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:36.390
but it has a peripheral colonnade,
uh,
as one finds in,
uh,

1024
01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:40.520
in Greek architecture.
But it doesn't have a peripheral staircases.

1025
01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:44.770
I'll show you in a moment.
It has rather a high podium here you see it.
Uh,

1026
01:05:44.771 --> 01:05:46.240
it is very well preserved.

1027
01:05:46.241 --> 01:05:50.200
You can see the columns in circling the whole building but you can see there is

1028
01:05:50.201 --> 01:05:53.770
no staircase circling the whole building but a very high podium.

1029
01:05:54.010 --> 01:05:55.570
A few people here for scale.

1030
01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:59.560
This is a big building and this building is much smaller than the temple of

1031
01:05:59.561 --> 01:06:02.710
Jupiter.
These buildings are so bail big that someone,

1032
01:06:02.711 --> 01:06:06.880
I guess tongue in cheek wrote an article at one point suggesting that this could

1033
01:06:06.881 --> 01:06:10.150
not have been built by human beings,
Romans or otherwise,
uh,

1034
01:06:10.151 --> 01:06:14.470
and was definitely built by Martians who came down in a spaceship and build it

1035
01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:18.730
and then left but left us with something quite extraordinary if that was indeed

1036
01:06:18.731 --> 01:06:22.810
the case.
Once again,
overly decorative,
overly decorative.
If you look at,

1037
01:06:22.811 --> 01:06:25.030
we could look at a whole host of details would,
if you look at them,

1038
01:06:25.031 --> 01:06:28.900
you will see extraordinary things were looking up in one of the bolts and you

1039
01:06:28.901 --> 01:06:33.670
can see how it's been nearly pretty much eaten away by this excessive

1040
01:06:33.671 --> 01:06:38.660
decoration.
The same here with this wonderful,
uh,
Medusa head in the center.
No,

1041
01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:42.850
no,
no inch is left,
uh,
undecorated by these architects.

1042
01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:48.030
This is one of the best preserved interiors of a Roman temple that we have the

1043
01:06:48.311 --> 01:06:51.160
temple of Bacchus.
We are looking through the doorway.

1044
01:06:51.161 --> 01:06:55.270
If you look at the jams of the doorway,
you will see,
uh,
how,
how,
how,

1045
01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.500
how decorated they are.
And again,
again,

1046
01:06:57.501 --> 01:07:01.570
the way in which they have been deemed materialized through that ornamentation

1047
01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:05.710
looking into,
uh,
the,
uh,
the interior.

1048
01:07:05.711 --> 01:07:07.800
And I can show you a better view here.
Uh,

1049
01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:11.710
you get a very good sense of what the structure looked like in antiquity,

1050
01:07:11.711 --> 01:07:16.270
that truly colossal Corinthian columns in this particular case,

1051
01:07:16.271 --> 01:07:21.040
the niches on two stories with RQ weighted pediments and with triangular

1052
01:07:21.041 --> 01:07:22.730
pediments up above,
uh,

1053
01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:27.700
the extraordinary scale of this highly decorative interior.

1054
01:07:27.701 --> 01:07:31.960
And I can show you a restored view of what we think this looked like in

1055
01:07:31.961 --> 01:07:35.680
antiquity.
At first glance,
it doesn't look so different from,
you know,

1056
01:07:35.681 --> 01:07:40.180
this sort of Basilica Olivia idea in Rome,
uh,
with the,
with the flat ceiling,

1057
01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:43.540
the coffered ceiling,
the giant columns and so on.
But of course,

1058
01:07:43.541 --> 01:07:46.540
it has no isles since it's,
I mean,
it has,
it does.
I'm sorry.

1059
01:07:46.541 --> 01:07:50.050
It does have aisles here.
Uh,
but you can see the occupations.

1060
01:07:50.051 --> 01:07:53.890
You can see the pediments.
Uh,
with the sculpture inside,

1061
01:07:53.891 --> 01:07:58.690
you can see the Corinthian capitals,
and you can see,
uh,
no clear story here,

1062
01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:03.610
but you can see a very interesting feature at the,
uh,
at the end,

1063
01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:08.030
the focus of everyone who came into this temple was the so called Adi

1064
01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:10.480
[inaudible],
a,
d,
y,
t,
O,
n,
Adi Tom,

1065
01:08:10.481 --> 01:08:15.481
which is a kind of a shrine in which the cult statue of Baucus would have been

1066
01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:18.350
presented.
You can see it well here,
uh,

1067
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:21.860
and you can see the use of the broken triangular pediment,

1068
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:26.660
but one that is very similar to that market gate in that the central element

1069
01:08:26.661 --> 01:08:30.800
with its triangle is still preserved but preserved in a plane that is further

1070
01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:35.000
back.
So that kind of Zigzag motion,
uh,
that we see here,

1071
01:08:35.001 --> 01:08:39.370
the great arc of vault underneath the paired columns on either side,

1072
01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:44.390
the shrine in the center of very elaborate Motif done in the style that we have

1073
01:08:44.511 --> 01:08:46.400
described as baroque.
Uh,

1074
01:08:46.401 --> 01:08:51.401
for this incredible structure I want to end today by showing you the,

1075
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:55.670
uh,
my favorite of all the buildings that I've shown you today because it's so

1076
01:08:55.671 --> 01:08:59.990
eccentric.
And that is the temple of Venus at Baalbek.

1077
01:08:59.991 --> 01:09:04.991
It's the small temple that lies outside the complex to the left of the complex

1078
01:09:05.481 --> 01:09:09.610
and the front.
Uh,
and it's the latest of the three temples,
uh,

1079
01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:14.740
probably dates to early to mid third century a d and also by far the smallest.

1080
01:09:16.101 --> 01:09:18.830
It's very small in relationship to the others.

1081
01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:22.040
It is also a round temple unlike them,

1082
01:09:22.041 --> 01:09:25.550
which are the traditional rectangular temples around temple.

1083
01:09:25.730 --> 01:09:28.520
But around temple with a difference.
If we look at the plan,

1084
01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:32.610
we will see it as a single staircase of facade orientation,
deep porch,

1085
01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.900
freestanding columns in that porch.
It also is peripheral.

1086
01:09:35.901 --> 01:09:38.250
It has columns that go all the way around.
Uh,

1087
01:09:38.370 --> 01:09:41.210
it is around structure with a round seller.
Uh,

1088
01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:45.130
but you can see in plan that the architect has scallop,
uh,

1089
01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:49.400
the outside of the structure in a very interesting way.
Uh,

1090
01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:54.480
and you can see that also in these restored views over here that scalloping both

1091
01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:58.380
on the base and also in the area of the tablet.

1092
01:09:58.381 --> 01:10:00.980
You're above the columns.

1093
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:06.430
You can also see that the architect has decades place niches on the outside of

1094
01:10:06.591 --> 01:10:11.090
the,
of the structure,
uh,
with,
uh,
with statues in them,

1095
01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.710
which is another example of this desire to decorate every surface that one

1096
01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:16.820
possibly could.

1097
01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:21.320
There's a great deal of controversy as to what the porch actually looked like

1098
01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.230
and whether the porch had what we see here,

1099
01:10:24.231 --> 01:10:28.610
which is an RQ weighted lintel inside a,
a triangular pediment.

1100
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:32.810
That's possible.
It may not have had that.
We're not absolutely sure,

1101
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:37.310
but at the very least we have this combination of what seems like a relatively

1102
01:10:37.311 --> 01:10:41.180
traditional porch with an innovative body.
It is in a sense,

1103
01:10:41.181 --> 01:10:46.181
a small version and a very eccentric version of the Pantheon in Rome with that

1104
01:10:46.311 --> 01:10:50.780
traditional porch and revolutionary body.
But this is not made out of concrete.

1105
01:10:50.781 --> 01:10:54.350
It is made entirely out of local stone.
Uh,
and again,

1106
01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:58.430
it has these wonderful features like the scallops base,

1107
01:10:58.450 --> 01:11:03.290
and I show you a detail is very well preserved today as are the other buildings,

1108
01:11:03.291 --> 01:11:06.470
or at least the temple of Baal office at Baalbek.
Uh,
we see it here.

1109
01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:09.620
You can see it's stone construction,
unfortunately black and white,

1110
01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:13.560
but you can get a sense it's the same honey colored stone is the others.

1111
01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:18.360
You can see the way it looks here.
You can see the scallop base,
the Scallop,

1112
01:11:18.361 --> 01:11:21.960
the wonderful scallop and tablature.
And when did they,

1113
01:11:21.961 --> 01:11:26.910
over the overly decorative nature of that in tablets or above,
in this case,

1114
01:11:26.911 --> 01:11:28.080
Corinthian capitals.

1115
01:11:28.081 --> 01:11:31.950
As you can see some traditional motifs like this hanging garlands,

1116
01:11:32.130 --> 01:11:36.420
the niches here with the statuary making the whole into a kind of decorative

1117
01:11:36.421 --> 01:11:39.690
motif.
Even the outside of the seller becomes decorative.

1118
01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:42.780
But look very carefully and you will see,
uh,

1119
01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:47.840
that the bases of the columns are five sided to make them work better with the

1120
01:11:48.451 --> 01:11:52.230
scallop wall.
This is the second time we've seen basis like this.

1121
01:11:52.231 --> 01:11:55.140
We saw them in the tomb of [inaudible] in Rome,

1122
01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:59.640
a base that had multiple more sides than was usual.
We see that here,

1123
01:11:59.641 --> 01:12:04.641
and it's a testimony again to the eccentricity of this particular designer.

1124
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:09.870
Uh,
but also to the sort of anything goes approach that we see in so much of this

1125
01:12:09.871 --> 01:12:11.250
Roman Baroque architecture.

1126
01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:16.250
And I just in closing the last two images that I'd like to show you are a detail

1127
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:22.070
of the temple of Venus at ball back with a temple with a detail of a bar meany,

1128
01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.280
uh,
structure.
Uh,
this one is the bar meeting structure.

1129
01:12:26.281 --> 01:12:29.910
This one is the temple of Venus.
But I think when you look at views like this,

1130
01:12:29.911 --> 01:12:30.970
you can see the closest.

1131
01:12:30.971 --> 01:12:35.490
So you can see what I mean by defining these as Baroque buildings already in

1132
01:12:35.491 --> 01:12:36.330
Roman antiquity.

1133
01:12:36.331 --> 01:12:41.331
But you can see the extraordinary impact that these amazing Roman creations had

1134
01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:47.770
on the minds and on the Aurora of great architects like Bernini and Borromini in

1135
01:12:49.171 --> 01:12:53.250
the 17th century in Italy.
Thank you very much.
