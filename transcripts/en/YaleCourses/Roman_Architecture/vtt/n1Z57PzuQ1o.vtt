00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.770
Last time I introduced you to some of Rome's greatest buildings and I remind you

2
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:12.140
of two of them here,
the Pantheon on the lefthand side of the screen,

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.890
the temple to all the gods,

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.090
and then of course the Colosseum on the right hand side of the screen.

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.330
These are two of the greatest master works of Roman architecture and we will

6
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.020
gain momentum and work our way up to those in the course of the semester.

7
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.670
But it's not where we're going to begin.

8
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:31.830
We're not going to begin with these master works.

9
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:36.240
We're going to begin at the beginning and the beginning goes way,
way back,

10
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:41.010
in fact,
all the way to the Iron Age and deed to the eighth century BC.

11
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.600
And we know on precisely what day,
uh,
not only the history of Rome,

12
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:47.970
but the history of Roman architecture began.

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.330
And that was specifically on the 21st of April in 753 BC because it was on the

14
00:00:56.971 --> 00:01:01.971
21st of April and 753 BC that according to legend Romulus founded the city of

15
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:09.390
Rome,
Romulus founded the city of Rome on one of Rome,

16
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:11.820
seven hills,
the Palatine Hill.

17
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.040
And I show you here a view of the Palatine Hill.
This is taken from Google Earth.

18
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:21.510
I urged you last time to make sure that you have Google earth downloaded on your

19
00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:25.860
computer and to take advantage of using Google earth and the course of this

20
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:30.861
semester in order to really get to know the city of Rome and the,

21
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.420
the location of the various buildings that we'll be talking about within the

22
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:37.350
city fabric.

23
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.560
So I show you one of these views of the Palatine hill in Rome from Google Earth,

24
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.920
and you can see the relationship of that hill to the part of Rome in which it

25
00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:50.670
finds itself.

26
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.270
You're going to be able to pick all of these buildings out by yourselves in the

27
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:57.090
very near future.
But let me just,
uh,

28
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.140
just do that for you here this morning.
Uh,
you can see of course,

29
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:03.870
the Colosseum in the upper right corner,

30
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.250
you can see the Roman forum lying in front of it.
Uh,

31
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.750
you can see the great that modern street that you see right behind the forum is

32
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:16.170
the via De 40,
and periodically,
uh,
uh,
uh,

33
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.220
commissioned by a Mussolini.
It'll do j.
Uh,

34
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:22.800
we can also see in this view,

35
00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:27.660
the Capitoline hill with the Oval Piatsa designed by Michelangelo.

36
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.150
And down here,
uh,

37
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.070
the famous circus Maximus,
as you can see,
the great stadium,

38
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:38.010
the greatest stadium of Rome.
It wasn't the only stadium of Rome,

39
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:42.660
but it was the largest.
Uh,
and you can see it's hairpin shape,
uh,
right down here.

40
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.080
The hill in question right now is the Palatine Hill.

41
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:50.070
And this is the Palatine Hill.
All of this area here.

42
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.860
And as you look down on it,
as you gaze down on it,

43
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.140
you will see the remains of a colossal structure,
uh,

44
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.190
which is actually a late first a d palace,
uh,

45
00:03:01.191 --> 00:03:05.140
that was designed under the direction of the emperor of Rome at that particular

46
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:06.190
time.
Uh,

47
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:11.170
a very colorful character that we'll talk about in some detail later in the term

48
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.060
by the name of demission.
This is dimensions palace on the Palatine Hill.

49
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.690
Uh,
but that,
that discussion of that palace lies in the future.

50
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.960
What I want to say today is miraculously the remains of Romulus is village on

51
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:30.991
the Palatine hill founded in the eighth century BC actually lies beneath the

52
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:35.290
remains of the palace of demission in Rome.

53
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.440
And it's to Romulus is huts on the Palatine hill that I want to turn to today.

54
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.050
Believe it or not,
remains of those huts from the Iron Age are still there.

55
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.180
Now.
They don't look like much.
Uh,

56
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:52.540
I'm showing you what remains of Romulus is huts right there.

57
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:55.810
And you're probably having a hard time figuring out exactly what we're looking

58
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:58.120
at.
Uh,
but what we're looking at the,

59
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:02.260
the architects that were working for the designers that we're working for

60
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:05.380
Romulus we're very clever indeed.

61
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.880
And they realize that the best way to create a foundation or pavement for their

62
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:14.020
huts was to use the natural rock of the Palatine Hill.

63
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.950
And that's exactly what they did.
What you're looking at here is the Tufa to you.

64
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:22.270
F a the natural Tufa rock of the Palatine Hill.

65
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.340
And what they did was they created a rectangular plan.

66
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.840
They gave it rounded corners and they cut the stone back about 20 inches down,

67
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.770
uh,
to create that rectangular shape.

68
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.950
They rounded the corners and then they put holes in the two for rock.

69
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.070
The holes were to support wooden poles that serve to,

70
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.710
to,
uh,
to support the superstructure of the hut,
uh,

71
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:55.670
and also to support the walls of the hut.
So the pavement,
uh,
of the,

72
00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:58.450
the two for rock of the Palatine is the,

73
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.420
is the floor of the hut.
And then these holes,
uh,

74
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.850
support the wooden poles that supported in turn the superstructure.

75
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.140
I now show you a restored view on the left and you should all have your monument

76
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:14.830
lists and should be able to follow along with the major monument.

77
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:17.860
You won't see every image that we're,
that I'm going to be showing here,

78
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:22.360
but she'll show see a selection.
They are the ones that you'll need to learn and,

79
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.900
uh,

80
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.670
be able to talk about for the midterm of the two midterm exams in this course.

81
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.280
Uh,
but you'll see there,
uh,

82
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.190
this restored view of one of these Palatine,

83
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:36.250
Hud's as well as a view of the model,
uh,

84
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.410
that one can actually see in the archeological museum that's on the Palatine

85
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.300
Hill.
Uh,
today you can see as you look at this restored view on the left,

86
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:49.150
you can see that rectangular plan that we talked about.

87
00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:53.290
Here you can see the rounded corners and you can see the wooden poles that were

88
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:57.230
placed into those holes,
uh,
to support,
uh,

89
00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.710
the walls and the superstructure of the building.

90
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.700
You can see over here the same,
the wooden poles.

91
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:08.090
This gives you a better sense of what they looked like in actuality the wooden

92
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:10.340
poles.
And also the superstructure.

93
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.380
We also know what the walls were made out of.
They were made out of something.

94
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:16.160
And I,
you know,

95
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.160
I've put some of the keywords that I might be unfamiliar to you on the monument

96
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:24.460
list as well.
They were made out of wattle and Daub.

97
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.950
Well what is wattle and Dow wattle and Dab is twigs and uh,

98
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.860
rods that are covered and plastered with clay twigs and rod's covered and

99
00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:38.330
plastic with clay.
Those that served as the walls of the structure.

100
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.680
And then the sloping roof as you see it here was fast.

101
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.030
Now it's very hard.

102
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.670
There are no huts that look like this in Rome still today that I can show you a,

103
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.830
to give you a better sense of what these would have looked like in antiquity,

104
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.330
but I'm sure you like,

105
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:56.840
I have seen huts like this on your travels around the world.

106
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.740
And one example I can show you and what would that we were all down there right

107
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:00.981
now.

108
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:05.981
This is a view of a small village in the Maya Riviera near Cancun,

109
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.061
uh,

110
00:07:07.061 --> 00:07:12.061
where one sees if you take the bus or a car from Maya to Cheech an Eatsa,

111
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:16.100
which I hope some of you have had a chance to do.
If you haven't,
it's great,

112
00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:17.330
great trip.
Uh,

113
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:22.331
and you can see all along the road huts that look very much like the huts of

114
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:26.900
Romulus,
these village made out of wood.
Uh,
and then with thatched roofs,

115
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:27.770
as you can see here.

116
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:32.060
So this is the best I can do in terms of conjuring up for you,
uh,

117
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.650
Romulus is village.

118
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.880
We also have information with regard to what these huts looked like in ancient

119
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:42.560
Roman times or not,
not nature them in the Iron Age.
As I mentioned before,

120
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.090
uh,
we have not only the pavement stone that's still preserved,
uh,

121
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:50.150
but we also have these urns,

122
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:55.000
we call them hut earns hot earnings cause their urns in the shape of huts.
Uh,

123
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.740
and these hut urns were used for cremation,
uh,

124
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.920
when people in the eighth century BC,
these date also to the Iron Age,
uh,

125
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.950
and the cremated remains of the individual was placed inside the door of the

126
00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:11.360
hut.
And if you look at this hut earn a,

127
00:08:11.361 --> 00:08:15.710
you'll see that it looks very similar to the huts of Romulus that we've already

128
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:20.570
been talking about it,
it is either sort of square or rectangular in shape.

129
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.600
It has rounded corners as you can see here and the roof of the hudder and is

130
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:26.860
sloping.
Uh,

131
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:31.870
so we do believe we use this along with the surviving pavement to restore a what

132
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:34.100
these uh,
hut earns,

133
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:39.370
what these huts of Romulus looked like in the eighth century BC.

134
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.090
Uh,
let me also note,

135
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:45.500
it's interesting just to see the status of men and women in any given

136
00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:47.390
civilization at any given time.

137
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.500
There are essentially two kinds of Hud urns from the eighth century BC.

138
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.480
There are,
I mean there are two kinds of,
excuse me,

139
00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:55.950
two kinds of urns in the eighth century BC.

140
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:59.870
One of them is hut urns and the other is helmet earns a,

141
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.050
and you can guess as well as as anyone is to who was buried in which the men

142
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:08.730
were buried in the helmet earns and the women's remains were placed in the hut,

143
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.710
earns a,
so men men's domain was considered the battlefield.

144
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.120
A women's domain was considered the house.
Uh,

145
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.220
but this how the houses are actually more,
uh,
more important,
uh,

146
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:23.050
in terms of giving us a sense again of what,
uh,

147
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.740
Romulus is village looked like in the eighth century.

148
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.580
And if you take one of those huts and you combine it with another set of huts,

149
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.440
uh,
you got,
you can,
you can get a sense of what the village,
uh,

150
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.630
of Romulus would have looked like in the eighth century BC.

151
00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:41.631
This is a model that is on view in the archeological museum on the Palatine Hill

152
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:43.260
today,

153
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:48.260
and it gives you a very good sense of the village of Romulus in the eighth

154
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:49.020
century.

155
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.930
And of course it was from this village that the great city of Rome grew.
Uh,

156
00:09:53.931 --> 00:09:57.900
and of course there's a quite significant difference between Rome as it is now

157
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.140
and Rome as it was in the eighth century BC.

158
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:06.330
I'm gonna,

159
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:11.330
I'm gonna skip a couple of centuries and take us from the eighth century BC to

160
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:17.361
the sixth century BC and talk about what was the greatest,

161
00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.680
our architectural project in the sixth century BC.
Now,

162
00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:26.780
just a few words about what was going on in the sixth century BC.
Uh,

163
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.440
those who were ascendant in the sixth century BC were essentially the Etruscans.

164
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.310
The Etruscans,
uh,
lived in what is known as a area.

165
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.630
They were quite advanced civilization prior to the Roman period lived in

166
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:44.250
[inaudible],
which is,
uh,
which is essentially Tuscany today,

167
00:10:44.251 --> 00:10:47.250
a trust in Tuscany,
Tuscany today.

168
00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:51.930
So the area around Florence and so on and so forth is where many of these

169
00:10:51.931 --> 00:10:56.300
individuals lived.
They became a quite powerful civilization,
uh,

170
00:10:56.301 --> 00:11:01.301
and they were able to use that power to gain ascendancy also in Rome itself.

171
00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:07.251
And there's a period in which there was a succession of a trust skin kings who

172
00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:12.180
were,
who were leading,
uh,
Rome.
And these are trust.
Can Kings,

173
00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:15.300
you know,
eventually kicked out of by the Romans.
Uh,

174
00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:17.160
but at this time in the sixth century,

175
00:11:17.161 --> 00:11:21.300
they were extremely important and it was under a trust skin,

176
00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:25.250
uh,
supervision and patronage that a Ba,

177
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.860
a major temple,
uh,

178
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:31.880
began to be put up in Rome in the sixth century BC precisely in five oh nine.

179
00:11:33.931 --> 00:11:38.230
It was dedicated in the year 509 BC.
As you can see,
uh,

180
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.080
from the monument list,

181
00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:45.390
the temple in question was the temple of Jupiter optimists.

182
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:50.540
Maximas Capitol Lien is now that is a mouthful and I don't want you to have to

183
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.750
necessarily remember all of that.
Jupiter optimist Moxham is capital Lena.

184
00:11:55.751 --> 00:12:00.280
So we will call him,
we will call this temple for all intents and purposes,

185
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.930
the temple of Jupiter.
Oh m see Jupiter Omc,

186
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:09.340
optimist,
maximus capitol Lenas,
the tablet cap,
the temple of Jupiter.

187
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:10.600
Omc,
uh,

188
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:14.950
was dedicated again in the year 509 BC.
Uh,

189
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:17.720
and it was dedicated to Jupiter,
uh,

190
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:22.690
but also to his female companions,
a Juno and Minerva.

191
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:27.460
I,
and when we think of those three are,
when those three are joined together,

192
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.080
Jupiter,
Juno in Minerva,

193
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.260
they are known as the capital line triad because their main temple was on the

194
00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:36.580
capital line hill in Rome.

195
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:41.200
And we will see the Capitol on triad not only honored in this temple,

196
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.130
but in other temples.
I showed you one on Tuesday and palm pay,
for example,
uh,

197
00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:50.680
the so called capitalism and Pompei that honored Jupiter,
Juno,

198
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.250
and Minerva.
You'll see that when a temple honor's the three of them,

199
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:58.390
it has implications for the architecture of that building,

200
00:12:58.391 --> 00:12:59.560
for the design of that building.

201
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:03.070
We'll talk about that right now in a few minutes.
Uh,
but,
uh,

202
00:13:03.071 --> 00:13:05.710
I want you to be aware of what the capital on triad is.

203
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:07.900
So it's all three of them honored together.

204
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.830
Although Jupiter is always considered a supreme when,

205
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.050
whenever those three get together.

206
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.080
So we have a temple here that we have to think of in large part as an a trust

207
00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:22.570
skin temple put up during the time of the trust.
Can Kings,
uh,

208
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.720
dedicated in 509,
but one that is beginning to have,
uh,

209
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.740
the impact of Rome,
uh,

210
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:34.390
and will itself have very strong impact on Roman temple architecture.

211
00:13:34.391 --> 00:13:38.170
And we're going to focus quite heavily today on Roman temple architecture.

212
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.350
And then of course,
return to it,
uh,

213
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.860
sporadically in the course of the semester as we move through and look at other

214
00:13:44.861 --> 00:13:49.150
temples like the Pantheon and like others that were put up in the Roman

215
00:13:49.151 --> 00:13:52.180
provinces.
The temple of Jupiter,

216
00:13:52.181 --> 00:13:57.170
Omc was built on the capital line hill in Rome.
So one of the other major,
uh,

217
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.200
seven hills.
So while the hill,

218
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:04.180
the hill of the Palatine was basically the residential section of Rome at this

219
00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:04.661
juncture,

220
00:14:04.661 --> 00:14:09.130
the capital line hill became its religious center where it's main temple was

221
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:13.400
placed.
Uh,
the temple of Jupiter was located,
uh,

222
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.810
on the hill,
um,

223
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:20.290
was located on the hill and about the position of one of the palaces that's

224
00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:24.460
there.
Now we mentioned last time in any of you who've been to Rome?
No,
this,
well,

225
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:25.900
uh,
that the,
uh,

226
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.920
Capitol Line Hill was redesigned in the renaissance by none other than

227
00:14:29.921 --> 00:14:32.180
Michelangelo himself.
Uh,

228
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.910
it was Michelangelo who was responsible for creating the Oval Piatsa that is at

229
00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:39.550
the center of the cap,
a capital line hill,

230
00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:43.630
which was then recall renamed the competent Doleo of Rome.

231
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.530
And there are these three palaces designed also by Michelangelo,

232
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.180
the capitalized,

233
00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:54.280
the conservatory and the senatorial palaces that served today as to museums on

234
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.460
you or I joined museum one on either side and a,
uh,
a,
um,

235
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.170
a governmental building in the back.
Uh,
and you can see that very well here.

236
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:07.430
So this is the capital on hill as it looks today,
as we designed by Michelangelo.

237
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:12.020
But in Roman times it was the location or from the sixth century BC on,

238
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:15.740
it was the location of the temple of Jupiter Omc,

239
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:18.430
the chief temple of Ancient Rome,

240
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.590
the most important temple of ancient Rome.

241
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.110
What did that temple look like?
A,
and again,
it's,
this is extremely important,

242
00:15:27.111 --> 00:15:31.940
not only for it but for the rest of Roman temple architecture.

243
00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:36.510
Over time we have,
believe it or not,
we have quite a bit of evidence.
Uh,

244
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:41.270
it's complicated by the fact that this temple burn down quite a number of times

245
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:42.140
throughout its history.

246
00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:46.580
We know it was still standing by the way in the fourth century d when it was

247
00:15:46.581 --> 00:15:50.780
described by a very famous writer.
Uh,
but so it had a very long history,

248
00:15:50.781 --> 00:15:54.110
but it burned down several times.
Uh,
and uh,

249
00:15:54.111 --> 00:15:57.170
it was rebuilt several times and each time it was rebuilt,

250
00:15:57.171 --> 00:16:00.290
it obviously was rebuilt in a new style,
you know,

251
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:04.370
whatever was oak or wronged at that time.
So it changed considerably.

252
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:05.540
And nonetheless,

253
00:16:05.541 --> 00:16:10.541
we do have quite a bit of information about it as far as we can tell when it was

254
00:16:10.701 --> 00:16:14.540
put up in five oh nine BC,
it looked something like this.

255
00:16:14.541 --> 00:16:16.430
What you're seeing here is a restored view,

256
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:21.730
a and a plan of the temple in 509 BC.

257
00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.120
Uh,
and,
uh,

258
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.600
it's never too soon in a course on architecture to learn how to read a plan a

259
00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:31.130
and to how to read a restored view or so called axonometric view.

260
00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:33.620
And I have put on you probably haven't had a chance to look yet,

261
00:16:33.621 --> 00:16:36.530
but I've put up on the website for this course,

262
00:16:36.531 --> 00:16:40.970
both under announcements and also in the forum,
the online forum section.

263
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:46.210
A couple of sheets that you will speak I think will be very helpful to you that

264
00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:49.790
have a terms and concepts.
Uh,
you know,

265
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:53.690
it has different kinds of different kinds of um,
you know,

266
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.670
vaulting and uh,

267
00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.180
different kinds of masonry and also tells you the difference between an accident

268
00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.930
metric view and a plan and so on and so forth.

269
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.770
I really urge you to print those out,
look through them.
Uh,

270
00:17:06.771 --> 00:17:07.970
in the beginning of this semester.

271
00:17:07.971 --> 00:17:10.730
We do have to spend a lot of time on what things are called,

272
00:17:10.731 --> 00:17:12.770
but once we do that for a couple of weeks,

273
00:17:12.771 --> 00:17:16.490
we'll be done with it and you'll know all the basic terms and we'll be able to

274
00:17:16.491 --> 00:17:20.720
go on from there.
But I think you'll find those handouts extremely helpful.

275
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:26.030
So as we look at what we have here,
I think you can see by looking at the plan,

276
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.340
uh,
that what we are dealing with here is a rectangular structure.
Uh,

277
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:35.030
the rectangular structure has a deep porch and these circles are columns.

278
00:17:35.031 --> 00:17:37.670
So with freestanding columns in that porch,

279
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:42.920
it has a single staircase at the front having a single staircase rather than one

280
00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:46.700
that in circles,
the building gives the building a,
uh,
a focus.

281
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.340
There's a focus on the facade for this structure.

282
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:55.560
You can also see that the p,
the back wall is plane,
back wall is plane.

283
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.170
I am the seller.
C,
e l l a,

284
00:17:58.171 --> 00:18:02.490
which is the central space of the inside of the temple is divided into three

285
00:18:02.491 --> 00:18:07.410
parts.
So I try partite seller,
uh,
and why was there a tripartite seller?

286
00:18:07.411 --> 00:18:11.250
You know the answer because there were three gods.
That was Jupiter,
Juno,

287
00:18:11.251 --> 00:18:15.660
and Minerva.
The capitol I'm triad.
Each one had his own little Sela,
uh,

288
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.140
with Jupiter,
obviously in the center flanked by his two ladies,
uh,

289
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:23.220
one on either side.
So whenever you see a building with a triple seller,

290
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.390
you're going to know that's a,
that's a temple of the capital.

291
00:18:27.391 --> 00:18:31.740
I'd try at,
we can see from the outside of the structure,

292
00:18:31.741 --> 00:18:35.430
the restored view,
uh,
that it had a quite tall podium.

293
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.840
The podium was in fact 13 feet tall,
pretty significant,

294
00:18:39.841 --> 00:18:42.960
13 feet foot tall podium right here.

295
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.960
And here you also see again the single staircase in the front.
Uh,

296
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.380
the facade orientation,
the deep porch,

297
00:18:49.381 --> 00:18:53.580
the freestanding columns in that porch and the triple entrance way into the

298
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:58.080
three sellers of the structure.
So that's the basic plan.

299
00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:58.710
Uh,

300
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:03.710
let me also mention the materials for the temple of Jupiter Omc in the sixth

301
00:19:04.051 --> 00:19:06.360
century BC because technology is an important,

302
00:19:06.361 --> 00:19:09.420
is important in any course on architecture.
Uh,

303
00:19:09.421 --> 00:19:14.140
we know and think back to what we already know about the huts.
Uh,
the bill,

304
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:19.190
the building material used here was a wood for the columns and the

305
00:19:20.311 --> 00:19:24.300
superstructure just as we saw in the Palatine huts,

306
00:19:24.301 --> 00:19:28.800
wood for the columns and the superstructure mud brick,

307
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:33.690
not waddling dow,
but mud brick for the podium and for the walls.

308
00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:39.000
Uh,
and then the structure had,
uh,
quite a bit of decoration.

309
00:19:39.001 --> 00:19:42.800
You don't see it here,
but quite a bit of decoration,
sculptural decoration,
uh,

310
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.960
in ancient times.
And this was made out of terracotta.

311
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:51.140
So would mud brick and terracotta where the materials used for this particular

312
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:57.660
building?
Oh,
I meant to show you,
sorry,
let me just go back for a second.

313
00:19:57.661 --> 00:20:01.950
They don't,
the reason that the,
uh,
the other plan is on the screen.

314
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:06.570
The one at the left,
uh,
this is a plan of an interest in tomb,

315
00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:08.170
the tomb of the,
uh,

316
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.240
shields and seats from cheer Vettery second half of the sixth century BC,

317
00:20:12.241 --> 00:20:13.530
which is on your monument list.

318
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:18.180
I only bring it to your attention because it's interesting that the Etruscans

319
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:23.010
also divided the main space of that tomb into three spaces.
Uh,

320
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.360
three separate spaces up at the top,
tripartite,
uh,

321
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.580
and also gave it a single staircase,

322
00:20:29.581 --> 00:20:32.640
which gave it a facade orientation.

323
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.510
I just mentioned that because we'll see that those,
that,
those,

324
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.860
that especially,

325
00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:42.861
that focus on the facade is an a trust can element that is picked up by the

326
00:20:43.021 --> 00:20:47.010
Romans.
Roman architecture is very much an architecture of the sides,

327
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.660
the front of buildings with a focus on the front of buildings.

328
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.560
And I wanted to make sure that you knew that not only in temple architecture but

329
00:20:53.561 --> 00:20:57.880
also in to market texture under the Etruscans.
Uh,
that was a,
uh,

330
00:20:57.881 --> 00:21:02.881
an approach that they already took and that was adopted from them by the Romans.

331
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:08.350
Uh,
another view also of the plan just so that you can see it again,

332
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:13.030
a straight up,
uh,
with the focus on the facade,
the single staircase,

333
00:21:13.031 --> 00:21:15.760
the deep porch,
the freestanding columns in that porch,

334
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.530
and then the tripartite division and the flat a back wall.

335
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.810
And I think it's important at this juncture to make a distinction between the

336
00:21:25.811 --> 00:21:28.900
most important,
uh,
trust skin temple,

337
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.510
namely the temple of Jupiter Omc.

338
00:21:31.511 --> 00:21:36.511
And you see a model of that here and the most important Greek ancient Greek

339
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.250
temple,
the Parthenon in Athens,
the Parthenon in Athens dates.

340
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:45.480
As you probably know,
to the fifth century BC,
uh,

341
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.590
this to the sixth century BC.

342
00:21:47.591 --> 00:21:52.591
So they are not exactly contemporary but roughly and a contemporary to one

343
00:21:53.201 --> 00:21:57.940
another.
Uh,
and uh,
as you look at this,
I think you can see for yourselves,

344
00:21:57.941 --> 00:22:02.020
although I will point point out,
uh,
the major distinctions between the two.

345
00:22:02.021 --> 00:22:06.010
And this is going to be very,
very important for today,
for today's lecture,

346
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.580
but also in the future because what we're going to see is that the Romans,

347
00:22:09.581 --> 00:22:12.940
when the Romans began to build their own religious architecture,

348
00:22:12.941 --> 00:22:16.690
they looked back to what had been done by the Greeks and what had been done by

349
00:22:16.691 --> 00:22:20.620
the Etruscans.
They picked and chose what they liked in each,

350
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.790
and they brought that together in an entirely new creation.

351
00:22:24.791 --> 00:22:28.390
They mixed it up with their own culture,
their own religion brought it together,

352
00:22:28.391 --> 00:22:30.880
an entirely new creation and created a,

353
00:22:30.881 --> 00:22:34.990
something distinctive that we know of as the Roman temple.

354
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.200
So what are the,
what are the differences between the two?

355
00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:43.250
We've already talked about the main,
uh,
main features of the Etruscan temple.
Uh,

356
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.270
but with what,
what are,
what are,
what,

357
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.930
what are the main features of the Greek temple of the Parthenon?
Uh,

358
00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.630
I think you can see that while superficially they look alike,
they have columns,

359
00:22:52.631 --> 00:22:55.920
it supported triangular pediment and so on and so forth.
Uh,

360
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.560
the major differences are,
and you can't see all of those here,
uh,

361
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.880
but the major differences are that instead of standing,
sitting on a high podium,

362
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:07.060
uh,
Greek temples sit on a much lower podium,

363
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.230
they have a staircase that encircles the entire building,

364
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.980
no facade orientation there,
no single staircase on the front,

365
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:20.060
the stairs in circle,
the entire building as you can kind of see here.
Uh,

366
00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.480
and there is a single seller.

367
00:23:22.481 --> 00:23:26.910
They never used the triple sellers we see in the capital on a temple.
Uh,

368
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:27.970
and uh,

369
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
and the major difference between the two perhaps is the fact that this building

370
00:23:33.911 --> 00:23:38.140
is built out of stone,
out of marble.

371
00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:42.490
The Greek building is built out of marble.
The Greeks using marble magnificently,

372
00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:47.150
uh,
in the fifth and even fifth century.
And even before that.

373
00:23:47.151 --> 00:23:51.800
So no,
no,
no ordinary old wood columns and mud brick for them.

374
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.470
They were using a marble.

375
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:59.360
So when we begin to see the Romans and we'll see that today using stone,
uh,

376
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:00.860
for their temple architecture,

377
00:24:00.861 --> 00:24:05.330
they are doing that under the very strong influence of Greece.

378
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:10.360
And that's extremely important in any assessment of early Roman religious

379
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.350
architecture.
Another view,

380
00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:16.090
and it's one that you have also on your monument list showing the capitalized

381
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.600
hill in Roman times,

382
00:24:17.601 --> 00:24:22.601
showing you the situation of the temple of Jupiter Omc in relationship to the

383
00:24:23.241 --> 00:24:27.060
other buildings that were up on top of the capital line tail,

384
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.890
mostly religious structures.
But I just wanted you to see it did not stand alone.

385
00:24:30.891 --> 00:24:33.770
Not all of these were built in the sixth century BC already,

386
00:24:33.771 --> 00:24:38.480
but over time and accretion of other buildings here you actually see the temple

387
00:24:38.481 --> 00:24:41.420
and the somewhat later version because as I mentioned,

388
00:24:41.421 --> 00:24:44.560
it burned down and it was rebuilt many,
many times.
Uh,

389
00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.990
but you also can see here this is just useful in terms of Roman religious

390
00:24:47.991 --> 00:24:51.230
practice.
The altar is located not inside the temple,

391
00:24:51.231 --> 00:24:54.740
but outside the religious service actually took place outside.

392
00:24:54.741 --> 00:24:57.950
The priest would officiate outside the temple.
And in fact,

393
00:24:57.951 --> 00:25:00.920
very few were allowed to go inside to see,
uh,

394
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:05.720
the sacred called statutes that was pretty much left for the priest and the

395
00:25:05.721 --> 00:25:08.630
priesthood.
Just again,

396
00:25:08.631 --> 00:25:12.320
to underscore the importance of Google earth for anyone who is not here on

397
00:25:12.321 --> 00:25:14.800
Tuesday,
I mentioned at that time,
uh,

398
00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:19.970
that you can not only go and fly over Rome as it looks today by a Google earth,

399
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:24.140
but they have just recently in the last few months introduced in ancient Rome

400
00:25:24.141 --> 00:25:27.320
version.
So you can go and,
and when you click the right button,

401
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:32.010
you click your mouse in such a way,
you can find that you,
uh,

402
00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.390
that the whole city will be,
um,

403
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:38.360
completely recreated into the ancient city.
And I just want to do,

404
00:25:38.361 --> 00:25:40.880
it's much more abstract.
Uh,
but nonetheless,

405
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:45.170
it gives you a sense of what many of these buildings look like in ancient Roman

406
00:25:45.171 --> 00:25:45.591
times.

407
00:25:45.591 --> 00:25:50.591
And this is a screenshot of the Capitoline hill as it appears in the Google

408
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.130
ancient Rome,
a version of,
uh,
of Rome.

409
00:25:55.131 --> 00:25:58.670
You can't do this for the other cities at this juncture just for the city of

410
00:25:58.671 --> 00:26:02.390
Rome.
But it's great fun to do and also very,
uh,
informative.

411
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.240
Now what is actually left of the temple of,
we know we've,

412
00:26:07.241 --> 00:26:08.990
we've looked at the account,
but Dalia,

413
00:26:08.991 --> 00:26:10.850
we see Michelangelo's buildings are up there.

414
00:26:10.851 --> 00:26:14.810
Now what is actually left of the Temple of Jupiter Omc?
Well,

415
00:26:14.811 --> 00:26:18.890
you're looking at it right here.
It's the podium of the temple,

416
00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:24.230
still survives that 13 foot tall podium of the temple of Jupiter.

417
00:26:24.231 --> 00:26:26.330
We think this is a quite early podium,

418
00:26:26.331 --> 00:26:29.670
maybe not as early as the sixth century BC,
uh,

419
00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:34.250
but a very early podium from the temple upon which the structure was built.

420
00:26:34.251 --> 00:26:36.590
You can get a sense of the height of these things.
And again,

421
00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:39.500
the characteristic of a trust in temple architecture.

422
00:26:39.501 --> 00:26:44.501
And as we shall see if most Roman temple architecture is to have a high podium,

423
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:49.740
uh,
we can see that podium here and we can see what,
how it is made.

424
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:54.770
Technically you can see it as made up of a series of rectangular blocks that are

425
00:26:55.381 --> 00:26:59.070
placed.
One next to one another and on top of one another.

426
00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:04.320
This is technically called ashler masonry,
a,
s,
h,
l,

427
00:27:04.321 --> 00:27:07.020
a,
r Ashleigh masonry to build,

428
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:12.060
to build a wall with this,
these kinds of rectangular blocks,
uh,

429
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:16.560
po Po piled one on top of another.

430
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.590
It's to Firestone in this particular case,
once again,

431
00:27:19.591 --> 00:27:23.990
which was natural at a to bestow natural to Rome,
to you f a,
uh,

432
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:28.020
and uh,
this,
uh,
this,
uh,
Ashleigh masonry,
again,

433
00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:32.240
a building technique that was particularly popular in the,
uh,

434
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:36.720
fifth and fourth and third centuries BC in Rome.

435
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.670
Now,
what,

436
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.950
what went up after the temple of Jupiter Omc in Rome quite a bit.
I mean,

437
00:27:43.951 --> 00:27:47.120
this was a very inspiring project,
a very major project.

438
00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:51.660
Obviously it's spawned a lot of other building projects in the city.

439
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:53.550
Very few of those survive.

440
00:27:53.551 --> 00:27:56.940
I can't show you much else from this particular period.

441
00:27:56.941 --> 00:27:58.740
And this is for a variety of reasons.

442
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.790
It has to do in part with those fires that I mentioned.
A lot of things burned,

443
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:06.140
uh,
and no longer survive.
It has to do with a,

444
00:28:06.141 --> 00:28:08.040
something I mentioned also on Tuesday,

445
00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:12.430
and that is that some of these buildings became quarries in later times,
uh,

446
00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:17.430
with later patrons and architects using them as a source of stone,

447
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:22.060
uh,
that could be used in later structures.
Uh,
so many of them were dismantled,
uh,

448
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.350
to be used for other buildings.
Uh,

449
00:28:25.351 --> 00:28:28.950
and also any city that is inhabited as Rome has been for two and a half

450
00:28:28.951 --> 00:28:33.780
millennia is obviously going to lose a certain amount of its structures over

451
00:28:33.781 --> 00:28:36.210
time.
They're going to be torn down,
they're going to be rebuilt,

452
00:28:36.211 --> 00:28:39.870
they're going to be incorporated into other buildings at some of those that are

453
00:28:39.871 --> 00:28:43.640
survive best are those that were actually incorporated into other buildings.
Uh,

454
00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:45.090
and indeed,
that's what happened here.

455
00:28:45.091 --> 00:28:49.740
The wall was incorporated into something else and built on top of,

456
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:54.570
and that's why it's still survives.
So we don't have all that much again,

457
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.760
uh,
uh,
besides this.

458
00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.660
But even if we had whatever was standing,
uh,

459
00:29:00.661 --> 00:29:04.860
in the fifth and fourth centuries or early fourth century BC would have been

460
00:29:04.861 --> 00:29:09.861
destroyed in the year 386 because in the year 386 BC,

461
00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:14.640
uh,
a group of tribes,
the gallic tribes,

462
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.010
the Gauls came down from the north.
Uh,

463
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:20.400
they destroyed everything in their path.

464
00:29:20.401 --> 00:29:25.401
They did a lot of damage to the Etruscan settlements around Florence and so on.

465
00:29:25.861 --> 00:29:27.000
They destroyed those.

466
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:31.200
They came into Rome and they set the city of Rome ablaze.

467
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.470
And when the smoke cleared,
and it did eventually clear,

468
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:39.710
the only building that was still standing was the temple of Jupiter optimists,

469
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:45.520
maximus capitol.
This,
that's how much destruction there was.

470
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:50.670
And so there's very little else that we can look at from this particular period.

471
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:55.630
What the sac of the balls did was also convinced the Romans that they had not

472
00:29:55.631 --> 00:29:58.870
protected their city well enough,
right?
I mean,

473
00:29:58.871 --> 00:30:03.640
they were completely exposed and the entire city was burned except for that one

474
00:30:03.641 --> 00:30:04.474
temple.

475
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:09.220
So they realized that they better get smart and they better start to wall their

476
00:30:09.221 --> 00:30:14.221
cities to begin to put a protective walls around the perimeter of those cities.

477
00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:19.510
And we see a great,
um,
a great efflorescence of wall building.

478
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.010
Therefore,
after the sack of 386 BC,

479
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:29.170
and I want to turn to that wall,
uh,
construction.
Uh,
right now,
uh,

480
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:33.670
I want to begin with the most important wall that was put up in the fourth

481
00:30:33.671 --> 00:30:36.590
century BC right after the galaxy.
Zach.
Uh,

482
00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.130
and this was the wall around Rome itself.

483
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:43.870
A Rome was encircled with a stone circuit,
a stone circuit that,
that,

484
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:48.100
uh,
that went around the entire,
uh,
seven hills,

485
00:30:48.101 --> 00:30:52.840
the famous seven hills of Rome,
and closing it in this stone circuit.

486
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:57.820
And fortunately,
some parts of that wall are still preserve today.

487
00:30:57.821 --> 00:31:00.340
And I show you the most extensive section here.

488
00:31:00.341 --> 00:31:04.150
This is called the Serbian wall walls.
You can see this on your monument list.

489
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.560
Serbian walls in Rome,

490
00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:11.030
dates to 378 BC,
uh,

491
00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:15.940
right after the sack,
not long after the sac,
378 BC.
Uh,
and,

492
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:16.900
uh,
some,

493
00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:21.820
some extensive sections of that wall or preserve the most extensive is the

494
00:31:21.821 --> 00:31:26.420
section near Rome's main train station.
The [inaudible].

495
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:30.100
You can see this Nazione modern building cause see the Staats Yonei mini in the

496
00:31:30.101 --> 00:31:31.030
upper right corner.

497
00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:36.180
And here is a view of this extensive section of the Serbian walls in Rome.

498
00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.880
The Romans didn't want to take any chances.

499
00:31:39.881 --> 00:31:42.790
They decided even though they're to FAU was pretty good.
Uh,

500
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:46.990
they decided they wanted to use the finest Tufa possible and the,

501
00:31:46.991 --> 00:31:51.460
so they brought it in from the Etruscan city of Bay Bei.

502
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:55.500
They have AEE was a famous and important to trust can city,
uh,

503
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:57.610
that the Romans had just made their own.

504
00:31:57.611 --> 00:32:00.910
So it was a perfect source for them of a,

505
00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:04.270
of outstanding building materials.
And they brought in a,

506
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:06.730
an imported yellowish Tufa,
uh,

507
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:11.320
from the Etruscan town of Ey to use for this very significant,

508
00:32:11.321 --> 00:32:12.400
very important,

509
00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:17.440
a wall that was going to protect them from this time forth.
Uh,

510
00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:21.540
and I,
you see that wall again here,
it is very weathered a,

511
00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:23.320
even though it's still stands,
it's very weathered.

512
00:32:23.321 --> 00:32:26.020
So the stones don't look as uh,
as,

513
00:32:26.021 --> 00:32:30.220
as expertly a carved as they would have been in ancient Roman times.

514
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:30.940
And what you can,

515
00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:34.540
it's hard to see here and I'll show you better in different wall shortly.

516
00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:39.070
But what it's hard to see is the system of what are called headers and

517
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:43.850
stretchers Heteros and stretchers that they used for this wall.

518
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.250
Ah,
what a header is when,
when you,
you take,

519
00:32:46.251 --> 00:32:49.310
you take the same size rectangular block,

520
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.390
but when you put the short side out facing out,
that's a header.

521
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:58.100
And when you put the long side of the rectangle facing out,
that's a stretcher.

522
00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.850
So it's a,
it was a alternating headers and stretchers.
Again,

523
00:33:01.851 --> 00:33:05.470
I'll show you that better in another wall momentarily,
but uh,

524
00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.340
use of headers and stretches here.

525
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:10.280
And we can also see that the blocks are quite regular.

526
00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:15.520
We are dealing with what we call a Ashleigh masonry.

527
00:33:16.491 --> 00:33:17.091
Once again,

528
00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:22.030
the same kind of construction is placement of these fairly regular blocks.
Uh,

529
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:25.340
one on one next to one another and one on top of one another.

530
00:33:25.341 --> 00:33:29.450
Ashler masonry in Latin.
The term is opus Opu,

531
00:33:29.451 --> 00:33:31.510
s quad dropped them Q,
u,

532
00:33:31.511 --> 00:33:35.240
a d r a t u m opus quad,
drop them.
So this,

533
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:40.190
you can call this either Ashleigh masonry or opus quadro bottom squared work.
Uh,

534
00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:44.810
the same sort of thing as we saw on the podium of Jupiter Omc being used for the

535
00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:49.890
Serbian walls in Rome in 378 I showed you last time.

536
00:33:50.421 --> 00:33:52.220
This section of the Serbian walls here,

537
00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:56.390
you can get a much better sense of the coloration of that.
Yellow is Tufa,
uh,

538
00:33:56.391 --> 00:33:59.270
from the,
uh,
and this is also very weathered,

539
00:33:59.271 --> 00:34:01.520
so it's hard to see the headers in stretchers.
Uh,

540
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.260
but it's another section of wall.

541
00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:07.310
And just in case any of you are going to Rome anytime soon that one can see on

542
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:11.720
the Aventine Hill,
which is a beautiful residential hill in Rome,
one of the,

543
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:15.650
one of those lovely places to wander in the entire city.

544
00:34:15.651 --> 00:34:17.810
You will come across a another section.

545
00:34:17.811 --> 00:34:20.450
You never know when little pieces of antiquity will crop up.

546
00:34:20.451 --> 00:34:23.930
They come up in the most unusual places is one wanders the city,

547
00:34:23.931 --> 00:34:27.650
which is one of the reasons it's such a fascinating place to visit.

548
00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:32.060
Now the Romans realize what was going on at the same time as the Romans were

549
00:34:32.061 --> 00:34:35.530
beginning to extensively colonize a while.

550
00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.800
They had these imperialistic ambitions,
they want it to colonize the world.
Uh,

551
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:43.370
but they began with the places closest to them and they began to build extensive

552
00:34:43.371 --> 00:34:44.780
colonies in Italy,

553
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:48.920
especially in an area very close to the city of Rome itself.

554
00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.710
And they recognize as they began to build what I,

555
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.750
what I meant when I mentioned to you last time,

556
00:34:53.751 --> 00:34:58.310
I like to call mini Rome's because these are little cities in the version of the

557
00:34:58.311 --> 00:35:02.030
Capitol City itself.
As they begin to build,
began to build these,

558
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.290
these mini rooms,

559
00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:08.500
they recognize that these mini Rome's also needed a security also needed to be

560
00:35:08.601 --> 00:35:12.530
protected by walls that were comparable to the Serbian wall.

561
00:35:12.531 --> 00:35:15.950
So we see this great efflorescence,
not only a colonization,

562
00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.500
but also have wall building,
uh,

563
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:23.330
in the period following the sac and the period following the construction of

564
00:35:23.331 --> 00:35:24.920
Rome's owned Serbian walls.

565
00:35:24.921 --> 00:35:28.490
And I want to show you a couple of a few examples of that.

566
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:31.010
This is a map that was custom made for this course.

567
00:35:31.011 --> 00:35:33.560
You can find it on the web portal.
Uh,

568
00:35:33.561 --> 00:35:36.980
and I think you'll find it very useful because what I've done here obviously is

569
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.140
on,
I don't clutter it up with a lot of places.
We're not looking at,

570
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:44.340
I focused on the towns that we are actually going to be looking at buildings in.

571
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.920
So I think you'll find it extremely helpful.
Rome is here at the star.

572
00:35:47.921 --> 00:35:51.120
You can actually click on the map and that will take you to a map of Rome
itself.

573
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.200
Uh,
but,
uh,

574
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.370
we see the star where Rome is and the towns that I'm going to take you to that

575
00:35:56.371 --> 00:36:00.900
have walls are uh,
the city of Coza,
the town,
the village.

576
00:36:00.901 --> 00:36:02.850
Really at that time of Coza,
uh,

577
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:07.880
the town of [inaudible] that you see over here and the town of Fillory,

578
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:10.190
Novi.
But I wanted to show you the map because you see how close,

579
00:36:10.191 --> 00:36:14.580
how proximate they are to the city of Rome itself.

580
00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:19.290
I'm going to show you these fairly rapidly.
Just to give you a sense,
again,

581
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.440
of the kind of wall construction that was going on in the colonies and the

582
00:36:22.441 --> 00:36:25.230
Italian colonies at this time.
This is,

583
00:36:25.231 --> 00:36:28.940
we'll look first at the city walls of the town of nor Ba.
Uh,

584
00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.100
and you can see from the monument lists that dates to the second half of the

585
00:36:32.101 --> 00:36:35.550
fourth century BC.
And as you look at these walls,

586
00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:40.300
these are not done out of two [inaudible],
a local,
a local stone to Norbert,

587
00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.810
more grayish and color,
as you can see here.

588
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.630
But you can tell me yourselves right off.
That's not opus Quadro Adam.

589
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:50.550
That's not ashler masonry.
The blocks are not rectangular,

590
00:36:50.551 --> 00:36:53.930
and they're not that even.
In fact,
they're multi-sided blocks.

591
00:36:53.931 --> 00:36:55.590
Some of them are polygonal blocks,

592
00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:59.190
and we technically call this polygonal masonry,

593
00:36:59.191 --> 00:37:00.990
and they've taken these multi-sided blocks,

594
00:37:00.991 --> 00:37:05.430
piled them up in a very interesting way to create a very handsome wall.

595
00:37:05.431 --> 00:37:10.340
I like this wall a lot myself.
Uh,
I very handsome wall,
uh,
two in circle,

596
00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:15.300
uh,
the town of Norma.
So polygonal masonry in this particular instance,

597
00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:20.360
and we see the same use of polygonal masonry at the town of Coza,

598
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.030
which is north of Norway.
As you'll remember from the custom map,

599
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.380
the town of Coza,

600
00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:30.590
the walls date to 273 BC at Khoza and you see glimpses of them here.

601
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:35.280
And I think you can see once again a grayish stone,
a use for these walls.

602
00:37:35.281 --> 00:37:36.900
And you can see that the uh,

603
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:41.010
the construction is once again a polygonal masonry,

604
00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.490
the,
the PS to raise this dawns,

605
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:49.520
the greatest masterwork a Roman wall design in this early period is the wall

606
00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:53.740
that you see here.
This is the wall at flairy.

607
00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:58.800
Novi for Larry Nobi was founded as a colony and 241 BBC 241 BC.

608
00:38:01.651 --> 00:38:06.651
And the walls were put up sometime between two 41 and 200 B BC.

609
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:12.630
And we see them here and you can see that the wall also had a quite spectacular,

610
00:38:12.631 --> 00:38:15.570
at least for its date,
quite spectacular gate.

611
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:17.970
Now if we look at the walls for is actually,
first of all,

612
00:38:17.971 --> 00:38:21.870
I want to point out that they have chosen to use due to different kinds of

613
00:38:21.871 --> 00:38:26.310
materials here as is immediately apparent as you look at this color view.

614
00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:31.830
Uh,
they chose to use a,
a gray pepper,
Reno stone,
p.
E,
p,

615
00:38:31.831 --> 00:38:33.180
e,
r.
I n.
O,

616
00:38:33.181 --> 00:38:37.510
a great pepper Reno stone from the all been hills,
uh,

617
00:38:37.511 --> 00:38:42.310
for the,
uh,
arch of the gateway and to use,

618
00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:43.203
um,

619
00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:48.130
a reddish brown Tufa bore the walls themselves,
Reddish Brown,

620
00:38:48.131 --> 00:38:52.580
Tufa pepper,
Reno,
great pepper Reno stone from the Alban hills.

621
00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:53.260
So they chose,

622
00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:57.670
they were very careful about their selection of materials in part to emphasize

623
00:38:57.671 --> 00:39:02.590
this distinction,
uh,
in texture and in color.
If you look at the wall,

624
00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:05.230
you can see we're dealing here clearly with Ashleigh Mason,

625
00:39:05.231 --> 00:39:06.730
we were the Oprahs quadro bottom.

626
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.510
And here you can see much more clearly than any of the other walls I've shown

627
00:39:10.511 --> 00:39:13.540
you because there so well preserved the headers and the stretchers,

628
00:39:13.541 --> 00:39:17.020
the alternating a square and rectangular blocks,

629
00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:21.520
the scheme of headers and stretchers,
uh,
that is used for this wall.

630
00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:25.090
The most important part of course is the arch,
the stone arch.

631
00:39:25.091 --> 00:39:27.850
It's a masonry arch.
As you can see.

632
00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.720
It's not the earliest arch and Roman architecture,
but it's one of the earliest,

633
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:35.710
uh,
it is,
has,
it has been amazingly done,
I think,

634
00:39:35.711 --> 00:39:38.350
quite masterfully done.
Uh,
if you look at it,

635
00:39:38.351 --> 00:39:43.351
you will see that what the designer has achieved is to take a series of

636
00:39:43.571 --> 00:39:47.510
wedge-shaped blocks.
These are called [inaudible] blocks.

637
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:49.680
I put that word on the monument lists for you,

638
00:39:49.681 --> 00:39:54.130
lose water blocks these wedge shaped blocks and has carved them in such a way

639
00:39:54.131 --> 00:39:56.710
that each one fits very,

640
00:39:56.950 --> 00:40:01.510
very effectively and very well into the overall scheme.

641
00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.330
They're wedged in next to one another.
In fact,
as you gaze at it,

642
00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:08.020
you kind of think,
Gee,
I wonder if any of those blocks are going to fall out,

643
00:40:08.021 --> 00:40:09.700
you know,
fall out from where they are,

644
00:40:09.701 --> 00:40:13.600
but they don't because they're wedged in a so closely next to one another.

645
00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:16.260
And then they have finished the line of the arch,
uh,

646
00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:21.300
very nicely so that it has a very attractive appearance.

647
00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:25.180
Uh,
and,
and,
and because it has done in a different stone,

648
00:40:25.181 --> 00:40:30.130
it stands out extremely well from the rest of the wall.
This is really,
again,

649
00:40:30.131 --> 00:40:34.960
a masterful treatment in my opinion of a wall at this particular time with the

650
00:40:34.961 --> 00:40:39.310
wonderful addition of the arch.
Uh,
and I think we begin to see,

651
00:40:39.311 --> 00:40:44.080
we talked last time about how important arch of making the arches and bolts and

652
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:46.090
especially the use of concrete,

653
00:40:46.091 --> 00:40:49.760
although here we see a stone arch clearly has stone arch.
Uh,

654
00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:54.780
but we are going to see that the capacity of the arch to be used for expressive

655
00:40:55.601 --> 00:40:58.510
purposes in architecture,
uh,
is a,

656
00:40:58.511 --> 00:41:02.650
is capitalized on by the Romans.
And I wanted you to be aware,

657
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:07.140
this is not only important as a wall of this period,
but important as a,

658
00:41:07.141 --> 00:41:11.360
as in the way that it's precent of what's to come,
uh,

659
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:16.470
with regard to the way in which the Romans are going to start to deploy the arch

660
00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:21.660
in extraordinarily creative and innovative ways in Roman architecture.

661
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.970
All begins here.
The arch of the gay,
the,

662
00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:29.830
the wall and gate Valarie Novi stand at the beginning of this incredible

663
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:34.460
development enrollment architecture.
I want to say something very,

664
00:41:34.461 --> 00:41:37.080
very quickly about,
uh,
the,
uh,

665
00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:40.880
about town planning during this period because just as I mentioned,

666
00:41:40.881 --> 00:41:45.150
Romans were colonizing,
uh,
towns in Italy,
uh,
and they were,
uh,

667
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:46.520
putting walls around them,

668
00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:51.730
but they were also beginning to think about how they thought about,
uh,
about,
uh,

669
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:56.920
city construction in general or the making of urban spaces and places during

670
00:41:57.351 --> 00:42:00.980
this particular period.
So I just want to show you fleetingly two examples.
Uh,

671
00:42:00.981 --> 00:42:02.510
the town of Coza,
which we,

672
00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:06.710
which we've already looked at the walls dating to the third century BC.

673
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:11.870
And it's worth noting that it was again after the sack of three 86,

674
00:42:11.871 --> 00:42:16.520
that this explosion of town building a really began.
As we look at this,

675
00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.320
the town plan of cozy,

676
00:42:18.321 --> 00:42:22.730
you can see that it is encircled by the wall that we looked at just before.
Uh,

677
00:42:22.731 --> 00:42:25.820
and you can also see it's roughly regular in shape.
You know,

678
00:42:25.821 --> 00:42:30.800
roughly kind of a square.
As you can see here,
there are gates in the walls.

679
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.250
Uh,
and then there is a scheme of streets,
uh,

680
00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:38.720
that is comparable to what I mentioned last time was typical for an ideal Roman

681
00:42:38.721 --> 00:42:42.320
city plan.
And that is,
uh,
the two main streets,

682
00:42:42.321 --> 00:42:45.830
the carto and the deck.
You Montas of the city,
the Cardo,
uh,

683
00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.290
being the north South Main Street and the deck,

684
00:42:48.291 --> 00:42:50.450
the monitor being the east West Street,

685
00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:54.080
and then intersecting very close to the center of the city.

686
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:58.430
And it's usually very close to that same center that you find the forum or great

687
00:42:58.431 --> 00:43:03.431
open a space meeting and marketplace of the city as well as a host of other

688
00:43:03.741 --> 00:43:06.020
buildings,
basilica market and so on.

689
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:10.710
And then on the highest hill of the town of poser,
a capitalism,

690
00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:15.560
a temple to Jupiter,
Juno and Minerva on that highest spot,

691
00:43:15.561 --> 00:43:19.850
the most important religious,
uh,
structure of that town.

692
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:22.010
That's the town of Kosha.
Uh,

693
00:43:22.011 --> 00:43:26.600
and then the other more important one is the town of Austria,
the port of Rome.

694
00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.000
Uh,
the town of Ostia,

695
00:43:28.001 --> 00:43:32.030
which was first founded that in 350 BC.

696
00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:37.060
And it was at that time that a military camp or cast from was a c a s t r u m a

697
00:43:38.121 --> 00:43:41.200
cast from was laid out,
uh,
there,
uh,

698
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:45.140
and you could see a plan of that Castro,
you the dark dotted line two years,

699
00:43:45.141 --> 00:43:48.530
the original plan of Ostia three 50 BC,

700
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:50.870
all the rest that you see around it as a city,

701
00:43:50.871 --> 00:43:55.340
as it grew into the second century,
a d when it had its epilogue.
Bresson's.

702
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:59.330
So we see the original city here and you can see it is perfectly regular.

703
00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:03.080
And I mentioned to you last time that this is very different from what happened

704
00:44:03.081 --> 00:44:07.580
in Rome.
Rome,
uh,
grew in a very haphazard way over the centuries.

705
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:12.320
There was never any real attempt to plan the city.
Uh,
but when Romans,

706
00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:15.260
the Romans were left to build the kind of ideal city,

707
00:44:15.261 --> 00:44:17.450
the city that they thought was the ideal Roman city,

708
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:22.370
they almost always built it in a very regular fashion as a square or as a

709
00:44:22.371 --> 00:44:23.001
rectangle,

710
00:44:23.001 --> 00:44:26.150
as regular as they could make it an ad varied depending upon the terrain.

711
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.680
There was a lot of hills.
And so on,

712
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:30.470
it might end up with a somewhat more regular shape,

713
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:35.250
but here you see it at its most regular planned like a costume or a military

714
00:44:35.251 --> 00:44:38.940
camp,
uh,
rectangular with the two main streets,

715
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:41.580
the Cardo north South Street,
the deck,

716
00:44:41.581 --> 00:44:46.200
you Montas the east West Street crossing exactly at the center of the city.

717
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:48.930
And then what's located there,
the form of the city,

718
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:52.370
the great open meeting and marketplace,
and then all the other,
uh,

719
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:55.330
major buildings deployed around that.
Uh,

720
00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:59.730
and then of course the residential structures on the shops interspersed among

721
00:44:59.731 --> 00:45:04.731
those in this typical Roman town plan of the fourth century BC.

722
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:11.220
I want to spend the rest of today's lecture on the three most important

723
00:45:11.221 --> 00:45:15.600
buildings in a sense that I'm going to show you today.
Uh,
visa vi,

724
00:45:15.601 --> 00:45:18.180
the development of Roman religious architecture,

725
00:45:18.181 --> 00:45:20.340
specifically temple architecture.

726
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:22.680
And I think I'm going to actually call for your help.

727
00:45:22.681 --> 00:45:26.040
You've learned a lot already and I think you now know enough to help me along a

728
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:30.180
little bit here on sorting out some of these temples.

729
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:34.440
One of them is located in Rome and the other two are located outside of Rome.

730
00:45:34.441 --> 00:45:37.590
I'll show you the map again in the center and the second so that you can see

731
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.310
where those other two are.
But I'm going to begin with the one in Rome,

732
00:45:41.311 --> 00:45:44.550
which takes me back to Google earth here.
Uh,

733
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:49.790
to show you the situation of the so called Temple of poor Tunis in Rome.

734
00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:54.890
That dates to we believe sometime it was put up sometime between one 20 and 80

735
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.620
BC in Rome.
A,

736
00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:00.200
you're going to get so good at this that you're going to be able to point all

737
00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:04.920
these places out without me.
Uh,
but uh,
we're looking back again over,

738
00:46:04.921 --> 00:46:07.440
this is a Palatine Hill.
We're looking at a slightly different angle.

739
00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:11.070
Palatine hill over here,
the very edge of the coliseum.

740
00:46:11.071 --> 00:46:12.480
You can see in the upper left,

741
00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.690
the great to be a day 40 and periodically and miscellany over here,

742
00:46:15.691 --> 00:46:18.840
the imperial fora here,
the wedding cake,
a victor manual,

743
00:46:18.841 --> 00:46:21.900
if Victoriano that I showed you last time over here,

744
00:46:21.901 --> 00:46:24.240
the more modern building the capital line hill,

745
00:46:24.241 --> 00:46:29.190
you can see the Oval Piatsa of Michelangelo right here.
And uh,

746
00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:33.630
what the,
and the circus maximus over here.
And uh,

747
00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:36.090
for any of you have been to Rome,
the Easel Lottie Barina,

748
00:46:36.091 --> 00:46:37.620
that wonderful little island,

749
00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:41.640
that one can cross the bridge to get to in Rome down here.

750
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:46.530
So here's the Tiber river looking nasty as it usually does.
It's very,
um,

751
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:51.930
green and uh,
not,
not the sort of place you'd want to take a swim in.
As you can,

752
00:46:51.931 --> 00:46:56.790
well imagine a,
but you see the Tiber river here.
Uh,
and if you look very closely,

753
00:46:56.791 --> 00:46:59.190
you will see two temples.
This is a round temple,

754
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:03.280
which has the very uninvented is called today,
very uninvented Lee,

755
00:47:03.281 --> 00:47:05.430
the round temple by the Tiber,
uh,

756
00:47:05.431 --> 00:47:07.650
the round temple by the Tiber for obvious reasons.

757
00:47:07.651 --> 00:47:12.000
And then hear a rectangular temple that looks like it has a red roof because it

758
00:47:12.001 --> 00:47:12.930
was undergoing things.

759
00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:16.660
It's been undergoing reconstruction and restoration recently.
Uh,

760
00:47:16.661 --> 00:47:19.130
you see that here?
This is the temple of Fortuna,

761
00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:21.720
so you can see in conjunction to another temple,

762
00:47:21.721 --> 00:47:26.610
it was built very close to the river,
to the Tiber river.

763
00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:31.360
Now let's look at the plan together of the temple up Pour Tunis.

764
00:47:31.361 --> 00:47:35.780
Based on your understanding now of typical,
uh,

765
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:40.090
trust skin,
religious architecture,
typical Greek religious architecture,

766
00:47:40.091 --> 00:47:42.470
what would you say about this plant?

767
00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:47.080
Is this more like an a trust skin temple or more like a Greek temple?

768
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:48.280
I can't remember if,
I think,

769
00:47:48.281 --> 00:47:52.090
I forgot to mention with regard to the Parthenon that not only does the,

770
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:53.290
the typical Greek temple,

771
00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:57.760
the fifth century BC have a staircase that encircles the entire monument.

772
00:47:57.761 --> 00:47:59.710
It has a colonnade,

773
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.980
a freestanding colonnade that in circles the entire monument.

774
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:07.360
And that's called a peripheral p.
E r I t t e R,
a,
l,

775
00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:11.490
a peripheral colonnade.
So based on what you know about,
uh,

776
00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:16.300
the temple of Jupiter,
Omc and the temple of,
and the Parthenon in Athens,

777
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:19.000
does this plan in plan,
when we look at this building,

778
00:48:19.001 --> 00:48:23.860
does this look more like an a trust skin plan or like a Rick plan?

779
00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:31.180
Okay.
Mr Roma.
Good.

780
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:37.990
All right.
All right.
Okay.
Yeah,
it's,
it looks like it might be a combination.

781
00:48:37.991 --> 00:48:40.870
Give me what the trust can characteristics are first

782
00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:46.090
chorus and also the,

783
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.230
this,
the,
the,
the single staircase.
Absolutely.

784
00:48:53.231 --> 00:48:56.890
Which gives it a facade orientation.
Is there a triple entrance way?
I mean,

785
00:48:56.891 --> 00:49:00.190
there are there spaces between the columns.
These are columns here,

786
00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:05.160
but look at the seller.
The cell is a single seller,

787
00:49:05.161 --> 00:49:07.660
so this is not a capitalism,
but there are spaces.

788
00:49:07.661 --> 00:49:10.930
You're right between the columns.
So take us a little further with the columns.

789
00:49:10.931 --> 00:49:15.190
You can see the columns in a deep porch.
The porch,

790
00:49:15.191 --> 00:49:19.420
freestanding columns in the front are freestanding.
So facade orientation,

791
00:49:19.421 --> 00:49:23.290
single staircase,
deep porch,
freestanding columns in the porch,
in this case,

792
00:49:23.291 --> 00:49:26.500
a single seller.
Those are all a trust skin characteristics.

793
00:49:26.501 --> 00:49:29.800
So it looks as if we are dealing here essentially within a trust can plan,

794
00:49:29.801 --> 00:49:33.130
but you are right.
What's your name?
Neil.
Neil was right.

795
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:38.250
However that this is a combination in that there are columns that go around the

796
00:49:38.411 --> 00:49:43.220
monument,
but is it a peripheral colonnade?
Neal?
Probably not.

797
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:47.450
Probably not.
Why not?
Because what's different about these columns?

798
00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.740
You can see it in plan there.
They go all the way around,

799
00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:53.470
but they're not freestanding.

800
00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:57.940
They're attached or engaged into the wall.
They're attached to the wall.

801
00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:02.950
What do we call that?
We call that a pseudo for rip curl pollinate.

802
00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:03.731
So yeah,

803
00:50:03.731 --> 00:50:06.880
it kind of looks like it goes around but it doesn't really because it's attached

804
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:11.320
to the wall and it kind of gives that sense of flatness that we got in the trust

805
00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:13.330
can temple.
So you're,
you were absolutely on the mark.

806
00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:18.360
It's a combination of the two and that is exactly what we see coming together at

807
00:50:18.551 --> 00:50:21.010
this particular time in Roman temple architecture,

808
00:50:21.011 --> 00:50:25.080
this wonderful way in which the Romans have looked at a trust skin precedents.

809
00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:29.090
They've looked at Greek presidents,
they what they like.
They mix it up,

810
00:50:29.091 --> 00:50:33.560
as I said before,
in a way in which best represents their own culture,

811
00:50:33.561 --> 00:50:35.000
their own religion,
uh,

812
00:50:35.001 --> 00:50:39.230
and create something that we're going to see becomes distinctively Roman.

813
00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.980
The building is very well preserved.
So we can go on to actually look at it.

814
00:50:42.981 --> 00:50:47.660
Here it is,
uh,
stands in almost pristine shape in Rome today,

815
00:50:47.661 --> 00:50:51.930
right near the Tiber river.
As I mentioned,
uh,
a wonderful temple,
uh,

816
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:55.490
in which we see some of those features that Neil has already pointed to.

817
00:50:55.491 --> 00:50:59.840
And that is the facade orientation,
the single staircase,
the deep porch,

818
00:50:59.841 --> 00:51:02.450
the freestanding columns in that porch from a distance.

819
00:51:02.451 --> 00:51:05.510
It does indeed look peripheral.
It looks like their columns all the way around.

820
00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:06.650
But as you look closely,

821
00:51:06.651 --> 00:51:11.480
you will see that the columns are indeed attached to the wall on the side and

822
00:51:11.481 --> 00:51:14.750
around the other side.
Now,
now that you see the actual view,

823
00:51:14.751 --> 00:51:19.751
there are some other things that give this away as a temple that is clearly also

824
00:51:19.941 --> 00:51:24.740
built,
been built under very strong Greek influence.
And what are those

825
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:29.960
stone?
Yes,
absolutely.
This is not made.
This is,

826
00:51:29.961 --> 00:51:33.440
this is not a wooden mud brick terracotta temple.

827
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:36.950
This is a temple that is made out of stone.
It's not made out of marble.

828
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:41.150
It's made out of,
uh,
of,
um,
travertine.

829
00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.030
It has travertine,
t,
r,
a,
v,
e,
r,
t,
I,
n.

830
00:51:44.031 --> 00:51:47.510
A travertine is an Italian stone bought from,

831
00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:52.190
brought from or quarried at the,
uh,
the town of Tivoli Tib,
O,
l,
I,

832
00:51:52.191 --> 00:51:54.830
which we'll talk about a lot in the course of the semester.

833
00:51:55.050 --> 00:52:00.050
A travertine brought Tivoli is about an hour's highspeed drive today from Rome,

834
00:52:00.171 --> 00:52:03.860
obviously longer in antiquity,
but it's fairly proximate to Rome.

835
00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:09.070
So this wonderful stone travertine from Tim Tivoli brought to serve as a facing

836
00:52:09.561 --> 00:52:13.640
for the podium,
uh,
and for the columns and the columns.
So it is,

837
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:18.230
it is essentially a stone structure.
We'll see that the walls are made of Tufa.

838
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:22.310
Uh,
but those walls were stuccoed over with white stucco.

839
00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:25.400
So that the impression that you would have gotten if you were,
if you,

840
00:52:25.401 --> 00:52:27.980
in ancient times when this was in more pristine condition,

841
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:30.260
was that you were looking at a white marble temple,

842
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:34.190
which would've certainly conjured up the idea that you were looking at a temple

843
00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:37.730
that was made a log wreck that was made in the Greek style.

844
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:40.880
Anything else that gives away the influence of Greek?
Arkady?

845
00:52:40.881 --> 00:52:45.620
Any of you know your orders,
Neil ionic order.

846
00:52:45.621 --> 00:52:50.270
Good.
I,
Oh,
I,
oh,
I,
oh.
And I see Ionic,
the three major,

847
00:52:50.271 --> 00:52:54.070
and you'll find this in your terms and concepts.
So bone up on those there.
Uh,

848
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:57.380
the Doric,
the ionic and the Corinthian.
We'll look at all of them today.

849
00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:58.430
The ionic order.

850
00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:03.350
What characterizes the ionic order are these what are called spiral volumes?
Vol.

851
00:53:03.351 --> 00:53:06.890
U T e s spiraled volumes.
And you can see those here.

852
00:53:06.891 --> 00:53:10.340
This is a typical ionic column clearly made.

853
00:53:10.341 --> 00:53:14.480
We don't see the Etruscans using this,
uh,
clearly made under the influence,

854
00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:19.340
the very strong influence of Greek architecture,
Greek temple architecture.

855
00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:24.520
Here's a view of the temple of cartoonists from the side and from the rear.

856
00:53:24.591 --> 00:53:29.040
We once again see the way those columns and circle the structure but are engaged

857
00:53:29.041 --> 00:53:30.120
into the wall.
Uh,

858
00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:35.160
you can also see the blocks of Tufa Stone Ashler blocks just as we saw them in

859
00:53:35.161 --> 00:53:37.080
the walls of two histone use tier.

860
00:53:37.081 --> 00:53:41.280
And you can get some sense of some remains of some of the stucco that was

861
00:53:41.281 --> 00:53:42.510
stuccoed over in white.

862
00:53:42.511 --> 00:53:46.440
So that from a distance at least you would have the impression that the whole

863
00:53:46.441 --> 00:53:48.750
building was made out of stone and even stone.

864
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:52.820
You might even be fooled into thinking it wasn't travertine,
it was marble.
Uh,

865
00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:54.720
if you were far enough away.

866
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:59.130
I also need to mention something very important for the future of Roman

867
00:53:59.131 --> 00:54:04.110
architecture.
And that is that concrete construction was used in the podium.

868
00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.080
You don't see it.
It was only used inside the podium.

869
00:54:07.081 --> 00:54:10.650
The reason it was used inside the podium is concrete is very strong.

870
00:54:10.651 --> 00:54:12.090
It can sustain great weight.

871
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:16.380
And the Romans recognized very early on that they could use it and utilitarian

872
00:54:16.381 --> 00:54:21.270
ways,
uh,
to help support buildings.
At this particular time,
the concrete,

873
00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:24.210
um,
was,
uh,
you know,

874
00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:29.300
was made up of rubble and liquid mortar and a kind of dash of volcanic dust.

875
00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:31.630
And they brought all of that together,
uh,

876
00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:35.010
to create a material that could sustain a great wait.

877
00:54:35.011 --> 00:54:37.160
So they use it here for utilitarian purposes where,

878
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.500
but we're going to see already next Tuesday,
uh,

879
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:44.010
the Romans beginning to take advantage of concrete for,
uh,

880
00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:48.810
for a very expressive purposes and,
and how well they do it,

881
00:54:48.811 --> 00:54:53.250
which culminates ultimately obviously in buildings like the Pantheon and it's

882
00:54:53.251 --> 00:54:54.420
incredible don't,

883
00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:59.670
here's the detail of the ionic capitals of the,
uh,
temple,

884
00:54:59.671 --> 00:55:00.330
a port Tunis.

885
00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:03.840
You can also see this building has as it would have if it were made in Greece,

886
00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:08.520
what's called an ionic frieze and Ionic frieze,
which if you look very carefully,

887
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:13.440
there's some remains of the candelabra and the garlands that hung from those

888
00:55:13.441 --> 00:55:17.190
candelabra,
uh,
in the original design of this temple.

889
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.830
I also think it's interesting to look,

890
00:55:19.831 --> 00:55:22.740
here's a view again of the Temple of Port Tunis as it looks today.

891
00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:27.030
This is a 19th century painting of the Temple of Port Tunis.

892
00:55:27.031 --> 00:55:30.120
As it looked at the time it was done by that artist.

893
00:55:30.121 --> 00:55:32.940
And what you see is something that I have already alluded to,

894
00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:37.800
but which is extremely important for,
uh,
the preservation of buildings like this.

895
00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:40.110
And that is that this building,

896
00:55:40.111 --> 00:55:44.340
the temple of port tune is like so many in Rome was reused in later times and

897
00:55:44.341 --> 00:55:46.110
transformed into something else.

898
00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:49.880
And it is probably only because it was transformed into something else that
it's,

899
00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:54.540
that it survived as well as it did because you can see that what happened is

900
00:55:54.541 --> 00:55:59.020
that they walled in the front.
Uh,
they gave it a fee,
a real facade,
uh,

901
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:01.330
a doorway,
three windows,
uh,

902
00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:05.490
a medallion with the Madonna across at the top of Bell Tower.

903
00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:08.730
And they turned it into a church and they turned it into a church.
And it,

904
00:56:08.731 --> 00:56:11.910
because it was an active church,
uh,
it was kept in good shape.

905
00:56:11.911 --> 00:56:16.911
You can see those ionic capitals and the freeze with the garlands and so on of

906
00:56:17.281 --> 00:56:20.220
the Temple of Port Tunis.
And you can also see the round temple,
by the way,

907
00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:24.730
which still does Sam stand also over here.
Uh,
right near it,
near the Tiber river.

908
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:26.600
Uh,
so this is the reason that we were,

909
00:56:26.601 --> 00:56:30.400
we are fortunate that the Temple of port tune is survives and it does survive in

910
00:56:30.401 --> 00:56:34.930
large part because again,
it was transformed into a church in later times.

911
00:56:34.931 --> 00:56:38.710
And this is one of the fascinations of Rome,
by the way.
You never know.
I mean,

912
00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:41.560
so many churches mask earlier buildings.

913
00:56:41.561 --> 00:56:44.890
There's one right near not too far from these,
uh,

914
00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:49.090
where you can actually see three Roman temples that stood side by sides.

915
00:56:49.091 --> 00:56:53.510
His son were,
were incorporated into the churches,
saw Nick Nicola Karcher a,
uh,

916
00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:56.980
and you can actually see the remains of all three of those temples,
uh,

917
00:56:57.050 --> 00:57:01.630
used in PR in that church.
And it's one of the fascinations obviously,

918
00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:06.610
of wandering around the city of Rome.
The other two,
the other two,
uh,

919
00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:08.740
temples that I want to show you today.

920
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:13.720
We're looking back at the map of this particular area are located at Corey.

921
00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:16.750
And you can see the proximity of Corey,
not just to Rome,

922
00:57:16.751 --> 00:57:19.030
but also to Ostia right here,

923
00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:22.030
the city of Corey and the city of Tivoli.

924
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:26.770
And now you see Tivoli from we're travertine comes the location of Tivoli in

925
00:57:26.771 --> 00:57:29.230
relationship again to Rome.
It's not very far,

926
00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:34.060
which is why the building material was so easily transportable from Tivoli to

927
00:57:34.061 --> 00:57:36.310
Rome.
Let's look first at Cory.

928
00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:39.370
Cory is one of those incredible you,

929
00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:43.630
those of you have traveled around Italy,
you know,

930
00:57:43.631 --> 00:57:45.460
outside of roam around Italy.
No,

931
00:57:45.461 --> 00:57:49.420
that one of the glories of traveling in Italy is to go into some of these

932
00:57:49.421 --> 00:57:52.910
medieval hilltowns.
You go into these places and you,
you,

933
00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.660
whether by car or by bus or cab,

934
00:57:55.661 --> 00:57:59.440
you make your way up to the very peak of that hill town.

935
00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:01.060
It's very picturesque.

936
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:04.330
And then ultimately you get to the top and you stand up there and you get this

937
00:58:04.331 --> 00:58:08.320
incredible panorama over the city and over the landscape.
Uh,

938
00:58:08.321 --> 00:58:11.950
that's the kind of place Corey is.
It's a medieval Hilltown.
Uh,

939
00:58:11.951 --> 00:58:13.120
but leave it to the Romans.

940
00:58:13.121 --> 00:58:15.580
And they had a knack for doing this wherever they went.

941
00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:19.450
They found the best location in Corey,
uh,
for their temple.

942
00:58:19.451 --> 00:58:24.250
And this temple is located almost at the very peak of the hill of Corey.

943
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:27.460
Uh,
and usually you have to drive all the way up to see the temple.

944
00:58:27.461 --> 00:58:30.010
The so called Temple of Hercules at Cory.

945
00:58:30.011 --> 00:58:32.050
We don't really know if this was put up to Hercules,

946
00:58:32.051 --> 00:58:34.570
but it's been called the temple of Hercules for a long time.

947
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:38.890
So we continue to call it that.
Uh,
and you see it here in plan,

948
00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:42.490
in restored view with its little complex in front,
uh,

949
00:58:42.491 --> 00:58:44.680
and then the temple as it looks today.

950
00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:49.950
So looking at this one then we can see again that we are dealing with an a trust

951
00:58:50.011 --> 00:58:54.730
can plan a with freestanding columns in the porch.
You can't see it here,

952
00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:57.940
but you can up there.
It does have a single staircase.

953
00:58:57.941 --> 00:58:59.590
It's a kind of pyramidal staircase.

954
00:58:59.591 --> 00:59:02.620
It has a side as well as a front or sides as well as friends.

955
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:07.330
But you can see it does not go all the way around as a Greek,
uh,
as a Greek,

956
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:10.960
um,
staircase would've,
it's focused on the front.

957
00:59:10.961 --> 00:59:15.130
So we once again have this idea of single staircase on the front facade

958
00:59:15.131 --> 00:59:19.180
orientation of the temple,
deep porch,
freestanding columns in that porch,

959
00:59:19.181 --> 00:59:21.560
single seller.
In this case.
Now,
Neil,

960
00:59:21.561 --> 00:59:23.390
what happens when you go around and this one?

961
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.160
<v 1>Yup.
Yup.
Well it's good.
I mean there's no columns around.</v>

962
00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:33.370
<v 0>There are no columns are no columns.
It's not a peripheral colonnade.
It's not an,</v>

963
00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:36.740
it's not a suit all crypto cause it doesn't have coffee.
But what is this?

964
00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:44.070
And they look sort of like flat columns.
There are what are called Pilasters,
p I,

965
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:49.200
P I l a s t e r s pilasters which are essentially flat columns also.

966
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:53.560
It does have some articulation.
You can see them up there is,

967
00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:56.800
there is articulation but it's been flattened out still further.

968
00:59:57.010 --> 01:00:01.420
So once again in the trust can plan with some nod to Greece in the sense that

969
01:00:01.421 --> 01:00:04.810
there's a recognition we've got have something that goes around here but they

970
01:00:04.811 --> 01:00:05.680
don't want to take it out.

971
01:00:05.681 --> 01:00:09.760
They don't want to use an actual column and they flatten it out.
Uh,

972
01:00:09.761 --> 01:00:13.400
as you can see,
so well here.
Now again,
anyone who knows your orders,

973
01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:18.040
what order is,
what Greek order is used here in this building.
Yep.
The doric,

974
01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:22.300
the doric order,
the most,
the simplest and most severe order is used here,

975
01:00:22.301 --> 01:00:27.130
the Greek doric order and the system of Greek.
Try glyphs and met,

976
01:00:27.131 --> 01:00:28.690
appease,
try glyphs and metaphase.

977
01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:31.750
I'll show you a detail in a moment and I'll explain what those are.

978
01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:35.800
So the Greek doric order try glyphs and Mehta piece,
uh,
for this temple.

979
01:00:35.801 --> 01:00:39.880
And one thing we couldn't see and that plan a is the high podium.

980
01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:43.180
So that's another,
a trust skin feature.
So once again,

981
01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:45.730
we see this very interesting and very eclectic,

982
01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:50.880
bringing together all the trust and elements and Greek elements in early in what

983
01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:55.210
we can call early Roman temple architecture.

984
01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:59.580
Here's another detail of the temple at Cory.
Uh,
you can get a size.
This was like,

985
01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:01.240
I took this on a very gray day,

986
01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:05.780
so you don't get the sense of the glory of what it can look like up there.
Uh,

987
01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:09.880
but you get some sense of its situation right at the edge,
uh,
with a,

988
01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:13.000
with a spectacular,
on a beautiful day,

989
01:01:13.001 --> 01:01:15.550
spectacular panorama of the mountains,

990
01:01:15.551 --> 01:01:18.490
the other mountains in this area and of the Hilltown itself.

991
01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.950
And here we can see the doric order better,

992
01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:25.930
very simple with the soap called try glyphs and met a t,
R I,
G,

993
01:01:25.931 --> 01:01:30.220
l,
Y p.
H.
E n n e t.
O.
P.
E.
S.
Try glyphs and Mehta piece.

994
01:01:30.221 --> 01:01:34.930
Tried lifts are triple strided bands.
Uh,
and you can see them up there,

995
01:01:34.931 --> 01:01:38.290
the triples,
right and bands and inbetween them square panels.

996
01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:41.920
So this alteration of triple strided,
Brooke,
blah bands,

997
01:01:41.921 --> 01:01:45.850
the tribe glyphs and the square panels,
the metal piece,
which is,
uh,

998
01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.810
which is typical of the doric order,
the Greek doric order.

999
01:01:49.811 --> 01:01:52.770
You see it in the Parthenon,
for example,
and it has been,
uh,

1000
01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:54.640
taken over here by the Romans.

1001
01:01:54.850 --> 01:01:58.180
You also see something very interesting about Roman building practice here

1002
01:01:58.181 --> 01:01:59.710
because if you look at the columns,

1003
01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:03.880
you'll see that the upper part of the columns are what is called fluted,
fluted.

1004
01:02:03.881 --> 01:02:07.360
They have striations in them,
uh,
and uh,

1005
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:10.240
but they're not fluted at the bottom.
You can see it stops right here.

1006
01:02:10.241 --> 01:02:14.920
The fluting stops here and the bottom is playing.
What's the reason for that?

1007
01:02:14.921 --> 01:02:18.490
Well,
we know that even in Greek Hellenistic Times that tech tech,

1008
01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:23.070
not that that approach was taken,
uh,
and we believe it was done for two reasons.

1009
01:02:23.071 --> 01:02:26.430
One practical purposes.
Uh,
why are they not there?

1010
01:02:26.431 --> 01:02:30.660
No flutes at the bottom because people are more likely to lean up against the

1011
01:02:30.661 --> 01:02:33.480
columns at the bottom than they are obviously at the top.

1012
01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:37.950
And when people lean up against columns,
the flutes start to break off.
Uh,

1013
01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:39.930
so they decided not to flute the bottom,

1014
01:02:39.931 --> 01:02:43.560
but it may have been also for decorative reasons because we'll see when we get

1015
01:02:43.561 --> 01:02:48.561
to palm pay in the very near future that there are many columns at Pompei that

1016
01:02:48.871 --> 01:02:52.980
have a floating at the top painted white.
And then the bottom,

1017
01:02:52.981 --> 01:02:57.300
the plane bottom painted red,
uh,
for reasons of taste and decoration.

1018
01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:00.000
And it's very possible we do know that ancient,

1019
01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:01.800
I don't want to destroy any illusions here,

1020
01:03:01.801 --> 01:03:05.970
but ms to ancient buildings were very often painted and ancient sculpture was

1021
01:03:05.971 --> 01:03:07.290
always painted.
Uh,

1022
01:03:07.310 --> 01:03:11.280
so these might have been a lot more garish looking in ancient times than they

1023
01:03:11.281 --> 01:03:11.791
are today,

1024
01:03:11.791 --> 01:03:15.310
which might also have taken away from this sense of having a marble building.

1025
01:03:15.311 --> 01:03:19.440
So that's something that we probably should keep in mind as we evaluate these

1026
01:03:19.441 --> 01:03:20.274
structures.

1027
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:24.960
The last one I want to show you today is the temple of Vesta at Tivoli.

1028
01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:30.360
Also beautifully situated.
It's a temple.
The dates to ADBC also,

1029
01:03:30.361 --> 01:03:33.980
probably not a temple of Vesta,
but it's around temple and Temple's of Vesta.

1030
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:38.010
We're up and round,
so it's tended to be called by scholars,
the temple of Vesta,

1031
01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:42.330
uh,
in ADBC.
Again,
beautifully situated out over a,
a,

1032
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:44.540
a particularly verdant,
uh,

1033
01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:49.570
area of Tivoli where you can look down and around this beautiful area,

1034
01:03:49.951 --> 01:03:52.680
this of waterfall,
very nearby.
It's just magnificent.

1035
01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:57.360
And you can see it's not surprising that some enterprising family decided to

1036
01:03:57.361 --> 01:04:01.130
build the Sybilla a restaurant,
uh,
right here.
Uh,
and there's,
uh,

1037
01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.730
there's a patio on which one can go and eat under umbrellas and so on and so

1038
01:04:05.731 --> 01:04:10.350
forth.
Uh,
here,
here's the temple,
the ancient temple of ADBC.

1039
01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:13.750
And once again,
we look at a plan over here.
Uh,

1040
01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.300
and I also show you a view of the so called Temple of Venus from Hadrian's villa

1041
01:04:18.301 --> 01:04:22.140
activity.
Just to make the point that,
um,
this is,

1042
01:04:22.141 --> 01:04:25.710
this is as Greek as we've gotten thus far in the sense that the Greeks really

1043
01:04:25.711 --> 01:04:28.560
loved round temples.
They built them a lot.

1044
01:04:28.561 --> 01:04:33.561
There was a very famous temple of Venus and their case Aphrodite on the island

1045
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:35.400
of Kauai,
Dos,
uh,

1046
01:04:35.401 --> 01:04:38.850
and that temple of Venus on the island of tonight oss is the one that was

1047
01:04:38.851 --> 01:04:41.050
duplicated by Hadrian for his villain.

1048
01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:42.840
We'll talk about this later in the semester,

1049
01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:46.050
but I showed the one at Hadrian's villa because it gives you a very good sense

1050
01:04:46.051 --> 01:04:49.530
of what this structure was like in ancient Greek times as well.

1051
01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:52.200
Because we think it's a replica around structure,

1052
01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:56.880
freestanding columns in circling the entire building,
low podium,

1053
01:04:57.070 --> 01:05:01.830
a staircase around that podium that encircled the entire building and then a

1054
01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:06.240
temple of Venus in the center.
Uh,
when we look at the plan of this structure,

1055
01:05:06.241 --> 01:05:09.990
we will see it's pretty close.
It's round,
it's got temples that are free.

1056
01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:13.620
It has columns that are freestanding that and circle the entire structure,

1057
01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:20.290
but it has a higher,
as we're going to see.
And even though it's circular,

1058
01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:24.700
they'd given it a staircase on one side a which gives it even,

1059
01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:27.840
even even around temple,
which you think of something you'd just keep circling.

1060
01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:32.530
Circling has a kind of facade orientation in this instance.
So they are,

1061
01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:36.540
so they are applying some of these Etruscan skin characteristics to a,

1062
01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:40.570
an almost pure,
uh,
Greek type.
Here's a view.

1063
01:05:40.571 --> 01:05:41.860
It's very well preserved,

1064
01:05:41.861 --> 01:05:45.970
a view of the temple of Vesta actively as it looks today.
Uh,

1065
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:50.710
and what order is this?
The Corinthian order,

1066
01:05:50.711 --> 01:05:54.790
the Corinthian,
the last of the three great Greek orders,
the Corinthian order,

1067
01:05:54.791 --> 01:05:57.340
which is very ornate,
which I'll describe in a moment.

1068
01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.280
We see it here supporting a freeze.

1069
01:06:00.281 --> 01:06:04.840
Once again in this case of freeze with garlands and libation dishes.
Uh,

1070
01:06:04.841 --> 01:06:07.540
we can see here also,
it is a very tall podium.

1071
01:06:07.541 --> 01:06:11.950
So an imposition of an Etruscan element on this structure.
Uh,

1072
01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:16.150
Greek orders,
uh,
the,
the,
the,
the building is made out of stone,

1073
01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:18.040
the columns and the base,

1074
01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:22.900
the columns and the facing of the base are made out of stone.
In this case,

1075
01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.470
a travertine,
once again,
travertine again was quarried right next door.
I mean,

1076
01:06:26.471 --> 01:06:28.630
this is Tivoli right there.
Uh,

1077
01:06:28.631 --> 01:06:33.250
and you can see the travertine detailing on the doorway and on the windows as

1078
01:06:33.251 --> 01:06:36.670
well.
Uh,
but what you see here that we haven't seen before,

1079
01:06:36.671 --> 01:06:38.570
remember I talked about the use of,

1080
01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:43.300
of concrete in the podium of the temple pour Tunis in Rome.

1081
01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:46.540
Here we see concrete use for the wall of the Sella.

1082
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:48.610
If the Greeks had put up this building,

1083
01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:52.300
they would have made the walls of the cella out of stone and they would have cut

1084
01:06:52.301 --> 01:06:56.410
those stones very carefully to create the kind of curvature that was needed.

1085
01:06:56.590 --> 01:07:00.070
But the Romans were getting really smart in terms of making things easier for

1086
01:07:00.071 --> 01:07:00.581
themselves.

1087
01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:05.290
They realize it was going to be a lot easier to build a round structure with

1088
01:07:05.291 --> 01:07:09.310
concrete than it was to have to carve all those stones and just those and just

1089
01:07:09.311 --> 01:07:12.910
those shapes.
So they have used concrete here for the seller.

1090
01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:16.810
We still could argue this is utilitarian purpose,
but at the same time,

1091
01:07:16.811 --> 01:07:20.410
I think it's beginning to demonstrate straight to us the expressive

1092
01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:25.390
possibilities of concrete.
Uh,
and we also see if you look very carefully,
uh,

1093
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:30.420
the way in which we'll talk much more about this next week,
but concrete,
uh,

1094
01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:34.690
in order to make concrete,
impermeable to water and so on and so forth,

1095
01:07:34.691 --> 01:07:36.220
you have to face it with something.

1096
01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:39.790
And they faced it with very small stones of irregular shape,

1097
01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:42.850
which we call uncertain work or opus and carried on.

1098
01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:47.830
But we can copy us new word,
Inc e r t u m opus,
and carried them,

1099
01:07:47.831 --> 01:07:52.270
which is put into the concrete wall.
It is still wet to give it,

1100
01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:57.040
to give it the ability to withstand water,
but also to give it an attractive,

1101
01:07:57.210 --> 01:08:01.840
a stone like appearance.
And you can see that opus and Keratin work used here.

1102
01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:08.160
Here's a detail of the wall where you can see its curvature and also see,
uh,

1103
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:12.790
that opus and character work.
And here is a detail of the capital's,

1104
01:08:12.791 --> 01:08:14.950
the Corinthian capitals that are used here.

1105
01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:20.070
What's characteristic of Corinthian capitals is that they have like,

1106
01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:24.440
like uh,
the eye on it.
I'd like the Ionic,
they have volume to the spiral volumes,

1107
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.120
but they are much more,

1108
01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:30.650
they are much smaller and much more delicate and they are in a sense

1109
01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:35.450
incorporated into the flowering plant.
This is called an a canvas plant,

1110
01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:40.460
a c,
a n t h u s a canvas plants grow all over Italy.

1111
01:08:40.461 --> 01:08:42.980
You see them everywhere.
Uh,
so they are just image.

1112
01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:47.600
They're just copying a plant that is indigenous to Italy.
They use those,

1113
01:08:47.601 --> 01:08:52.601
a campus leaves that seem to grow out of the column to incorporate the spirals

1114
01:08:53.541 --> 01:08:55.190
and there's always a,
uh,

1115
01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:59.450
a prominent central flower that is also part of this motif.

1116
01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:04.280
It's important to note at the beginning that while the Greeks use the doric and

1117
01:09:04.281 --> 01:09:08.720
the ionic order almost exclusively,
the Greeks did invent the Corinthian order.

1118
01:09:08.721 --> 01:09:10.730
They used it in very late Hellenistic tums,

1119
01:09:10.731 --> 01:09:14.420
but quite infrequently the Romans used all three.

1120
01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:19.370
But we are going to see very quickly that they decide pretty early on that they

1121
01:09:19.371 --> 01:09:24.080
eye on that the Corinthian capital is their capital and almost every building

1122
01:09:24.081 --> 01:09:25.160
we'll see some exceptions,

1123
01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:29.390
but almost every building we'll see in the course of the semester uses the

1124
01:09:29.391 --> 01:09:33.740
Corinthian capital.
Why did they take to the Corinthian capital in particular?
Uh,

1125
01:09:33.741 --> 01:09:36.620
this is something we can think about in the courses a semester and debate.

1126
01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:39.590
I think it has to do probably with two major reasons.
One,

1127
01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:43.280
it was particularly decorative,
very highly decorative,
more so than the others,

1128
01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:48.140
but maybe even more important than that is the fact that the Corinthian capital,

1129
01:09:48.141 --> 01:09:49.340
at least in my opinion,

1130
01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:53.600
looks the best from the most vantage points because it's pretty much the same

1131
01:09:53.601 --> 01:09:57.080
all the way around.
Uh,
the,
the Doric is pretty severe.

1132
01:09:57.230 --> 01:10:00.970
The ionic looks best from certain angles where you can really see the volume as

1133
01:10:00.971 --> 01:10:02.540
well,
less wealth from other angles.

1134
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:07.100
But this looks pretty much the same wherever you see it.
So it's a very flexible,

1135
01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:12.230
uh,
and,
and easily easy to use a capital type.
We see also here,

1136
01:10:12.231 --> 01:10:13.430
I've referred to this last time,

1137
01:10:13.431 --> 01:10:17.530
but I want to describe it for you just in the second we see here,
the um,

1138
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:21.080
the uh,
core offering,
c,
O,
f,
F,
e,
r,
I,N ,
g,

1139
01:10:21.081 --> 01:10:24.320
the offering of the ceiling,
which is basically placing,

1140
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:29.830
placing a series of receiving a square elements there to give the sense of depth

1141
01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.860
or in the,
uh,
in the ceiling.

1142
01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.430
And then in the center you see these flowers that match up nicely with those in

1143
01:10:37.431 --> 01:10:41.510
the Corinthian capitals,
which are called Rosettes,
r,
O,
s,
e,
t,
t,
s,

1144
01:10:41.511 --> 01:10:45.950
and we'll see core offering and the use of rosettes quite extensively in Roman

1145
01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:48.900
architecture.
I mentioned the restaurant,
uh,

1146
01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.550
the Sabella used to be a horrendous restaurant.
I,
I was,

1147
01:10:52.551 --> 01:10:54.590
when I started taking pictures of Roman buildings,

1148
01:10:54.591 --> 01:10:57.800
I guess there's a little more timid than I am today.
So I always thought,
well,

1149
01:10:57.801 --> 01:11:00.350
Gee,
if I'm going to go into the terrorist and want to take the picture of the

1150
01:11:00.351 --> 01:11:03.560
temple,
I'm kind of going to have to eat there.
I would never do that now,

1151
01:11:03.561 --> 01:11:04.770
but I did that at one point.

1152
01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.700
I made the mistake of eating in this restaurant twice and I never went back

1153
01:11:07.701 --> 01:11:11.030
again.
Uh,
but when I went just a couple of years ago to see the temple,

1154
01:11:11.031 --> 01:11:14.450
once again,
I saw that they had really,
some new owners must have come along.

1155
01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.000
They've really expanded.
The restaurant looks very pretty now.
Uh,

1156
01:11:18.001 --> 01:11:20.460
and this is the terrorism,
which one can eat?
I haven't tried it,

1157
01:11:20.461 --> 01:11:23.220
but I might actually next time I go,

1158
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:27.120
I want to just end with a couple of remarks.

1159
01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:31.250
One is that one of the interesting things is that all,

1160
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:32.450
although the sto,

1161
01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:36.330
the temples that we talked about today were in part made out of stone in all

1162
01:11:36.331 --> 01:11:37.530
cases travertine.

1163
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:42.150
We do know that already in the year 146 BC,

1164
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:47.100
so earlier than a couple of the temples we looked at just now and one 46 BC,

1165
01:11:47.101 --> 01:11:50.280
they had the Romans had already ready put up a temple,

1166
01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:55.340
another temple to Jupiter near the Tiber river that was made entirely of marble

1167
01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.760
entirely of marble.

1168
01:11:56.761 --> 01:12:00.390
So they were already beginning to think not just of their own local stone or

1169
01:12:00.391 --> 01:12:03.990
stones that were from local play close places in Italy,
but,

1170
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.290
but imported marble.
Uh,
and uh,

1171
01:12:07.291 --> 01:12:10.560
so I want to you to know that so that we can talk about it in the future.

1172
01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.020
And we also know that in one 42,

1173
01:12:13.050 --> 01:12:16.380
the ceiling of the temple of Jupiter Omc was gilded.

1174
01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:21.830
And we also know that not long after that they repaved the temple of Jupiter Omc

1175
01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.890
and gave it a multicolored stone.

1176
01:12:24.891 --> 01:12:27.960
So what this is telling us is that a lot of people in Rome,

1177
01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:30.090
we're beginning to think of,

1178
01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:33.810
of temples that were more ornate than anything had become,

1179
01:12:33.811 --> 01:12:36.090
had come before anything that had come before.

1180
01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:39.900
There are some very conservative individuals who did some writing at this

1181
01:12:39.901 --> 01:12:43.020
particular time who bemoan the fact that they had,

1182
01:12:43.021 --> 01:12:47.070
that the Romans had moved away from the trust in temples made out of wood and

1183
01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:51.180
mud brick and so on and were becoming too ostentatious in their taste.

1184
01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:55.170
But I think these new Greek style temples,
we're definitely here to stay.

1185
01:12:55.410 --> 01:12:59.180
And I just wanted to end up with a quote from Cicero,
uh,

1186
01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:02.550
after one of these fires,
these fires that so often raged in Rome,

1187
01:13:02.551 --> 01:13:06.520
the great fire of 83 BC,
uh,
Cicero,
uh,

1188
01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:11.010
talks about the,
the rebuilding still again at the temple of Jupiter Omc.

1189
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:14.130
And I quote from Cicero when he says,
let us feel,

1190
01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:19.190
let us feel that conflagration to have been the will of heaven and it's purpose

1191
01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:22.500
not to destroy the Temple of Almighty Jupiter,

1192
01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:27.390
but to demand of us.
One more splendid and magnificent.

1193
01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:31.470
What did that mean?
More Greek,
more Greek looking,
more marble.

1194
01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:36.500
And last comment I'm going to make is to make the temple of Jupiter Omc even

1195
01:13:37.291 --> 01:13:38.250
more magnificent.

1196
01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:42.450
The Roman general seller who was sacking Athens at this particular time,

1197
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:47.340
goes into Athens.
And after he sacks,
it takes it over,
conquers it.

1198
01:13:47.670 --> 01:13:52.530
He goes up to the biggest temple in town,
the temple of Olympian Zeus,
Zeus,

1199
01:13:52.531 --> 01:13:56.910
the Greek counterpart of Jupiter.
And he takes some of the Collins,

1200
01:13:56.911 --> 01:14:00.540
actually steals some of the columns from that temple,

1201
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:04.890
has them shipped back to Rome and he incorporates them into the temple of

1202
01:14:04.891 --> 01:14:09.540
Jupiter.
Omc on the capital line hill,
these columns,
my last point,

1203
01:14:09.690 --> 01:14:14.650
these columns were 55 and one half feet tall.

1204
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:17.770
Uh,
so that,
and they were made of solid marble.

1205
01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:21.610
So that gives you some sense of the objectives of the Romans visa be temple

1206
01:14:21.611 --> 01:14:25.330
building,
uh,
in the first century BC.
