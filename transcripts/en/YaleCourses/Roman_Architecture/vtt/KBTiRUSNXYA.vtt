1
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.020
Good morning everyone back back to Rome today,
back to Rome,

2
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.380
which was beginning to emerge as the worlds or the ancient world's greatest

3
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:17.511
super power and emergence that we're going to see had a profound impact on Roman

4
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.130
architecture.

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.050
And we'll also see that there were a number of men who affected,
uh,

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.140
this superstardom for Rome and they're men that I'm going to talk about and talk

7
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:35.070
about with you today.
These included Julius Caesar Pompey,

8
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:40.071
the Great Mark Antony and Octavian Augustus especially Octavian Augustus

9
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.770
Augustus,
first emperor of Rome.

10
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.780
And it's the reason that I've decided to call this lecture today from brick to

11
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:52.200
marble,
Augustus assembles Rome.

12
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.370
You see on the left hand side of the screen,
a portrait of Julius Caesar.

13
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.960
It's a green diabase portrait of Caesar.
It's now in Berlin.

14
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.120
And I believe actually that it is a portrait that was commissioned by Cleopatra

15
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:09.954
herself.

16
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.940
She commissioned it for a building that she and Cesar were putting up,

17
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:19.350
an Alexandria called the Kaiser.
He them that honored Cesar.

18
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.070
Uh,
and you can see that he is represented as he was.

19
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:27.210
It's a quite realistic portrait with the lines and wrinkles with his,

20
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.620
a receding hairline and so on,
uh,
accentuated in this portrait.

21
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.330
On the right hand side of the screen,
we see an image of Pompey,
the great,
uh,

22
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:41.100
a marble portrait that is now in the knee,
Carlsberg,
glip ditech in Copenhagen,

23
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.860
and a portrait that shows that Pompey the great,

24
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.810
very much wanted to ally himself with Alexander the great because if you look at

25
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:52.980
his very full head of hair,
you can see that he wears it in the center,
uh,

26
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.850
pushed up in a kind of pump a door,

27
00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.070
which is a reference to the same kind of upsweep that was worn by Alexander the

28
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.770
Great,
I want to give you a few,

29
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.910
I want to give you a little bit of information about Caesar,
about his life,

30
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:10.530
about some of his accomplishments,

31
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.190
because these are going to have an impact on the architecture,

32
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.640
on our discussion of the architecture that he commissioned in Rome.

33
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.770
We know that Caesar was elected console in 59 BC.

34
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.010
He then joined with Pompey the great and with a man by the name of Crassus to

35
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:32.940
form.
What is known as the first triumvirate.
The,

36
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.830
the result of that first triumvirate was in part that Caesar received,

37
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.250
uh,
a console ship in Gaul.
Uh,

38
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.300
but despite all good intentions,
just a few years later,

39
00:02:45.301 --> 00:02:49.140
in 54 BC,
the triumvirate fell apart.

40
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.570
Difficult Times,
uh,

41
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.100
where the case in Rome between 53 and 50 BC,

42
00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.290
there were food shortages and riots in the city.
Uh,

43
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.310
and the Senate was very concerned that these uprisings would leave lead to a

44
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:09.010
takeover by the populous of the city.

45
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.960
Pompey took charge,
he took control of the Senate and he restored order.

46
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.350
And His reward for so doing is that the Senate was willing to work with him to

47
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:21.910
try to overthrow his rival.

48
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.800
That is Julius Caesar Crassus the other member of the triumph.

49
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.430
It had since died.

50
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.180
But Caesar got the upper hand at the end of the day.

51
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:35.830
And it was Cesar who defeated Pompey the great at a very famous battle,

52
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:38.200
the battle of far solace,
uh,

53
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:43.201
which took place in 48 BC after the battle of our solace and his defeat by

54
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:49.510
Julius Caesar,
Pompey fled to Egypt where he was murdered.

55
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.501
And in fact,

56
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:55.501
the Egyptian slit Pompey's head put it on a plate and presented it to Caesar.

57
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.240
Now you think Cesar would have been happy about that?

58
00:03:58.241 --> 00:04:02.410
He wasn't because although he was thrilled to have defeated Pompey the great,
uh,

59
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:05.230
he did not,
he did not like seeing a,

60
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:09.760
the head of a fellow Roman delivered to him on a plate.

61
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.690
Uh,
Cesar at that point,
despite his victory,

62
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.750
what was foremost in his mind was his affair with Cleopatra and he stayed in

63
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:22.800
Egypt with Cleopatra for a period of time.
Uh,

64
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.770
but in 45 BC,
by 45 BC,
he had returned to Rome.

65
00:04:26.771 --> 00:04:31.771
He was acclaimed dictator in that year in 45 and after that he pursued fiscal

66
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:35.080
reforms for Rome.

67
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.910
And also he commissioned a number of very important public works.

68
00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:41.320
And that's where,
uh,

69
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.350
Roman architecture obviously comes into play despite the fact that he initiated

70
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:50.960
those reforms and built buildings and,
uh,
you know,

71
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.070
built up that the city and interesting ways,
uh,

72
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.380
the aristocrats and Rome considered Caesar retirement.

73
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.360
They considered him a tyrant because they felt that the influence of Cleopatra

74
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.860
had rubbed off too much on him.
And his ambitions were two much monarchical,

75
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.400
uh,
and the aristocrats,
uh,
encouraged,
uh,

76
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.450
his murder and he was assassinated.
As all of you know,

77
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.750
by Cassius and Brutus in the year 44 BC on the ides of March,

78
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.700
uh,
anti was divinized by the Senate.

79
00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:26.701
He was made a god by the Senate in the year 42 BC in his biography of Julius

80
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.510
Caesar,
the,
uh,
the writer,

81
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.560
a Tony's bus who was a secretary and a biog refer to the emperor Hadrian and the

82
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:39.550
second century A.
Dot.
D.

83
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.360
So at Tony is wrote a biography of the 12 Caesars,

84
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:48.070
a very famous biography that many of you may know served as the basis for Robert

85
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.610
Graves,
a very well known I,
Claudius,
uh,

86
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.480
which also accentuates again the biographies of those first 12.
CAESARS.

87
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.490
And although Caesar himself was dictate or not emperor,

88
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:03.290
he is the first of the Caesars who is covered by sue at Tony's.
And in Sua,

89
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:05.780
Tony is his biography of Julius Caesar.

90
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.990
He tells us about some of these major architectural commissions that Caesar

91
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.860
embarked on in Rome.

92
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.460
And it's interesting to read about these because we'll see that all of them see,

93
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.560
seem to have been the best and the greatest.

94
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:26.561
And I think one of the explanations for this is the time that Caesar's spent in

95
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.580
Alexandria,
in Egypt with Cleopatra.
She wanted to show him the sites.
And in fact,

96
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:36.581
they went on a very famous barge trip together down the Nile in which she showed

97
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:41.000
him the pyramids.
And the Sphinx is a,
that we're there to be seen.

98
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:45.740
And he was extremely impressed by what he saw in Egypt and decided,

99
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.290
uh,

100
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.510
that one of the most important things that he could do that he could contribute

101
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:52.400
to posterity visa vi Rome,

102
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.640
was to make roam into a city that was the equal of Alexandria that had similar,

103
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.760
uh,

104
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.530
large scale buildings and impressive monuments the way Alexandria did.

105
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:05.120
So he came back to Rome,

106
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.650
he undertook this major building project and Sua Tony is,

107
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:13.970
tells us that he built,
he wanted to build,
he started to build a temple to Mars.

108
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.720
That,
so at Tony has described as as the biggest in the world,

109
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.740
why to compete with the buildings of Alexandria.
A vast,

110
00:07:21.741 --> 00:07:24.080
not just a theater of vast theater,

111
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.870
a Greek and Latin public libraries.

112
00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:30.350
We know of course that the greatest library in the war and the ancient world at

113
00:07:30.351 --> 00:07:34.900
this particular time was the library at Alexandria.
So he wanted,
uh,

114
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.890
libraries in Rome that could compete with the Great Library of Alexandria.

115
00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:44.630
And he was also particularly interested in engineering marvels.

116
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:45.480
He,
uh,

117
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.590
built or he began to build a highway from the Adriatic across the APP and nines

118
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.960
to the Tiber.
And then,
uh,

119
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:58.030
most famously a canal cut through the isthmus of Corinth that was in large part

120
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.050
achieved,
uh,

121
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:05.070
and one can still see that canal if one visits Corinth in Greece today.

122
00:08:05.691 --> 00:08:08.180
So he had vast ambitions,

123
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:13.181
but many of these ambitions were cut short by his assassination in 44 BC.

124
00:08:14.481 --> 00:08:17.960
He was not able to achieve architecturally all that he had hoped.

125
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:23.450
One building that he was able to complete or almost complete,

126
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.050
uh,
was a forum in Rome.
The forum,
you,

127
00:08:28.051 --> 00:08:32.330
Liam Iul,
I,
U M,
which is after his family name,

128
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.740
you Ileus,
uh,
the form you will Liam or as we usually call it,

129
00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:39.440
the forum of Julius Caesar in Rome.

130
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.770
A was a building that he was able to begin in the year 52 BC and then it was,

131
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:52.820
um,
it was inaugurated in 46 BC,

132
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:55.620
which is a couple of years before his assassination.

133
00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.030
It wasn't quite finished at the time of its inauguration and it was left to

134
00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:01.170
Caesar's follower,

135
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:06.171
Augustus first emperor of Rome to actually complete some of the details of the

136
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:10.920
form.
But for all intents and purposes,
it was done by 46.

137
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.300
I show you a Google earth of aerial view of,
uh,

138
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.240
the Roman forum as you see it here.
We've looked at this before,
the Roman forum,

139
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:25.160
the coliseum just for you to get your bearings,
the circus maximus,

140
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.060
the Palatine Hill,
the capital line hill,
the Victor Emmanuel monument,

141
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:34.680
tear muscle [inaudible] via day fori and periodically here the so called

142
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:38.940
imperial,
four of which Augustus's forum,
which we're also gonna talk about today,

143
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:39.774
is apart.

144
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.370
The Forum of Caesar is very close to the Roman forum.

145
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.190
It's located just to the left tier and above.
Uh,

146
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.190
the wedding cake of Victor Manual.

147
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:54.330
You'll see it here and you can barely make out the three columns that are still

148
00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:59.280
preserved from the temple.
Uh,
that was located in side this forum.

149
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.500
So you can see it was adjacent to,

150
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:06.501
and in fact connected to the Roman forum that lay over here.

151
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.250
So a forum,
uh,
and in that forum,
a temple,

152
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:16.080
a temple to Venus,
Venus,
Ghana tricks,
g,
e,

153
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.240
n,
e,
t,
r,
I x,
Venus,

154
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:23.241
Ghana tricks who was the divine ancestors of the Julian family.

155
00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:28.401
The Julian family traced its ancestry back to Venus via a niece through a nice,

156
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.710
uh,
so this was the very special patron goddess of not only Caesar himself,

157
00:10:34.711 --> 00:10:37.050
but of the Julian family.

158
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:42.470
This is a plan of the forum of Julius Caesar as it would've looked a when the

159
00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:45.570
building was inaugurated in 46 BC.

160
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.110
And I think you can see here that it has,
uh,

161
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.520
two major prototypes,
uh,
that,

162
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:58.680
that models that were being looked back at when this was designed,
uh,

163
00:10:58.681 --> 00:11:00.930
beginning in 52.
Uh,

164
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.100
you can see that it is based heavily on earlier Roman forum,

165
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.960
Sam night slash Roman forum design as we saw it in the city of palm pay.

166
00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:12.600
Think of the forum of Pompei.
Uh,

167
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.560
but it also was based in part on a building that we have not looked at in which

168
00:11:16.561 --> 00:11:21.300
no longer survives but we have information about and that is that uh,
guys,

169
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.920
Maria Mercy's rhythm of Julius Caesar that he and Cleopatra put up in,

170
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.300
in Alexandria.

171
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.620
And we know enough about that building to know it too was an open rectangular

172
00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:35.850
space with colonnades around it and a temple as part of it.

173
00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:39.510
So this whole idea of temple in a rectangular complex,

174
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.180
we see it in Alexandria contemporaneously.

175
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.810
We see it earlier in Pompei at the forum of Pompei.

176
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:51.050
So a great open rectangular space open to the sky with colonnades on either

177
00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:52.944
side.

178
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:58.220
You can see on this side there are some additional chambers and based on what

179
00:11:58.361 --> 00:12:01.390
those look like and plan,
I am sure you can tell me what they are.

180
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:02.860
Does anyone know,

181
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.420
think back to what we saw in palm pay that looked similar to this.

182
00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:11.560
What are these here?
What Stowe,

183
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:16.390
Stowe storage did you say?
Or Storage?
Uh,

184
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:17.230
not exactly.

185
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:21.700
Storage shops to bear and I remember the tobacco and I that we saw fronting the

186
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:23.120
houses in palm pay.

187
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:27.730
These are a series of shops or to bear night opening off the left,

188
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.320
a colonnade of the,

189
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:34.350
of the forum and then on the sh one of the short sides pushed up against the

190
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:35.770
back wall.
In fact,

191
00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:40.771
in this case almost projecting out of the forum to a certain extent the temple

192
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:46.360
of Venus Ghana tricks we can see in plan and the dominates the space in front of

193
00:12:46.361 --> 00:12:49.950
it just as the Capitol Liam did at palm pay.
Uh,

194
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.960
we can see the general plan conforms to early Roman temple architecture as we've

195
00:12:56.711 --> 00:13:01.711
described it with its use of the trust can plan and the Greek elevation.

196
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:06.670
We can see that there is,
it has a,
well I'll show you this in a moment,

197
00:13:06.671 --> 00:13:10.390
but take my word.
It has a high podium.
It has a deep porch,

198
00:13:10.391 --> 00:13:15.290
it has freestanding columns in that porch.
It has a facade orientation,

199
00:13:15.291 --> 00:13:18.480
although one idiosyncrasy of this particular,
uh,

200
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.120
temple is that the staircase,
uh,

201
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.810
is located not just on the front but on the two sides,

202
00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:27.820
but only at the level of the podium.

203
00:13:27.821 --> 00:13:31.930
The staircase is not encircled the building as it would have and a Greek temple,

204
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:32.410
uh,

205
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:37.410
but it goes beyond the front to the sides of the podium to allow access to it

206
00:13:38.591 --> 00:13:39.700
that way as well.

207
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:45.030
A single entrance because this is a temple of Venus and not the cup and not the

208
00:13:45.761 --> 00:13:50.530
capital on triad.
And then columns,
freestanding columns on either side,

209
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:55.600
uh,
and but a flat back wall,
a very much in the trust and manner.

210
00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:59.320
So a temple that is very much in keeping with the other kind of temple

211
00:13:59.321 --> 00:14:03.880
architecture that we have seen thus far.
What significant though,

212
00:14:03.881 --> 00:14:08.500
again,
is that the choice of the choice of goddess to honor here,

213
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.750
the fact that it is Venus,
again,
a tricks,

214
00:14:10.751 --> 00:14:15.370
a personal God is from the point of view of Julius Caesar's.
Someone who was,

215
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.000
uh,
who was,
uh,
associated closely with his family,

216
00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:22.960
with the genesis of his family and not with the Roman state as a whole.

217
00:14:22.961 --> 00:14:24.690
And that's a very important distinction.

218
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:28.480
The difference between putting up a temple to the Capitol on triad,

219
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.610
a very state oriented thing to do,

220
00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:34.270
to putting up a temple to your own personal goddess.

221
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.650
It signals a certain change.
Uh,

222
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:41.130
visa vi the way these individuals thought about themselves and uh,
may,

223
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:46.170
may again have had something to do with the way Cesar was perceived in Rome and

224
00:14:46.241 --> 00:14:49.990
to his eventual demise.
In fact,
I should also add that Caesar,

225
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:55.530
because his relationship with Cleopatra ended up putting up a statue of

226
00:14:56.121 --> 00:15:00.650
Cleopatra as the Egyptian Goddess,
Isis in this temple as well,

227
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:03.860
standing right next to a venous Gannett tricks,

228
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:08.861
which was a pretty arrogant and probably a pretty stupid thing to do in

229
00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:11.130
Republican Rome,
where,
where,
uh,

230
00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.630
where Cleopatra was considered very,

231
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.860
very interesting public figure because she did come with him to visit Rome at

232
00:15:18.861 --> 00:15:21.150
one point,
uh,
but was a,

233
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:26.200
also a maligned by many among the aristocracy as an enemy of Rome.

234
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:33.490
I'm showing you here a view of the forum of Caesar as it looks today.

235
00:15:33.501 --> 00:15:38.501
And you can see the columns on the left hand side from the colonnade.

236
00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:40.530
Some of those still stand.
Uh,

237
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:45.550
you can see the staircase or the foundations of the staircase and the podium

238
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.550
tall podium again of the temple of Venus Ghana tricks.

239
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.840
But you can see that only a very small number three in fact of the columns are

240
00:15:53.841 --> 00:15:57.470
preserved.
So it is an actually quite ruined his state.
Uh,

241
00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.890
and what you're looking at here is actually not even for the most part,
the,
uh,

242
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.680
Julian a building because we know that this building was seriously damaged in a

243
00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:08.210
fire later,
uh,

244
00:16:08.211 --> 00:16:13.010
and that it was restored by the emperor demission and the late first century a d

245
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.210
and then by the emperor Trajan into the early second century Aad.

246
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.930
And so what stands today is primarily a later structure,

247
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.490
but we do believe it was based very closely on the original Julian building.

248
00:16:25.491 --> 00:16:29.720
And in that regard is a very good reflection of what it would've looked like.

249
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.900
This coin over here shows the temple as it was in the time of Julius Caesar.

250
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.440
We see,
uh,

251
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.550
the altar in the front of the altar because the sacrifice always takes place in

252
00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:42.410
front of a Roman temple.

253
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.560
The temple itself with its columns that are parted on this coin only to show the

254
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:51.500
statue of being a scan,
a tricks inside the cult statute,
uh,

255
00:16:51.501 --> 00:16:55.280
the colonnades on either side.
And then if you look closely at the pediment,

256
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:59.390
you can see that there's sculpture in there and we have literary descriptions of

257
00:16:59.391 --> 00:17:01.280
what that sculpture depicted.

258
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:04.760
And we know it was a scene of Venus rising from the sea.

259
00:17:04.761 --> 00:17:07.250
So being as good at tricks rising from the sea,

260
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:10.390
the closest thing probably to it is something like for you,

261
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.510
for those of you who know it,

262
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.520
the Bata cellies primavera in Florence is probably the sort of the idea here for

263
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:21.820
emerging from the waters and in her depiction in this particular a pediment

264
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.321
above.

265
00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:29.321
And we know that there were also scenes of cupids carrying the arms and armor

266
00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:31.700
probably of Mars.
Uh,

267
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.090
this is me with a former graduate student of mine pointing out,

268
00:17:35.091 --> 00:17:37.310
he wrote a dissertation on the Forum of Caesar,

269
00:17:37.311 --> 00:17:41.900
which was afterwards published as a book.
Uh,
but he,
he's pointing out to me,

270
00:17:41.901 --> 00:17:43.970
here are some of the,
uh,

271
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
some of the architectural detail that still survives at one can see when one

272
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:52.630
wanders through that forum today.
And,
uh,

273
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.110
you can see the very deep drill work here,

274
00:17:55.111 --> 00:17:59.220
deep drill work that is actually not characteristic of the time of Julius
Caesar,

275
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.460
but rather of the time of demission and Trajan.

276
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:07.580
So probably this decoration belongs to the later renovation of this particular

277
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.053
structure.

278
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.350
This gives you perhaps the best idea of what the temple would have looked like

279
00:18:13.351 --> 00:18:14.980
in the forum.
Uh,

280
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
a restored view of the temple of Venus Ghana tricks in the forum of Julius

281
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:25.410
Caesar with it.
It's an inscription telling us that Caesar,
a dictator of Rome,
uh,

282
00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:30.270
put it up,
fake it.
Uh,
as you can see here,
you can see the tall podium,

283
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.140
you can see the facade orientation,
although again,

284
00:18:34.141 --> 00:18:38.260
there was a staircase on the three sides of that podium.
Uh,

285
00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.670
you can see the birth of Venus in the pediment above.

286
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.860
You can see the columns over here of the side of the colonnade,

287
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:50.700
of one of the left side of the forum that would've had statues on bases,

288
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.960
the shop's behind.
Uh,
and most importantly,

289
00:18:54.961 --> 00:18:59.961
what this restored view shows you is the relationship between the temple of

290
00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:02.610
Venus,
Ghana tricks and Caesar's forum.

291
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.510
And the Capitol Liam on the top of the Capitoline hill,

292
00:19:06.511 --> 00:19:10.590
because when you take away the victor of monument of the Victor Emmanuel

293
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.860
Monument,
which is there now in which we saw in the earlier image,

294
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.420
you can see that the building that was up on top of the hill at this particular

295
00:19:18.421 --> 00:19:22.530
time was of course the capital and the temple of Jupiter Omc.

296
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:27.000
And I mentioned to you at the time we talked about the temple of Jupiter Omc,

297
00:19:27.001 --> 00:19:32.001
although the a Daleo as redesigned by Michelangelo with the Senatorial Palace in

298
00:19:33.001 --> 00:19:36.660
the back,
which is where the temple of Jupiter Omc was,

299
00:19:36.661 --> 00:19:38.190
faces modern Rome,

300
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:42.930
the ancient temple faced ancient Rome faced the Roman forum.
Uh,

301
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:46.590
and so you see it facing the Roman forum in this restored view.

302
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.660
So I don't think it was coincidental.

303
00:19:48.661 --> 00:19:52.080
The Romans were very careful as we've learned about how they cited their

304
00:19:52.081 --> 00:19:55.560
buildings and they like to make references from one building to another.

305
00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:00.120
I don't think it is any coincidence that she sees her chose this site for his

306
00:20:00.121 --> 00:20:04.590
temple of Venus so that anyone who gaze that it would also see out of the corner

307
00:20:04.591 --> 00:20:05.424
of their eye,

308
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:10.350
the Temple of the Capitol on triad on the Capitoline hill and that would only

309
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:15.351
enhance Caesar's stature in the eyes of his contemporaries.

310
00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:18.510
Uh,

311
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:23.510
you see now portraits of Marc Antony on the right hand side of the screen of

312
00:20:23.841 --> 00:20:27.390
black basalt,
portrait of Antony now in England,

313
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:32.750
and a portrait of Rome's first Emperor Octavian Augustus on the lefthand side of

314
00:20:34.171 --> 00:20:34.620
the screen,

315
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:39.620
a fantastic bronze image of him that was part of an equestrian statue found in

316
00:20:40.831 --> 00:20:43.110
the North Sea near Greece.

317
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:49.460
With regard to Antony and Octavian after Caesar's assassination in 44 BC,

318
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.640
it was Marc Antony who rose to power.

319
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.540
Octavian was only 19 at the time,

320
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.450
so your age.
Uh,

321
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.300
and he was the grand nephew of Caesar,

322
00:21:04.301 --> 00:21:08.260
so he had a familial relationship,
although a fairly distant one,

323
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:11.500
two a of the grand nephew of Caesar.

324
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.980
And this 19 year old upstart tried to overthrow Marc Antony and he was not

325
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:23.680
successful in the why's.
If you can't beat them,
join them.

326
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.250
Way of thinking about life and the world,
uh,

327
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.770
Octavian joined with Antony,

328
00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:34.771
with Mark Antony and a man by the name of Lapidus to form what we know of as the

329
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.000
second triumvirate.

330
00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:40.510
And that happened in the year 43 BC.

331
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.220
Once they had formed the,
uh,
the second triumvirate together,

332
00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:49.960
Octavian Antony took all of their military forces and each of them had a

333
00:21:49.961 --> 00:21:54.961
considerable amount and they combine them with the objective of going after

334
00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:00.130
Cassius and Brutus casters and Brutus Julio Remember,
had murdered,
uh,

335
00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.180
Caesar and they were successful at so doing.

336
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.790
They con they beat,
they beat and murdered,
uh,

337
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.760
Cassius and Brutus at the battle of Philippi in the year 42 BC,

338
00:22:12.761 --> 00:22:16.930
a very important battle.
The Battle of Philippi in 42,

339
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:21.720
B c Mark Antony,
who not only,
um,
uh,

340
00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.400
rose to power after Caesar's assassination,

341
00:22:24.401 --> 00:22:29.401
but rose in the life and times of Cleopatra they had entered into,

342
00:22:29.771 --> 00:22:33.790
well,
there's some rumors that this happened or began much earlier in time,

343
00:22:33.791 --> 00:22:35.770
but at any rate,
Mark Antony,
uh,

344
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:40.420
takes up with Cleopatra and he joins her and in Egypt and he spends a good deal

345
00:22:40.421 --> 00:22:45.421
of his time in the eastern part of the empire with his power more Octavian very

346
00:22:46.481 --> 00:22:49.360
smartly realized Antony is distracted.

347
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:54.660
This is a perfect time for me to try once again to gain the supreme power that I

348
00:22:56.681 --> 00:22:58.900
want.
I don't want to be part of a threesome.

349
00:22:58.901 --> 00:23:03.090
I want a rule Rome completely myself.
Uh,
and uh,

350
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.980
he defeats Antony and Cleopatra.

351
00:23:05.981 --> 00:23:10.720
I one of the most famous battles of all time,
the battle of Actium,

352
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.230
a naval battle,
which took place off the Northwestern coast of,

353
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:20.590
of Greece in 31 BC after that very famous battle.

354
00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:26.940
Antony and Cleopatra commit suicide and Octavian becomes the sole emperor of

355
00:23:29.411 --> 00:23:32.680
this new emerging superpower.
Uh,

356
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.290
and he is appointed as Augustus,

357
00:23:35.291 --> 00:23:40.291
which meant that he had a special kind of majesty in the year 27 BC.

358
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:47.470
We have additional information about Augustus from sewer.

359
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.360
Tony is his biography of him.
Uh,

360
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:54.690
he wrote one of him obviously as well,
and from Augustus,

361
00:23:54.691 --> 00:23:59.691
his own account of his life and of his accomplishments.

362
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:05.330
I mentioned that Octavian and that's called the rays guest di Di we out gousty.

363
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:06.080
Uh,

364
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:11.080
I mentioned that and took the title of Augustus in 27 BC and he was emperor of

365
00:24:12.021 --> 00:24:15.950
Rome for a very long time from,
uh,
the,

366
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:20.980
from that year 27 until his death in Aad 14 at the age of 76,

367
00:24:22.311 --> 00:24:25.600
which was a very ripe old age to live to a,

368
00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:28.760
at a time when most people were women were dying in childbirth.

369
00:24:28.761 --> 00:24:32.340
That 10 to 20.
And,
uh,
men,
uh,

370
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.560
we're dying for the most part in their 30.
So 76 was a very old age,

371
00:24:36.561 --> 00:24:38.330
indeed in ancient times,

372
00:24:38.331 --> 00:24:42.200
and it meant that Augustus was emperor of Rome for a very long period.
Uh,

373
00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:45.860
as you can see now at his death,
uh,
uh,

374
00:24:45.861 --> 00:24:50.330
Augustus deposited three documents besides his will,
uh,

375
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.580
with the vestal virgins in Rome.

376
00:24:52.581 --> 00:24:56.120
And these included instructions for his funeral,

377
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.820
a kind of state of the Union address,

378
00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:04.630
what was the situation in Rome and in the empire at the time of his death or

379
00:25:04.941 --> 00:25:08.420
right before his death.
And then most importantly for us,

380
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.520
a resume of his act,

381
00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:14.090
a resume of all of his accomplishments during his lifetime,

382
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:19.630
which were meant to be carved on two bronze plaques that were to be set up in

383
00:25:19.731 --> 00:25:21.950
front of his tomb in Rome.

384
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:26.990
These are the famous res guests,
di Di we,
owl gousty.

385
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:27.531
Uh,

386
00:25:27.531 --> 00:25:32.531
and that means the list of things accomplished of the divine Augustus because

387
00:25:32.601 --> 00:25:37.601
Augustus like Cesar before him was made a god was transformed into a god at his

388
00:25:38.211 --> 00:25:42.920
death.
Uh,
and this lists all of his accomplishments at home and abroad,

389
00:25:42.921 --> 00:25:47.330
the battles that he won,
the cities that he formed.
A,
but most important for us,

390
00:25:47.331 --> 00:25:51.740
it lists dozens and dozens of building projects.
For example,

391
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:57.010
at lists 82 temples that he either restored or built in Rome,

392
00:25:58.101 --> 00:25:59.640
in Rome itself.
Uh,

393
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.760
so it gives you some sense of the magnitude of this man's a building objectives,

394
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.690
uh,
and uh,
and,
uh,

395
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:11.390
and it's very important to us as a compendium of what he does.

396
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:14.030
Some of these buildings still survived,
some of them don't.

397
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.790
But this is a very informative list indeed.

398
00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:20.690
And it shows us that to Augustus as to Cesar before him,

399
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.590
the building of buildings,
uh,

400
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:26.930
was extremely important to making a building's not only to remake Rome,
and they,

401
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:30.150
uh,
you know,
as a great city of the ancient world,
uh,

402
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:33.950
but also to leave something for posterity.
Uh,
and of course,

403
00:26:33.951 --> 00:26:37.820
both of them were successful in both of those objectives.

404
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:42.770
Very important for us.
Today is also the words of Seward.
Tonia Sua.

405
00:26:42.771 --> 00:26:47.771
Tony tells us that Augustus bragged that he and I quote,

406
00:26:48.181 --> 00:26:52.860
found Rome,
a city of brick and left Rome,
uh,

407
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:55.230
city of marble,
a city,
a brick,

408
00:26:55.231 --> 00:26:58.590
meaning that brick tile that we saw in palm pay.

409
00:26:58.591 --> 00:27:03.060
He found a Rome that was built out of that same kind of brick tile that we saw

410
00:27:03.061 --> 00:27:07.770
palm,
but he wanted to transform.
He left the city of Rome,

411
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.780
uh,
a city of marble.
And that's exactly the major thrust of today's lecture.

412
00:27:12.781 --> 00:27:17.781
Augustus builds Rome Augustus build Rome as a marble city in the model of

413
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:24.480
ancient Greece in the model of Athens,
in the Greek part of the world.

414
00:27:24.481 --> 00:27:26.580
It's a rhetorical exaggeration,

415
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:31.440
but we're going to see from the to Augusta buildings that I show you today that

416
00:27:31.441 --> 00:27:33.150
it wasn't far off the mark,

417
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.390
that he really did create a city of marble on the Tiber.
Uh,

418
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:40.530
and he left for posterity.
That Greek marble temple,

419
00:27:40.531 --> 00:27:44.220
a hellenized Greek marble city,
a hellenized,

420
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:49.250
a city that builds on the Hellenization of Roman architecture that we've already

421
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:50.303
talked about.

422
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:56.510
What made a Augustus is boast possible was the fact for the first time in its

423
00:27:57.811 --> 00:27:58.980
history,
uh,

424
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:04.040
a high quality marble was available to Rome,

425
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:05.503
uh,

426
00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:10.670
in close proximity that is marble from Italy itself as opposed to imported

427
00:28:11.191 --> 00:28:12.024
marbles.

428
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:16.590
We've seen up to this point that the Romans wanted to build marble buildings

429
00:28:16.591 --> 00:28:20.130
that they,
that they created a full marble walls,

430
00:28:20.131 --> 00:28:22.410
the first style at palm pay for example,

431
00:28:22.411 --> 00:28:26.970
and also in Rome that they created temples,
uh,
out with,

432
00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:31.980
with columns and a superstructures that were made out of Tufa or,

433
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.800
or travertine.
And then they stuck oh,

434
00:28:34.801 --> 00:28:39.360
those over white to make them look like marble even though they were not marble.

435
00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:40.051
Uh,

436
00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:45.051
but that they just didn't have access to marble readily enough to transform to

437
00:28:45.841 --> 00:28:49.980
actually make these buildings out of marble itself.
There are,
there was some,

438
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:54.930
some flirtation with it.
They did import a certain amount of Greek marble to use,

439
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.160
uh,
for some buildings,

440
00:28:56.161 --> 00:29:00.990
but it wasn't available at a low enough cost to allow the kind of full scale

441
00:29:00.991 --> 00:29:03.660
marble building,
uh,
that they wanted to do.

442
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:08.870
What happens in the end of the reign of the reign of Caesar and into,

443
00:29:09.111 --> 00:29:13.740
or the dictatorship of Caesar and in to the emperorship of Augustus,

444
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.620
is that all of a sudden a high quality,

445
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.920
relatively inexpensive marble becomes available.

446
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:24.920
Because what happens is the Romans begin to exploit in the lights is Arion

447
00:29:24.991 --> 00:29:26.880
period and into the age of Augustus,

448
00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:32.160
the marble quarries at Luna on the northwest coast of Italy.

449
00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:36.000
Uh,
this is the same town as modern Carrara,

450
00:29:36.001 --> 00:29:41.001
the same quarries that were used centuries later by none other than Michael

451
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.840
Angelo himself,
Carrara marble.
You all know Carrara marble called Luna,

452
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.980
this site called Luna in ancient Roman Times.
So Luna or Carrara Marble,

453
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:56.250
I show you a view here of the marble quarries are one of the marble quarries at

454
00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.160
Luna.
Slash.
Carrara.
What it looks like today,

455
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:05.430
this is a reenactment of bringing the marble blocks down from the mountain,

456
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:10.310
uh,
for use in construction.
They basically do it the same way.
Today's,

457
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:14.230
they probably did it in ancient Roman times,
uh,

458
00:30:14.231 --> 00:30:17.950
and it was fairly easy to get this and it was on the coast.

459
00:30:17.951 --> 00:30:22.090
It was fairly easy to load this marble into boat,
bring it down to Australia,

460
00:30:22.091 --> 00:30:26.710
and then up the Tiber to Rome.
And that began to be done,
uh,
in,
in,

461
00:30:26.711 --> 00:30:30.250
in with great success,
especially in the age of Augustus.

462
00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:34.390
Going to Carrara today is a pleasure.
It's an interesting place to visit,

463
00:30:34.391 --> 00:30:39.310
especially if you go there at the time of the,
um,
of the,
uh,

464
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:43.960
the marble exhibition that they have in the competition that they have a where

465
00:30:43.961 --> 00:30:45.820
people,
uh,
make,
uh,

466
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:50.200
whatever out of out of Carrara marble and compete for prizes.

467
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.590
And I show you a view,
a taken during one of these,

468
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:57.970
one of these contests,
a here now on the screen.

469
00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.650
And there are some amazing,

470
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:04.680
amazing works of art we might call them that come out of these competitions.

471
00:31:05.261 --> 00:31:10.090
Here's one of my favorites you see over here,
uh,
the Mar,

472
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:13.810
the Luna Marble version of a,

473
00:31:13.811 --> 00:31:17.710
an Italian Chink would change though these chink would chain toes,
which are,

474
00:31:17.711 --> 00:31:20.860
were minuscule,
uh,
are not,
um,

475
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:22.780
not many of them exist today,

476
00:31:22.781 --> 00:31:25.630
although you do see some antique versions here and there.

477
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:26.980
But I had one of these ones.

478
00:31:26.981 --> 00:31:31.120
And you can see a picture of me in fact here in front of American Express and

479
00:31:31.121 --> 00:31:33.400
not far from the Spanish steps.

480
00:31:33.401 --> 00:31:37.640
The Piatsa d spun yet with my chink with Jane Doe is a long time ago.
Uh,

481
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:42.530
but you can see how small it is.
I'm actually standing on the front,
uh,
front,
uh,

482
00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:46.870
passenger side,
uh,
popping up through the sunroof,

483
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.620
but use my size there and I'm about five,
seven compared to the car.

484
00:31:50.621 --> 00:31:54.310
It gives you some sense of how small these cars were today.

485
00:31:54.311 --> 00:31:56.260
So the Italians had been very good about,

486
00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.620
about this sort of thing for some time and continue as you well know,

487
00:31:59.621 --> 00:32:03.580
to drive for the most part small cars,
uh,
through the city.

488
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.700
And another one of my favorite,
uh,

489
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:10.740
entries into the competition or these Luna marble decapitated heads of one and a

490
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.220
Vieta Parone,
uh,

491
00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:18.340
that were put forward in one of these competitions some years ago

492
00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.170
with regard to transforming roam into a marble city.

493
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:28.170
Now that Carrara marble was available at a fairly low cost compared to the

494
00:32:29.351 --> 00:32:34.150
importation of Greek marbles,
a Augustus begins to build his marble city.

495
00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:39.150
And I'm going to show you two major commissions,
uh,
of Augustus today.
Uh,

496
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:43.190
the first of these is the forum of Augustus in Rome.

497
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:47.330
A forum,
uh,
or the forum are Gostem in Rome,
uh,

498
00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:50.720
that that was,
uh,
very much in Augustus,

499
00:32:50.721 --> 00:32:54.440
his mind from the beginning of his rise to power.
In fact,

500
00:32:55.490 --> 00:33:00.290
there it's Sue Atonia is who tells us that the reason that Augustus built a

501
00:33:00.291 --> 00:33:05.210
forum in Rome was because even though there were already two forums in Rome that

502
00:33:05.211 --> 00:33:08.780
includes the Roman Forum and the Forum of Julius Caesar,

503
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:12.110
even though those two existed,
and we're both being used,

504
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:14.090
that the populations who attained,

505
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:19.040
Tony tells us the population was growing by leaps and bounds as were the need to

506
00:33:19.041 --> 00:33:22.560
try judicial cases.
And that the play,

507
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:27.610
the spaces in the forums of the Roman Forum and in the Forum of Julius Caesar

508
00:33:28.161 --> 00:33:32.470
did not allow for the needs of the populous or for these,

509
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:36.650
the needs of these judicial cases and that they needed to build another forum.

510
00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:38.210
Well,
that's a good story,

511
00:33:38.211 --> 00:33:41.540
but the likelihood is it had pretty much nothing to do with that.

512
00:33:41.541 --> 00:33:44.600
I may have had something to do with that,
but not a lot to do with that.
Uh,

513
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:48.470
because,
uh,
Augustus had ulterior motives.
Augustus.

514
00:33:48.471 --> 00:33:50.190
It was at the battle of Philippi,

515
00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:55.290
that battle of 42 BC when Marc Antony and Octavian joined forces to defeat the

516
00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.780
assassins of Julius Caesar.

517
00:33:59.781 --> 00:34:04.070
It was right before that battle that Augustus vowed that if he won,

518
00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:08.840
if he were successful,
uh,
that he would build a temple to Mars,

519
00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:13.330
the Avenger Mars alter ulto,
our Mars Mars,

520
00:34:13.331 --> 00:34:18.331
the Avenger in gratitude for helping him avenge the death of Julius Caesar,

521
00:34:19.521 --> 00:34:23.420
the murder of Julius Caesar,
the assassination of Julius Caesar.

522
00:34:23.421 --> 00:34:27.440
And so when he was successful,
he said,
I will build a,

523
00:34:27.441 --> 00:34:31.680
that temple and that temple needed and environment.
Uh,
and uh,

524
00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.480
as we've seen,
Romans often build temples inside complexes,

525
00:34:35.481 --> 00:34:38.190
whether it was sanctuaries or forums.
Uh,

526
00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:43.250
and so he had a good excuse to build a major forum in Rome as a domicile for the

527
00:34:45.111 --> 00:34:49.310
temple of Mars old tour.
He didn't get around to it for a while.

528
00:34:49.311 --> 00:34:53.870
Again the battle of Phillip Pie 42 but he had a lot of other things to contend

529
00:34:53.871 --> 00:34:56.150
with,
namely Marc Antony and Cleopatra.

530
00:34:56.151 --> 00:34:59.960
It wasn't until after the battle of Actium when he got rid of the two of them,

531
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.890
uh,
that he had time to build this temple to Marzel tour.

532
00:35:03.891 --> 00:35:07.760
And we see it beginning to go up in 28 BC,

533
00:35:07.761 --> 00:35:11.600
so considerably later than the original battle 28 BC.

534
00:35:11.601 --> 00:35:15.290
And it was dedicated in Rome and a very important on a very important date,

535
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:20.380
the date of a,
of a d of two BC,
excuse me,
of two BC.

536
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:25.180
So,
uh,
begun in 28 BC and dedicated in to BC.

537
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.880
And that's the date that I've given you on the monument list,

538
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:32.900
the dedication of the temple of Marzel tour and the forum of Augustus in two BC.

539
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:35.240
We see it's planned here.

540
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:40.930
We will see momentarily that it was built in very close approximation and in

541
00:35:40.951 --> 00:35:45.330
fact right next to the forum of Julius Caesar,
why?
Because of course,

542
00:35:45.331 --> 00:35:50.080
Augustus wanted to associate himself with his divine adoptive father,
Caesar.

543
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:53.130
So he puts his own forum right next to Caesars.

544
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:57.240
We see the forum of Augustus here,
we can see that it follows in the main,

545
00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.120
the plan of the forum of Julius Caesar.

546
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:05.420
It is a rectangular space open to the sky with colonnades on either side with a

547
00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:12.900
temple in the center pushed up against the back wall and dominating the space in

548
00:36:12.901 --> 00:36:17.850
front of it.
The only change here is the addition of these hemi cycles,

549
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:22.770
one on either side looking very much like the Hemi cycles that we looked at from

550
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.120
the sanctuary of Fortuna Prima Jania at Palestrina.

551
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:32.300
These embracing arms that serve to accentuate architecturally and visually the

552
00:36:32.491 --> 00:36:35.940
temple in the center.
Uh,
and that also served as a place.

553
00:36:35.941 --> 00:36:40.440
There are niches on either side where they could put statuary and the like seen

554
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:45.450
through the columns.
As you can see here,
the temple of Marzel tore itself again,

555
00:36:45.451 --> 00:36:50.170
very similar to temples,
early Roman temples that we've been talking about.
Uh,

556
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:54.300
using the Etruscan plan,
the sod orientation,

557
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:59.100
single staircase,
deep porch,
freestanding columns in that porch.

558
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:03.270
Freestanding columns on either side,
but yet like an a trust in temple,

559
00:37:03.271 --> 00:37:06.210
a flat back wall.
As you can see here,

560
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:11.300
some columns inside decorating the seller of the temple and then a single niche,

561
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.060
uh,
for the cult statue.
Uh,

562
00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:17.400
inside and note here also the base,

563
00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.900
I'll say something about the statute that said,
stood on that base later.

564
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:27.230
Here's a Google earth view of this part of Rome showing the connection between

565
00:37:28.141 --> 00:37:32.820
this is,
you can see here the a forum of Julius Caesar.
As it looks today.

566
00:37:32.821 --> 00:37:36.590
This is the entrance.
We're moving back toward the Capitoline hill.

567
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.830
These are those three columns that I showed you before are still preserved as

568
00:37:40.831 --> 00:37:45.480
well as the columns of the colonnade on the left side that entered into the

569
00:37:45.481 --> 00:37:49.390
shops.
Here's the modern via day Fori am periodically,
uh,

570
00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:53.440
built by Mussolini.
What miss miscellany did was slice,
uh,

571
00:37:53.441 --> 00:37:58.200
the Roman Forum and Julian Forum from the so called imperial fora to which they

572
00:37:58.201 --> 00:37:59.970
were originally attached.

573
00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:04.410
And any of you who've been in Rome recently know that this entire area as being

574
00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:07.500
excavated,
the plan is event street is still there now,

575
00:38:07.501 --> 00:38:11.370
but the plan is eventually we'll see whether this really happens because it's a

576
00:38:11.371 --> 00:38:15.360
good be a traffic nightmare.
But the plan is to take that,
that uh,

577
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:20.280
muscle any street down eventually and reunite all of these forums in some great

578
00:38:20.281 --> 00:38:24.450
archeological park.
Uh,
someday it would be exciting if that were to happen.

579
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.920
So the modern street,

580
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:31.160
but initially the forum of Caesar would have stood exactly next to the form of

581
00:38:31.651 --> 00:38:34.710
Augustus.
We see that here and if you look carefully,

582
00:38:34.711 --> 00:38:39.711
you can see the remains of the temple of Marzel tour as well as a precinct wall

583
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.650
that is preserved.

584
00:38:41.651 --> 00:38:46.651
It was 115 foot precinct wall protecting the forum from just the area we were

585
00:38:48.821 --> 00:38:51.120
talking about before,
that question about,
uh,

586
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.360
housing for the well to do and the less well to do in ancient Rome.

587
00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:59.530
Protecting the forum from the so called Sabura sub.
You are a,

588
00:38:59.531 --> 00:39:04.090
which was that area of Rome in which all of those rickety wooden tenement houses

589
00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:08.860
were located in which we're constantly going up in fires to protect the temple

590
00:39:08.861 --> 00:39:13.861
cause marble can burn to protect the temple of Marzel two or from all of that

591
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:17.760
stuff.
Uh,
that was back there in the Seborga.

592
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:22.060
Here's another view from Google Earth from taken from the other side,

593
00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:26.890
showing the remains of the temple of Marzel tore pushed up against the back
wall.

594
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.010
And then that precinct wall that is very well preserved,

595
00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:33.190
snaking its way around dividing the forum proper,

596
00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:38.340
the sacred space from the residential area called the [inaudible] that was

597
00:39:38.381 --> 00:39:42.230
behind.
Here's a view of the,
uh,
uh,

598
00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:43.540
of the,
uh,

599
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:48.250
precinct wall as it looks from the outside of the forum today are,

600
00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.130
there are some additions that were made in later times,
you know,

601
00:39:51.131 --> 00:39:53.360
medieval looking windows and the like.
Uh,

602
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.480
but for the most part it's preserved as it was.

603
00:39:55.481 --> 00:40:00.060
You can see we're dealing with ashler blocks made out of pepper,
Reno stone,
pep,

604
00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:04.270
e.
R.
I.
N.
O.
We've talked about pepper reno before.
It's a form of Tufa,

605
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:08.290
a stone that was used here with Ashleigh blocks for uh,

606
00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.920
the and circling precinct wall.
You can see the coloration of those,
uh,

607
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:16.520
pepper,
Reno blocks,
grayish brownish color here.
Uh,

608
00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:20.770
and you can see the difference between that and the temple,

609
00:40:20.771 --> 00:40:23.170
the remains of the temple,
the columns,

610
00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.770
the steps of the temple as well as some other decoration.

611
00:40:26.771 --> 00:40:31.771
And also some of the walls were made out of Luna or Carrara Marble Luna or

612
00:40:32.981 --> 00:40:35.950
Carrara marble for this temple.

613
00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.970
This is a view of the temple of Marzel tour as it looks today.

614
00:40:39.971 --> 00:40:41.170
It's in ruinous state,

615
00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.890
but enough is preserved for us to get a very good sense of what it originally

616
00:40:44.891 --> 00:40:47.740
looked like.
You can see that the podium is tall.

617
00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:50.190
You can see that it's made out of Tufa.
Uh,

618
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:55.200
you can see that the steps are sheathed in Carrara marble,

619
00:40:56.510 --> 00:41:00.130
uh,
brought from,
uh,
those quarries that we discussed before.

620
00:41:00.131 --> 00:41:04.810
You can see that the columns were also made out of solid Carrara marble.

621
00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:09.160
We see that here we see a wall in Carrara marble and we see the distinction

622
00:41:09.161 --> 00:41:12.520
between that and the pep reno walls.
Uh,

623
00:41:12.521 --> 00:41:16.400
you can also see in this very good view,
a,
uh,
a,

624
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.210
one of the Hemi cycles on the left hand side.

625
00:41:19.211 --> 00:41:22.840
And you can see those niches that I mentioned before or that would have held

626
00:41:22.841 --> 00:41:26.890
statuary that you could see through the columns.

627
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:31.280
This is a restored view in the Ward Perkins,
a textbook which,
uh,

628
00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:36.320
shows you what the temple would have looked like in antiquity and when it was in

629
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:41.600
its final form.
And you can see the,

630
00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.450
the everything we've described,
the tall podium,

631
00:41:44.451 --> 00:41:46.760
single staircase facade orientation.

632
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:49.640
You can see also that there was sculpture in the pediment.

633
00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:51.580
And we know something about that.
Uh,

634
00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:56.420
you can see the columns on either side and you can see in the second story and

635
00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:00.140
you can barely make them out.
But take my word,
those are instead of columns,

636
00:42:00.141 --> 00:42:04.130
they are figures of women,
uh,
that we're going to say something about.
Uh,

637
00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:06.680
and you can see those again on both sides.

638
00:42:06.681 --> 00:42:10.610
So this gives you a sense of what the temple would've looked like in its hay
day.

639
00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:16.430
The favored,
uh,
Capitol column type and Capitol of the Romans.

640
00:42:16.431 --> 00:42:21.260
The Corinthian is what is used here.
Uh,
you can see a restore,
a,

641
00:42:21.261 --> 00:42:25.260
a,
a preserved capital.
And how beautifully rendered they were.

642
00:42:25.261 --> 00:42:30.190
A very high quality capital's done out of Luna or Carrara marble.
Uh,

643
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:34.850
we can see the characteristic triple row of a canvas leaves the spiral volume.

644
00:42:34.851 --> 00:42:36.230
It's growing out of those,

645
00:42:36.231 --> 00:42:40.790
the central flower that we see always in the Corinthian order,
uh,

646
00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:41.624
for,
uh,

647
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:45.650
the columns that were used for the temple and for most of the side columns on

648
00:42:45.651 --> 00:42:48.740
the first story as well.
But in some cases,

649
00:42:48.741 --> 00:42:52.430
those columns were replaced with others that have,

650
00:42:52.431 --> 00:42:55.730
instead of the spiral volume,
it's growing out of the account.

651
00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.340
This leaves Pega Psi.
We need horses.

652
00:42:58.341 --> 00:43:02.540
And I show you a detail of one of those pegs cy here,
uh,

653
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:07.150
to have a capital with an animal that replacing the spirals,
uh,

654
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:12.160
is called a zone amorphic capitol Zhou [inaudible] Zoomorphic,

655
00:43:12.171 --> 00:43:16.840
z.
O.
O m.
O r p.
H.
I.
C.
So a morphic capital.
Uh,

656
00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:21.850
and it's interesting to note that we see similar zoomorphic capitals in Greece a

657
00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:27.800
a bit earlier than this structure at a gateway that I'm going to show you at a

658
00:43:27.801 --> 00:43:28.820
place called hallucis.

659
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:33.560
We'll return to this when we discuss a Roman Greece later in this semester.
Uh,

660
00:43:33.561 --> 00:43:36.810
and these have,
instead of Pega side,
these have bull proteomes,

661
00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:40.250
the tops of bulls emanating out of the canvas leads.

662
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:42.170
But I show it to you to make one point.

663
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.500
And that is that it seems very likely that there was some interesting

664
00:43:45.501 --> 00:43:48.230
architectural exchange ideas,
architects,

665
00:43:48.231 --> 00:43:52.530
and so on going on between Athens and Rome,
uh,

666
00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:57.580
in the late Republican period in the time of Julius Caesar and into the age of

667
00:43:57.681 --> 00:44:01.280
Augustus.
And it's an issue that we'll return to in the future.

668
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:06.970
We're going to see that Augustus not only builds his marbles city in order to

669
00:44:07.071 --> 00:44:11.590
make it look like,
you know,
more like grease,
more like Athens,
uh,

670
00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:16.460
and to connect his new golden age with the golden age of Pericles and Athens.
Uh,

671
00:44:16.461 --> 00:44:21.290
but we see,
we see very specific,
uh,
Greek models being used.
For example,

672
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:25.370
one of these is a freeze from the forum of Augustus.

673
00:44:25.371 --> 00:44:30.371
The other is a freeze from one of the three temples on the Acropolis in Athens

674
00:44:31.291 --> 00:44:33.090
of the fifth century B BC,

675
00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:38.100
the so called Eric theone or Eric theum and the Latin eyes version a.

676
00:44:38.101 --> 00:44:41.100
And one of these is from one and one of these is from the other.

677
00:44:41.101 --> 00:44:43.290
And I just wondered quickly if any of you want to guess,

678
00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:45.900
which is the Roman one and which is the Greek one that had copies.

679
00:44:45.901 --> 00:44:50.901
You can see this alternation of the Lotus and Paul met leaves here and he,

680
00:44:51.601 --> 00:44:55.530
quick thoughts.
How many of you think this is the Greek one?

681
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:59.460
How many of you think this is the Greek one?

682
00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:00.980
<v 1>Okay,</v>

683
00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:03.440
<v 0>this is the Roman one.
This is the Roman one at the top.</v>

684
00:45:03.441 --> 00:45:07.440
This is the Greek one down here.
The Greek one down here,
or more deeply undercut,

685
00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:09.480
which is I think what throws people,
uh,

686
00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:12.020
the Roman one from the forum of Augustus up above.

687
00:45:12.021 --> 00:45:13.990
But the important point for us,
again,
uh,

688
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:17.510
that they are looking back at Greek buildings of the fifth century and they are

689
00:45:17.511 --> 00:45:19.560
copying what they see.
Uh,

690
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:24.670
we see here a model of the forum of Augustus with the Temple of Maura's old tour

691
00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:29.320
inside that forum with the,
uh,
embracing x,
Z,

692
00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:32.360
z dry or heavy cycles on either side.

693
00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:37.550
Or you can see that the exterior of the structure was quite plain.
I just,

694
00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:41.060
in the way that a Domus Etol lick us outside was playing.

695
00:45:41.061 --> 00:45:45.920
And it was only when you got inside,
I bet you got a real sense of,
uh,
of the,

696
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:48.860
um,
of the,
the glory of the architecture.

697
00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:53.150
So I think you can see well here and most interesting for us.
I mentioned that,

698
00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:56.090
uh,
these columns and the temple were Corinthian.

699
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:59.000
The columns on the first story over here,
we're Corinthian.

700
00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:03.140
But in the second story on the left and right sides of the forum,

701
00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:07.220
the columns are replaced by figures of women,

702
00:46:07.221 --> 00:46:10.660
by figures of maidens.
And I show you two of them are survived.

703
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:13.850
There's two of them are well preserved.
I show them to you here,

704
00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:19.060
these figures of maidens that replace the columns that support the capital's on

705
00:46:19.641 --> 00:46:23.530
top of their heads.
Uh,
and they flank,
uh,

706
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:27.290
this shield in the center with the depiction of a male head.

707
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:32.510
This is the God Jupiter,
a certain,
a certain guys of the God,
Jupiter,

708
00:46:32.511 --> 00:46:36.560
Jupiter,
Amazon.
As you can see him here and we have,

709
00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:41.590
we have information that tells us that Alexander the great used to play shields

710
00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:45.110
in the,
uh,
in,
in the,
in the Parthenon,

711
00:46:45.111 --> 00:46:48.080
in Athens and elsewhere after great military victories.

712
00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:51.890
And it is possible that that sort of thing is being referred to here because we

713
00:46:51.891 --> 00:46:56.891
know Augusta's like Pompey before him a had a thing that for Alexander and like

714
00:46:57.531 --> 00:46:59.750
to associate himself with Alexander,

715
00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:04.870
but most important for us is the fact that these maidens have clear precedence

716
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:07.010
in the Greek world.

717
00:47:07.011 --> 00:47:11.960
The famous porch of the maidens on the Athenian Acropolis fifth century BC,

718
00:47:11.961 --> 00:47:16.830
the Eric theone again,
uh,
e,
r,
e,
c,
h,
t,

719
00:47:16.831 --> 00:47:19.070
e,
I,
O,
n and the,
the Greek version,

720
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:23.390
the Eric theone of Athens fifth century BC,

721
00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.920
same set of maidens.

722
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:29.410
We know that these had fallen into disrepair and the age of Augustus Augustus

723
00:47:29.411 --> 00:47:33.700
visited Athens three times.
He did not like seeing these in disrepair.

724
00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:38.590
And in fact,
he had his own architects replace one of them with a Roman copy.

725
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:43.570
And while they were doing that,
they made plaster casts of these maidens.

726
00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:46.420
They brought those plaster cast back to Rome.

727
00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:48.820
And then in reduced scale,

728
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.490
they duplicated them for the,
uh,
for the,
uh,

729
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:57.820
forum of Augustus in Rome.
So appropriations from Greece,

730
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:01.540
appropriations in part because Augustus liked them.
Uh,

731
00:48:01.541 --> 00:48:05.020
but also I don't think there's any question that he was trying to draw a

732
00:48:05.021 --> 00:48:06.970
relationship between himself,

733
00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:11.770
his new golden age and the golden age of Pericles and Athens.

734
00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.240
We also have evidence for what the pediment,

735
00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:20.140
the sculpture in the pediment looked like.
And I want to turn to that now.

736
00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:25.530
This is a relief that dates to a slightly later period that purports to

737
00:48:26.111 --> 00:48:30.460
represent the pediment of the temple of Mars old tour.
Uh,

738
00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.990
and I show it to you here and we can tell from this exactly what these

739
00:48:34.991 --> 00:48:37.030
sculptural display was all about.
Uh,

740
00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:41.200
in the pediment of this temple we see here in the center,
not surprisingly,

741
00:48:41.201 --> 00:48:45.460
Mars old tour himself.
Marzel tour depicted with a bare chest,
uh,

742
00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:49.810
next to him,
to his left,
to his right.
Excuse me.
To our left,

743
00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:54.280
we see a figure of a woman.
This is Venus and Venus,
as you can see,

744
00:48:54.281 --> 00:48:57.850
has a something on her left shoulder.
It is a cupid,
uh,

745
00:48:57.851 --> 00:49:00.820
so Venus with Cupid,
uh,
Venus,

746
00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:03.790
the consort of Mars,

747
00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:08.840
and then over here a personification that we believe depicts for tuna for two.

748
00:49:08.841 --> 00:49:13.841
Now the goddess of fortune who brought fortune to Augustus in his battle.

749
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:16.360
And then over here,
uh,

750
00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:19.930
a seated figure of Roma with her arms and armor.

751
00:49:19.931 --> 00:49:23.200
Keep this figure in your mind because I'm going to show you another seat in Roma

752
00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:28.480
and very soon.
And then over here,
a reclining figure of the Tiber River,

753
00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:32.380
the Tiber on the liver,
on which Rome was built over here,

754
00:49:32.381 --> 00:49:34.960
a seated figure we believe is Romulus,

755
00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:39.220
the founder of Rome on the Palatine Hill and overhear a reclining

756
00:49:39.221 --> 00:49:41.560
personification of the Palatine.

757
00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:46.560
So most important that the building honored of course Marzel tour and that Mars

758
00:49:46.661 --> 00:49:48.790
old tour was depicted in the pediment.

759
00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:52.750
There was also a cult statue inside the temple of Mars a.

760
00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:56.620
And we believe we know what that looked like as well because we believe we have

761
00:49:56.621 --> 00:50:01.621
a copy of it in a relief from Algiers of that is still preserved.

762
00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:06.550
That depicts Mars in the center of this Marzel tour.
Again,

763
00:50:06.551 --> 00:50:09.880
this time the warlike Marzel tour because you can see he's wearing his

764
00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:14.710
breastplate and his helmet,
his consort Venus is once again by his side.

765
00:50:14.711 --> 00:50:19.120
Venus is leaning on a pedestal.
She's very seductive.
Her,

766
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:22.750
her drapery is falling off her shoulder as you can see.

767
00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:27.350
And she looks toward Mars and then cupid down here offering her a sword in a

768
00:50:27.351 --> 00:50:30.350
sheath,
probably Mars,
his own a sword.

769
00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:34.040
And then over here a figure that's very controversial.

770
00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.220
I youthful looking figure with a bare chest,
uh,

771
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:40.250
and you can see a full cap of hair.
Uh,

772
00:50:40.251 --> 00:50:44.750
and we think that he is actually the divinized Julius Caesar,

773
00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:48.860
very botox compared to what he's rejuvenated compared to what he looked like.

774
00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:53.790
A in that green diabase portrait that I showed you before,
uh,

775
00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:56.480
a very youthful,
a divine Caesar,

776
00:50:56.481 --> 00:51:01.370
which shows you what happens to people in Roman times when they were a

777
00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.121
divinized.

778
00:51:02.121 --> 00:51:07.121
They were able to shed a fair number of years and were depicted in much younger

779
00:51:07.641 --> 00:51:12.200
versions in there divinized state.
So this probably a reflection as you can see,

780
00:51:12.201 --> 00:51:16.070
the figures stand on bases and figures that stand on bases and Roman relief

781
00:51:16.071 --> 00:51:20.450
sculpture are usually meant to be statues.
And we believe that this is again,

782
00:51:20.451 --> 00:51:24.980
a rendition of what the triple a set of statutes would have looked like inside

783
00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:27.650
the temple to return to the plan quickly.

784
00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.830
Just to make the point that the sculptural program,

785
00:51:30.831 --> 00:51:35.260
we're concerned here primarily with architecture,
but the sculptural program,
uh,

786
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:38.210
was very complicated but very interesting.

787
00:51:38.211 --> 00:51:42.470
And the figures were very carefully aligned with one another to get the message

788
00:51:42.471 --> 00:51:44.660
across.
So as you looked at the temple,

789
00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:47.540
you would've seen Marzel tour in the center of the pediment.

790
00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:50.030
If you were allowed to walk in to the temple,

791
00:51:50.031 --> 00:51:51.710
which usually only the priests could do,

792
00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:55.340
you would see the cult statue with Marzel tour in the center there,

793
00:51:55.640 --> 00:52:00.640
there was an equestrian statue that was put up of Augustus in to BC when he was

794
00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:05.570
given the title pot tear poetry I the father of his country.

795
00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:09.950
And then all along the colonnades,
there would have been statuary,

796
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:14.550
including an image of,
uh,
of um,
uh,

797
00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:18.770
Nissan,
this side Romulus on this side and the so called Sumi weary,

798
00:52:18.771 --> 00:52:20.090
the great men of Rome,

799
00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:25.330
both Augustus's colleagues and also his rivals in their portraits on either

800
00:52:25.731 --> 00:52:30.590
side,
a kind of giant picture gallery.
I enjoy and portrait gallery of,

801
00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:35.030
uh,
of the,
of,
of,
of Rome,
of the great men of Rome,

802
00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:39.890
of the greatest men of Rome,
namely Augustus himself.
Uh,
and uh,
his,
uh,

803
00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.540
his ancestry,
both divine and mythological,
Avaya and nice,

804
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.130
and also Venus.

805
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:52.510
The second marble building that I want to show you today is the famous altar of

806
00:52:53.481 --> 00:52:58.340
Augustan peace.
The ARRA pacas goosed die.
Uh,
which is one of,

807
00:52:58.341 --> 00:53:01.850
if not my most favorite building in monument in Rome.

808
00:53:01.851 --> 00:53:05.390
And one that I've had a personal obsession with my entire scholarly life.

809
00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:08.960
I've written a lot on this monument and have a lot of thoughts which have

810
00:53:08.961 --> 00:53:13.961
changed significantly over the years about this very important structure we know

811
00:53:16.131 --> 00:53:16.581
about it.

812
00:53:16.581 --> 00:53:20.960
Augustus tells us about the altar of Augustan peace himself in his raise guest

813
00:53:20.961 --> 00:53:23.300
die.
He tells us on his return,

814
00:53:23.301 --> 00:53:28.301
and I'm quoting Augustus here from RG on his return to Rome from Spain and gall.

815
00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:30.570
He had gone to Spain and gold,

816
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:35.250
which were the western part of the empire in order to make some diplomatic

817
00:53:35.251 --> 00:53:38.310
treaties on my return to Rome from Spain and goal.

818
00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:43.340
After successfully restoring law and order to the provinces,

819
00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.120
the Senate decided,

820
00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:50.121
and this happened in 13 BC to consecrate the Arra Pacas Al Goose die on the

821
00:53:50.641 --> 00:53:51.091
campus.

822
00:53:51.091 --> 00:53:56.091
Marshus the so called field of Mars and area of Rome in honor of my return at

823
00:53:56.191 --> 00:53:58.230
which officials,
priests,

824
00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:02.850
and vestal virgins should offer an annual sacrifice.

825
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:08.100
We believe that the monument being referred to here is the one that you see now

826
00:54:08.101 --> 00:54:08.934
before you,

827
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:14.120
the Arra Pahlka sal goose dye made entirely of Luna or Carrara marble solid Luna

828
00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:17.460
or Carrara marble,

829
00:54:17.461 --> 00:54:22.410
and even more of a marble building in a sense than the Temple and forum that

830
00:54:22.411 --> 00:54:24.650
we've looked at thus far.
Uh,

831
00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:28.710
it is a marble building that we believe that we know,
we know it's dates,

832
00:54:28.711 --> 00:54:29.700
quite specifically.

833
00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:34.700
We know that it was a consecrated on the 4th of July and easy date to remember

834
00:54:36.211 --> 00:54:36.781
for all of us.

835
00:54:36.781 --> 00:54:41.781
The 4th of July in 13 BC was when it was consecrated and it was completed and

836
00:54:42.361 --> 00:54:46.020
dedicated on the 30th of January in nine VC,

837
00:54:46.021 --> 00:54:50.740
the 30th of January just happened to be the birthday of Augustus.

838
00:54:50.741 --> 00:54:55.650
His wife Livia,
no coincidence there.
She was obviously lobbying,
uh,

839
00:54:55.651 --> 00:54:59.880
for that.
Uh,
so on her birthday,
30th of January in nine BC,

840
00:54:59.881 --> 00:55:04.740
this structure is dedicated.
We,

841
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:08.270
we know that,
uh,
it,
we,
we,

842
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:13.230
there's a lot of controversy as to exactly what event is referred to on this

843
00:55:13.231 --> 00:55:16.890
monument because we'll see that there was a procession that refers to some

844
00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.690
historical event.
Uh,

845
00:55:18.691 --> 00:55:23.550
we will also see that the monument is covered with all kinds of sculptural

846
00:55:23.551 --> 00:55:26.670
decoration,
including flowering a campus plants,

847
00:55:26.671 --> 00:55:29.160
including mythological and legendary scenes,

848
00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:34.340
including historical scenes and trying to decipher the web of all these and

849
00:55:35.191 --> 00:55:38.970
their relationship to one another is fairly complex.
Uh,

850
00:55:38.971 --> 00:55:42.090
what's important to us as we look at this,
um,
is,

851
00:55:42.091 --> 00:55:46.950
and I want to show you here from Ward Perkins a plan and an accident metric
view,

852
00:55:46.951 --> 00:55:51.250
which will give us a very good sense of what this altar was all about.
Uh,

853
00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:55.830
we can see that the altar proper was located in the center of the structure.

854
00:55:55.831 --> 00:55:57.570
It's a kind of u shaped alter,

855
00:55:57.870 --> 00:56:00.900
which goes what goes back to Greek precedents.

856
00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:04.320
The most famous use shaped alts alter of the Hellenistic period.

857
00:56:04.321 --> 00:56:09.180
Some of you may know at the altar of Zeus at Pergamon,

858
00:56:09.181 --> 00:56:10.710
the great altar of Zeus at Pergamon,

859
00:56:10.711 --> 00:56:13.080
which you see in the upper most part now in Berlin,

860
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:17.520
but these u shaped altars were used in Greece and you can see that same you

861
00:56:17.521 --> 00:56:21.300
shaped form here,
use for the altar,
the altar proper,

862
00:56:21.301 --> 00:56:25.930
where the sacrifice was actually made is located inside this precinct,

863
00:56:25.931 --> 00:56:29.920
which is open to the sky and most importantly has double doors.

864
00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:34.980
A doorway on the eastern side of the monument and a doorway on the western side

865
00:56:35.231 --> 00:56:38.170
of the the monument.
Even though there are two doors,

866
00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:42.520
you note that there is only a single staircase on the western side.

867
00:56:42.521 --> 00:56:43.570
So the Romans,

868
00:56:43.571 --> 00:56:47.080
despite the fact that they've given it a dual focus by putting two doors,

869
00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:51.110
they still give it a single focus by a single staircase.

870
00:56:51.111 --> 00:56:55.270
So it's the facade ism of Roman architecture reigned supreme.

871
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:59.140
As you can see here,
the fact that there were double doorways,

872
00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:03.400
very significant and we try to,
we've tried to sort out why that might be.

873
00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:07.390
There are two possible precedents are two possible references that are being

874
00:57:07.391 --> 00:57:10.960
made here.
One,
two a Greek alter,

875
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:13.480
a a Greek fifth century BC alter,

876
00:57:13.481 --> 00:57:17.050
which shouldn't surprise us since we've seen that Augustus is looking back at

877
00:57:17.051 --> 00:57:21.130
the fifth century BC and Greece and mining it for architectural ideas and

878
00:57:21.131 --> 00:57:25.260
associations.
We see here what is the,
uh,
it was a,

879
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:30.070
is a restored view of the altar of the 12 gods or the altar of pity that was

880
00:57:30.071 --> 00:57:34.960
located in the Greek market place,
the Athenian in Athens,
the Athenian Agora,

881
00:57:34.961 --> 00:57:37.960
the marketplace and Athens fifth century BC.

882
00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:42.910
You can see that it consisted of an altar in the center with a precinct wall

883
00:57:42.911 --> 00:57:47.440
with double doorways,
one on either side here and with relief sculpture.

884
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:51.910
So it looks like that might well be an important model again and not

885
00:57:51.911 --> 00:57:55.810
surprisingly since it dates to the fifth century but also important.

886
00:57:55.811 --> 00:57:58.210
And I show you an image of it on a Roman coin.

887
00:57:58.211 --> 00:58:02.440
Here is the so called shrine of Janus,
the two headed God,

888
00:58:02.441 --> 00:58:07.210
j a n u s the shrine of Janus,
which we know is located in the Roman forum.

889
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:12.760
And tradition had it that when the doors,
because it had double doors,

890
00:58:12.761 --> 00:58:17.590
what had two sides,
cause he was a two headed God.
So two sides,
both with doors,

891
00:58:17.591 --> 00:58:22.060
both with double doors and that when those double doors were closed,

892
00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:26.050
it's signaled that peace reigned throughout the empire.

893
00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:27.850
And we know in the Res Guest Die,

894
00:58:27.851 --> 00:58:31.840
Augustus tells us that he closed the doors of the shrine of Janus.

895
00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:35.350
He brags three times during his reign.

896
00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:40.570
So it is very likely that the double doors on the shrine of Janus are referred

897
00:58:40.571 --> 00:58:45.310
to not surprisingly in an altar that was put up two piece to the piece that

898
00:58:45.311 --> 00:58:49.660
Augustus brought to Rome through his various military victories and also through

899
00:58:49.661 --> 00:58:51.250
his diplomatic conquests,

900
00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:55.170
his diplomatic treaties like the one that he assigned in,
uh,

901
00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:56.560
Spain and gall.

902
00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:00.520
I want to take you quickly through the monument and keep in mind always that

903
00:59:00.521 --> 00:59:04.750
it's made out of Luna or Carrara marble to show you some of the,

904
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:06.190
this is not of course in sculpture.

905
00:59:06.191 --> 00:59:08.170
So I'm not going to go into the sculpture in any detail,

906
00:59:08.171 --> 00:59:10.760
but I want you to be aware of it,
uh,

907
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:14.740
because some of the motifs are important in our understanding also of

908
00:59:14.741 --> 00:59:17.710
architecture.
We see here two views of the altar.

909
00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:22.430
You see these winged Lion Griffin's that are very popular motifs in the Augustan

910
00:59:22.431 --> 00:59:27.431
period as well as the spiral and the cannabis plant that was also popular and

911
00:59:27.861 --> 00:59:32.330
Augustan Times a figural freeze that represents the vestal virgins that were

912
00:59:32.331 --> 00:59:37.280
referred to as those who are,
who,
um,
to which offerings are,

913
00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:42.290
are,
you know,
the sacrifice is taking place in part in honor of them.

914
00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:42.710
Uh,

915
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:47.360
but we see here I sacrifice itself where the animal victims are being brought in

916
00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:52.070
for slaughter.
We also see,

917
00:59:52.071 --> 00:59:55.190
if we look at right where we're now inside the monument,

918
00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:59.090
we've looked at the altar proper.
If we look at the precinct wall,

919
00:59:59.091 --> 01:00:03.090
the inside of the precinct wall,
we see that as very well preserved.

920
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:05.800
And we see it is zoned to s two,

921
01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:10.820
essentially two zones with slats all done in Carrara Marble slats down below,

922
01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:15.410
uh,
that looked like either a wooden wall or perhaps a fence of some sort.

923
01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:20.390
Then above also depicted in Carrara marble.
These great garland did swags,

924
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:23.610
uh,
that you see hanging from pilasters,
uh,

925
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:25.970
but also from the skulls of bulls.

926
01:00:25.971 --> 01:00:28.790
I'll show you a detail in a moment when you'll see those skulls better,

927
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:32.630
the skulls of the bowls that have been sacrificed on this altar.

928
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:37.670
And then above the swags,
uh,
you can see these libation dishes.

929
01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.130
Uh,
and what has been speculated,

930
01:00:40.131 --> 01:00:43.550
and I think it's ingenious on the part of the scholars who first came up with

931
01:00:43.551 --> 01:00:44.060
this,

932
01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:49.060
that what they think is being represented here is actually a copy or a rendition

933
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:51.260
of the wooden,
the,
the,
uh,

934
01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.830
the temporary wouldn't alter that would have stood on this site,

935
01:00:54.831 --> 01:00:58.550
because remember,
they're consecrating it already in 13 BC,

936
01:00:58.551 --> 01:01:01.730
but the structure itself isn't built until nine,

937
01:01:01.731 --> 01:01:04.940
and they have to keep offering this annual sacrifice so they have to offer it

938
01:01:04.941 --> 01:01:05.660
somewhere.

939
01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:10.520
So the suggestion is they made a makeshift wooden altar that looked like this

940
01:01:10.521 --> 01:01:15.020
with actual wooden slats,
wouldn't poles,
a real garlands and so on.
Uh,

941
01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.940
and that what they've done on the altar is to create a rendition of that on the

942
01:01:19.941 --> 01:01:21.560
interior,
uh,

943
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:26.710
interior precinct wall of the Arra pacas a detail of these garlands here you can

944
01:01:27.501 --> 01:01:28.111
see the bolts,

945
01:01:28.111 --> 01:01:32.390
skulls or boot cranium extremely well and I thought you'd be interested to see

946
01:01:32.391 --> 01:01:36.560
and perhaps not surprised that we can see very close renditions of this.

947
01:01:36.561 --> 01:01:41.060
Also in painting of the time this painting on the left comes from the house of

948
01:01:41.061 --> 01:01:42.740
Livia in Rome.
We didn't look at it,

949
01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:46.580
we looked at the villa of Livia Prima Porta and we looked at Augustus,
his house.

950
01:01:46.581 --> 01:01:47.450
But when we did that,

951
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:51.740
I told you Olivia had her own house across the street from Augustus is and this

952
01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:53.060
painting is from that.

953
01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:57.650
It's clearly a second style wall residual first style done in paint,

954
01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:01.670
projecting columns.
Garland's hanging from those columns,
garlands,

955
01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:06.230
interlace with ribbons.
Just as you see here.
And when this was painted,

956
01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.000
which it was in antiquity,

957
01:02:08.001 --> 01:02:11.900
it would have looked very similar to what you see on the other side of the

958
01:02:11.901 --> 01:02:12.171
screen.

959
01:02:12.171 --> 01:02:17.171
So interesting interrelationships between decoration in sculpture and

960
01:02:17.691 --> 01:02:20.190
architecture and decoration in paint.

961
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:23.580
The accident metric view again shows you,

962
01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:26.070
here's that inner precinct that we've just described,

963
01:02:26.071 --> 01:02:30.390
that the outside had a series of panels,
square panels,
uh,

964
01:02:30.391 --> 01:02:35.391
four of them on the short sides and then are on the front sides with the doors

965
01:02:35.971 --> 01:02:37.080
are flanking the doors.

966
01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:40.530
And then on the other sides of the north and south of freeze.

967
01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:43.830
And I show you a detail of that freeze,
a freeze,

968
01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:46.470
the subject matter of which is somewhat controversial.

969
01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:49.890
I'm not going to go into that here today.
Suffice it to say though,

970
01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:54.570
that Augustus senators,
magistrates,
members of the priesthood,

971
01:02:54.571 --> 01:02:59.430
members of the imperial family all take part in these processions that are

972
01:02:59.431 --> 01:03:03.630
located on the north and south.
Those processions rest on these,

973
01:03:03.631 --> 01:03:06.790
a campus plants down below,
which when you think a bit,

974
01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:10.620
think of it has absolutely nothing to do with reality because how could a

975
01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:15.510
procession of human figures be supported,
uh,
by,
uh,
by,
uh,

976
01:03:15.511 --> 01:03:19.320
canvas plants below impossible.
And yet it is,
you know,

977
01:03:19.321 --> 01:03:23.550
some of that fantasy thinking that we saw in third style Roman painting.

978
01:03:23.551 --> 01:03:24.384
And I show you,

979
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:29.250
I remind you of a detail of garden room queue over here where we saw some of

980
01:03:29.251 --> 01:03:34.240
that fanciful third style painting,
uh,
seems to come into play here.
In fact,
the,

981
01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:38.390
the delicate of canvas leads absolutely beautifully rendered in the are podcast.

982
01:03:38.391 --> 01:03:42.780
You seeing the same sort of thing in the black background of the,
uh,

983
01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:45.600
of the,
uh,
garden room Q.
So again,

984
01:03:45.601 --> 01:03:50.460
interesting in correspondences between painting and architectural decoration.

985
01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.480
The freeze on the south side has a portrait of Augustus himself.

986
01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:56.360
You can see him here veiled,
uh,

987
01:03:56.490 --> 01:04:01.410
taking part in this procession as well as members of the imperial family,

988
01:04:01.411 --> 01:04:02.460
including children.

989
01:04:02.461 --> 01:04:06.210
Here's a little boy in a toga and here's a little boy who is very controversial

990
01:04:06.211 --> 01:04:11.010
in a,
in a,
um,
some kind of a foreign costume.

991
01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.920
And I mentioned that I've written a lot on this.

992
01:04:13.921 --> 01:04:17.490
And in my most recent article on this subject,

993
01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.220
I talk in particular about these,
this,

994
01:04:20.221 --> 01:04:25.050
these children and foreign dress as possibly children who were uh,

995
01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.470
the,
the what we call,
um,

996
01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:31.200
pledges of empire or hostage guests that belonged,

997
01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:35.520
that were children of very important rulers of other parts of the world who were

998
01:04:35.521 --> 01:04:39.090
brought to Rome to live with the emperor in his house in the palace to be

999
01:04:39.091 --> 01:04:44.091
trained with the objective of eventually sending them back to their native lands

1000
01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.170
to serve as rulers.
It was,

1001
01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:51.320
Augustus is way of creating a kind of hedge demonic empire that he controlled by

1002
01:04:51.361 --> 01:04:55.740
getting all of these people on his side and then placing those friends of Rome

1003
01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.520
into important positions around the world.

1004
01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:02.610
And I think that's referred to in these scenes.
Again,

1005
01:05:02.611 --> 01:05:05.580
I'm not going to go in any detail into the mythological scenes,

1006
01:05:05.581 --> 01:05:10.260
but they are scenes like a Roma seated on a pile of arms.
And Armor,

1007
01:05:10.261 --> 01:05:15.261
just as we saw her in the pediment of the temple of Marzel tour and hear a scene

1008
01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:19.500
that seems to have shown Mars,
uh,

1009
01:05:19.501 --> 01:05:23.200
overseeing Romulus and Remus being suckled by the she will.

1010
01:05:23.201 --> 01:05:28.201
So references to Rome's historic and also legendary and mythological past,

1011
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:31.090
uh,
clearly,
uh,
in this monument,

1012
01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:37.050
perhaps most interesting to all of us from the point of view of architecture is

1013
01:05:37.481 --> 01:05:41.890
the original location of this monument in relationship to Augustus,
his tomb.

1014
01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:45.940
And also what has been happening there in recent years under the direction of

1015
01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:48.730
the famous American architect Richard Meier.

1016
01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:52.830
I show you a view from Google earth and aerial view showing,
uh,

1017
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:54.430
the mausoleum of Augustus,

1018
01:05:54.431 --> 01:05:57.520
this large round tomb that we will look at on Thursday,

1019
01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.010
showing a Piatsa,
uh,

1020
01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:05.040
around it and showing from the air the Richard Meyer Museum that has been built

1021
01:06:05.441 --> 01:06:09.550
to enclose the Arra pockets.
This was not the right near the Tiber river.

1022
01:06:09.551 --> 01:06:13.720
This was not the original location of the [inaudible],
which was up over here.

1023
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:18.340
It ended up beneath a Po,
a palace in the renaissance period.
And at that time,

1024
01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.980
some pieces of it were,
uh,
were,

1025
01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:24.360
were taken apart and made their way to,
to,

1026
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:28.000
to museums in Rome but also to museums as far away as Paris.

1027
01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:32.230
And it is actually to muscle Leni that we can be grateful for.

1028
01:06:32.231 --> 01:06:37.180
Bringing all of those pieces back together and reconstructing the ARRA POC is,

1029
01:06:37.181 --> 01:06:39.700
couldn't reconstruct it cause that palace is still there now,

1030
01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:44.740
but reconstructing it right on the Tiber river next to the mausoleum of
Augustus.

1031
01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:49.300
And then having this whole Piatsa redesigned as the Piatsa honoring Augustus,

1032
01:06:49.301 --> 01:06:53.080
the Piatsa Piatsa,
a imperatore honoring Augustus,

1033
01:06:53.081 --> 01:06:56.430
but also honoring with Salini because there's a major inscription to miscellany

1034
01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:00.970
as well as buildings,
very much in the so called fascist style.
Uh,

1035
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.940
we see the Meyer building again here and I show you,
uh,

1036
01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:07.000
the,
um,

1037
01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:12.550
the travertine cause Myra was careful to use at least some travertine in this

1038
01:07:12.551 --> 01:07:15.250
structure.
The travertine base,
although this was not as,

1039
01:07:15.251 --> 01:07:19.390
this actually belongs to an original precinct that was located before,

1040
01:07:19.391 --> 01:07:23.620
that was done by Mussolini's architect with the entire text of the rays,

1041
01:07:23.621 --> 01:07:25.300
guests die.
Fortunately,

1042
01:07:25.301 --> 01:07:29.290
my kept that and an s and kept that wall as part of his own building.

1043
01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:33.090
Here you see one of the fascist structures in the area of built by my selenium

1044
01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.880
and then the famous Alfredo Ristorante.
I'm not actually recommending it,

1045
01:07:36.881 --> 01:07:39.190
but it's well known there better restaurants to eat in Rome,

1046
01:07:39.690 --> 01:07:44.690
but because it has a certain historical cache at any rate I just mentioned to

1047
01:07:44.891 --> 01:07:45.760
you that it's there.

1048
01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:49.510
This is the interesting inscription that makes reference to Miss Illini.

1049
01:07:49.511 --> 01:07:51.310
And note the flying victory figure,

1050
01:07:51.311 --> 01:07:55.600
which we'll see decorates often Roman arches carrying this bundle of twigs and

1051
01:07:55.601 --> 01:07:58.270
rods at the Romans that Roman,

1052
01:07:58.271 --> 01:08:02.380
the Roman bodyguards of the emperor used to carry the so called fos gaze.

1053
01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:04.900
If you ever wondered where the word fascism comes from,

1054
01:08:04.901 --> 01:08:08.770
it comes from the Roman fos gaze Mussolini's name.

1055
01:08:08.771 --> 01:08:13.771
You can see part of it here and new s s o l part of it scratched out after his

1056
01:08:14.201 --> 01:08:18.210
death.
Uh,
and uh,
discredit a door,
you know,
in the,
in,

1057
01:08:18.230 --> 01:08:19.640
in the 30s.

1058
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.110
And then ultimately what's been interesting to me is I've watched this

1059
01:08:24.111 --> 01:08:27.140
inscription and photographed it year after year whenever I'm there.

1060
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:31.130
I've noticed recently that he's having is something of a revival because they

1061
01:08:31.131 --> 01:08:33.240
are,
and he ha he is with selenium,

1062
01:08:33.241 --> 01:08:35.980
is having something over a Bible in Italy and um,

1063
01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:37.580
there's a good deal of interest in him.

1064
01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:41.330
And they have filled his name part of when they redid the museum,

1065
01:08:41.331 --> 01:08:44.000
they also refilled in his name.
As you can see here.

1066
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:48.170
I just wanted to make a point about the sighting of the Arra pacas and its

1067
01:08:48.171 --> 01:08:52.220
relationship to the mausoleum of Augustus.
Remember,
it's no longer,

1068
01:08:52.221 --> 01:08:54.800
it's what its original locates now.
It's over here,

1069
01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:58.640
right next to the mausoleum and the Tiber that was not its original location.

1070
01:08:58.790 --> 01:09:03.080
It was located over here along the ancient via Flaminia,

1071
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:06.770
the street that Augustus talk when he returned from Spain and gall,

1072
01:09:06.771 --> 01:09:09.650
it was put up right here.
Uh,
and,
uh,

1073
01:09:09.651 --> 01:09:14.651
it had in front of it an obelisk that was brought from Egypt and that obelisk

1074
01:09:15.291 --> 01:09:18.340
was part of a Sundial,
uh,
that would,
uh,

1075
01:09:18.341 --> 01:09:22.910
that was orchestrated carefully enough so that the shadow from the sun would

1076
01:09:22.911 --> 01:09:27.911
fall exactly on the center of the Arra pockets on Augustus is birthday.

1077
01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:32.220
That's how carefully orchestrated it was.
And the fact that,
uh,

1078
01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:35.870
there is an Egyptian obelisk and there's mention in the inscription on that

1079
01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:40.820
obelisk of the victory over Cleopatra and Antony at the battle of Actium and

1080
01:09:40.821 --> 01:09:45.680
that the are pockets commemorates his diplomatic treaties in the western part of

1081
01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:49.670
the empire in France.
And Spain seems to me to be,
uh,

1082
01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:54.500
a reference to the fact that Augustus was victorious in all parts of the Roman

1083
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:58.790
Empire,
the Western,
as well as the eastern part of the empire referenced here.

1084
01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:02.600
And then close proximity to the mausoleum of Augustus.

1085
01:10:02.601 --> 01:10:05.780
Cause we've already talked about the fact that in the minds of the Romans

1086
01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:10.580
victory in battle and victory over death,
we're essentially synonymous.

1087
01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:12.110
Both of them referred to here.

1088
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:15.590
I'm not implying that this was planned as a complex.
The Mazal Liam is,

1089
01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:18.650
we'll see on Thursday dates to 28 to 23.

1090
01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:21.860
It was built much earlier than the altar of 13 to nine.

1091
01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:26.900
But I think when they decided to add the Arra pockets to this complex,

1092
01:10:26.901 --> 01:10:30.920
there was a great deal of thought that was given to siting it in relationship to

1093
01:10:30.921 --> 01:10:34.700
the tomb and to thinking about the whole,
uh,
as a complex,

1094
01:10:34.701 --> 01:10:36.740
at least at that particular juncture.

1095
01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:41.060
And I show you two more restored views where you can see the obelisk and the way

1096
01:10:41.061 --> 01:10:43.520
in which it cast.
It served as a Sundial,
cast,

1097
01:10:43.521 --> 01:10:46.070
a shadow toward the [inaudible] pockets.
And then there,

1098
01:10:46.071 --> 01:10:47.810
even though this is a little bit out of focus,

1099
01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:52.811
the relationship of the very large tomb to the obelisk and ultimately to the

1100
01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:57.470
Aarp Ahca.
So a,
an area that was not planned as a complex but grew into one,

1101
01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:00.340
uh,
a,
an image of MOUs.

1102
01:11:00.341 --> 01:11:05.120
Selenia wonderful photograph of muscle Leni visiting the Arra pockets after it

1103
01:11:05.121 --> 01:11:09.740
was restored and dedicated and placed in,
uh,
a,
uh,

1104
01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:14.430
a complex design by his architect.
And then an image here of Richard Meyer,

1105
01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.770
a celebrating,
uh,
the,
uh,

1106
01:11:16.771 --> 01:11:21.440
the rest of the cleaning and a placement of the,

1107
01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:25.500
our APOC is inside the new museum designed by him.
And in just a few minutes,

1108
01:11:25.501 --> 01:11:29.730
I'd like to run through a series of slides because I think a particularly

1109
01:11:29.731 --> 01:11:33.900
interesting issue for all of us in one that I hope that we will debate in the

1110
01:11:33.901 --> 01:11:38.280
online forum is the fact that the building by Richard Meyer,

1111
01:11:38.281 --> 01:11:42.090
this museum which has been praised and maligned,
both,
uh,

1112
01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:47.150
this museum is the first modern building that has been put up in the center,

1113
01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:51.120
the central core of Rome since the time of muscly knee.

1114
01:11:51.121 --> 01:11:55.950
Since muscle Leni redesigned the Piatsa Boosto imperatore and added some other

1115
01:11:55.951 --> 01:11:59.850
buildings,
uh,
to the landscape of Rome.
There are other,
there are,

1116
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:02.730
there are buildings by major architects,
including Meyer himself.

1117
01:12:02.731 --> 01:12:06.590
Mayor built a jubilees church a few years,
a number of years ago.
Uh,

1118
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:11.010
and Renzo Piano and other architects have been working in Rome,
but they are not,

1119
01:12:11.011 --> 01:12:15.420
their buildings are located on the outskirts and the sort of suburbs of the city

1120
01:12:15.421 --> 01:12:17.040
and not in the city itself.

1121
01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:20.730
This is the only new building that has been added to the city.

1122
01:12:20.731 --> 01:12:24.660
And you can see from this particular view why some people think of it as a kind

1123
01:12:24.661 --> 01:12:29.460
of white elephant that really doesn't fit the tenor of uh,
the um,

1124
01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:32.520
the,
uh,
the city.
And in fact,

1125
01:12:32.521 --> 01:12:35.410
when it first opened in 2006,
uh,

1126
01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:38.250
and I was there not long after and uh,

1127
01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.900
taking some photographs of some pictures of the building that were outside that

1128
01:12:42.901 --> 01:12:46.170
had been,
the graffiti had been added to a,
and they're,
you know,

1129
01:12:46.171 --> 01:12:50.430
they call it the Meyer criminology.
And over here,
this is my favorite.

1130
01:12:50.431 --> 01:12:55.431
It says [inaudible] far meaning those architects of the past where a lot better,

1131
01:12:57.110 --> 01:13:00.320
uh,
than Meijer is the,
is the message here.
So there are,

1132
01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:03.990
there are many people who do not like this building and I think a case can be

1133
01:13:03.991 --> 01:13:07.680
made with regard to the outside.
My are,
there is a nod,
you know,

1134
01:13:07.681 --> 01:13:12.120
to ancient Rome with the travertine wall that is outside and continues inside.

1135
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:15.810
But it's typical Meyer white glass and,
and a lot of people,

1136
01:13:15.811 --> 01:13:19.380
I mean I don't mind that sort of thing,
but a lot of people feel that it doesn't,

1137
01:13:19.381 --> 01:13:23.130
it doesn't really suit the environment with the two baroque churches right

1138
01:13:23.131 --> 01:13:25.350
across the way and so on and so forth.

1139
01:13:25.351 --> 01:13:28.140
So I think a case can be made for the exterior,

1140
01:13:28.141 --> 01:13:32.490
but when you enter into the museum and got pay your fee and then go into the

1141
01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:35.010
door and into the,
our pacas itself,

1142
01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:37.650
I have to say and pass the marble,

1143
01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:41.230
the plaster casts of Augustus in his family,
uh,

1144
01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:44.040
that you can see lined up against the travertine wall.

1145
01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.950
When you confront the building itself in its new interior,
I have to say,
I,

1146
01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.380
I'm very impressed and very moved by this interior.

1147
01:13:52.381 --> 01:13:53.930
You've got the sort of egg crates,

1148
01:13:53.931 --> 01:13:58.260
ceiling and these wonderful louvered windows that allow you to see not only

1149
01:13:58.270 --> 01:14:02.820
miscellaneous fascists buildings next door,
but also the mausoleum of Augustus.

1150
01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:04.580
Uh,
that it,
that it really,
I'm not,

1151
01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:09.540
the light is superb and it really does give you a chance to see this altar in a

1152
01:14:09.541 --> 01:14:12.550
way that it hasn't been seen before.
And especially at night.

1153
01:14:12.551 --> 01:14:15.400
I enjoy seeing it at night because as you go by it,

1154
01:14:15.401 --> 01:14:17.620
they have it laid it up as you drive by.

1155
01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:19.780
One of the greatest things to do in Rome,
by the way,

1156
01:14:19.781 --> 01:14:24.781
is late at night when all the traffic has died down either by car vesper or

1157
01:14:24.971 --> 01:14:27.700
whatever.
I just,
just get around the city,

1158
01:14:27.701 --> 01:14:29.350
go from one part of the city to another,

1159
01:14:29.351 --> 01:14:33.160
which you can zip around late at night and driving along lingo.

1160
01:14:33.161 --> 01:14:37.630
Tevere the street along the Tiber river and seeing the Ma,

1161
01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:42.690
the alter of the are Apaka Pakistan who started light it up inside the new Myer

1162
01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:47.440
Museum,
like a jewel and a jewel box.
I can't help but think Augustus is smiling,

1163
01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:48.640
uh,
somewhere,
uh,

1164
01:14:48.641 --> 01:14:53.200
to think that everything he did to try to preserve his memory for posterity has

1165
01:14:53.201 --> 01:14:58.201
been done and has been helped to a great extent by the great American architect

1166
01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:00.910
Richard Meyer.
Thank you.
