1
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.690
Good morning everyone.
As you can see from today's lecture title,

2
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:11.691
we're going to be talking about painting palaces and villas in the first

3
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:13.860
century,
a d.

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.220
But I could also call this lecture a lecture on a third and fourth style Roman

5
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:25.110
wall painting because we're going to continue our conversation today about the

6
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:29.040
four architectural styles of Roman wall painting.

7
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.600
In order to,
uh,
in order to do that,

8
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:37.950
I just want to remind you of what we talked about last time.

9
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:42.570
We covered the first and second styles of Roman wall painting and you'll

10
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:46.710
remember that what they had in common is that they both tried to create an

11
00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:49.470
illusion of what they weren't.
In a sense,

12
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.130
think back to the first style of Roman wall painting when the painters tried to

13
00:00:55.261 --> 00:01:00.261
transform a rubble wall into a marble wall to create the illusion that it was

14
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:05.460
indeed a marble wall rather than a rubble wall.

15
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.710
And in the case of the second style,

16
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:11.610
and I show you two examples again of that here,
the uh,

17
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.810
the from the villa,

18
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.840
the detail from the villa of Publius Scania's Sydney store on the left hand side

19
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:22.881
of the screen now in the Metropolitan Museum of art and the House of Augustus,

20
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.560
the room of the masks and the house of the,

21
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.830
of Augustus on the Palatine Hill in Rome.

22
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.310
Both examples of second style Roman wall painting.

23
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:37.140
And we saw in this instance that the illusion was to create the sense that you

24
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:41.970
were looking through a window to transform once again the rubble wall into a

25
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:42.511
window,

26
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:47.511
a window that showed what might lie outside the villa in the Paris style court.

27
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:48.600
For example,

28
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.750
remember this one with the shrine or throw loss that is surrounded by blue sky

29
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:59.160
and looks like it is located perhaps in a domestic peristyle.

30
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.380
And then over here,
uh,

31
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:05.640
this window that opens onto a sacro idyllic landscape,

32
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:10.641
we are being beckoned into that sacro idyllic landscape to explore the sacred

33
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:13.710
items within it.
And even beyond.

34
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:18.711
So opening up these walls illusionistic Lee both in the w to create an illusion

35
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:20.851
in both.

36
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:25.851
But in the case of the second style to open the wall up illusionistic Lee as a

37
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:30.730
panoramic window.
We also explored the fact that in the second style,
uh,

38
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.940
the Roman designers,
the Roman painters,
uh,

39
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.210
seem to have experimented with one point linear perspective.

40
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.590
This perspective in which all points recede to a single point in the distance.

41
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:48.240
And that we see that use of one point perspective.

42
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.220
In the second stall wall paintings in the room of the masks,

43
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.690
we also talked about the relationship between second style Roman wall painting

44
00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:02.691
and theatrical architecture that they may have been looking at actual theaters

45
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:07.690
possibly and would possibly in a other more permanent materials that no longer

46
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:12.250
survive or they may have been creating this in part out of whole cloth.

47
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.410
Uh,
so this connection to the theater.

48
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:18.910
And the one last point that I want to remind you of is the fact that we also

49
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:23.080
discussed that although there's an enormous respect for earlier Greek

50
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:27.460
architecture,
not only in these paintings but in the temples and in the cities,

51
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.980
uh,

52
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.980
and in the sanctuaries that we've already explored and we see the Roman painters

53
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:38.641
using those elements of Greek architecture columns and pediments and the like in

54
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:43.420
the second style,
we also see that they are beginning to break the rules.

55
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:45.340
They have a respect for Greek architecture,

56
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:48.670
but they're all also willing to bend the rules.

57
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.990
An example being of course,
their use of the triangular pediment here,

58
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:57.991
but they have broken that triangular pediment apart to reveal the throw loss

59
00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:59.110
here.

60
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.580
This is a very important development and we saw it already also in the sanctuary

61
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:08.440
of Fortuna premed Jania at Palestrina where you'll remember the column capitals

62
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:13.420
in the ramp and how they slanted those column capitals in a way that Greek

63
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:15.280
architects never would have done.

64
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.520
We see that same sort of breaking of the rules here.

65
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.870
It's extremely important because it shows again that although they revered the

66
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:26.560
past,
they were willing to look forward to the future and we're going to see,

67
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:31.561
especially in the late first century AED into the second century Aidy further

68
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:36.631
exploration of that kind of thing and it's going to have a huge impact on Roman

69
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.350
architecture.

70
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.870
In order to explore the third and fourth styles,

71
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.100
I need to go to a couple of other cities than the ones we've looked at thus far.

72
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.930
Uh,
I have the map here.

73
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:54.931
Once again that shows Campania we are going to be looking at the city of or a

74
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.590
villa in the town of a plunkitis which you see here.

75
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.860
We'll also be looking at an important villa at bus go,

76
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:07.030
Trey Causei and you can see the proximity of those two to the sites we've

77
00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:09.940
already discussed.
Pompei,
Herculaneum,

78
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.630
Boscoreale Ali and also Naples.
Up here.

79
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.270
I want to look first at a villa or the paintings at a villa at a planted this

80
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.380
villa.
And you see,

81
00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:28.060
a plan of adhere appears to have been belonged to a woman by the name of

82
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:32.910
[inaudible],
p o p p a e a p.
O p.
P.

83
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.540
E a who was pope paya.
Paul Pena was first the mistress,

84
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.860
and then the wife of Rome's notorious Emperor Nero.

85
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.061
Initially,

86
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:48.061
it looked as if the two were soulmates because she seemed to have as much as of

87
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:53.311
a mean streak as he did in that she encouraged him quite avidly to murder his

88
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:58.340
mother,
uh,
to murder his early,
his wife,
uh,

89
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:02.000
and even to murder the philosopher Seneca.

90
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.800
But despite the fact that they seem to have been soul mates,
uh,

91
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.450
neuro turned against her.
And in fact,

92
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:13.280
when she announced to him that she was pregnant,
he kicked her in the stomach,
uh,

93
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.100
which caused her death.
But after her death,

94
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:20.840
he took advantage of her death and divinized her made her a diva for his own

95
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:24.680
political purposes.
So a very interesting saga here,
uh,

96
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:29.630
between neuro and his wife pay up.
The reason that we think pope pay,
uh,

97
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.170
uh,

98
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:35.170
owned this villa or lived in this villa at some point and the villa dates we

99
00:06:35.421 --> 00:06:38.090
believe to 20 to 10 BC.

100
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.060
The reason we believe that she lived there is that there was a,
uh,
a,

101
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.030
an Amphora,

102
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.360
one of these terracotta pots that was found in the excavation with the name of

103
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:53.170
the,
a Friedman Friedman of popup,

104
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.570
which suggests that she may well have lived there.

105
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:02.120
The other interesting observation that archeologists made when they excavated

106
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.410
this particular house is that it looked like it had been empty at the time of

107
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:11.240
the eruption of Vesuvius when it had been indeed covered over with ash and lava.

108
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.750
And they also found a lot of tools lying around the house,

109
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:16.860
which led to their belief,
uh,

110
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.330
that the house was probably in the process of being renovated.

111
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:24.650
It may have suffered damage in the earthquake and was in the process of being

112
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:29.540
renovated before reuse at the time Vesuvius struck.

113
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.990
If we look at this very good plan of what is preserved of this village today,

114
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:35.790
uh,

115
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.890
we can pick out a number of features that we've already become accustomed to in

116
00:07:39.891 --> 00:07:44.360
our study of Roman domestic architecture houses and villas.
Uh,

117
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.410
we can see Paris dial courts with columns.
For example.
Uh,

118
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.360
we notice here the very large atrium with the,
uh,

119
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.130
[inaudible] designated here in plan.

120
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.120
There was a kitchen and an extensive kitchen over here as well.

121
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:03.770
We also see the use of columns,
these colonnades,
uh,
that,
uh,

122
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:06.860
that are part of Paris styles in some cases,

123
00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:11.780
but also our colonnades that look out from the villa toward what,

124
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.460
what,
what surrounds it,
the landscape and the sea and so on that surround it.

125
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:21.460
And it's another example of what we began to see in the second phase of the plan

126
00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:23.890
of the Ville of the mysteries in palm pay.

127
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.540
And that is an opening up of the facade,
a,

128
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.530
an incorporation of a larger number of windows,
uh,

129
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.430
to make the facade lighter and more airy,
uh,

130
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.440
as well as a series of colonnades with spectacular views toward what lay outside

131
00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:42.480
the villa.
The most important room for us today,
uh,

132
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.890
is room number eight over here.
Uh,

133
00:08:45.891 --> 00:08:50.891
and that room is part of an interior bath and elaborate interior bath.

134
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:55.200
Uh,
that was part of visibility and room number eight,

135
00:08:55.201 --> 00:09:00.201
which is basically a rectangular room as you can see here was the caldarium or

136
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:03.030
the warm room of that bath.

137
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:08.031
And it has some very interesting paintings that will show us the transition

138
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.530
between what we know of his second style Roman wall painting and what we term

139
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.260
third style Roman wall painting.

140
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.910
This is a view of the villa as it looks today.
You can see like Herculaneum,

141
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:25.470
it is very closely surrounded by a modern apartment houses and so on.

142
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.730
Here you see it,
it's only again,
part of what the original villa was.

143
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.080
But even from this view,

144
00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:35.250
you can get a sense of how open it was compared to those very enclosed severe,

145
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.120
don't miss a tall Wicca houses that we began with a will you see,

146
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:43.980
hear this opening up views through columns,
both uh,
and doorways,

147
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:49.010
but also these peristyle courts and colonated courts and so on that again,

148
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.430
give this a very open,
oh,

149
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.800
open a appearance,
which is part of again,

150
00:09:55.801 --> 00:10:00.801
this important development toward that kind of openness the house has in the

151
00:10:01.981 --> 00:10:06.960
villa has in it both second and third style Roman wall paintings,

152
00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:10.890
which again makes it extremely interesting because it is clear that there was

153
00:10:10.891 --> 00:10:14.610
some transitioning here from one style to the other.

154
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.450
And I should mention by the way that with regard to the first,

155
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.570
second and third and fourth styles,
uh,

156
00:10:21.571 --> 00:10:26.430
they weren't necessarily an evolution,
a development from one point to another.

157
00:10:26.431 --> 00:10:27.330
By that I mean,

158
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.720
I don't think the painters of the patrons and necessarily had in mind,

159
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:35.070
we're going to start at point a and get to point d eventually.

160
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.840
I think that what we're dealing with here as we talk about this chronological,

161
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.351
uh,

162
00:10:40.351 --> 00:10:45.351
evolution is a transition of styles that had something to do in part probably

163
00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:46.351
with fashion,

164
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:51.270
with fashion for a particular way of decorating things and of course with

165
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:55.410
influences that were coming in from other parts of the world.
And in fact,

166
00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:59.970
as far as the transition from the second to the third style,
uh,
this,

167
00:10:59.971 --> 00:11:02.670
this cycle of style,
a style styles,
uh,

168
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:07.440
seems to suggest that at the time that the second style was at its most,

169
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.260
uh,
most,
uh,
popular,
uh,

170
00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:14.490
was just when those who own these houses wanted to move on to something new.

171
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:19.350
Understandably once everybody had it,
it was time to think about something else.

172
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:23.700
And so the cycle just as these walls that we've been describing,

173
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:25.540
the room of the masks,
uh,

174
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.490
the funniest Sydney store and this one in a plant us that we see on the left

175
00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:32.790
hand side of the screen,
just as they gained their greatest popularity,

176
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:37.410
there was a decision to move on to still another cycle of taste.

177
00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:37.831
And again,

178
00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:42.690
that's exactly what we're going to see at a plant as I show you here on the left

179
00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:44.440
actually is not on your monument lists.

180
00:11:44.441 --> 00:11:46.620
But in order to get us to the third style,

181
00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:49.620
I want to say something about a second style painting.

182
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.040
It add a plant this and we see a detail of that.

183
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.790
The left hand side of the screen,

184
00:11:55.230 --> 00:12:00.160
I compare it to the second style or a part of the second style wall,
uh,

185
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.760
of Pf Arnia Sydney store at Bosco Arreola.

186
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.520
And I think you can see the resemblance between the two.

187
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.920
The objectives are the same.
Uh,

188
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:13.540
the artist is trying to open up the wall to create a picture window through

189
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:16.540
which you can see,
uh,
a vista,

190
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.680
a vista that includes a round shrine just as we saw here.

191
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:24.750
So the same at a plant is around shrine in this case with the windows,
uh,

192
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.050
spread to see a cult statue inside.
And that shrine,

193
00:12:29.051 --> 00:12:33.180
that circular Shriner throw loss surrounded by a peristyle,

194
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:36.310
the kind of Paris peristyle that one might have seen,
uh,

195
00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:40.030
inside one of these Roman houses surrounding a garden.

196
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:44.920
Just as at bus Gloriola we see the,
the,
uh,
the gateway,

197
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.930
uh,
that seems to separate us from what lies beyond,
uh,
and we see again,

198
00:12:49.931 --> 00:12:52.790
the structure surrounded by blue sky.
Uh,

199
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:57.810
we also see these very substantial columns that are characteristic of the second

200
00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:02.851
style projecting out into the spectators space supporting and tablatures that

201
00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:08.221
also project out into the spectators space and supporting also a lintel that has

202
00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:12.820
a,
uh,
a ceiling,
uh,
with,
uh,

203
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.060
with coffers that recede into depth.

204
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.070
So what we see in second style at a plant is,

205
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:23.100
is very similar to what we saw at second style at Bosco Arreola and also at

206
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:28.240
Pompei Curriculum,
16 of the villa of the mysteries.

207
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:33.690
But if we look at call Darian eight room eight of the call Dorian of the bath,

208
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:39.760
we see something that may or may look superficially similar,

209
00:13:39.761 --> 00:13:42.280
but it's actually very,
very different.

210
00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:46.420
And I think you can pick out those differences very quickly.
Just as I can.

211
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:51.750
What we're looking at here is a view of a three walls and the most important

212
00:13:52.361 --> 00:13:56.320
back wall here.
And then the walls to the right and to the left.

213
00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:00.760
And if you look carefully,
you will see that the coloration is similar.
Uh,

214
00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:05.760
the famous Pompei and read a nice maroons,
some blacks,
some gold,
uh,

215
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.320
use tier.
And again,
quick glance,

216
00:14:08.321 --> 00:14:13.300
you see that there's a landscape of some sort with a blue sky right in the

217
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:17.920
center.
So you're being used to second style painting.
You might say to yourself,

218
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.580
oh,
well that's another window into something that lies beyond.

219
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.830
But if we look at it very carefully,

220
00:14:23.831 --> 00:14:26.440
we will see that that is not the case at all.

221
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:31.390
We're going to see here that what has happened is that the artists have
rejected,

222
00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:31.871
uh,

223
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:36.871
the perspect tival panoramas of the second style in favor of going back to a

224
00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:43.540
appreciation of the flatness of a wall.
What is a wall?
But flat,

225
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.420
a wall is flat,
a flat wall is to be decorated.
So,
uh,

226
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:49.151
sort of,
uh,

227
00:14:49.151 --> 00:14:54.151
believing in that integrity of that wall is the cornerstone of the thinking.

228
00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.770
For what we call third style Roman wall painting.

229
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.450
And you can see the way the artist has treated the wall,
a series of zones,

230
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.400
uh,
painted Maroon zone or a Sokal down here,
a middle tier,

231
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:11.690
painted Pompei and read an upper tier,
painted this gold,

232
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.130
all of which looks like a series of stripes across the wall.

233
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.750
Let me show you another view,
which is a little bit brighter,

234
00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:25.370
so that I think you can see this better.
The Maroon Zone,
the red zone,

235
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.380
and the gold zone.
Uh,
and if you look also at the,
uh,

236
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.270
the painting in the center,

237
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.540
you will see that there are some architectural elements,

238
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:40.430
but they are not the substantial architectural elements of the second style.

239
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:44.200
Uh,
they are very attenuated.
If you look at these,
and we'll,

240
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.850
I'll show you a detail in a moment.
It does.

241
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.650
They are in fact columns we'll see with capitals at the top,
but from a distance,

242
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.380
they don't look like they ha they don't look like columns.

243
00:15:54.381 --> 00:15:58.130
They look like white stripes,
uh,
against a flat wall.

244
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.180
They support lintels.
As you can see here,
these lintels don't project,

245
00:16:02.181 --> 00:16:03.320
they're just straight Lindell's.

246
00:16:03.321 --> 00:16:07.880
It not broken in any way and they too are very delicate.
Uh,

247
00:16:07.881 --> 00:16:11.180
and from a distance look like a stripe against the wall,

248
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.350
not like a lintel.
We can also see,

249
00:16:15.351 --> 00:16:18.620
and I think that by having the detail will help you here.
Yeah.
Let me,

250
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.800
let me first show you a comparison between this wall and called Dorian eight and

251
00:16:24.531 --> 00:16:27.170
the second style wall that we looked at just before.

252
00:16:27.171 --> 00:16:30.320
And I think you can see very clearly the differences here,

253
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.660
the substantial columns in this case,

254
00:16:32.661 --> 00:16:37.310
the opening up of the wall as a window to something that lies beyond this is

255
00:16:37.311 --> 00:16:40.640
very different.
Yes,
there's a blue sky.
Yes,
there's a tree,

256
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.690
but that scene is contained within a frame.

257
00:16:44.691 --> 00:16:48.920
I think I can also illustrate that better here by showing you a detail of that

258
00:16:48.921 --> 00:16:52.230
central panel.
That central panel by the way,
uh,

259
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.750
represents not something that one would be likely to see outside the window of

260
00:16:56.751 --> 00:17:00.600
one's house.
Uh,
but rather a mythological scene,
uh,

261
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:05.120
which represents the legendary hero Hercules.
You see him over here,

262
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.340
uh,
Hercules and in fact,

263
00:17:07.341 --> 00:17:11.300
Hercules has just finished the last of his 12 labors.
Uh,

264
00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:15.590
and he has brought back the apples of the disparities which you see sitting on a

265
00:17:15.591 --> 00:17:20.300
rock over here.
Uh,
and so he is celebrating the last of the,

266
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.030
uh,
of,
of,
of these 12 labors.

267
00:17:23.031 --> 00:17:25.670
For some reason he seems to be the kind of tree hugger here.

268
00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:30.440
He seems to be hugging the tree.
A tree that has a yellow ribbon tied around it.

269
00:17:30.441 --> 00:17:32.030
We,
we use today yellow,

270
00:17:32.031 --> 00:17:37.031
really Thai yellow ribbons around things are a variety of reasons as we know,

271
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.370
we don't know exactly why the Romans did that,

272
00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:43.370
but we see that frequently in Roman wall painting.

273
00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:48.530
But here he is standing at the base of the tree is Labor's completed.
Uh,

274
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.390
and tree again is surrounded by blue sky.

275
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:56.070
But I think you can see that it is not a window into something that lies beyond

276
00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:00.510
because the scene is contained within this frame.

277
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:05.780
And what the artist has done is outlawed the frame with a very black dark black

278
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.790
outline.
Now,
whether this has anything to do with us,

279
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:12.450
old curtains that we talked about in the second style might be interesting to

280
00:18:12.451 --> 00:18:13.284
speculate,

281
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:18.590
but it looks to us like it's basically just a frame that is making it clear that

282
00:18:18.631 --> 00:18:21.390
this is flat,
that what we are dealing here with,

283
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:26.391
what we are dealing with here is a flat wall onto which a panel picture has been

284
00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:31.680
attached.
It is Haung.
It seems to be hung on that flat wall.

285
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.270
It is not meant as a,

286
00:18:33.271 --> 00:18:37.500
as a window or a panorama into something else besides the black frame.

287
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:42.500
You see there's also a moulded frame very nicely painted here and in this detail

288
00:18:42.661 --> 00:18:43.800
you can see that again,

289
00:18:43.801 --> 00:18:48.510
what looked like stripes and white stripes on a flat wall from a distance are

290
00:18:48.511 --> 00:18:49.620
indeed columns.

291
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.940
You can see that they support capitols and a lintel up above,

292
00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.080
but from a distance,
again,
they don't look that way and their capitals that are,

293
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.130
they are columns and capital's very different from what we've seen before

294
00:19:02.131 --> 00:19:05.530
because again,
they are very,
very,
very attenuated,
very deaf,

295
00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.910
very delicate.
Uh,

296
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:12.720
they don't have any of the substance of the columns of the second style.

297
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.070
Look up above the panel picture of Hercules.
And you'll see,

298
00:19:17.071 --> 00:19:18.990
and I have a better detail of this in a moment,

299
00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:24.290
a series of figures that are located in the yellow zone and I can show them

300
00:19:26.101 --> 00:19:31.101
better to you perhaps here where you're looking also at a view of the Sokal.

301
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.460
This side of the wall,

302
00:19:32.461 --> 00:19:37.020
you may have noticed this and the general view is actually a niche is actually a

303
00:19:37.021 --> 00:19:40.980
niche.
A rectangular is fairly shallow,
rectangular niche there.

304
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.160
So the painting continues into that niche,

305
00:19:44.161 --> 00:19:45.870
which gives it a little sense of depth,

306
00:19:45.871 --> 00:19:50.760
a little more sense of depth than it would have otherwise.
Uh,
and uh,
above,

307
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.560
above the niche is a soffit,
which you can see is also painted.

308
00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:59.100
And I show you a detail of that soffit up above.

309
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.240
If you look at what's right above the picture,
the painting of Hercules,

310
00:20:03.241 --> 00:20:05.910
you will see,
and I'll show you these in detail in a moment.

311
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.310
A forest that is a man who plays a Sithrah,
uh,

312
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.100
who was seated there and his playing his instrument on either side of him.
Uh,

313
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.780
we see panel pictures and then on top of those panel pictures,

314
00:20:18.781 --> 00:20:23.010
peacocks,
peacocks that are represented frontally and look out toward us.

315
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.790
And if you look at both,
and we'll look at them in detail again momentarily.

316
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.490
If you look at the Sephoras and if you look at the peacocks,

317
00:20:29.491 --> 00:20:32.070
you see that they are standing on ground lines,

318
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:35.130
but ground lines that don't look like they have any depth.
In fact,

319
00:20:35.131 --> 00:20:37.940
they're standing somewhere where you couldn't really stand.
Uh,

320
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.850
which is one of the interesting features of third style.
Again,

321
00:20:41.851 --> 00:20:45.720
this desire to move and to respect the flatness of the wall.

322
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:50.850
If we look at the Sop,
uh,
we see that that too is painted in red and gold,
uh,

323
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:55.990
that it is divided into a series of panels that in those panels we see floating

324
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.440
mythological figures,
a woman on a bull.

325
00:20:59.441 --> 00:21:01.120
I'll show you a detail of her in a moment,

326
00:21:01.121 --> 00:21:05.230
just floating in the center that she doesn't seem to be in any space at all.

327
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.840
She's just floating there.
And then on either side,

328
00:21:07.841 --> 00:21:12.730
a niche with a shell at the top with standing figures.
And then strangely enough,

329
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:17.080
pictures of still life paintings.
Uh,
right below those.

330
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:22.070
Here's here are all of those details here we see the SIF tourist,
uh,

331
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.290
sitting again where there doesn't seem to be,
he,
there is a,
uh,
a brown,

332
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.480
a Maroon or brown line here,

333
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.750
but it doesn't look like it occupies any space.

334
00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:35.500
So there's this interesting tension between the flatness of the wall and the

335
00:21:35.501 --> 00:21:38.380
fact that there's a figure that seems to be sitting somewhere where there's no

336
00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:42.040
place to sit.
A the same with the peacocks.
You can see them.

337
00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.790
This one standing on this white flat line,
uh,

338
00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:50.770
his toes do seem to be a,
you know,
projecting a bit over those.

339
00:21:50.771 --> 00:21:55.760
So this is interesting tension between what's flat and what might be,
might,

340
00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.290
might have a hint of space.
And then below that,

341
00:21:59.291 --> 00:22:03.760
one of these sacro idyllic landscapes,
again,
framed in black,

342
00:22:03.761 --> 00:22:05.350
making it clear that we are,

343
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.030
we are to read this as a panel picture hanging on a flat wall,

344
00:22:10.031 --> 00:22:12.160
a kind of picture gallery,
uh,

345
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:16.040
in a way that's very different from second style up here.
Uh,

346
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.760
a mysterious figure with a sacrificial dish,

347
00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:23.830
a standing Billy [inaudible] in a niche with a shell decoration at the top,

348
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:28.720
and then it's still life painting with fruit,
uh,
down below.
And then up here,

349
00:22:28.721 --> 00:22:32.770
something that we're going to see becomes ubiquitous in third style Roman wall

350
00:22:32.771 --> 00:22:33.490
painting,

351
00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:37.810
a figure that floats in the center of a colored panel,

352
00:22:37.811 --> 00:22:42.190
either red or black or white.
In this case,
a,
a,
uh,

353
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:45.940
mostly nude female figure who is riding.

354
00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.810
As you can see on the back of a bull,
uh,
at least the front of the,

355
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:53.560
of the animal is a bowl.
And you can see the back of the animal has a,

356
00:22:53.561 --> 00:22:54.400
has a fish tail.

357
00:22:54.401 --> 00:22:59.200
So it's a kind of a bull like sea creature as you can see here.

358
00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:04.960
So this room,
this very important room called Dorian eight in the villa.

359
00:23:04.961 --> 00:23:09.961
At a plant as seems to be a good example of this transition from second style,

360
00:23:11.021 --> 00:23:14.980
which was also in the house to some new cycle of,
uh,

361
00:23:14.981 --> 00:23:17.560
of fashion in Roman painting.

362
00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:23.710
And example of the mature third style,

363
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:28.630
uh,
can be seen in two rooms,
the red room and the black room,

364
00:23:28.631 --> 00:23:32.110
so called for obvious reasons.
This is the red room,
uh,

365
00:23:32.111 --> 00:23:37.111
that belong to the villa of a grip of posthumous at bus go.

366
00:23:38.541 --> 00:23:42.040
Trey Causei that dates to around 11 BC.

367
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:45.760
We believe this house we think,
uh,

368
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.500
also had imperial connections.
That is,

369
00:23:48.501 --> 00:23:53.270
we think that this house was put up in honor of the first emperor of Rome.

370
00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:56.390
Augustus is only child.
His daughter Julia,

371
00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:01.160
the marriage of Julia to Tiberius t.
I.
B,
e R.
I,

372
00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:04.370
u s the man who was to become the second emperor of Rome.

373
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:09.700
The marriage of Julia to tie Bearius may have been the occasion for the

374
00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:11.510
decoration of this house.

375
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:16.670
It bears the name of one of Julia's sons by a different man,
by Marcus Agrippa.

376
00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.600
Uh,
her son,
her last son,
his name was a grip,
a posthumous,

377
00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:25.190
because he was born after she was impregnated obviously by a group of before he

378
00:24:25.191 --> 00:24:30.050
died.
But the child was actually born after the death of a grip,
a hence his name,

379
00:24:30.051 --> 00:24:31.890
a grip of posthumous.
Uh,

380
00:24:31.891 --> 00:24:36.350
there's some speculation that he may have lived in this villa at some point,

381
00:24:36.351 --> 00:24:41.030
but what's important to us is the likelihood seems to be that just as with the

382
00:24:41.031 --> 00:24:42.280
villa at a plumpness,

383
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.910
this villa seems to have been owned by someone in the imperial family,

384
00:24:46.911 --> 00:24:49.950
which is very important because it suggests to us,
uh,

385
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:54.830
not only that the finest artists of the day must have been working on these as

386
00:24:54.831 --> 00:24:59.831
they did in Rome for the house of Augustus or in Prima Porta for the villa of

387
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:01.244
Libya.

388
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:05.600
But also leads me at least to speculate that it's possible that these

389
00:25:05.601 --> 00:25:08.660
interesting transitions from third,

390
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:13.690
from second to third style and third style to fourth style may have come at the

391
00:25:14.271 --> 00:25:18.590
behest of the artists who were these very high level artists who were working,

392
00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:20.720
uh,
in the imperial employee.

393
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:24.710
It makes a certain amount of sense to speculate that that might've been the
case.

394
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.280
So here we have the red room of the villa of a grip of posthumous at Bosco Trey

395
00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:36.290
Cozzie and we can see some of the same features that we saw in called RM eight

396
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.330
of the villa at a plant.

397
00:25:38.331 --> 00:25:43.130
As we see once again that those substantial columns at that opening in the wall

398
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.780
is gone forever.
Banished.
In fact,
the Romans never returned,
uh,

399
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.330
to their quest after one point perspective.
For example,

400
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:54.020
respect for the integrity of the wall,
the flatness of the wall,

401
00:25:54.021 --> 00:25:57.850
the wall as a surface to be decorated.
Uh,

402
00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.840
we see that they have decorated it with a system of tears,
a black,

403
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.260
uh,
Sokal at the bottom,
uh,

404
00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:09.380
than a red central zone and a red upper zone.
And by the way,

405
00:26:09.381 --> 00:26:11.810
we can still see some,
some,
some,

406
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:15.290
we still get some sense that they have looked at earlier,

407
00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:18.410
second style wall paintings.
Because if you look at the structure,

408
00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.380
the overall structure of this wall,
for example,

409
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.710
there still seems to be a central panel flanked by wings.

410
00:26:24.711 --> 00:26:28.790
This whole idea of Reggie and us be Tahlia that we talked about that goes back

411
00:26:28.791 --> 00:26:31.070
to theater design.
Uh,
there's,

412
00:26:31.071 --> 00:26:35.930
there's certainly a hint of that still here in the general arrangement or

413
00:26:35.931 --> 00:26:40.610
formatting of the wall,
but it is completely flat black zone,
red zone.

414
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:41.421
And then,

415
00:26:41.421 --> 00:26:45.480
although we will see in detail that we have a column here with a capital at the

416
00:26:45.481 --> 00:26:47.760
top from a distance,
again,

417
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:52.790
it looks like a white stripe on a flat wall and that's deliberate on the part of

418
00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:57.330
the artists.
Again,
here there's a panel in the center,

419
00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:01.860
but it is not a panel that serves as a window to what lies beyond.

420
00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:06.090
It is a panel that is meant to be just that a panel.
Uh,

421
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:11.150
it's meant to imitate perhaps a marble painted panel that would have actually

422
00:27:11.701 --> 00:27:15.570
hung on a wall in a house or villa like this,

423
00:27:15.571 --> 00:27:19.920
but depicting that here in paint.
So it is meant to be,

424
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:24.950
we are meant to see it as a panel picture that hangs on a flat wall in the red

425
00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:28.980
room at Bosco.
Trey Causei.
Uh,

426
00:27:28.981 --> 00:27:32.850
we can see also some vegetal decoration.
Very,
very delicate.

427
00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:37.710
Doesn't occupy space at all,
decorates the flat wall above.

428
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:42.630
So very similar to what we saw.
Again in called Dorian made.

429
00:27:42.631 --> 00:27:47.100
Here's a detail of the red room where we can see the sacro idyllic landscape

430
00:27:47.101 --> 00:27:47.700
better.

431
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.750
You can see that it follows in the line of others sacro idyllic landscapes that

432
00:27:51.751 --> 00:27:55.290
we've seen.
It has a shrine in this case,

433
00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:00.320
a column that supports an urn at the top with the tree behind that,

434
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:06.470
uh,
some sort of wall with windows over here.
And in this case,
uh,

435
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.650
a group of shepherds with their flocks,
uh,

436
00:28:09.651 --> 00:28:14.400
and other possibly figures,
possibly involved in some kind of ritual,

437
00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.930
uh,
located,
uh,
in and around,
uh,
the shrine.

438
00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.770
Or you can also see here extremely well in detail the way in which they have

439
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:27.800
outlined this panel with a black frame to make it very clear that this is

440
00:28:27.841 --> 00:28:31.680
contained within a frame that beyond that they have.

441
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:35.250
You can now see that this is a column,
a very attenuated,

442
00:28:35.251 --> 00:28:38.010
very delicate column,
more a Collinet,

443
00:28:38.011 --> 00:28:41.670
we might call it a with a capital at the top,

444
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.070
but it is meant here not to,
to uh,
to occupy any real space,

445
00:28:47.071 --> 00:28:49.260
not to project into the viewers space,

446
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:54.470
but to serve as a second frame for the panel picture that is placed on the flat

447
00:28:55.771 --> 00:28:56.370
wall.

448
00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:01.290
I think it's instructive to compare this to what we saw in the room of the masks

449
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:05.760
house of Augustus,
Palatine Hill,
mature second style,
so mature,

450
00:29:05.761 --> 00:29:08.670
second style commissioned by an imperial patron,

451
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:14.010
mature third style commissioned by we think an imperial patron.

452
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.910
Uh,
both sacro idyllic landscapes with white backgrounds.

453
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.290
But you can see the main difference here,
not only the substantial architecture,

454
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:27.500
but the fact that the white background continues behind the architecture,

455
00:29:27.631 --> 00:29:32.250
right?
It continues behind the architecture here,
here,
here,

456
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.900
which gives us the sense again,

457
00:29:33.901 --> 00:29:38.901
that this is something that's a misty landscape of some sort that one could at

458
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:40.440
least with one's eye,

459
00:29:40.441 --> 00:29:45.441
but also perhaps oneself could actually enter into and wander around.

460
00:29:45.671 --> 00:29:49.540
That's the sense you get here.
But here you are.
You are stopped from doing that.

461
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:53.740
There's nothing more here than a panel picture that hangs on a wall.

462
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.940
Now you might say to me that if we're going back to respecting the wall and,
and,

463
00:29:57.941 --> 00:30:02.920
and to,
uh,
having a painting that is fairly flat,
uh,
that,
oh,

464
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:06.850
you know,
what are we going back to the first stop of Roman wall painting.

465
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:10.540
And I remind you of one of the first Dell Roman wall paintings that we looked at

466
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:11.374
together,

467
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.830
but it really is very different from the first style as well because in the

468
00:30:14.831 --> 00:30:17.770
first dial you'll remember the wall was not actually flat.

469
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:23.110
The wall was built up as a relief,
uh,
in a series of architectural zones.

470
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:23.741
Uh,

471
00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:28.570
and then though the individual blocks were painted different colors to give an

472
00:30:28.571 --> 00:30:32.110
illusion once again that this was not a,
a plain wall,

473
00:30:32.111 --> 00:30:37.111
but rather a very exotic and expensive marble wall with marbles brought from all

474
00:30:37.211 --> 00:30:39.370
over the world,
uh,
to decorate it.

475
00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:44.290
So an illusion of something that it wasn't here in the third style.
Uh,

476
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.650
we are again not dealing with any illusions really at all,

477
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.470
but just a respect for the flatness of the wall,

478
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:54.990
decorating that flat wall with a kind of wallpaper through paint.
Uh,

479
00:30:55.040 --> 00:31:00.040
and then putting on that flat wallpapered wall pictures hanging pictures just as

480
00:31:00.611 --> 00:31:03.310
we hang pictures on flat walls today,

481
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:09.970
the Avila at Bosco Trey Causei also has a black room,

482
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.810
a so called because the main color there,

483
00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:17.650
the main background color there is as you can see black it too is interesting,

484
00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:18.161
uh,

485
00:31:18.161 --> 00:31:23.161
and has a and interesting in a somewhat different way but is a quintessential

486
00:31:23.351 --> 00:31:28.090
example of mature third style Roman architectural painting.

487
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:33.360
We see once again that the room has been divided into a central center,

488
00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:38.500
a central area with wings,
one on either side.

489
00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:43.420
We also see that it has been divided into painted zones,
red at the bottom,

490
00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.340
black in the center,
black.

491
00:31:45.341 --> 00:31:50.341
Also at the top we can see that there are architectural members,

492
00:31:51.011 --> 00:31:55.480
although again,
they look from a distance,
like white stripes on a black wall.

493
00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:58.390
But if we get up close to them and I'll show you even some,

494
00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:02.860
some closer views in a moment,
we will see that we are dealing with very,
very,

495
00:32:02.861 --> 00:32:07.810
very,
very attenuated Colinette's with capitals at the top.
And notice,

496
00:32:07.811 --> 00:32:09.010
and this has been true throughout,

497
00:32:09.011 --> 00:32:13.170
they decorate these columns also all up and down,
uh,

498
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:16.600
all along the way with floral motifs and so on and so forth,

499
00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:18.540
which also underscores,
uh,

500
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:22.870
their function as a decorative motif rather than an actual column.

501
00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:27.940
The column supports the Collinet support.
You know,
what looks like a,

502
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:31.860
a very,
um,
simple pediment.
Uh,
it just,

503
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:36.610
it just slightly peaked as you can see up there.
Uh,
and uh,

504
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.440
but,
but,
but there is one,

505
00:32:38.441 --> 00:32:42.770
this painting is interesting because if you look carefully at the freeze at the

506
00:32:42.771 --> 00:32:46.510
upper,
most part of the columns are Colinette's.

507
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:49.490
You will see that there is some hint of space there.

508
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:54.680
Look at the way it undulates.
There's,
uh,
it,
it,
it recedes over here,

509
00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:59.540
receives over there and then it also meanders a in the center.

510
00:32:59.541 --> 00:33:04.280
So there's a slight hint in this particular case of some space,

511
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.530
some respect session into depth,

512
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:11.390
which only adds to the intrigue and mystery of these incredible paintings.

513
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:16.310
These are very,
very interesting in detail.
I can show you here,
for example,

514
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:20.990
uh,
the swans,
uh,
we see some swans and remember these swans,

515
00:33:20.991 --> 00:33:25.610
this again seems to be an imperial house because we will see swans are very

516
00:33:25.611 --> 00:33:29.680
important for the emperor Augustus.
And he decorates the RF pacas enrollment,

517
00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:34.720
great work of architecture and sculpture with swans that may make reference to a

518
00:33:35.061 --> 00:33:39.950
new golden age that he is ushered in.
We see those here,
but look at them.

519
00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:44.630
Look at the way they rest on these little,
a candelabra like a torches.

520
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.710
And then those in turn on a spiraling a canvas,

521
00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:53.840
a tendril that doesn't look like it could support anything at all.

522
00:33:53.841 --> 00:33:55.070
How very strange,
I mean,

523
00:33:55.071 --> 00:33:58.850
to have a swan supported by a tendril like this,

524
00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:03.020
this sort of thing couldn't actually work.
Uh,
and it's one of,
again,

525
00:34:03.021 --> 00:34:06.680
the intrigues of the details of painting such as these.

526
00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:11.260
This is another interesting detail because it shows again a kind of candelabra.

527
00:34:11.261 --> 00:34:16.070
I'm supporting a panel picture that we are meant to read as a panel picture on

528
00:34:16.071 --> 00:34:20.800
the wall.
And if you look carefully,
you can see the Egyptian Ising motifs.
Uh,

529
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.480
in that panel picture,
uh,
there was,
uh,
a,

530
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:26.330
an extreme Egypt,

531
00:34:26.331 --> 00:34:31.331
Romania that spread through Rome and Italy after a Augustus was victorious over

532
00:34:32.601 --> 00:34:37.601
Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the famous battle of Actium a Augustus initially

533
00:34:38.421 --> 00:34:43.370
use these egyptianize and motifs to make political,
uh,
remarks about his,

534
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:48.380
his,
uh,
his victory over Cleopatra and Antony.

535
00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.680
But over time it became more a fashion,
uh,

536
00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:56.720
and we begin to see Egyptian Ising motifs not only in the homes of members of

537
00:34:57.261 --> 00:35:01.760
the imperial family,
but even used even more widely than that.

538
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:06.440
Another detail,
a shows again,
that central area with the,

539
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:11.180
now you can see that they are indeed Colinette's with capitals at the top.

540
00:35:11.181 --> 00:35:14.780
You can also see there are a couple of medallions that turned out to be

541
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:17.780
medallions that have heads in them over here.

542
00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:19.910
But here you can see how fanciful it gets,

543
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:23.930
even though this is clearly a colinette with a capital a what,

544
00:35:23.931 --> 00:35:25.820
what capital supports then I mean,

545
00:35:25.821 --> 00:35:30.080
an unusual building practice supports on top of it,
a medallion with a head,

546
00:35:30.081 --> 00:35:32.510
and then another curlicue on top of that.

547
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:35.660
And that supports the pediment and that has on the edge,

548
00:35:35.661 --> 00:35:39.720
this very decorative dripping off the side.
I mean,
there's no,

549
00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:44.580
this is fantastic in that regard.
Fantastic.
And an end.
And,
and they're,

550
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:47.320
they're clearly having fun,
uh,
with these,
uh,

551
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:52.430
details and with using these wonderful details is drop element over here.

552
00:35:53.221 --> 00:35:56.460
For example,
the portraits are intro,
the images are interested in.

553
00:35:56.461 --> 00:35:57.480
Your heads are interesting.

554
00:35:57.481 --> 00:36:02.380
Many scholars that believe that their representations of God's like Apollo,
uh,

555
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:06.000
but a couple of scholars have put forward the idea and I find it a very

556
00:36:06.001 --> 00:36:09.060
attractive one that we may actually have there.
Two of them.

557
00:36:09.061 --> 00:36:11.700
We may actually have a portrait of Julia,
uh,

558
00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:16.480
whose marriage may have been commemorated here and have her,
uh,

559
00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:20.130
of her stepmother,
uh,
Livia.

560
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:23.280
The emperors of Rome during the age of Augustus,

561
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:28.670
most interesting of all is the small sacro idyllic landscape that floats in the

562
00:36:29.611 --> 00:36:33.690
center of the panel.
Again,
in third style Roman wall painting,

563
00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:38.691
we either tend to have painted panels in the center with frames as we've seen

564
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.570
thus far or floating elements in the center.

565
00:36:42.571 --> 00:36:47.070
They could be a floating woman on the back of a,
of a bull slash sea creature,

566
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.210
or they can be a sacro idyllic landscape as we see here.

567
00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:55.830
And here's another detail where we can blow up that sacro idyllic landscape and

568
00:36:55.831 --> 00:37:00.570
see again that it is just the sort of a sacred and idyllic landscape we've seen

569
00:37:00.571 --> 00:37:04.860
before with the shrine,
top of a column,
a,
a building over here,

570
00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.170
trees,
a tree in the center of their trees,

571
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:11.460
and then various sacrificial goings on in front of that.

572
00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:12.960
But from a distance,
again,

573
00:37:12.961 --> 00:37:17.961
it just looks like some sort of object floating in the center of a very large

574
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.780
black flat wall.

575
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:25.080
One decorative motif among many.

576
00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.720
We looked last time at the,
uh,

577
00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:35.090
magnificent paintings in the villa of Livia at Prima Porta.

578
00:37:35.341 --> 00:37:40.260
And we talked about the fact that that was the quintessential second style wall

579
00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:45.530
because more than any other we saw it was truly the wall as Panorama as a vista

580
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.800
into something that might lie beyond.
And we described in great detail,
uh,

581
00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.270
the features of this particular painting.

582
00:37:55.260 --> 00:38:00.260
It's interesting that you wouldn't think that a garden escape would be a good

583
00:38:01.141 --> 00:38:05.850
subject for third style Roman wall painting,
a kind of painting that again,

584
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:08.970
uh,
respects the flatness of a wall.

585
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:14.030
And yet we do have examples of what we would term a third style Roman wall

586
00:38:14.341 --> 00:38:19.341
painting showing the depiction of a garden scape.

587
00:38:19.441 --> 00:38:20.370
And I turned to that.

588
00:38:20.371 --> 00:38:25.371
Now the painting that you look at is on the wall of the house of the orchard.

589
00:38:25.711 --> 00:38:29.730
The causes dealt through Taito in Pompei,
uh,

590
00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:30.750
in the orchard,

591
00:38:30.751 --> 00:38:35.751
the so called orchard cubic ulum and it dates to add 25 to a d 50,

592
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.640
so considerably later.
And it's interesting,
by the way,

593
00:38:39.641 --> 00:38:41.410
to note the chronology here.

594
00:38:41.411 --> 00:38:46.300
Third Style Roman wall painting has a quite long life because if we talk about

595
00:38:46.301 --> 00:38:49.740
it being used already in 20 to 10 BC at a plant is,

596
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.810
and we're now looking at a house,
it could be as late as 50,

597
00:38:52.811 --> 00:38:57.460
might've been decorated as late as 50.
And uh,
that takes us,
you know,
60,

598
00:38:57.461 --> 00:39:01.450
70,
70,
60,
or 70 years for this one style.

599
00:39:01.451 --> 00:39:04.120
So although I said these are cycles of fashion,

600
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:08.290
fashion wasn't changing all that quickly at this particular juncture.

601
00:39:08.291 --> 00:39:13.240
But here we see a garden scape,
uh,
in what we would call a third style wall.

602
00:39:13.241 --> 00:39:17.370
Now why do we call this a third style wall?
Uh,

603
00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:21.460
it's divided into zones.
We have a black Sokal down here.

604
00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:24.670
We have a zone here,
which seems to show a fence,

605
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.850
a more substantial fence than we saw in the villa,

606
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:32.740
the garden's scape of Libya.
Uh,
it does seem to support some,

607
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:37.720
a marble vessels or vases here.
So you might,

608
00:39:37.721 --> 00:39:39.280
you know,
you look at the bottom,
you think,
well,

609
00:39:39.281 --> 00:39:42.220
maybe there is some suggestion of some space.
In fact,

610
00:39:42.221 --> 00:39:46.780
if you look very carefully at the Gateway of the fence,

611
00:39:46.781 --> 00:39:51.781
you can see that there is some attempt to represent it as if it receives into

612
00:39:51.851 --> 00:39:55.810
depth,
at least the doorway.
So there's some attempted that here.

613
00:39:55.990 --> 00:40:00.580
But if you look at this zone,
I think you'll agree with me that the artists have,

614
00:40:00.581 --> 00:40:05.290
once again,
the painters of once again respected the flatness of the wall.

615
00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:09.190
Yes,
there are columns here,
but they are not substantial columns.

616
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:14.020
They are attenuated columns,
maybe not as attenuated as Bosco Trey Causei,

617
00:40:14.021 --> 00:40:17.470
but attenuated.
Nonetheless,
they do have capitals at the top.

618
00:40:17.471 --> 00:40:20.650
But as you walk into this room and look at them from a distance,

619
00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:25.780
they look like gold stripes on a flat back wall.
And in fact,

620
00:40:25.781 --> 00:40:30.781
the fact that the wall was painted black is very significant and not blue as we

621
00:40:31.121 --> 00:40:34.960
saw in the garden scape of Livia,
uh,
at Prima Porta.

622
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.250
And look also what's particularly interesting is the way in which the artist has

623
00:40:39.251 --> 00:40:41.380
positioned the trees,
uh,

624
00:40:41.381 --> 00:40:45.070
within the frames of the columns.

625
00:40:45.071 --> 00:40:46.390
If you look very closely,

626
00:40:46.391 --> 00:40:51.391
you will see that there isn't a single leaf that either overlaps the columns or

627
00:40:51.941 --> 00:40:54.040
the disappears behind the columns.

628
00:40:54.041 --> 00:40:58.060
They are completely contained within those columns.

629
00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:01.810
They are represented very abstractly,
very flat.
Uh,

630
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:06.340
and so because they are contained within those,
we get the impression,

631
00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:10.720
not that we're looking at a garden scape that is somehow viewed through a window

632
00:41:10.721 --> 00:41:13.770
behind the columns,
but is it,

633
00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:18.420
it's almost as if we're looking at a Japanese screen or something like that.
It,

634
00:41:18.421 --> 00:41:19.060
it's uh,

635
00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:23.560
it's a flat surface that has been decorated with depictions of trees,

636
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:28.710
not a view to look at trees that lie behind these columns.

637
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:32.710
It's,
it's very,
it's really fascinatingly done I think.

638
00:41:32.711 --> 00:41:37.711
And if we look at a detail of the wall in the Casa del Fruit Taito over here and

639
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:44.890
have a tree and a detail of a tree from Olivia's villa at Prima Porta,

640
00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:50.990
I think we again see the differences between the two blue background,

641
00:41:50.991 --> 00:41:54.890
which gives us a sense of reality here.
Mountains in the background.

642
00:41:54.891 --> 00:41:55.760
As you'll remember,

643
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.230
a black background to your gives a very different effect here.

644
00:42:00.231 --> 00:42:04.910
We talked about how the artist was a particularly good observer of nature,

645
00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:08.130
had really gone out and looked at real trees,
uh,

646
00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.900
had looked at the way in which leaves rustled and the breeze had looked at the

647
00:42:11.901 --> 00:42:16.010
way in which again,
light falls differently on a leaves.
You could,

648
00:42:16.011 --> 00:42:19.010
it can bei them in light or it conveyed them in shadow.

649
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.270
And we looked at the very realistic way in which the artist depicted the birds

650
00:42:23.271 --> 00:42:26.700
who are in flight and then a light on a,
uh,

651
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:31.600
on a leaf or a branch of the tree.
Look at the difference here.
Uh,

652
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:35.990
the leaves are beautifully rendered,
beautifully rendered,
but they are rendered,

653
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.090
they are all rendered essentially the same.

654
00:42:38.091 --> 00:42:41.840
You don't have the same sense of the difference of light and shadow.

655
00:42:41.841 --> 00:42:44.930
You don't have the same sense.
I mean,
you don't,
these seem immutable,

656
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:49.400
not as if they could be ruffled by the breeze at all immutable shapes.

657
00:42:49.401 --> 00:42:54.340
And look at the difference in the bird who himself or herself,
uh,

658
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:58.610
seems to be a shape against a black background.
You don't get the sense,

659
00:42:58.611 --> 00:43:01.610
there's no sense of movement as you see of the birds.

660
00:43:01.611 --> 00:43:05.210
As you see at the villa of Livia at Prima Porta,

661
00:43:05.211 --> 00:43:08.000
the bird is one shape among many shapes.

662
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:12.680
The snake has the sinuous snake that makes its way up.
The tree.

663
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:17.660
Uh,
has,
uh,
you know,
you have some sense again of this as a teasing us here,

664
00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:21.620
there's some sense of depth because as it's slithers all along here,

665
00:43:21.621 --> 00:43:24.980
you get the sense that it is intertwining itself,
uh,
with,

666
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:29.760
with the trunk of the tree.
So that may be,
there's a hint of,

667
00:43:29.761 --> 00:43:32.180
have some depth and some motion there.

668
00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:36.890
So this is interesting play I think that the artist has,
has,
uh,

669
00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.740
created here.
But on the whole,
um,

670
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:44.770
this again is a painting that clearly respects all the tenants that have come to

671
00:43:45.561 --> 00:43:49.910
be from the point of view of these artists.
Third Style Roman wall painting.

672
00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.220
Even for a subject as a,

673
00:43:52.221 --> 00:43:56.210
as unlikely for this as a garden scape.

674
00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:04.700
We have talked about third cell Roman wall painting in Campania.

675
00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:09.990
We have talked about the fact that a lot of it seems to be connected in some way

676
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:13.280
to members of the imperial household.
Uh,

677
00:44:13.281 --> 00:44:18.281
and we see the same also in Rome and it's to Rome that I would now like to turn

678
00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:25.840
and specifically to the Golden House or the Dome was our area of the Emperor

679
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:28.100
Nero.

680
00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:33.100
I show you a view of the famous octagonal room of neuros Domus area.

681
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.990
It is one of the greatest rooms enrollment architecture.

682
00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:42.000
It's an octagonal room that has a large oculus.
It is made out of concrete.

683
00:44:42.001 --> 00:44:44.220
It has radiating alcoves,
uh,

684
00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:49.110
and it is in a sense of grandiose version of the figure Doriam,
uh,

685
00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:53.340
that we saw in the style being informed Bas at palm pay.

686
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:57.810
It is part of a very major architectural revolution under Nero.

687
00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:01.350
It is extremely important.
We'll talk about it in great detail,

688
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:04.620
visa vi the architecture in a later lecture.

689
00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:08.670
But I do want to bring up just the contextually,

690
00:45:08.671 --> 00:45:13.320
it works better for me to talk about the painting separately and the paintings

691
00:45:13.321 --> 00:45:17.850
in connection to paintings and Pompei and it's to those paintings that I'm going

692
00:45:17.851 --> 00:45:18.684
to turn.

693
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:23.780
Now the paintings in Nero's Domus area that we will see are both third and also

694
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:27.840
fourth style Roman painting.
So once again,

695
00:45:27.841 --> 00:45:32.841
we seem to be in a situation where we are looking at a palace in this case

696
00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:38.931
commissioned by an imperial patron in which it looks like there was an important

697
00:45:39.001 --> 00:45:41.880
transition from one Roman decoration,

698
00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:45.610
one Roman wall painting,
decoration style,
uh,

699
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:49.320
to a another in this case.
The third style to the fourth style.

700
00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:53.050
The dome is salary of paintings are important,
uh,

701
00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:55.680
for three major reasons.

702
00:45:56.310 --> 00:46:00.750
The first reason is we can date them exactly.
We know that these paintings,

703
00:46:00.751 --> 00:46:05.751
both of the third and the fourth styles were done in the Domus area between 64

704
00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:11.070
and 68 a d we also know,

705
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.840
and we know this very rarely,

706
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:17.870
the name of the painter who was responsible for the third and fourth style

707
00:46:18.181 --> 00:46:21.990
paintings in the Domus area.
His name is one.
You will,

708
00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:26.430
I hope you will.
I hope.
I know you will never forget,
uh,

709
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:30.330
because his name was fabulous.
Fab,
U,
l l,

710
00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:35.160
U s fabulous,
and he was indeed as you shall see,
truly fabulous,

711
00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:38.520
fabulous,
uh,
is known from,

712
00:46:38.521 --> 00:46:42.030
we know him from the writings of Pliny Plin.

713
00:46:42.031 --> 00:46:46.530
Why many of you probably read the writings of Plenty,
tells us a lot about art.

714
00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:51.650
Ancient Art and plenty tells us that a fabulous was the painter or the Dome Miss

715
00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:53.940
Aria in Rome.

716
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:57.780
And he tells us a couple of other interesting tidbits about fabulous.

717
00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:01.020
He tells us that fabulous.
Always used to paint in a toga.

718
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:06.530
Now painting in a Toga is like painting in a three piece suit today you wouldn't

719
00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:10.440
paint in the toe,
you know,
painting and a Toga makes no sense to paint in a Toga,

720
00:47:10.441 --> 00:47:14.060
but he obviously,
whether he really painted into Toka,
we don't know.
Uh,

721
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:17.550
but that was his reputation,
which means he dressed up for the event,

722
00:47:17.551 --> 00:47:21.840
took it very seriously.
We also know from plenty that are plenty.

723
00:47:21.841 --> 00:47:26.220
Tells us that the dome is our area,
was fabulous,
is prison.

724
00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:29.350
Why was it fabulous?
Is Prison.
It was fabulous.

725
00:47:29.351 --> 00:47:32.680
Is Prison because any of you who have visited the dome is salary.

726
00:47:32.681 --> 00:47:33.700
And those of you who haven't,

727
00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:37.090
I hope you will when you're enrolling because it's extraordinary place to see.

728
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:42.580
Uh,
we'll,
we'll see that it is Carter after Carter,
after Carter,

729
00:47:42.581 --> 00:47:43.361
after Carter,

730
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:48.361
and we only have today a very small piece of the Domus area preserved.

731
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.710
Uh,
so if,
if,
if a fabulous,

732
00:47:51.711 --> 00:47:56.711
his job was to paint all of the walls and all of the ceilings of the Domus area,

733
00:47:56.921 --> 00:48:00.760
it would have indeed taken a lifetime.
It would have indeed,
uh,

734
00:48:00.761 --> 00:48:05.390
served as a kind of prison for him.
I suppose a later,
um,

735
00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:10.450
might be interesting to think of him in connection to.
He was not as great as,

736
00:48:10.451 --> 00:48:14.230
but,
uh,
he was in a sense the Michelangelo of his time,

737
00:48:14.231 --> 00:48:17.950
think about Michelangelo and the Sistine ceiling and all the time that he

738
00:48:17.951 --> 00:48:20.890
devoted to,
uh,
to painting,
uh,

739
00:48:20.891 --> 00:48:24.040
that extraordinary space also in Rome.

740
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:26.620
I show you a couple of views of the carters.

741
00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:30.370
I'm not going to go into detail now on exactly why this is the case,

742
00:48:30.371 --> 00:48:34.390
but the dome is,
our area is now underground.
It's subterranean.
It was,

743
00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:36.123
it was,
uh,

744
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:40.150
raised to the ground and covered over in part by a later Roman emperor that

745
00:48:40.151 --> 00:48:43.120
we'll talk about in the future.
So if you wouldn't,
you visited today,

746
00:48:43.121 --> 00:48:44.500
you need to go underground.

747
00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:48.100
It was buried for a long time and rediscovered in the renaissance.

748
00:48:48.101 --> 00:48:52.240
And it's interesting because we know that the famous painter,
Raphael,

749
00:48:52.241 --> 00:48:54.010
the famous renaissance painter,
Raphael,

750
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.730
went underground and was one of the first to see,
uh,

751
00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:02.710
the paintings of the Dome is salary because Rafael left a graffito on the wall,

752
00:49:02.711 --> 00:49:05.590
which basically says Raphael was here.
Uh,

753
00:49:05.591 --> 00:49:09.550
and we're fortunate that he left that because it tells us again that he was
here.

754
00:49:09.551 --> 00:49:14.410
And we're not surprised because this is a low Jetta in the Vatican today that

755
00:49:14.411 --> 00:49:17.650
was designed by when it was painted by raw fail.

756
00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:22.840
And you can see how much the paintings of the Dome is our more weathered,

757
00:49:22.841 --> 00:49:26.240
obviously,
than the one on the left.
But the paintings of the Dome is salary.

758
00:49:26.241 --> 00:49:29.320
I had a huge impact on Rafael.

759
00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:32.920
I'm going to show you three rooms and the Domus area.

760
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:38.020
The first is the,
and I'm sorry I have to show you this too.
In black and white.

761
00:49:38.021 --> 00:49:42.400
It's the only and it's very hard to photograph there and it's uh,
one of the,

762
00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:45.310
it's the only image I happen to have of this wall,

763
00:49:45.311 --> 00:49:49.750
but I am showing you a room called the Sala daily.
Ooh.

764
00:49:49.751 --> 00:49:50.441
Celente,

765
00:49:50.441 --> 00:49:53.890
which means the room of the birds and like the other paintings I'm going to show

766
00:49:53.891 --> 00:49:57.280
you today,
a dates to 64 to 68 a d.

767
00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:02.680
You can see that this is a third style Roman wall painting.
Uh,

768
00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:06.460
it partakes of all the features that we've already described for third style

769
00:50:06.461 --> 00:50:09.760
Roman wall painting.
It,
it,
uh,
it,
it,
um,

770
00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:14.140
has a flat wall as you can see here.
It's not painted red or black,

771
00:50:14.141 --> 00:50:18.190
but in this case white,
which makes it even more delicate looking.

772
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:21.640
But it is definitely,
they have,
uh,
definitely,
um,

773
00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:26.460
observe the integrity of the wall and painted it white.
Uh,

774
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:29.840
you can also see that the architectural members that there are,

775
00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:34.220
are very attenuated and look like stripes on the wall from a distance.

776
00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:37.760
You can see that some of the frames are vegetal or floral,

777
00:50:37.761 --> 00:50:42.200
very delicate as you can see here.
And then in the central panels.

778
00:50:42.201 --> 00:50:44.870
And it's the reason that it's called the solid daily Buccellati.

779
00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:48.180
We have little birds on those little birds float,
uh,

780
00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:52.610
in the center of these panels.
Once again,

781
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.540
a decorative motif among many,
uh,

782
00:50:55.610 --> 00:51:00.610
so the flatness of the wall observed a wall that is flat and to be decorated by

783
00:51:01.221 --> 00:51:05.930
the painter.
That's the solid daily [inaudible] selectee third style.

784
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:10.880
Uh,
this is a vault in the,
uh,
Domus area,

785
00:51:10.881 --> 00:51:14.600
which is useful for us because here we can get a better sense of the color.

786
00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:19.580
Once again,
uh,
the background is white,
uh,
and once again,

787
00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:22.220
the integrity of the wall has been respected.

788
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:26.030
The artist has divided that wall into a series of panels.

789
00:51:26.031 --> 00:51:31.031
But within those panels we see once again a sea creatures in this case,

790
00:51:31.311 --> 00:51:34.790
floating in the center of those framed panels.

791
00:51:34.791 --> 00:51:37.250
We are meant to read them as frame panels.

792
00:51:37.251 --> 00:51:39.860
Not as views into some other world.

793
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:45.150
A note also that some of the frames are done with vegetal and floral floral

794
00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:49.730
motifs.
Very,
very delicate,
very attractive,

795
00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:51.650
very ephemeral in a sense,

796
00:51:51.651 --> 00:51:56.300
very light light weight against that white background,
so very much.

797
00:51:56.301 --> 00:52:00.890
Again,
another example of a third style Roman wall painting,

798
00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.800
but then there is this room and this room,

799
00:52:03.801 --> 00:52:08.280
his room 78 and [inaudible] 78 uh,

800
00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:13.300
is extremely important for us because we see something else is happening in room

801
00:52:13.971 --> 00:52:18.290
78 yes,
it does still have a white wall.
Yes,

802
00:52:18.291 --> 00:52:23.000
it does still use a floral decoration for some of the frames.

803
00:52:23.001 --> 00:52:26.930
Yes,
it does have a framed panels in this case,

804
00:52:26.931 --> 00:52:31.430
not with black but with a red frames as you can see here,

805
00:52:31.431 --> 00:52:34.670
all elements of the third style.
Absolutely.

806
00:52:34.671 --> 00:52:37.580
So it partakes of a number of third style elements.

807
00:52:37.581 --> 00:52:41.000
The White Wall itself is very third style thing to do.

808
00:52:41.001 --> 00:52:46.001
But you will notice of course that something new has happened here and that is

809
00:52:46.371 --> 00:52:51.371
more substantial architecture has been or the representation of more substantial

810
00:52:51.951 --> 00:52:54.910
architecture has been reintroduced a,

811
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:59.720
if you look at these architectural elements that frame some of the panels,

812
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:03.260
you will see that we see once again real columns,

813
00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:07.120
real columns that seem to support projecting lintels.
Uh,

814
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:11.060
and then through those,
once again a white background in this case,

815
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:16.210
but through those we see other elements of architecture here at two storied

816
00:53:16.491 --> 00:53:18.470
columnar,
uh,
uh,

817
00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:23.560
monument and overhear what seems to be a broken triangular pediment supported by

818
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:29.250
columns.
So architecture is substantial.

819
00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:34.490
Architecture is reintroduced in the central zone flanking the panels on either

820
00:53:37.051 --> 00:53:37.884
side,

821
00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:43.050
but it is a different architecture than we've ever seen before because we never

822
00:53:43.051 --> 00:53:45.060
see a complete building.

823
00:53:45.061 --> 00:53:50.061
We see only fragments of buildings this broken triangular pediment on its own.

824
00:53:50.221 --> 00:53:51.480
As an example of that.

825
00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:55.800
Fragments of buildings which we will see are depicted in what I would describe

826
00:53:55.801 --> 00:53:57.390
as illogical space.

827
00:53:57.690 --> 00:54:02.100
They don't look like they're actually occupying space the way a regular building

828
00:54:02.101 --> 00:54:02.921
wood or wood or,

829
00:54:02.921 --> 00:54:07.470
or what and what is characteristic of the second style but depicted fragments of

830
00:54:07.471 --> 00:54:10.350
buildings depicted in illogical space.

831
00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:13.710
And then very important than the upper most zone.

832
00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:19.520
We see a depiction of a number of these fragments of architecture all jumbled

833
00:54:20.041 --> 00:54:22.470
together almost to create a building.

834
00:54:22.471 --> 00:54:24.600
Although it isn't a building that actually works.

835
00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:29.310
I like to call these architectural cages because there they are individual

836
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:32.940
elements,
individual fragments again,
that are grouped together,

837
00:54:32.941 --> 00:54:37.360
architectural cages that often have in them very strange,
uh,

838
00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.540
mythological and other creatures,

839
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:43.560
most of whom are very difficult to identify today.

840
00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:48.830
So we see this incredible transition between the third style Roman wall painting

841
00:54:49.591 --> 00:54:54.591
that fabulous is using for the Domus area to something that is transitioning us

842
00:54:55.861 --> 00:54:58.620
into what we call the fourth style.
In fact,

843
00:54:58.621 --> 00:55:03.080
I would call this room a fourth style,
a Roman Room,

844
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:04.530
a fourth style painted room.

845
00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:08.430
And the genius behind this I would speculate,
uh,

846
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:11.010
was a fabulous himself.

847
00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:13.840
I want to show you another example of,

848
00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:17.460
of fourth style because we believe fourth style.

849
00:55:17.461 --> 00:55:21.260
Remember the date of the Dome is salary is 64 to 68.
Uh,

850
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:25.620
so if it is being is coming to the fore,
the fourth style at that time,

851
00:55:25.621 --> 00:55:30.540
it means that it is about the time of the earthquake in palm pay.

852
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:35.790
And we do see paintings in palm pay that we believe date between the earthquake

853
00:55:35.791 --> 00:55:40.791
of 62 and the eruption of Vesuvius of 79 that are examples.

854
00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:45.060
Also a fourth style Roman wall painting.
This is one of them.

855
00:55:45.061 --> 00:55:50.061
It's a wall from the house of the vestals in Pompei at dates to 62 to 78 and we

856
00:55:52.351 --> 00:55:56.250
can see exactly what I was describing at the dome is our area.

857
00:55:56.610 --> 00:56:00.870
We look at the bottom part and we see that it still has a,

858
00:56:00.871 --> 00:56:05.871
it still looks like a third style wall in that we see golden panels and red

859
00:56:07.891 --> 00:56:12.891
panels with floating figures in the center and with a floral decorations around

860
00:56:14.161 --> 00:56:18.870
those we see over here and mythological panel with a black frame around it.

861
00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:23.160
Uh,
that is meant to look like a panel picture hanging on a flat wall.

862
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:27.760
All of that is exactly what we saw in the third style.
But again,

863
00:56:27.761 --> 00:56:32.440
what separates this from a third style painting is this reintroduction of

864
00:56:32.441 --> 00:56:34.210
architecture over here,

865
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:37.600
architecture PR presented against a white background,

866
00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:41.710
but it's not a full building.
It is a fragment of a building,

867
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:45.690
a fragment of a building with substantial architectural members and of

868
00:56:45.691 --> 00:56:48.790
projecting and tablature above.
And then in the upper zone,

869
00:56:48.791 --> 00:56:52.540
again against a white background,
those architectural cages,

870
00:56:52.541 --> 00:56:57.541
those fragments of architecture that had been jumbled together and are used as a

871
00:56:57.731 --> 00:57:01.540
Amelia for these very strange creatures,
animal,

872
00:57:01.541 --> 00:57:06.340
human and the like,
uh,
that are,
that are located in them,

873
00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:12.090
these architectural cages that are also decorated with a strange and interesting

874
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:15.340
ornamentation,
uh,
at the upper most parts.

875
00:57:15.341 --> 00:57:17.560
So another example of fourth style,

876
00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:23.160
our very best examples of fourth style Roman wall painting all come from a

877
00:57:23.891 --> 00:57:25.810
single house in palm pay.

878
00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:31.410
It is a house that we looked at together before it is the house of the Betty.

879
00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:35.410
Uh,
you'll remember the kitchen in the house of the [inaudible],
for example,

880
00:57:35.411 --> 00:57:39.460
the wonderful garden,
uh,
that we explored there.
Uh,

881
00:57:39.461 --> 00:57:42.320
it is also a house that has,
um,

882
00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:47.550
an incredible array of paintings and it shows us several stages of the fourth

883
00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:49.264
style.

884
00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:54.100
And I should mention also that while we call these styles first,

885
00:57:54.101 --> 00:57:58.400
second,
third,
and fourth as anything else,
they have sub style,

886
00:57:58.401 --> 00:58:02.140
sub sub styles,
uh,
and transition periods.
You know,

887
00:58:02.141 --> 00:58:07.141
one can refer too late for early second style and mature second style late

888
00:58:07.691 --> 00:58:10.200
second style,
early third style transit.
You know,

889
00:58:10.201 --> 00:58:12.190
all of there are certain subtleties because again,

890
00:58:12.191 --> 00:58:15.340
remember the artists who were making these were not thinking,
oh,

891
00:58:15.341 --> 00:58:19.060
I'm transitioning from the second to the third style.
They were just moving on.

892
00:58:19.061 --> 00:58:23.220
They were experimenting with things they hadn't experimented before and they

893
00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:26.380
soon found themselves in a different mill.
Yup.

894
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:30.590
So there are those subtleties and we can see those in the house of the Betty.

895
00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:34.080
I can show you early,
middle and even late,
uh,

896
00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:37.600
fourth style at the house of the [inaudible],
which is just what I'm going to do.

897
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:40.450
Now.
We're going to begin with garden room Q,

898
00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:45.070
which is the one that you see here,
which you can see from the monument list.

899
00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:50.020
We believe dates to 62 to 70 Aidy garden room queue.

900
00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.890
Now,
if all of garden room cue that was preserved was the bottom part,

901
00:58:53.891 --> 00:58:58.240
if you didn't have that very top zone,
and I asked you what style is this,

902
00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:02.650
you would probably tell me third style and you'd be right that it was third

903
00:59:02.651 --> 00:59:03.340
style.

904
00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:08.320
But the addition of that zone in the upper most part gives it away as a fourth

905
00:59:08.321 --> 00:59:09.760
stall wall.
But it's again,

906
00:59:09.761 --> 00:59:13.570
a very good example of an early one because we can see this transition.

907
00:59:13.571 --> 00:59:15.100
So in the bottom,
again,

908
00:59:15.101 --> 00:59:19.480
very much adhering to the tenants of third style Roman wall painting design,

909
00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:24.440
respecting the flatness,
the wall,
dividing the wall into a series of zones.

910
00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:28.700
Uh,
a Sokal that's black,
uh,
a main section that's red,

911
00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:31.580
a sort of wings on either side that are also black.

912
00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:33.440
But as you look at this wall from a distance,

913
00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:38.180
those black elements look like stripes,
large black stripes on the wall.

914
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:41.990
And even within those black stripes,
we see these very attenuated,

915
00:59:41.991 --> 00:59:45.980
delicate colinette's close up.
You can see that they're calling nets,

916
00:59:45.981 --> 00:59:49.940
but from a distance,
again,
they look like gold stripes on a flat wall,

917
00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:54.010
floating,
Floating,
um,
uh,

918
00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:58.640
mythological figures in the center as is characteristic of the first doll.

919
00:59:58.641 --> 01:00:02.150
And then there was a panel painting over here that was rudely removed by

920
01:00:02.151 --> 01:00:04.730
treasure hunters at one point.
So,
uh,

921
01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.540
panel pictures as well as floating a mythological figures.

922
01:00:08.541 --> 01:00:13.220
And then at the upper most part you see this does this addition white ground

923
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.190
architectural,
um,

924
01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:20.620
cages as I've described them with a whole panoply of interesting mythological

925
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:26.291
and other figures that are inserted into those architectural cages.

926
01:00:26.571 --> 01:00:31.571
So a very early example of fourth style Roman wall painting in the house of the

927
01:00:32.271 --> 01:00:35.840
Betty in Rome.
These,
again are so interesting in detail.

928
01:00:35.841 --> 01:00:38.930
If you blow this up to the size that we see it here,

929
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:43.070
you will see that this is that black background in between the red panels that

930
01:00:43.071 --> 01:00:44.330
we were looking at before.

931
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:48.680
You can see all kinds of strange things going on here in detail.

932
01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:53.120
A female figure semi naked.
Uh,
she's clashing her symbol,

933
01:00:53.121 --> 01:00:56.540
she's dancing here,
uh,
and she is supporting on her head.

934
01:00:56.541 --> 01:00:59.060
She's oblivious to the fact that she's supporting on her head.

935
01:00:59.210 --> 01:01:03.700
The base of one of these,
one of these colinette's as you can see here,

936
01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:08.570
pays no heed whatsoever that she's serving as a support for the colonnades and

937
01:01:08.571 --> 01:01:13.080
that either side of her,
uh,
what we call herms,
h e r m s,
uh,

938
01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:17.060
which are part human and part pedestal,
uh,
male heads,

939
01:01:17.061 --> 01:01:21.440
bearded male heads carrying libation dishes or whatever on either side.

940
01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.010
And then a very interesting sacrificing down here.
So again,

941
01:01:25.011 --> 01:01:27.470
as I've said so many times looking at these paintings,

942
01:01:27.471 --> 01:01:31.640
the details of these paintings is a very intriguing experience.

943
01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:37.010
Uh,
the room that seems to be a good example of the mid,
uh,

944
01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:40.100
fourth s style is the house of the vets.

945
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:44.720
He a room of Pentheus,
which we date to around 70 a d.

946
01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:47.880
You see it here,
it is very well preserved.
Uh,

947
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:52.640
it is a room in which the color gold abounds.
As you can see,
a Maroon,

948
01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:56.360
a circle,
the gold central zone,
uh,

949
01:01:56.450 --> 01:02:01.450
it partakes of third style in that you can see that the main parts of the wall

950
01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.700
are flat with a panel.

951
01:02:04.701 --> 01:02:07.850
A mythological panel picture that is surrounded by a frame.

952
01:02:07.851 --> 01:02:11.510
So just to make absolutely sure that the viewer understands what they are

953
01:02:11.511 --> 01:02:15.650
looking at.
Here is a panel picture that hangs on a flat wall,

954
01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:19.280
not a window into something that lies beyond but uh,

955
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:23.370
we see in the central zone the reintroduction of architecture,

956
01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:27.360
substantial architecture where you can really make out the columns and the

957
01:02:27.361 --> 01:02:31.590
pediments but not full buildings,
fragments of buildings,

958
01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:36.360
fragments of buildings that are represented in very illogical space.

959
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:38.160
As you can see here,
again,

960
01:02:38.161 --> 01:02:42.880
substantial elements like this with the supporting the columns supporting uh,

961
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:47.370
the lintel with the coffered ceiling represented in perspective.

962
01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:49.290
So all of that brought back.
Uh,

963
01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.610
but again these are not full buildings as we would see in the second style,

964
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:58.910
but these fragments in a logical space and a detail again of the same that I

965
01:02:59.731 --> 01:03:03.450
just described and it's interesting to compare it to some details from second

966
01:03:03.451 --> 01:03:07.080
style Roman wall painting.
Think a funniest Sydney store,

967
01:03:07.081 --> 01:03:11.490
the Metropolitan Museum cubicles where you can actually,
and these are,

968
01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:15.240
these are,
you can actually,
you really have a sense of,
of what this building was,

969
01:03:15.241 --> 01:03:16.650
is a doorway that leads in.

970
01:03:16.651 --> 01:03:20.400
And then there are a series of tears and there's a balcony in everything.

971
01:03:20.401 --> 01:03:22.200
Everything connects to one another.

972
01:03:22.201 --> 01:03:27.120
But here we see something quite different where we see not a whole building or

973
01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.620
parts of a building together,

974
01:03:28.621 --> 01:03:33.621
but rather these individual pieces that are depicted as I mentioned in a very

975
01:03:33.961 --> 01:03:36.990
illogical way,
the,

976
01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:42.020
the glory of Fourth Style Roman Wall painting I'm in depends on your taste

977
01:03:42.121 --> 01:03:46.450
because it's very gaudy as well.
But one could say that the greatest,
uh,

978
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.050
preserved or the most interesting,
let's put it that way.

979
01:03:49.051 --> 01:03:51.690
The most interesting preserved,
uh,

980
01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:55.050
fourth style wall is also in the house of the Betty.

981
01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:58.320
It is in the [inaudible] room of the house of the Betty.

982
01:03:58.321 --> 01:04:03.140
We believe at dates to 70 to 79.
It is our,
you know,

983
01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:07.620
an example of full blown fourth style at its most incredible.

984
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.121
And you know,

985
01:04:09.121 --> 01:04:12.660
it's almost as if this artists wanted to be remembered for posterity.

986
01:04:12.661 --> 01:04:14.430
We don't know his name unfortunately,

987
01:04:14.431 --> 01:04:19.431
but remembered for posterity as the person who created the textbook example of

988
01:04:20.341 --> 01:04:22.080
fourth style Roman wall painting.

989
01:04:22.081 --> 01:04:27.081
And what's fascinating about it is what he has done is he has mixed together all

990
01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:32.160
of the earlier styles.
First,
second,
third,
fourth first.

991
01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:35.760
We see the Sokal down here is decker.
It's all done in paint,

992
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:41.120
but it is painted to represent marble or to imitate marble incrustation just as

993
01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:44.340
we saw in the first style.

994
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:48.600
So the marble encrustation of the first style used for the Soco,

995
01:04:48.601 --> 01:04:50.160
but again in paint,
not in relief.

996
01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:55.890
The second tier we see the substantial columns supporting uh,

997
01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:59.940
lintels and,
and tablatures with uh,
with um,
uh,

998
01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:04.950
coffered ceilings represented in depth.
That's a second style element.

999
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:06.240
Third style,

1000
01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:11.480
these panels red with a mythological paintings in the center,

1001
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.510
uh,

1002
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:17.510
with frames and overhear a white panel with floral decoration and floating

1003
01:05:18.101 --> 01:05:19.360
mythological figures.

1004
01:05:19.361 --> 01:05:24.010
Those are elements of the third style and the fourth style reintroduction of

1005
01:05:24.011 --> 01:05:28.930
architecture in the central zone.
Fragments of architecture,
not full buildings,

1006
01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.370
fragments of architecture depicted in illogical space.
Uh,

1007
01:05:33.371 --> 01:05:36.460
and then in the upper most tier,
uh,
these architect,

1008
01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:41.490
these architectural cages with people with all kinds of strange figures,

1009
01:05:42.521 --> 01:05:45.310
animals,
divinities,
uh,

1010
01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:47.810
personifications and the like.

1011
01:05:47.811 --> 01:05:52.480
So all of those four styles brought together in one place.
Here's another view,

1012
01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:56.620
one that perhaps gives you an even better sense not of everything I've
described,

1013
01:05:56.980 --> 01:06:00.370
but of the overall appearance of this room as one walks into,

1014
01:06:00.371 --> 01:06:04.600
it's actually a very small room,
but it gives you the sense of grandiosity.

1015
01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:08.800
And this is interesting too because you see in this case the artist has kind of

1016
01:06:08.801 --> 01:06:10.810
matched up,
uh,
the,
I mean he's,

1017
01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:15.340
he's represented two very similar fragments.
One on either side.

1018
01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.890
That in a sense as you stare at it gives you the sense,

1019
01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:20.920
or at least it gives me the sense that perhaps maybe there is something that

1020
01:06:20.921 --> 01:06:25.921
continues behind the wall or behind the central mythological panel picture that

1021
01:06:26.291 --> 01:06:28.630
you see here.
But this is quintessential,

1022
01:06:28.631 --> 01:06:32.530
quintessential fourth style Roman wall painting.

1023
01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.091
I think I had,

1024
01:06:37.091 --> 01:06:41.410
I meant to show you also one fruit more detail here

1025
01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:48.430
where you can see again here,
you can see one of those,
uh,
one of these,
uh,
uh,

1026
01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:53.200
elements with the fragments of architecture and a logical space in detail.

1027
01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:57.700
And you can see even he been here too.
There are strange things going on.

1028
01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:02.680
We see masks reintroduced in the fourth style.
Uh,
we see in this case a mat.

1029
01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:07.710
That mask is supported by a panel picture that represents a,

1030
01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.770
a curved staff,
an animal,
uh,
some,

1031
01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.620
some baskets on top of the table.
I mean it's,

1032
01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:18.070
you try to interpret exactly what all this meant,

1033
01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:21.610
but it's interesting how much detail is put into these,

1034
01:07:21.611 --> 01:07:25.480
even though each of these individual items are difficult to see you 10,

1035
01:07:25.481 --> 01:07:26.980
when you walk into a room like this,

1036
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:30.820
you tend to look at the whole and not at the individual details and yet the

1037
01:07:30.821 --> 01:07:35.140
artist's patrons and so on had paid a great deal of tension of attention to that

1038
01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:36.003
detail.

1039
01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:40.870
I want to show you lastly and thought we could talk about this for a couple few

1040
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:42.960
minutes ourselves together.
Uh,

1041
01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:47.970
I one last fourth style or part of a fourth style Roman wall painting.

1042
01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:52.930
It is a fragmentary wall that we attribute to the fourth style,
uh,

1043
01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:57.960
that came from Herculaneum and dates also to this latest phase,

1044
01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:02.340
some time to 70 to 79.
Uh,

1045
01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:06.100
and it's quite interesting in view,
not only of what we've discussed today,

1046
01:08:06.101 --> 01:08:08.350
but in everything we've talked about,
uh,

1047
01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:12.520
with regard to the four styles of Roman will painting in the last,
you know,

1048
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:16.310
week or so.
Uh,
I,
um,
you know,

1049
01:08:16.311 --> 01:08:19.270
what part of the wall you think this came from.
Uh,

1050
01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:24.260
and what you find interesting about at visa vi our general discussion of Roman

1051
01:08:24.261 --> 01:08:28.760
wall painting.
Someone liked to volunteer to,
to begin.

1052
01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:35.740
<v 1>Yup.
We get a notice that looks like,</v>

1053
01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:40.510
<v 0>yes,
yes.
Yeah.</v>

1054
01:08:40.511 --> 01:08:44.020
We've been debating this whole question of the black curtains and there's a post

1055
01:08:44.021 --> 01:08:47.920
now online and I hope that you'll all add to that as we continue that

1056
01:08:47.921 --> 01:08:51.160
conversation.
Uh,
this one,
in this particular case,

1057
01:08:51.190 --> 01:08:55.570
it seems in controvertible that what is represented here is a curtain.

1058
01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.820
There's no question that's a curtain.
It's hanging up there.
Uh,

1059
01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:03.930
so we get the sense that it is that it has been raised on what is a kind of a

1060
01:09:04.151 --> 01:09:08.140
stage set that lies behind.
So great point.

1061
01:09:08.230 --> 01:09:10.350
What else strikes you about this?
Yup.

1062
01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:20.230
Yes.
Based on the perspective that's used here,

1063
01:09:20.231 --> 01:09:23.210
based on the fact that there's a white background,
uh,

1064
01:09:23.230 --> 01:09:25.660
which isn't always the case in four style painting,

1065
01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:27.670
but it tends to be the case for most of it.

1066
01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:32.230
One could speculate that this is either one of those elements that has been

1067
01:09:32.231 --> 01:09:37.231
reintroduced in the main zone on either side of the central panel or what else

1068
01:09:39.131 --> 01:09:39.964
might it be?

1069
01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:43.743
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1070
01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:49.970
<v 0>right.
The illogical,
the,
the park part of a building in illogical specific,</v>

1071
01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:52.760
it might be in the central zone as one of those side wings,

1072
01:09:52.761 --> 01:09:57.761
but it might also be way up in the top as one of the architectural cages,

1073
01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:03.080
uh,
that we see in the upper most part.
That's also possible.
Uh,

1074
01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.090
so what is being depicted here?

1075
01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:09.683
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1076
01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.890
<v 0>Obviously a stage set of some sort.</v>

1077
01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:16.040
How would you describe this architecture in the foreground?

1078
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:26.040
You all know to state the obvious,
sorry,
it looks like Second Wendy wise.

1079
01:10:26.041 --> 01:10:27.480
It looks like second style because

1080
01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:31.460
<v 1>projecting that it's substantial,
it's projected</v>

1081
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:34.610
<v 0>good.
We have substantial architectural elements.</v>

1082
01:10:34.611 --> 01:10:39.410
It's clear that these are our real columns with real capitals at the top that

1083
01:10:39.411 --> 01:10:41.540
those capitals project into our space.

1084
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:46.750
The artist has made an effort to depict a recession into space as well cause you

1085
01:10:46.761 --> 01:10:50.240
can see the way in which these peers are angled.
For example,

1086
01:10:50.241 --> 01:10:52.490
back to give one the sense,
uh,

1087
01:10:52.491 --> 01:10:54.800
that we are looking at something depicted in space.

1088
01:10:54.801 --> 01:10:59.420
You can see the coffered ceiling up here or the projecting and tablet.

1089
01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:03.710
There's the mask,
which is an another reference to things the attrical.

1090
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:07.850
But is there one point perspective here or is there any attempt to depict one

1091
01:11:07.851 --> 01:11:11.480
point perspective or is it some other kind of perspective and if so,

1092
01:11:11.481 --> 01:11:12.830
what kind of perspective,

1093
01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:19.590
what kind of perspective?

1094
01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.570
No one knows.
Yeah,

1095
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:33.900
no what,
Yup.

1096
01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:40.150
Yeah.
But,
but it's more like

1097
01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.160
<v 1>atmospheric perspective.</v>

1098
01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:48.250
<v 0>No disagree atmospheric perspective.
Uh,
so that again,</v>

1099
01:11:48.251 --> 01:11:50.540
what's in the foreground is,
uh,

1100
01:11:50.650 --> 01:11:53.530
the outlines are from what's in the background is very,

1101
01:11:53.531 --> 01:11:56.830
very fuzzy and gets fuzzier and fuzzier.

1102
01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:59.560
Let me show you a detail of this.

1103
01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:05.730
If you blow it up,
you can see,
I mean,
try to count,

1104
01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.350
I don't know if you're counting tall,

1105
01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:12.000
if you try to count the zones of space here,
you'd go berserk.
Uh,
I mean,

1106
01:12:12.001 --> 01:12:15.030
clearly they are trying to conjure up space,
uh,

1107
01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.160
something that perhaps receipts,

1108
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:22.020
but it seems to be done by means of atmospheric perspective.
What were wild,

1109
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:27.110
where the objects in the foreground are represented with the firmest outlines

1110
01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:32.940
and those in the background with the fuzziest outlines.
As you can see here,

1111
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:36.510
if you blow it up,
you can see that the details are incredible.
I mean,

1112
01:12:36.511 --> 01:12:40.440
you can see the decoration and the freezes.
You can see some of the figural,

1113
01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.040
a decoration,
the capitals and so on and so forth.
Uh,

1114
01:12:44.041 --> 01:12:46.930
but it is lost in this,
it is lost in,

1115
01:12:46.931 --> 01:12:50.940
in something of a haze as you can see here.
So it's,

1116
01:12:50.941 --> 01:12:55.320
it's a very good example of fourth style Roman wall painting.

1117
01:12:55.321 --> 01:12:58.690
It is some,
as it has been suggested,
it is a piece of the wallet.

1118
01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:02.670
Could be one of the wings.
It could be in the upper most zone.

1119
01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:05.430
It certainly makes reference to things.
The attrical.

1120
01:13:05.431 --> 01:13:09.930
It's certainly conjures up in some ways second style,
but it is,

1121
01:13:09.931 --> 01:13:13.740
it is clearly.
Um,
it is clearly an example of,

1122
01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:16.890
of fourth and again I'm glad that the Si,

1123
01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.010
the issue of the curtains was raised because I think that's a particularly

1124
01:13:20.011 --> 01:13:23.790
interesting one and because here we can really see a full bodied curtain.

1125
01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:28.410
I think it will help to add to the speculation that is already going on in the

1126
01:13:28.411 --> 01:13:33.411
online forum and about which I hope we can continue to engage in the days ahead.

1127
01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:39.150
We will have one last lecture on Roman painting on Thursday,

1128
01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:41.760
uh,
in which is entitled Special Subjects.

1129
01:13:41.761 --> 01:13:44.610
And I'm going to deal there with everything I haven't dealt with in the four

1130
01:13:44.611 --> 01:13:48.810
styles.
And then we are going to get back fully to architecture.

1131
01:13:49.230 --> 01:13:53.580
We'll go to Rome and we'll begin to look at the architecture under the emperors

1132
01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:56.430
Augustus and so on.
Thanks.
