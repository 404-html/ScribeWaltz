1
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.573
Good morning.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.560
As you can see from the title of today's lecture habitats at Herculaneum and

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.580
early Roman interior decoration,

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.930
we're going to be concentrating once again at least in the first half of the

5
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:19.170
lecture on domestic architecture in Campania.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.600
We're going to look at several houses in Herculaneum and then we're going to

7
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:29.601
move from there to begin our discussion of early Roman interior decoration,

8
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:35.301
namely the first and second styles of Roman wall painting and what you'll see

9
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.210
makes them particularly relevant to what we've been discussing thus far.

10
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:43.260
This term is the fact that in both the first and second styles,

11
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.400
architecture is depicted in these paintings and we're going to see some very

12
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:51.930
interesting relationships between that and the built the built monuments that

13
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:54.540
we've talked about thus far this semester.

14
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.930
Just to remind you of the location of Herculaneum,

15
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:02.730
which is usually called the sister,

16
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:06.760
city of palm pay because of that locale.
Uh,

17
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.460
we see it on the map here.
Pompei is down in this location.

18
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.810
Herculaneum is to the north east of palm,

19
00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:18.780
pay closer to Naples.
And Pompei is,
as you can see.

20
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.500
And note also that the city of bus gory all lay bus Allah,

21
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.250
which is located between almost equal distant,

22
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:30.480
a little bit closer to Pompei then Herculaneum but in between the two.

23
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.430
And I pointed out to now,
because we're going to look at an important,
uh,

24
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.680
room with paintings from the city of Bus Gory Ali today as well.

25
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.470
Here you see a view a Google earth,

26
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.880
a fly over of Herculaneum as it looks today,
uh,

27
00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:51.540
is very helpful because you can see a couple of things here that I want you to

28
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:53.580
keep in mind as we look at this city.

29
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.470
One that although most of the city of palm pay has been excavated,

30
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:03.471
only about a quarter or 25% of the city of perculate IOM has been excavated.

31
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.330
So we have much less than less at Herculaneum than we do for palm pay.

32
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.410
And what we're missing for the most part is the public architecture.

33
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.050
We don't have a great amphitheater from Herculaneum.

34
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:20.620
We don't have a theater and a music hall complex.
Uh,

35
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.150
we don't have,
we think we might have part of the basilica,

36
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:25.620
but we're not absolutely sure.

37
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.840
We don't have the great large a forum space that we have in palm pay.

38
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:34.140
So we're missing a lot of that public architecture at Herculaneum,

39
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:37.560
which gives us less of a sense of what the city was originally like,

40
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:39.060
at least in its public face.

41
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.830
Although there's no doubt that that material is still lies beneath the ground.

42
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:45.360
So we have only a quarter of the city,

43
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.230
mostly the residential part of the city or part of the residential part of the

44
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:53.970
city.
But there are several houses there that are extremely,

45
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.330
um,
give us,
uh,
provide,
uh,
information,

46
00:02:57.331 --> 00:03:01.360
especially about what was going between the eruption of,

47
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.920
between the earthquake and the eruption of the Soviet 62 to 79 that are

48
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:08.950
extremely valuable in terms of giving us a sense,
again,

49
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:13.390
of the evolution of Roman domestic architecture.
The other,

50
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.370
the other issue that this particular view raises is the reason why Herculaneum

51
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:22.810
is less well excavated then palm pay.
And the reason for that has to do,

52
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:24.010
and you can see it well here,

53
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:28.870
has to do with the fact that the modern city grew up on top of the ancient city.

54
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.790
Uh,
and uh,
they were able at one point to clear part of it for excavation,

55
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.930
but they have not been able to clear the rest.
It's a political nightmare,

56
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.890
you know,
to have to deal,

57
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:42.760
you have to relocate all the people who live in this area and have lived in this

58
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:47.260
area for a very long time.
That's politically a very difficult thing to do.

59
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:50.110
It also is extremely costly.
So thus far,

60
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.050
only 25% of Herculaneum revealed.

61
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:57.730
Let's all hope that at some point someday Italy can sort this out and find a way

62
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.270
to excavate the rest of this extraordinary city.

63
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.130
You can see from this view that I took as,

64
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.310
this is one of the views that you get as you enter the site,

65
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:10.930
the current location today.

66
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.170
But I think you can see very well here again what I'm talking about,

67
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:16.290
the relationship between the ancient,

68
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.650
ancient city lower ground level that has been on earth through excavation.

69
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.540
You can see a peristyle court of one of the houses here,
for example,
a button.

70
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:29.890
You can see the way in which the modern city rings,
uh,
the site.

71
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.770
And again,
what a challenge it would be to,
uh,

72
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.180
to remove that modern city and to reveal the rest of Herculaneum.

73
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.350
Here's another view where you can also see some of the remains of the ancient

74
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:45.700
city of these residences and so on and their relationship to the rest of the

75
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:49.630
town.
With regard to the history of Herculaneum,

76
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:53.170
it is very similar to the history of Pompei.

77
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.320
One difference is that the city of Herculaneum was supposedly founded by

78
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.400
Hercules,
hence its name Herculaneum.
But in other respects,

79
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.720
the history again is,
is quite comparable.
Uh,
we know for example,

80
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:12.721
that the city of Herculaneum was overseeing for a while by that same metallic

81
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:17.560
tribe called the Oskins who were then,
uh,
who were then,
uh,
uh,

82
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.660
conquered by the Sam Nights.

83
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:23.950
And the Sam nights took over Herculaneum and it was during the Sam night period

84
00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:28.570
and Herculaneum that we begin to see the same kind of architectural development

85
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:32.500
that we saw also in Pompei.
We also know that the,

86
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:35.260
that those in Herculaneum,
the citizens of Herculaneum,

87
00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:38.770
the leaders of Herculaneum got involved in the social wars,

88
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:40.480
as did those in palm pay,

89
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.690
and that the city of Herculaneum was conquered by Rome in [inaudible] 89 BC in

90
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:47.800
89 BC.

91
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.800
So Herculaneum becomes a Roman colony in 89 BC thereafter.

92
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.800
We know,
and of course at that point just is in palm pay.

93
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.780
The Romans begin to build buildings in the Roman manner.

94
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.830
From that point on,
we know,
again,
comparable development.

95
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:08.831
We know that the hurts that in Herculaneum they also witnessed that very serious

96
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.330
earthquake,
an earthquake that,

97
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.980
that also a destroyed significant parts of the city of Herculaneum.

98
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:20.981
And they too went through that frenzied 17 year period of rebuilding a,

99
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:23.840
but again,
just as at palm pay.

100
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:28.841
It was for not because the city of Herculaneum was also covered by the ash and

101
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:32.690
lava of Vesuvius.
However,

102
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.250
there's one major difference,
uh,

103
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.830
that has to do with the way that ash and lava fell.
Uh,

104
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.730
we talked about the fact that at pump pay there was actually quite a bit of

105
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:47.170
notice that the ash and lava,
uh,

106
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.890
came down on the city fairly gradually and that there was time for people to

107
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:56.210
escape and that most of them did except for those full hardy souls who decided

108
00:06:56.211 --> 00:07:00.860
to wait it out,
uh,
which we discussed a couple of lectures ago,

109
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.030
but in Herculaneum,
uh,
it happened much more rapidly.
And in fact,

110
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:10.031
it became very clear very quickly that a huge blanket of lava was headed toward

111
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:13.040
the city.
And needless to say,

112
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:16.220
that encouraged people to leave a pronto.

113
00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:19.760
And we thought at least for a very long time that that's in fact what had

114
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:20.151
happened,

115
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:25.100
that everybody had escaped the onslaught of Vesuvius.

116
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.010
What happened after,
uh,
that that blanket of lava and Gulf,

117
00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:35.990
the city is it hermetically sealed the city,
hermetically seal the city,

118
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:36.681
uh,

119
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:41.681
in such a way that materials that have been lost at Pompei were preserved at

120
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:44.330
Herculaneum.
And the most,

121
00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:47.840
the best example of that is would we have almost no wood.

122
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:52.400
What is not a material that it stands the test of time terribly well and we have

123
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:56.410
almost no wood from Pompei but from the city of Herculaneum,

124
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.610
we have a considerable amount of wood.

125
00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:02.360
And this just has to do with this with the fact again that the city was so

126
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.680
hermetically sealed by that blanket of love.

127
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:08.900
And I can show you a few examples of what survives in wood,

128
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.490
for example,
this bad or part of a bed a that still preserved.

129
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:15.840
As you can see here with the wooden legs,
uh,

130
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.970
a wooden partition in one of the houses to divide one section,

131
00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:24.670
kind of like a modern Pobo wall to divide one section,
uh,
of the,
uh,

132
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.870
structure from another.
Uh,

133
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.220
you can see also the wooden frames around the doors and around the windows are

134
00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:36.221
also preserved as are these wooden beams that you can see over the doorways and

135
00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:41.090
over the,
uh,
over the windows,
mostly over the doorways,

136
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.370
those wooden beams also made out of wood.

137
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:47.270
And this is the most famous example and one that everybody sees as you wander

138
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.670
the streets of Herculaneum,
uh,
the Causa gras teach show,
uh,

139
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.550
which we see here.

140
00:08:52.551 --> 00:08:57.090
And you can see that even the balcony which is made out of wood is extremely

141
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.790
well preserved.
So this provides evidence that we don't have pump from Pompei.

142
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.830
That's extremely valuable in terms of understanding a Roman building practice.

143
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.280
I mentioned already though,
that we didn't think anyone,

144
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:12.120
we thought that all of the,

145
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.010
those who lived in Herculaneum had escaped from the CVS.

146
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:17.520
Uh,

147
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.520
but it turns out that was not in fact the case as recently as the 1980s,

148
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.270
some archeologists,
uh,
were,
uh,

149
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:31.310
doing some excavating down at the sea walls of the city of Herculaneum.

150
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.600
And Lo and behold,
they came upon a cache of skeletons.

151
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.470
And I show you some of those skeletons here in those skeletons are in the same

152
00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:45.150
kinds of positions at the body as the bodies that we saw at Tom pay in that

153
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:49.140
clearly a number of them have huddled together for the protection,

154
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.810
a few child protection as it turned out in here.

155
00:09:51.811 --> 00:09:56.540
Another one who's raising himself or herself in an attempt to,
uh,

156
00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:01.320
to,
to survive somehow,
uh,
this awful event that has occurred.

157
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.330
Uh,
we find these skeletons and they found these skeletons near the sea wall.
And,

158
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.050
um,
what they've concluded from this two things.
One,
again,

159
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.380
the difference in the lava that fell on Herculean,

160
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.490
we can see that it not only preserved would,
it also preserves bone,

161
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:20.760
which is why the skeletons are still visible here.

162
00:10:20.761 --> 00:10:25.470
Whereas it pump pay everything,
uh,
you know,
everything decomposed at palm pay.

163
00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:27.420
So the situation,
again,
quite different.

164
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:31.740
But they've all also been able to determine that what clearly happened here is

165
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:35.850
again,
because there was so much notice people fled.
And where did they flee?

166
00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:39.860
They fled toward the water because they were right on the sea.
Uh,

167
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:43.320
they had a lot of boats and the hope was that they could ferry,
uh,

168
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.160
everybody out from the city.
And for the most part they were successful.

169
00:10:47.161 --> 00:10:51.420
But there was a certain group that unfortunately got left behind and it was

170
00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:54.780
their remains that were discovered in the 1980s.

171
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.850
It's amazing what these bodies can tell us about some of the people who live

172
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:02.910
there.
And I'll just give you a little sense of a couple of the,

173
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.530
of the storylines.
Uh,
here is,
uh,
the,
the skeleton of a woman.

174
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.200
And you can see that this woman has,

175
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:14.820
if you look very closely at her left hand to or for fingers,
you can,
she,

176
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:19.830
she has rings on two of her fingers and those are larger views of those very

177
00:11:19.951 --> 00:11:24.750
rings.
Two rings with green and red stones,
the redstone,
you can see it,

178
00:11:24.751 --> 00:11:28.740
the little bird depicted on it.
These were her rings.
Consequently,

179
00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:31.450
the archeologists called her the Ring Lady,
uh,

180
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.040
or the rich should be the rings lady.
Uh,

181
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:37.920
but here she is with her two rings and you can see that she also had next to her

182
00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:42.830
side,
these two absolutely gorgeous.
A snake golden snake bracelets,

183
00:11:42.831 --> 00:11:47.280
sort of Allah,
Cleopatra,
Cleopatra ask that she obviously loved,
uh,

184
00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:51.480
and took with her,
uh,
when she attempted to escape from the city.

185
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.130
And an even more poignant story is this one.

186
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.260
What we're looking at here is the head of a woman,
a young woman.
Uh,
the,
the,

187
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.930
uh,
excavators have determined,
and if you can look,

188
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:03.640
if you look at the top of her head,

189
00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:07.180
you will see that a tuft of hair is actually preserved.

190
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.270
It looks dark in this image,
but it's actually blonde.

191
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.590
So they'd been able to determine,

192
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:16.591
this was a young blonde woman who lived in Herculaneum and uh,

193
00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:20.530
you can see the small size of the skeleton and below this is not hers.

194
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:23.800
It's obviously her,
the fetus,
the baby,
uh,

195
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:25.610
she was seven months pregnant.

196
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.160
They've been able to determine and so they have found the bones of the baby as

197
00:12:30.161 --> 00:12:33.790
well.
And you can see them here in the excavators,
the excavation reports,

198
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.570
they talk about the fact that the bones of the baby of the infant,

199
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:42.550
of the unborn child are so fragile that it was like picking up eggshells,
uh,

200
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:47.200
when they were trying to,
to,
uh,
piece,
uh,
this skeleton together.

201
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.220
So it's incredible the kind of information that archeologists have been able to

202
00:12:51.221 --> 00:12:56.221
glean from those trying to escape Herculaneum on that fateful day in August of

203
00:12:57.281 --> 00:12:58.540
79.

204
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.860
One other sad story is just that they did actually find the remains of one

205
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.690
child.
This is sort of like the story of the dog at palm pay.
One child,
uh,

206
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:14.680
whose remains were left in this little crib in one house and again,

207
00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:17.620
the bones are preserved because of this.

208
00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:21.280
The circumstance of the particular configuration of the law of,

209
00:13:21.281 --> 00:13:22.660
of the bones of that,
uh,

210
00:13:22.661 --> 00:13:26.590
of that small child are also preserved in this crib,

211
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.140
in one of the houses in Herculaneum

212
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.340
to turn to the city itself.

213
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:38.370
I show you now a plan of Herculaneum or at least the excavated part of

214
00:13:39.371 --> 00:13:43.180
Herculaneum.
Uh,
that gives you some sense of what is there.

215
00:13:43.181 --> 00:13:44.910
And I've already mentioned that we simply,

216
00:13:44.911 --> 00:13:48.870
you won't see any big amphitheater and plant already major,
uh,

217
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.520
forum complex and so on and so forth.

218
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:54.940
We simply don't have that evidence in the excavated part.

219
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.790
But what you do see is comparable to the residential area.
Pompei.
Uh,

220
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.150
you can see a series of major thoroughfares,
crossing it with one another.

221
00:14:04.151 --> 00:14:06.340
We can't be sure since we don't have the whole city,

222
00:14:06.341 --> 00:14:10.790
which is the main Cardo and which is the main deck [inaudible] of the city.
Uh,

223
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.310
but they are certainly certainly laid out at a quite regular pattern with shops

224
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.490
and houses interspersed with one another.

225
00:14:18.491 --> 00:14:21.640
As you can see a extremely well here.

226
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.470
Again,
we don't,
we as far as we know,

227
00:14:26.471 --> 00:14:31.210
we really were quite sure we don't have any of the major public buildings,

228
00:14:31.211 --> 00:14:33.610
but there are a couple of,
of,
uh,

229
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:36.490
of structures here and there that do tell us something.

230
00:14:36.491 --> 00:14:38.560
Here's an arch for example.
Uh,

231
00:14:38.561 --> 00:14:42.190
that may have been on one of the more important thoroughfares of the city.
Uh,

232
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.610
and we certainly have a sh have shops and,

233
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:49.850
and the like along the way.
And I can actually show you a few,
uh,

234
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:54.770
views of,
of shops and the city streets and so on.

235
00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:59.750
That gives you a good sense that Herculaneum was very similar looking to Pompei.

236
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.650
If you look at the street here as the street from the city of Herculaneum,

237
00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:08.300
you can see the same uh,
multi-sided stones for the pavement.

238
00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:12.560
You can see the same sidewalks,
you can see the same drains in Herculaneum.

239
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.050
You can see the same Rutten marks.
What you don't see,

240
00:15:15.051 --> 00:15:19.100
and I started a post on this yesterday,
what you don't see or stepping stones,

241
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.860
there are no preserve stepping stones in Herculaneum.

242
00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:25.730
There are lots of preserves stepping in Palm Bay and I was mulling this over

243
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:26.630
yesterday in a way,

244
00:15:26.631 --> 00:15:29.990
even beyond what I have tended to in the past about these stepping stones.

245
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:34.340
Thinking about could I think of any other examples in any other Roman city I've

246
00:15:34.341 --> 00:15:38.090
ever been including Rome itself with is actually quite a bit of preserved uh,

247
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.280
pavement here and there out on the,

248
00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:43.100
via Apia in the Roman forum and so on and so forth.

249
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:46.730
And I can't think of a single other site off the top of my head where we find

250
00:15:46.731 --> 00:15:47.570
stepping stone.

251
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:51.800
So I just put that out as a thought question for all of us to see whether we
can,

252
00:15:51.801 --> 00:15:55.940
whether I'm missing something or whether it's conceivable that Pompei may have

253
00:15:55.941 --> 00:16:00.941
been exceptional in this regard rather than the norm here we see a amphoras

254
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.130
these clay amphoras in which wine or oil were kept.

255
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.820
So a wine or an oil shop there.
And then of course our favorite,

256
00:16:07.821 --> 00:16:12.650
the fast food stand,
the Thermop Oleum,
uh,
Herculaneum had plenty of Thermop Olia,

257
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.230
uh,
very similar to those in palm pay.

258
00:16:15.231 --> 00:16:19.490
So you can imagine for the most part are quite similar,
uh,
looking city.

259
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:24.380
I mentioned though that the evidence that we do have is mostly for residential

260
00:16:24.381 --> 00:16:28.820
architecture and there are three houses in particular that I want to focus on

261
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.310
because they give us information,
uh,

262
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.510
that goes beyond the information that I've been able to give you from the houses

263
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:37.040
that we looked at in Pompei.

264
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:41.900
The first one I want to look at is the so called Sam night house at Pompei,

265
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:43.130
at Herculaneum.

266
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.500
It dates to the second century BC and you see it in plan here.

267
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:50.090
It's a very simple house.

268
00:16:50.091 --> 00:16:53.990
So second century BC that tells you what it tells you that it's early,

269
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.530
but it's already in that hellenized don't miss period,

270
00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.720
which began in the second century BC.

271
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:04.400
So we look to see which plan it conforms to.
Is it,
does it conform to the dome?

272
00:17:04.401 --> 00:17:07.460
Is he tall or the d or the Nice Dome as well?

273
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:11.480
At first it looks like it conforms to the Dome [inaudible] because you can see

274
00:17:11.481 --> 00:17:16.430
it's quite simple.
Uh,
it has the basic core.
You come in here into the foul case.

275
00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:21.460
There are cells on either side,
the cell lie,
uh,
these cell I are indeed sell lie.

276
00:17:21.461 --> 00:17:25.400
They are,
they open up only to the house and not to the outside.

277
00:17:25.401 --> 00:17:29.420
They have not been transformed into shops.
We see the atrium here,

278
00:17:29.421 --> 00:17:33.590
we see the [inaudible] of the Atrium and there was of course a comp [inaudible]

279
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.880
up above.
We see a very small number of cubic ula.
Uh,

280
00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:42.910
just a couple over here and we don't seem to see the usual wings in less.

281
00:17:43.611 --> 00:17:45.170
This one over here,

282
00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:47.810
although there seems to be some sort of staircase on that side,

283
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:52.680
served as in part as the wing.
Uh,
and so,
and one of those rooms,

284
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:55.910
probably the left one served as the dining room.
There's no cordless,

285
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.750
there's no Paris style.
So again,

286
00:17:57.751 --> 00:18:02.550
at first it looks like a pretty simple example of the end even and even

287
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.180
simplified version of a typical domus Etol Alica.

288
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.340
But when we walk into the atrium,

289
00:18:08.341 --> 00:18:11.730
which is very well preserved today we see something quite different.

290
00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:16.200
They focus in this particular house was the atrium.
You can tell it's an atrium.

291
00:18:16.201 --> 00:18:18.240
You can see the calm pluvial up above.

292
00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:23.850
We're looking here at the entrance way through the FAO case.

293
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.690
These are the doors into the two cells,
one on either side.

294
00:18:27.691 --> 00:18:31.520
This is a door into one of the,
one of the only two cubic ula,
uh,

295
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:35.500
in this structure.
Uh,
you can see also that the,
um,

296
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.640
the patron and designer of this particular house want to want it.

297
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.530
You can see that this is a hellenized miss in the sense that they have

298
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:44.720
incorporated,
uh,

299
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:49.030
pilasters here on either side of the,
um,

300
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.030
of the wall next to the entrance way.

301
00:18:51.031 --> 00:18:56.031
But most interesting of all is what has happened in what seems to be a second

302
00:18:56.461 --> 00:19:01.410
story.
Uh,
for the atrium.
They have expanded.
They have moved,
they have,

303
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:05.760
they have developed the atrium even more vertically than has been the case

304
00:19:05.761 --> 00:19:10.140
before.
By adding this,
uh,
this,
this,
uh,
blind,

305
00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:15.630
a blind gallery blind gallery up at the top,

306
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:19.800
which on three sides is again closed.
You can see the enclosed wall,

307
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.250
but on the fourth side,
which I can't,

308
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.350
which I don't have an image to show you the fourth side,
there's an open to this,

309
00:19:26.351 --> 00:19:29.540
an open logia.
There's open space between the columns.

310
00:19:29.541 --> 00:19:33.870
So blind gallery on three sides open logia on the other side,

311
00:19:33.871 --> 00:19:37.470
the open logia of course adding additional light,

312
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.410
bringing additional light into the atrium.

313
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.470
So a very elaborate treatment of the atrium,

314
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:48.120
which shows us not only the esteem in which this particular patron,

315
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.250
uh,
held the atrium,

316
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:54.240
but also this interesting incorporation of columns in a different way than we've

317
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:55.074
seen before.

318
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:59.430
Making them the high point of this room by placing them in the second story,

319
00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:03.920
they are ionic columns.
Notice also this sort of lattice work fence,
uh,

320
00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:07.230
that in circles it,
we'll see that kind of lattice work fence.

321
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:09.150
Also enrollment painting.

322
00:20:09.151 --> 00:20:13.060
You can see in fact the remains of some paint on the walls and the walls,
uh,

323
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:17.940
behind this were painted.
So a very,
very opulent,
uh,

324
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:21.030
opulent atrium that shows again,

325
00:20:21.031 --> 00:20:25.450
this interest in building vertically and adding some interest at the upper most

326
00:20:25.451 --> 00:20:29.640
part to create the sense of two stories.
This is an a development,

327
00:20:29.641 --> 00:20:34.200
this is in fact even early for that,
uh,
in the second century BC,

328
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:41.140
the two most important houses,
however,
at Herculaneum are the,
uh,

329
00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.720
house of the Mosaic Atrium and the house of the stacks.

330
00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.840
And I want to look at both of those houses with you today.

331
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.840
I'm going to start with the house of the Mosaic Atrium.

332
00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:56.170
You can see from this plan which comes from the word Perkins Textbook.

333
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.560
You can see from this plan that they are literally side by side.

334
00:20:59.561 --> 00:21:03.610
They essentially share a wall as you can see here.
Uh,

335
00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:06.970
and I wanna there they are very important in terms of the development,

336
00:21:06.971 --> 00:21:11.971
not only of a residential architecture in Campania in the late first century,

337
00:21:13.691 --> 00:21:18.691
a d but also as a premonition of what's to come in much later.

338
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.390
Residential architecture.
Again,
I'm going to look at both of them.
Uh,

339
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.100
and we'll start first with the mosaic atrium.
If you look at the top of the plan,

340
00:21:27.101 --> 00:21:30.490
the northern most part of the plan,
and this house by the way,
does,

341
00:21:30.491 --> 00:21:32.810
as you can see from the monument list,
uh,

342
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.730
does date to a add 62 to 79.

343
00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:41.730
So at the very end of a domestic architecture development in palm pay,

344
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.560
if we look at the upper most part,
the north,

345
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:49.860
you will see that if you enter the house at the Arrow and you look ahead,

346
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.960
you would think you look at the vista head and see the Atrium and the to bleed

347
00:21:53.961 --> 00:21:58.360
them.
You would think you were in a typical Domus Etol a type house.

348
00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.690
It's got those three main elements.
It's got the foul case,

349
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.620
it's got the atrium with an employer,
Viacom and accomplished via miss.
We'll see.

350
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.760
And it's got a to bleed them all on access with one another.

351
00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:13.780
But as you're standing in the atrium looking toward the Tbilisi them,

352
00:22:13.781 --> 00:22:16.300
you're kind of looking at this to bleed them and sang to yourself.

353
00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.980
This is not the,
to glean them.

354
00:22:17.981 --> 00:22:19.890
I know this is not that to bleeding and I'm used to,

355
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.570
this is not the to bleed them and most of the houses that I know,

356
00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:25.010
it's designed in a very different way.
And what,

357
00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:29.080
what is it that you see in plan that indicates to us that it's designed in a

358
00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:31.240
different way?
Does anyone see what it is

359
00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:36.670
it has?
Are they columns?
Look closely.

360
00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:42.560
They are they,
are they round?
No.
No.
They're square.

361
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:47.360
So they're either peers or their columns on bases that are square.

362
00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.480
But,
but you're right,
there are architectural members in here.

363
00:22:50.481 --> 00:22:55.130
It turns out their peers,
but so there their peers in here.
Okay.
Uh,
what else?

364
00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:59.210
What about the,
the,
the actual plan itself.
How were those peers?

365
00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:01.700
What's the relationship of those peers to the,

366
00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.550
to the room design

367
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:09.370
<v 1>there someone over there.
Is that right?</v>

368
00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:13.400
<v 0>Freestanding.
Yup.</v>

369
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:18.530
What else does it remind you of a plan we've seen in another context,

370
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:24.130
you're looking at a central space divided by two isles by architectural members.

371
00:23:25.431 --> 00:23:29.720
In this case by peers,
a basilica.
It's a basilican plan.

372
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.020
Basilican plan,
Central Nave to side offs.

373
00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:37.400
What's a basilican plan doing in a house?
Is this a basilica or a law court?
No,

374
00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:40.700
it's actually a winter banqueting room,

375
00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:44.330
but a winter banqueting room in the shape of a basilica.

376
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.080
And I make lot of that because we'll see this happening with increasing

377
00:23:48.081 --> 00:23:52.550
frequency enrollment architecture and that is a certain building type that was

378
00:23:52.551 --> 00:23:55.130
developed for one kind of building.
In this case,

379
00:23:55.131 --> 00:23:58.670
a Basilican plan developed for law courts,
uh,

380
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.690
begins to be used for a nother kind of room.
In this case,

381
00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:04.430
a winter banqueting hall.

382
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.420
And I like to call this to sort of interchangeability of form that you can do.

383
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.930
You can develop a certain plan for a certain kind of structure,

384
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.860
but then be creative enough to realize that you could use that same plan in

385
00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:19.190
another environment in a different but interest in way.

386
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.590
And that's exactly what happens here.
Now,
needless to say,

387
00:24:21.591 --> 00:24:25.370
the scale is actually fairly large,
but this does not look like a huge basilica.

388
00:24:25.371 --> 00:24:26.120
It's,
it's,

389
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.740
it's brought down to domestic size scale as you can see here.

390
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:34.010
So that's a very interesting development.
It's very well preserved.

391
00:24:34.011 --> 00:24:37.090
And I'll show it to you in a moment.
So once you get into the atrium,

392
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:41.510
then you have to take an abrupt right in order to see the peristyle court.

393
00:24:41.511 --> 00:24:43.880
And the peristyle court is very,
very large.

394
00:24:43.881 --> 00:24:47.600
We've talked about the fact that there was an increasing interest in the

395
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:51.990
peristyle as a key component of a Roman house.
Uh,

396
00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:56.090
and we see that very clearly here in fact that the peristyle is really beginning

397
00:24:56.091 --> 00:25:00.980
to take pride of place away from the atrium cause the atrium is almost beginning

398
00:25:00.981 --> 00:25:01.791
to go the way of the,

399
00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:05.200
to bleed them in the sense that it's becoming a kind of passageway.

400
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.070
It's not an end in itself,

401
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:10.220
it's becoming or they tend to bleed a ends and their selves.

402
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.610
They are a passageway into this huge peristyle.

403
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.980
If you look at the plan of the Paris style,
uh,

404
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.880
you can see that there are columns with those columns are engaged into the wall

405
00:25:19.881 --> 00:25:22.040
and that's well preserved.
I'll show it to you in a moment.

406
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.400
And then also extremely interesting is now on axis with the Atrium and bill.

407
00:25:27.921 --> 00:25:30.350
Huge peristyle is tr,

408
00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.380
tr is the trickling IOM or the dining room.

409
00:25:33.381 --> 00:25:36.950
And look at the size of that trickling IOM and look at the fact that the try

410
00:25:36.951 --> 00:25:41.540
Klinean opens both off the Paris style and also has an opening on this way,

411
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:46.520
on this end,
toward the front,
uh,
toward the other side,
excuse me,
of the,

412
00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:51.080
uh,
of the,
of the house.
And this is the side.
This is the side,

413
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:56.030
the southern side that faces the sea.
And Herculaneum was very close.

414
00:25:56.031 --> 00:25:59.060
I'll show you.
I restored view that makes this clear in a moment.

415
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.080
Herculaneum was very close to the sea and this,

416
00:26:03.081 --> 00:26:07.280
these two houses were probably among the two most expensive houses in

417
00:26:07.281 --> 00:26:10.160
Herculaneum because they had the best views of the sea.

418
00:26:10.161 --> 00:26:14.450
They were very up high above the seawall and they looked right out at the sea.

419
00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.590
So this,
the,

420
00:26:15.591 --> 00:26:19.610
the way they've designed this very large try Klinean to benefit from being able

421
00:26:19.611 --> 00:26:24.500
to see both the peristyle and views out over the sea even while you were dining.

422
00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.260
Uh,
there seems to have been a,
um,

423
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:30.650
call a colonnade over here,
uh,

424
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:34.970
so views through columns out to the sea and then these two rooms at d,

425
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.620
these are,
as you can see here,
the [inaudible],
d I a,
e t,

426
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:43.800
a singular,
d,
I,
a,
e t,
a,
e,
plural.

427
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.080
These are,
uh,

428
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:49.450
these are rooms that are set aside for sort of summer pleasures,

429
00:26:49.451 --> 00:26:52.790
summer pleasures near the,
near the panoramic window,
uh,

430
00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:57.720
that you can look out to the Cecil place to relax and enjoy the sunshine on the

431
00:26:57.721 --> 00:27:01.800
southern end views of the sea,
a special room set up,
set aside,

432
00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.380
adjust for that kind of panoramic viewing and the like.

433
00:27:05.381 --> 00:27:09.870
So this move again toward vista toward panorama that we've been talking about

434
00:27:09.871 --> 00:27:13.490
before.
So some very important changes here.
Uh,

435
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:17.040
that signal where Roman residential architecture,

436
00:27:17.041 --> 00:27:19.050
we'll go in the future.

437
00:27:19.051 --> 00:27:23.670
I'm going to wait on the plan of the stags till we finish with the mosaic

438
00:27:23.671 --> 00:27:27.930
atrium.
The mosaic atrium.
You can see a view into the atrium today.

439
00:27:27.931 --> 00:27:31.620
You can see why the house is called the house of the mosaic Atrium because of

440
00:27:31.621 --> 00:27:36.621
the very well preserved a black and white strikingly striking a black and white

441
00:27:37.591 --> 00:27:39.450
mosaic that we find there.
Uh,

442
00:27:39.451 --> 00:27:42.290
and you can see how well preserved the employee IOM is,
uh,

443
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:46.470
with the mosaic decoration around that.
You can also see,
however,

444
00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:47.850
if you look carefully at this image,

445
00:27:47.851 --> 00:27:51.690
you probably noticed it already that the floor undulates why does the floor

446
00:27:51.691 --> 00:27:53.280
undulate if Laura and Jill lakes,

447
00:27:53.281 --> 00:27:57.770
because of that heavy blanket of lava that entered into,
uh,

448
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.440
Herculaneum that,
that,
uh,
made it's presence known,
uh,

449
00:28:01.441 --> 00:28:06.360
and that distorted the shape of the,
um,
of the,

450
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:11.190
uh,
floor of the Atrium about fortunately preserved it at the same time,

451
00:28:11.191 --> 00:28:12.310
which is great.
Uh,

452
00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:17.160
we're looking from the atrium into the bleed them and we see that Basilican
form,

453
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:19.260
uh,
that we described already before.

454
00:28:19.261 --> 00:28:24.030
A central nave of back wall side aisles on either,
you can see this side,

455
00:28:24.031 --> 00:28:28.580
but same on this side is on this side,
side aisles,
uh,
and uh,

456
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:31.620
circulation of space among them.
Uh,

457
00:28:31.621 --> 00:28:34.920
and you can also see if you look very carefully and have another view in a

458
00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:37.350
moment that there are windows here as well,

459
00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.020
windows that allow light into the system.

460
00:28:40.021 --> 00:28:42.180
When we talked about the basilica of Pompei,

461
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:47.340
I mentioned to you that the Basilica Pompei did not have a clear story.
C,

462
00:28:47.341 --> 00:28:51.910
l e r e s t o r.
Y did not have a clear story,
but that we would,

463
00:28:51.911 --> 00:28:55.680
we would begin to see the development of the clear story later.
We see it here.

464
00:28:55.950 --> 00:29:00.390
This use of a clear story is the placement of windows in that second story to

465
00:29:00.391 --> 00:29:04.170
allow light into the structure.
It has been developed here.

466
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.530
It's very important to architectural development and we're going to see again,

467
00:29:07.531 --> 00:29:10.530
the ramifications of that into the future.

468
00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.940
Here's another view of the,
um,
of,

469
00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:16.710
of what is up this banqueting hall.
And by the way,

470
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:21.030
the technical name for this and I have it on the monument lists for you is the

471
00:29:21.031 --> 00:29:24.010
Egyptian [inaudible] or the [inaudible],

472
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:28.440
the [inaudible] or if it's easier for you,
the Egyptian Ecos,
uh,
that,
uh,

473
00:29:28.441 --> 00:29:33.360
that this particular form of banqueting hall in the shape of a basilica.

474
00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:38.120
Uh,
this,
this view is helpful not only because you can see the peers better,
uh,

475
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.170
but also because you can see the windows better,

476
00:29:40.171 --> 00:29:43.420
the clear story system that allows light into the space.

477
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.670
And you can also see this ubiquitously use of white and red for the peers in

478
00:29:48.671 --> 00:29:50.950
this case,
just as they are usually used for columns.

479
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.430
The upper most part of the pier a is white,

480
00:29:54.431 --> 00:29:56.340
and then they painted the bottom red.

481
00:29:56.610 --> 00:30:01.610
So very similarly to the kind of decor we saw also in Pompei.

482
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.380
This is of course the peristyle court.
Uh,

483
00:30:05.381 --> 00:30:10.120
you can see it here and you can see the way in which these columns have been

484
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.800
engaged into the wall of the garden court.
Uh,

485
00:30:14.801 --> 00:30:19.790
you can also see this interesting use of combination of stone and tile,
uh,

486
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:22.960
for the construction.
Also interesting.

487
00:30:22.961 --> 00:30:26.860
As you look at the rooms that line the side of the peristyle,
uh,

488
00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.430
you can see how open up how opened up they have become.

489
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:35.430
We don't see that severe wall that we saw in the very earliest domus Vitalik a

490
00:30:36.221 --> 00:30:39.760
with no windows is you'll recall there are lots of windows here and they are

491
00:30:39.761 --> 00:30:43.780
large windows and they are allowing light into the structure,

492
00:30:43.781 --> 00:30:45.550
not just on the front where the views are,

493
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.990
but on the other sides of the building.
This is again a very important change,
uh,

494
00:30:49.991 --> 00:30:54.991
and one that is going to have again important ramifications for the future.

495
00:30:55.211 --> 00:31:00.211
Note also that the famous palm pay in red is used to pay to decorate the walls.

496
00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.300
So that's the house of the mosaic atrium.

497
00:31:04.301 --> 00:31:09.040
Now let's turn to the house of the stags,
the house of the Stag,

498
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:12.460
so called because of a sculpture that was found there that I'll show you a bit

499
00:31:12.461 --> 00:31:15.130
later.
If we look at the house of the stags,

500
00:31:15.131 --> 00:31:17.830
we see some interesting things happening as well.

501
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:20.360
That seemed to parallel the development.

502
00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:24.970
We've already described this house to be built between 62 and 79.

503
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:29.310
The entrance in this case is on the upper most,
right,
uh,

504
00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:33.850
right here.
And you can see that you enter in along the Fao,

505
00:31:33.851 --> 00:31:38.851
ks along by the throat of the house into what is designated as the atrium.

506
00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:44.620
But that atrium is not like any other atrium we've seen thus far this semester.

507
00:31:44.621 --> 00:31:48.550
What's missing?
The [inaudible],

508
00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:51.340
the employ of IOM is missing if there's no improving them.

509
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:53.200
There's no comp Bluebeam,
uh,

510
00:31:53.201 --> 00:31:58.201
which means that the room is not open to the sky and we call a,

511
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.000
we call it an atrium that has no opening.

512
00:32:01.001 --> 00:32:05.210
And I put this on the monument list for you and Atrium test today to not them

513
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.980
and Atrium test due to Naadam is an atrium that has no,
uh,

514
00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.930
no opening to the sky.
And that's the case here.
That also is,

515
00:32:13.931 --> 00:32:17.830
tends to under play this space because there's no longer,

516
00:32:17.831 --> 00:32:21.820
as interesting as it was when it had that wonderful basin and the s and the

517
00:32:21.821 --> 00:32:25.030
skylight and so on and so forth.
And if you look at the plan,

518
00:32:25.031 --> 00:32:28.360
you'll see it's very interesting.
It has lots of openings on various sides.

519
00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:32.320
So here,
this is a really good example of what I was hinting at before.

520
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.130
And that is the atrium beginning to go the way of the [inaudible],

521
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.950
the atrium beginning to become a passageway from one part of the house to

522
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.890
another.
It really is merely a passageway from the outside,

523
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.400
from the foul ks into the other rooms of the house.

524
00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:51.580
What have received the greatest emphasis by the patron and by the designer is

525
00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:56.060
not the atrium,
but is the Tri Clint IOM or dining hall.

526
00:32:56.061 --> 00:32:59.810
And you can see that there are two of them.
And they are,

527
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:04.760
they are placed in relationship to one another axial relationship to one
another.

528
00:33:04.761 --> 00:33:07.870
So they're almost talking to one of,
there's like a dialogue,
uh,

529
00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:12.960
an architectural dialog between that smaller tripe Klinean and this larger try

530
00:33:13.221 --> 00:33:17.820
Klinean across an open courtyard,
of course,
an open courtyard.

531
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:22.840
So here we see again the tri minium beginning to emerge as the single most

532
00:33:22.971 --> 00:33:26.890
important room in the house,
which obviously sig signals,
uh,

533
00:33:26.891 --> 00:33:28.340
what's going on in these houses,

534
00:33:28.341 --> 00:33:32.370
that people are beginning to use them even more than they did before.
Uh,

535
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:36.500
not only as places of business,
but it's places to,
uh,
to enjoy,
um,

536
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:40.640
fabulous dinner parties.
Uh,
and while you can look out over the sea,
and in fact,

537
00:33:40.641 --> 00:33:43.700
if you look at this try Columbia and the larger one you can see again,

538
00:33:43.701 --> 00:33:48.380
it opens both off the garden court and also opens toward the south of where you

539
00:33:48.381 --> 00:33:52.190
would have seen the views of the sea.
All of this very deliberate,

540
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:53.130
we see the d day,

541
00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:58.130
I tie here as well these summer living spaces with views out over the water.

542
00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.780
And here we see an interesting detail,
which is a kind of,
um,

543
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:08.380
kiosk or gazebo that's located in the front and that actually still survives and

544
00:34:08.631 --> 00:34:13.490
I'll show that to you in a moment.
So again,
quite momentous changes,
uh,

545
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.480
in architectural,
in,
in a residential architecture,

546
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:22.430
in Herculaneum and in Campania in general,
in the late first century.

547
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.890
A D this is a restored view,

548
00:34:24.891 --> 00:34:27.980
very helpful because we can use it to illustrate a number of things.

549
00:34:27.981 --> 00:34:32.480
We can use it to illustrate how close to the sea Herculaneum was.
Uh,

550
00:34:32.481 --> 00:34:36.260
we can use it to look at the seawalls that I talked about before.

551
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.900
We can use it to look at the,
the harbor,
the,
the,

552
00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:42.410
the small boat dock that was down here with boats waiting.
This,

553
00:34:42.411 --> 00:34:47.240
this was the place that people ran to,
uh,
in order to escape,
uh,

554
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.850
the onslaught of Vesuvius.
Uh,

555
00:34:49.851 --> 00:34:54.050
and this is exactly in the seawall is exactly where those bodies were found.

556
00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.840
So they made it this far,
but not far enough.

557
00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:02.130
And we can pick out both the house of the mosaic Atrium right here and the house

558
00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:06.530
of the stags over here,
both of them,
very large.
As you can see,

559
00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.810
you can see in the case,
here's the northern end.

560
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:11.270
You can see in this case for the house of the Mosaic Atrium,

561
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:15.710
the [inaudible] of the atrium that we described,
the mosaic atrium.

562
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:18.950
And you can see the open court here.
You can see the,

563
00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:23.900
the side that faces the sea.
And how opened up it is how many windows there were,

564
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:25.890
how much,
how open to the d,

565
00:35:25.891 --> 00:35:29.210
the Iti on either side where you could get nice views here.

566
00:35:29.211 --> 00:35:31.550
The house of the stags,
same sort of thing.

567
00:35:31.551 --> 00:35:34.370
You see no opening whatsoever in the northern end.
Uh,

568
00:35:34.371 --> 00:35:38.370
no as opening in the ceiling,
no complete Liam are you,
do you see the,

569
00:35:38.371 --> 00:35:43.080
to try Clinique of facing one another across the open court and you see that

570
00:35:43.081 --> 00:35:44.730
little gazebo,
uh,

571
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:48.270
entrance where the Gazebo that again looks out toward the sea,

572
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:52.560
that distinctive detail here.
A couple more views just to show you quickly the,

573
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:56.830
that if you go and visit Herculaneum,
you can still see those seawalls.
Uh,

574
00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.920
they're made out of concrete.
As you can see,
they're well worth taking a look at.

575
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:05.670
Uh,
and uh,
this is a view taken.

576
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.360
This is one of the ways you can enter into the city taken across.

577
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:13.800
You can see the Suvi,
it's in the background and you can see,
uh,
the,

578
00:36:13.801 --> 00:36:16.500
this is the house of the Mosaic Atrium that we've been looking at.

579
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.480
This is the house of the stags.

580
00:36:18.481 --> 00:36:20.640
Can you can tell the difference because of the Little Gazebo,

581
00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:25.170
little kiosk in front.
Uh,
and here you can see again,

582
00:36:25.171 --> 00:36:30.000
so well the way this is positioned high up on the wall with spectacular views of

583
00:36:30.001 --> 00:36:30.834
the sea,
uh,

584
00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:35.670
and this opening up of the wall to allow maximum vista,

585
00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.850
uh,
Matt Maximum Panorama.
Uh,
through that,

586
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:42.990
through those spaces in the house,
note the Kioski or,

587
00:36:42.991 --> 00:36:46.620
and then note this other entrance.
I'm going to show you both of those in detail.

588
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.980
This is a little gazebo.
As you can see,
it rests on peers.

589
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:54.900
I was obviously a very pleasant place to sit with marble furniture and have a

590
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.350
glass of wine out here looking out over the sea.

591
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:03.150
And you can see once again that the peers have been stuccoed over white on top,

592
00:37:03.151 --> 00:37:08.150
red on the bottom,
just as we have seen is so characteristic.
Also Pompei.
Uh,

593
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:13.050
and right behind that other entrance way that I can also show you a,

594
00:37:13.051 --> 00:37:15.060
where you can see if you look very closely,

595
00:37:15.061 --> 00:37:17.850
you can see not only the red paint on the pilasters,

596
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:23.150
but also the very elaborate decoration and blue and white of the pediment above.

597
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.800
This gives you some sense also the kind of decorative sculpture there would have

598
00:37:28.801 --> 00:37:33.090
been in buildings like this,
the marble tables,
uh,
the um,
the,

599
00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:36.060
these wonderful,
uh,
statues.
There are two of them,

600
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:40.260
have a stags being attacked by hounds.
Uh,
and these are,

601
00:37:40.261 --> 00:37:42.900
these stags are what have given this house.

602
00:37:42.901 --> 00:37:45.780
It's name the house of the stags.

603
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:52.520
I want to turn from a Roman residential architecture in Herculaneum and the

604
00:37:53.731 --> 00:37:55.330
developments there too.

605
00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:00.270
Early Roman wall decoration,
painted decoration.

606
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:02.040
And as I said at the beginning,

607
00:38:02.041 --> 00:38:06.300
specifically to the first and second styles of Roman wall painting,

608
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:10.020
which are particularly interesting in the context of a course on architecture

609
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:13.470
because as we'll see,
they are so architecturally oriented.

610
00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:19.370
I want to begin with a wall from the house of Salad and we'll go back to palm

611
00:38:20.581 --> 00:38:24.770
pay.
We'll be looking at examples both in Pompeii and Herculaneum and also Rome.

612
00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:28.480
Uh,
I want to look at the house of sal list and palm pay.

613
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:33.120
And you can see from your monument list that the to bleed them was decorated

614
00:38:33.121 --> 00:38:35.530
with what we call first style Roman wall painting.

615
00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:39.460
That's obviously a modern scholarly,
a designation.

616
00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:44.270
They didn't call it that in ancient Rome or pump pay or Herculaneum,
uh,
first,
uh,

617
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:48.160
first style Roman wall painting this to bleed them in.

618
00:38:48.161 --> 00:38:51.310
This house was decorated in around 100 BC,

619
00:38:51.311 --> 00:38:56.230
which is when we date most of the examples of first style Roman wall painting.

620
00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:00.490
It is very well preserved and it gives us a very good sense of what the Romans

621
00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.810
are,
what the,
in this case,

622
00:39:01.811 --> 00:39:06.670
the Pompeians were trying to achieve this style.

623
00:39:06.671 --> 00:39:08.800
The first style of Roman wall painting is also,

624
00:39:08.801 --> 00:39:12.970
you'll see it referred to and your books and your textbooks and scholarship in

625
00:39:12.971 --> 00:39:13.960
general as,
as,

626
00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:19.110
as either the masonry style or the incrustation style.

627
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:23.570
Uh,
and the reason for this,
both of those are good descriptions because,
uh,

628
00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:28.600
you can see that what is at work here is that the designers are trying to create

629
00:39:28.601 --> 00:39:29.170
a wall.

630
00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:32.950
They're trying to create the illusion that what we're looking at is not a stucco

631
00:39:32.951 --> 00:39:37.060
and paint wall,
which is actually what it's made out of,
but a real marble wall.

632
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.620
We can see that the wall is divided into a series of zones,

633
00:39:41.621 --> 00:39:42.640
architectural zones,

634
00:39:42.641 --> 00:39:47.260
which are exactly the zones that were used in Roman building technique.

635
00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:48.760
We don't quite see it here.

636
00:39:48.761 --> 00:39:51.640
I'll show it to you in another example that there's usually way at the bottom,

637
00:39:51.641 --> 00:39:54.850
a very narrow band,
which is called a plinth.

638
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:59.920
P.
L.
I.
N.
T.
H.
The plinth is has above it.

639
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:03.370
Uh,
what's called the Sokal,
s.
O.
C.
L.
E,

640
00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:05.230
a higher,

641
00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:10.231
slightly higher element then what are called the Ortho stats.

642
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:13.210
O.
R.
T.
H.
O.
S.
T.
A.
T.
S.

643
00:40:13.211 --> 00:40:17.860
The ortho stats are these blocks here.
And then the ice,
uh,

644
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.620
Domenic I.
S.
O.
D.
O.
M.

645
00:40:20.621 --> 00:40:24.280
I see the ISO Domecq courses.

646
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:29.610
You see those here and then usually either a string course or more likely or in

647
00:40:30.491 --> 00:40:35.350
addition to a cornice,
what's called a corn as a projecting cornice,
c,
O,
r,

648
00:40:35.351 --> 00:40:39.580
n,
I,
c,
e at the top,
so plinth,
Sokal,

649
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:43.600
orthostatics ice,
adamic blocks,

650
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:46.660
and then the string course and the cornice,

651
00:40:46.661 --> 00:40:50.890
which again corresponds to actual Roman building technique,

652
00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.850
but more important than those,
that terminology is again,

653
00:40:54.851 --> 00:40:58.240
what's they are trying to achieve here.
It is clear when you look at,

654
00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:02.620
well first of all,
keep in mind that this is not flat.
It's a relief.

655
00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:07.390
It's a relief wall and the wall has been built up in relief through stucco.

656
00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.800
They've taken the rubble wall,

657
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:13.060
they've added Stucco and they made that stucco look like a series of blocks that

658
00:41:13.061 --> 00:41:14.830
are divided by the string courses.

659
00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:19.240
Then what they've done is painted those blocks and they painted those blocks.

660
00:41:19.241 --> 00:41:23.680
Not all one color,
not all Pompei and red,
but all different kinds of colors,

661
00:41:23.681 --> 00:41:28.090
green and red and pink and Beige and sometimes multicolored is,

662
00:41:28.091 --> 00:41:30.490
we'll see what is the implication here?

663
00:41:30.491 --> 00:41:33.530
What the implication here is that we are looking,

664
00:41:33.531 --> 00:41:38.210
that they're trying to create the illusion through a stucco and paint of a

665
00:41:38.211 --> 00:41:40.340
marble wall of a marble wall.

666
00:41:40.341 --> 00:41:43.550
That would have been very expensive to build because you would have had to bring

667
00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:45.200
all of these multicolored marbles,

668
00:41:45.201 --> 00:41:50.201
which you could not find in Italy from places very far away from North Africa or

669
00:41:50.361 --> 00:41:54.380
from the Asia minor or from Greece.
You'd have to bring or from Egypt,

670
00:41:54.381 --> 00:41:57.320
you'd have to bring it from very,
very,
very far away.

671
00:41:57.321 --> 00:41:59.600
And that would cost a tremendous amount of money.

672
00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:04.130
So what they are saying here is I am,
I,
I'm the owner of this house.

673
00:42:04.131 --> 00:42:08.720
I am wealthy enough to be able to afford a bringing marble from all over the

674
00:42:08.721 --> 00:42:12.700
world and using it to decorate my,
uh,
my,
to bleeding them.
Now,

675
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:16.670
was anyone fooled that this was a real marble wall and not a painted wall?

676
00:42:16.671 --> 00:42:18.130
We'll probably not.
Uh,

677
00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:23.140
but the idea was to give one the sense that this was a very expensive wall.

678
00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.920
Uh,
and we'll see one of the most,
well I'll,

679
00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.480
I'll hold that till later cause I thought to later,

680
00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:34.190
here's another example in the same house.
This is the house of Salus.

681
00:42:34.191 --> 00:42:34.971
We are looking,

682
00:42:34.971 --> 00:42:38.780
we have just here's the to bleed them wall that we just looked at.
We are uh,

683
00:42:38.781 --> 00:42:43.430
we are now in the Atrium of the house or what survives of the Atrium of the

684
00:42:43.431 --> 00:42:47.630
house.
We were looking at two of the cubicles that opened off the atrium.

685
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:52.010
And if you look at the walls you can see again the same effect that the rubble

686
00:42:52.011 --> 00:42:55.640
wall has been covered with Stucco,
that the stucco has been divided,

687
00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.440
stucco has been built up in relief,

688
00:42:57.441 --> 00:43:00.590
that it has been divided into a series of architectural zones.

689
00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:05.090
And then the individual blocks and the Ortho stat level and in the ice Dominic

690
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.150
level have been painted different colors.
Again,

691
00:43:08.151 --> 00:43:12.650
to give this illusion that what we are looking at is a marble wall,

692
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:14.510
not a painted wall.

693
00:43:14.511 --> 00:43:19.130
So an attempt attempt to make something to fictionalize and make something seem

694
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.870
more than it actually is.
Here's another view,

695
00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:27.380
a restored view that gives you a sense perhaps of what this might have looked

696
00:43:27.381 --> 00:43:32.240
like when the colors were more vivid.
We do believe that those Qubica had doors,

697
00:43:32.241 --> 00:43:35.180
probably wooden doors that no longer survive.
Uh,

698
00:43:35.181 --> 00:43:38.240
and you can see not only the architectural courses here,

699
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:41.690
but the effect that this would have had.
He is one of these multicolored blocks.

700
00:43:41.691 --> 00:43:45.000
Again,
a marble that would have had to be brought,
uh,
from,
uh,

701
00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:48.800
north Africa or somewhere like that where they had these kinds of multicolored

702
00:43:48.801 --> 00:43:49.310
marbles.

703
00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:52.970
But this gives you some sense of what the appearance would have been perhaps

704
00:43:52.971 --> 00:43:54.400
from a distance.
You,
you're,

705
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:59.330
I really would have been fooled into thinking that this was a real marble wall.

706
00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:04.010
You'll remember the restored view I showed you of the House of the fon where we

707
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:06.180
stood again in the atrium.
Uh,

708
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:09.890
looking back at the statute of the phone and I mentioned that the walls were

709
00:44:09.891 --> 00:44:12.590
decorated with first style Roman wall painting.

710
00:44:12.591 --> 00:44:16.730
And so we see that again here and we see the kind of effect it would have had if

711
00:44:16.731 --> 00:44:20.920
the entire space was covered with this kind of wall paint.

712
00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:25.920
And you can also see the relationship between those paintings and the vista that

713
00:44:26.361 --> 00:44:28.970
one saw as when stood and looked back,
uh,

714
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:34.030
through the columns onto the additional columns of the Paris style court.

715
00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:37.590
Another example of a first style wall,

716
00:44:37.591 --> 00:44:42.180
this one from Herculaneum is the so called Sam Night House,

717
00:44:42.181 --> 00:44:46.020
which we saw earlier today with that fabulous atrium,

718
00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:47.880
the Sam [inaudible] house.

719
00:44:47.881 --> 00:44:52.290
And this is the foul case of the Sam Night House.

720
00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.840
Also dates to 100 BC.

721
00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:57.600
And you can see the same scheme as we already saw.

722
00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:01.590
One additional feature that you can see better here is the plinth.

723
00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:05.160
This very narrow band that we see at the bottom of the plinth,

724
00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.080
the Sokal here,
the Ortho stats here,
uh,

725
00:45:10.081 --> 00:45:14.560
the ice adamic courses here,
the string course,
and then the corners.

726
00:45:14.561 --> 00:45:19.561
So exactly the same scheme that we saw in the other house at Pompei.

727
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.160
We see here in the [inaudible] house at Herculaneum.

728
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:27.150
This one even better preserved.
And that's actually a very washdot view,

729
00:45:27.151 --> 00:45:30.540
but I can show you a better one a where you can get a better sense of the

730
00:45:30.541 --> 00:45:35.430
coloration of this particular wall,
the plinth,
the softball,

731
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:36.690
the Ortho stats,

732
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:41.520
the isoc don't mix and then a phrase as you can see in between the string course

733
00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:44.730
and the corners,
there is a red freeze a,
and look at this.

734
00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.060
This is better preserved so that you can get a better sense again of what this

735
00:45:48.061 --> 00:45:50.730
might have looked like in ancient Roman times.

736
00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:55.260
This wonderful contrast between the reddish porphyry Lightstone that probably

737
00:45:55.261 --> 00:45:56.820
would have come from Egypt,

738
00:45:56.821 --> 00:46:00.690
the multi grained a stone that might've come from North Africa.

739
00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.510
The kind of impact that this would have had,
but again,

740
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:06.990
most important for us is what they're trying to do is create an illusion there,

741
00:46:06.991 --> 00:46:11.280
crying,
trying to create,
just make something look like something.
It really isn't.

742
00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:16.310
They are using again a stucco and paint to make a wall to make a very plain wall

743
00:46:18.151 --> 00:46:23.151
to make a rubble and stucco and painted wall into a very grandiose wall that

744
00:46:23.251 --> 00:46:26.760
looked like walls that were probably the kinds of walls.
In fact,
we shore.

745
00:46:26.761 --> 00:46:31.020
They were the kinds of walls that decorated the palaces of great Hellenistic

746
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:32.670
kings and the Hellenistic east.

747
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.420
We know that the great kings of Pergamon and some of the other uh,

748
00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:41.660
kingdoms had palaces that had real marble walls and we think it's very likely

749
00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:46.080
that that is the sort of thing that they are trying to recreate here.

750
00:46:46.081 --> 00:46:47.080
And then a very,
a,

751
00:46:47.081 --> 00:46:51.540
a particularly important point I think is the fact that even though I would love

752
00:46:51.541 --> 00:46:54.960
to lay claim to this particular style for the Romans,

753
00:46:54.961 --> 00:46:58.980
the Romans did not invent the first style of Roman wall painting.

754
00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:00.960
They copied it from the Greeks.

755
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:05.310
We know that the Greeks used this first style of Roman wall paint,
whatever,

756
00:47:05.311 --> 00:47:08.760
whenever it wasn't called the Dot Roman wall painting obviously for them.

757
00:47:08.761 --> 00:47:11.910
But they used something comparable to the first style,

758
00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:16.620
which we believe was derived from these Hellenistic palaces.
Ultimately,

759
00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:17.190
uh,

760
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:22.190
and you can see here a view of a wall or a drawing of a wall that was in,

761
00:47:24.221 --> 00:47:28.860
and it's on your monument list from the House of the Trident on the island of de

762
00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.700
Los,
late second,
early first century BC.
Uh,

763
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:36.400
the island of de Los was a strategically located between,
with located,

764
00:47:36.401 --> 00:47:38.380
between,
um,
uh,

765
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:43.480
it'll Italy and Greece and Asia minor and so on.

766
00:47:43.481 --> 00:47:46.640
It was one of these crossroads of trade.
Uh,

767
00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:50.360
and it was a place where Romans settled in the late,
uh,

768
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:53.410
first as a for centuries BC especially.

769
00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:57.610
And we see houses there.
Uh,
probably some Greek owners,

770
00:47:57.611 --> 00:48:01.570
some Roman owners that have this same kind of style.
It's painted.

771
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:03.160
We see the same zones.

772
00:48:03.161 --> 00:48:06.850
I won't describe them again at the same architectural zones that we see in the

773
00:48:06.851 --> 00:48:11.590
first style paintings in,
uh,
in Pompeii and Herculaneum.
Uh,

774
00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:15.880
but,
uh,
and,
and we believe that those are based on Hellenistic precedents,

775
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:18.980
but they show us again that this was used in the Greek east,

776
00:48:18.981 --> 00:48:21.670
was probably picked up by some of the traders,

777
00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.680
brought back to Italy and use their,

778
00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:27.280
the fact that it's a Greek import is extremely important because it then we can

779
00:48:27.281 --> 00:48:30.220
group it with all the other Greek imports that we've been talking about,

780
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:35.200
the columns,
the Paris styles,
the Alexander mosaic,
all of the things that,

781
00:48:35.201 --> 00:48:38.630
that the,
um,
that the Romans,
the Helen Ising,
uh,

782
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:43.060
elements that we have seen the Romans be particularly fond of in this early

783
00:48:43.061 --> 00:48:47.230
period and have used themselves in their architecture and in their architectural

784
00:48:47.231 --> 00:48:49.210
decor.
So we see that here again,

785
00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:54.420
the taking over of a Greek style of organizing and decorating a wall,

786
00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:56.470
uh,
for these Roman buildings.

787
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:59.710
This is a house we'll look at later in the semester at Ostia,

788
00:48:59.711 --> 00:49:03.250
the road port city of Ostia,
this so called house of cupid and psyche.

789
00:49:03.251 --> 00:49:06.850
And we see the two lovers here on a pedestal in the center.

790
00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.400
I show it to here only.
It's a much later structure,

791
00:49:09.401 --> 00:49:13.750
but I show it to only because we will see when we get to that that the Romans do

792
00:49:13.751 --> 00:49:17.560
and we'll see it much earlier than that.
In fact,
the Romans do begin to Revet,
uh,

793
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:21.530
some of their structures with marble.
This begins already in the age of Augustus,

794
00:49:21.531 --> 00:49:23.290
so we'll see it very soon.
Uh,

795
00:49:23.291 --> 00:49:28.050
and eventually it becomes part of house design as well.
So while this isn't a,
as,

796
00:49:28.051 --> 00:49:30.730
as grandiose as a Hellenistic palace would have been,

797
00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:34.450
it does give you some idea of what a house would look like or a palace would

798
00:49:34.451 --> 00:49:37.900
look like that had marble on the floor and marble on the walls.

799
00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:39.800
And it's this kind of thing,
uh,

800
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:44.380
that they are trying to create the illusion of this is very subtle with pastels

801
00:49:44.381 --> 00:49:44.801
and so on,

802
00:49:44.801 --> 00:49:48.850
but it's this kind of thing that they are trying to create the illusion of with

803
00:49:48.851 --> 00:49:50.290
the Roman for style.

804
00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:53.950
We see first style Roman wall painting also in,

805
00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:57.850
I'm also in Rome.
And in fact,

806
00:49:57.851 --> 00:50:01.000
I can show you an even more spectacular example in Rome.

807
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:02.890
It's from the house of the griffins.

808
00:50:02.891 --> 00:50:05.950
And I show you a view into a great barrel vaulted room.

809
00:50:05.951 --> 00:50:09.460
We're walking along the Carter have a great barrel vaulted room in the house of

810
00:50:09.461 --> 00:50:12.610
the griffins in Rome on the Palatine Hill.

811
00:50:12.611 --> 00:50:16.870
In fact under the later Imperial Palace of the emperor Domitian,

812
00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:18.730
it dates to 80 BC.

813
00:50:18.731 --> 00:50:23.250
This particular room which we call room three dates to the eight to ADBC.

814
00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:26.920
It's from this room that the house gets its name because you can get a glimpse

815
00:50:26.921 --> 00:50:29.780
of,
and I'll show you a better view in a moment of the griffins.

816
00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:33.830
There are heraldic Griffin's in a lunette painted red in the background they're

817
00:50:33.831 --> 00:50:34.550
made out of.

818
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:38.180
They're built up and stucco and then the lunette itself is painted red.

819
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:41.450
It's from those Griffin's if the house got its name,

820
00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:46.310
we are looking down the side of that house and we see again that that is built

821
00:50:46.311 --> 00:50:48.830
up in Stucco so it's still a kind of stucco relief.

822
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:53.570
But if you look at the paintings on the walls and on the back wall,

823
00:50:53.571 --> 00:50:56.030
the sidewall and the back wall and I'll show you a better view here.

824
00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:59.570
You will see that although we are dealing with something that looks like a first

825
00:50:59.571 --> 00:51:04.490
style wall,
it's very flat.
It's decided divided into architectural zones.

826
00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:08.810
Uh,
the softball,
the Ortho stats,
the ice adamic courses here,

827
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:13.730
that is all done entirely in paint.
As you can see,
it's not built up as a relief.

828
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:18.680
The only relief here that we see is the relief that is used for the heraldic

829
00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:23.930
Griffin's up in the upper most part.
When this was in better condition,

830
00:51:23.931 --> 00:51:26.330
it was a painting was made of it.

831
00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:29.870
And I showed that painting to you here and I hope this will give you a better

832
00:51:29.871 --> 00:51:34.020
sense than anything else I've shown you today of how glorious these things must

833
00:51:34.021 --> 00:51:37.850
have been in antiquity and how again,
if you stood back from them,

834
00:51:37.851 --> 00:51:41.660
you might have been somewhat fooled.
Uh,
we see the wall here.

835
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:45.650
We can see all the components that we've already described,
the plinth,

836
00:51:45.651 --> 00:51:49.580
the softball,
the Ortho stats,
the ice Domenic courses,

837
00:51:49.581 --> 00:51:53.810
and then the lunette with the heraldic griffins.
Uh,
and again,

838
00:51:53.811 --> 00:51:57.830
the whole idea of this being to give you the impression that you were looking at

839
00:51:57.831 --> 00:52:01.940
a real marble wall,
even though you are looking at a painted,

840
00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:07.070
much more important for the development of Roman painting is another house that

841
00:52:07.071 --> 00:52:11.690
I'm going to show you.
OOPS,
okay.
Who was going to show you?

842
00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:19.103
<v 1>Okay.</v>

843
00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:25.710
<v 0>Here,
uh,
which is room two in the house of the griffins and while,</v>

844
00:52:25.711 --> 00:52:29.970
and the states a little bit later,
it was done between 80 and 60 BC.

845
00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:31.440
And we look at this,

846
00:52:31.441 --> 00:52:36.000
we will see that there are beginning to be some important changes here.

847
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:39.780
Uh,
as you look at this,
you see where looking at a barrel vaulted room,

848
00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:40.890
once again,
uh,

849
00:52:40.891 --> 00:52:45.180
walls decorate and we'll all three walls well decorated and very well preserved

850
00:52:45.181 --> 00:52:48.750
so we can see exactly what's going on here.
As we look quickly,

851
00:52:48.751 --> 00:52:51.030
we see remnants of the first style wall.

852
00:52:51.031 --> 00:52:54.700
We see that we have the same architectural zones,
the plinths,
the orthos stats,

853
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:57.780
the Ice Doma,
uh,
ice to doma courses.

854
00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:00.390
And we have the same idea of marble.

855
00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:04.230
You can see that these very gated marble blocks and these red,
uh,

856
00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:07.380
red panels are meant to look again like marble.

857
00:53:07.381 --> 00:53:09.630
Although this is done entirely in paint,

858
00:53:09.631 --> 00:53:13.320
there is no stucco die in used in this room whatsoever.

859
00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:14.850
STUCCO is not used anywhere here.

860
00:53:14.851 --> 00:53:19.800
This is completely flat and it is painted as an illusionistic view.

861
00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:21.870
But as we look at this,
we see,

862
00:53:21.871 --> 00:53:26.200
although we get a sense that that first cell wall is kind of present,
uh,

863
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:29.340
we also see some,
again,
very important changes.

864
00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:33.210
We see the way in which they've treated the Sokal here to create these kinds of

865
00:53:33.211 --> 00:53:37.650
illusionistic cubes that look almost as if they're projecting out into our

866
00:53:37.651 --> 00:53:42.600
space.
Look also at what they've done by adding columns,

867
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:44.550
columns that stand on basis,

868
00:53:44.551 --> 00:53:49.551
this colonnade that seems to encircle the room the way a peristyle in circles,

869
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:54.210
a garden court,
this introduction of columnar architecture,
again,

870
00:53:54.211 --> 00:53:58.680
clearly under the influence of Greek architecture and clearly commensurate with

871
00:53:58.681 --> 00:54:02.970
what they're doing in temple architecture,
what they're doing in,
uh,
in,
um,

872
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:06.600
in sanctuary architecture and also in house architecture.

873
00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:11.840
So we see those columns and it looks as if those columns are resting on bases

874
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:15.990
that are represented in as if they're receding into the background.

875
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:20.520
They artists has paid a lot of attention to trying to render them perspectively.

876
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:23.220
So although all of this is done in paint,

877
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:27.750
we get the impression that what we're looking at is a colonnade that is in front

878
00:54:27.751 --> 00:54:28.351
of the wall.

879
00:54:28.351 --> 00:54:33.351
It projects into the spectators space and that what lies behind it is a kind of

880
00:54:33.391 --> 00:54:34.800
first style wall.

881
00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:39.870
This is the very beginnings of what we call second style Roman wall painting.

882
00:54:39.871 --> 00:54:41.430
This introduction of columns,

883
00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:44.970
this introduction of elements that project into the viewer space,

884
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:47.730
the sense that you are looking at two levels of space,

885
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:52.050
the level of space that is the wall and then the level of space that projects in

886
00:54:52.051 --> 00:54:54.690
front of it and look at the columns at the top of the columns.

887
00:54:54.691 --> 00:54:56.460
You will see they whole lintels.

888
00:54:56.461 --> 00:55:00.810
But those lintels also are shown is if they're receding into depth and you can

889
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.810
sort of barely see and you'll see this better as you study this on the,

890
00:55:03.811 --> 00:55:08.580
in the online images,
you'll be able to see the actual a coffered ceiling,

891
00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:13.050
uh,
that is represented on the top or underneath those lintels,

892
00:55:13.051 --> 00:55:17.370
which again indicate that this is being,
uh,
this is um,

893
00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.710
being represented in depth.

894
00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.020
And here you can see exactly what they're trying to do.

895
00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:29.010
They're trying to use paint and only paint to recreate the sort of thing that we

896
00:55:29.011 --> 00:55:31.380
saw in built architecture in the [inaudible],

897
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:33.960
in the house of the a silver wedding.

898
00:55:33.961 --> 00:55:38.460
These columns that project in front of a painted wall,

899
00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:41.510
this is the PSD raises dawns of,

900
00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:44.310
of what we call second style Roman wall painting.

901
00:55:44.311 --> 00:55:49.311
This is the preeminent example of mature a second style Roman wall painting.

902
00:55:49.921 --> 00:55:53.400
It is a,
a scene in the villa of the mysteries.

903
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:55.450
It's in one of the cubicles cubicles,

904
00:55:55.720 --> 00:56:00.720
cubic Ulum 16 at the bill of the mysteries and Pompei it dates to 60 to 50 BC.

905
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:07.890
It's a further development of what we saw in room two of the house of the

906
00:56:07.891 --> 00:56:12.810
griffins.
We see the first style wall is still present.
We see the plinth,

907
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:17.010
we see the sock,
we see the orthostatics,
we see the ice adamic blocks,

908
00:56:17.011 --> 00:56:21.240
although they are done entirely in paint.
Again,
no stucco here whatsoever.

909
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:25.660
We see the columns have also added as is typical of second style.

910
00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:29.230
But here the columns are even more interesting because we can see that the

911
00:56:29.231 --> 00:56:33.250
columns not only project from the wall themselves but they support and in

912
00:56:33.251 --> 00:56:38.020
tablature,
e n t a,
B,
l e t,U r e n n,
tablature,

913
00:56:38.021 --> 00:56:40.930
which projects out toward the spectator.

914
00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:44.050
And they tried to make that look as if it recedes into depth.

915
00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:48.670
We see another set of columns here,
uh,
that support a straight Lindell.

916
00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:52.000
But then look the,
the Lintel arches up in the center.

917
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:55.600
This is called an RQ weighted lintel and RQ weighted lintel.

918
00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:59.140
We have not seen an RQ weighted lintel in built architecture.

919
00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:02.890
This is very early 60 to 50 BC.
We are seeing it here.

920
00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.680
Why are we seeing it here and why are we not seeing it?

921
00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.990
In built architecture is a very interesting issue.

922
00:57:07.991 --> 00:57:10.660
In one we could debate in the online forum,

923
00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:13.170
we see that that first style wall has been,
oh,

924
00:57:13.171 --> 00:57:16.510
and we also see columns that support one of these lentils with a coffered

925
00:57:16.511 --> 00:57:20.050
ceiling.
Uh,
the Brown coffered ceiling up at the upper most part,

926
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:24.160
the first stall wall is a very complex painting and a very interesting painting.

927
00:57:24.161 --> 00:57:28.510
Intellectually.
The first all wall has been,
it's there,

928
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:31.180
but it's been dropped down.
It's been dropped down.

929
00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:33.580
And now we can see something that lies behind.

930
00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:37.470
Behind that first style wall we see a view of,

931
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:40.990
of this round a structure called a thorough loss.

932
00:57:41.110 --> 00:57:43.170
T h o l o s around thoughtless.

933
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:46.650
It's like the throw loss that was at the top of the sanctuary of Fortuna premed

934
00:57:46.651 --> 00:57:48.340
Jania at Palestrina.

935
00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:53.460
It's a shrine of some sort and that shrine is surrounded by blue sky.

936
00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:56.650
So that's something that's presumably outside.

937
00:57:56.830 --> 00:58:00.970
So the first style wall has been dropped down and now we have this vista or

938
00:58:00.971 --> 00:58:04.540
panorama of something that lies outside the wall.

939
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:07.090
So we inset in a sense have three zones of space.

940
00:58:07.091 --> 00:58:09.940
We have the columns that project into the spectators space.

941
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:13.720
We have the first style or the what's left of the first style wall,

942
00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:18.810
and then we see a view through the wall to something that lies beyond a vista,

943
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:21.130
a panorama,
a window.

944
00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:26.340
It's like opening up the wall as a window to what lies beyond this fictive.

945
00:58:26.441 --> 00:58:29.080
Again,
in the same way that first stall wall painting was fictive,

946
00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:34.000
it creates an illusion of something that is there that isn't really there and it

947
00:58:34.001 --> 00:58:37.060
coincides certainly with the kind of development we've been tracing.

948
00:58:37.061 --> 00:58:40.330
Also in built architecture,
this opening up at the house,

949
00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:44.920
opening up of the windows,
opening up bay windows to views that lie beyond.

950
00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:49.060
There's also these mysterious things that are called the people usually refer to

951
00:58:49.061 --> 00:58:51.940
as the black curtains in second style Roman wall painting.

952
00:58:51.941 --> 00:58:55.690
You can see this black element that looks almost as if it were a curtain that's

953
00:58:55.691 --> 00:59:00.691
been dropped down to reveal the scene that lies beyond because of this and

954
00:59:01.481 --> 00:59:04.000
because of the columns,
the projecting columns.

955
00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:08.110
Many scholars have suggested that there's some relationship between this and

956
00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:11.650
theatrical Roman are theatrical architecture.

957
00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:15.400
The attrical architecture that was probably stage sets in the like that were

958
00:59:15.401 --> 00:59:19.430
probably initially made out of wood that don't survive any longer.
Uh,

959
00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:21.140
and that these may imitate,
uh,

960
00:59:21.141 --> 00:59:25.790
some of those stage sets and that this may be an actual curtain using theatrical

961
00:59:25.791 --> 00:59:29.340
performances.
But there are other ways to think about,
uh,

962
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:31.370
those black curtain so to speak.

963
00:59:31.371 --> 00:59:33.380
And I think we don't have time to do that here now,

964
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:37.640
but we should definitely engage on that in the online forum.

965
00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:41.470
I want to show you,
oh,
and I do want to say one last thing.

966
00:59:41.471 --> 00:59:44.550
We're going to look at one more example of second cell Roman wall painting.
Uh,

967
00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:45.170
one thing,

968
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:48.800
one distinction that I want to make between the first and the second style is

969
00:59:48.801 --> 00:59:51.830
while the first style of Roman wall painting was a Greek import,

970
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:54.380
there is nothing like the second style is,

971
00:59:54.381 --> 00:59:57.200
we've just described it anywhere in Greek art.
Uh,

972
00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.130
the second style of Roman wall painting is without any question,

973
01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:05.180
a Roman innovation and an extraordinary Roman innovation at that.

974
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:09.380
And one that is very closely allied with developments in architecture as we've

975
01:00:09.381 --> 01:00:13.130
described them.
This is another example,
The v the villa,

976
01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:15.950
a Publius Fanis Sinise store,

977
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:21.190
second style painting dates to 50 to 40 BC.
Uh,

978
01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.250
it was in that town of Bus Gloriola that I showed you on the map before between

979
01:00:25.251 --> 01:00:28.530
Herculaneum and Pompei.
Uh,
and it had,

980
01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:32.770
it was removed from there at one point and made its way to New York.
Uh,

981
01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:36.320
it is now in the metropolitan and has been for a long time in the Metropolitan

982
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.620
Museum of art.
It is usually referred to as the met cubic ulum.

983
01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:41.990
And if you haven't seen it,
you should go down and see it.

984
01:00:41.991 --> 01:00:44.820
It is most extraordinary.
They've tried to recreate the,

985
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:46.750
the paintings are all ancient of,

986
01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:50.360
but they tried to recreate the ambiance by putting a black and white mosaic on

987
01:00:50.361 --> 01:00:53.770
the floor and giving us a nice comfortable sort of bed,
uh,

988
01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.720
and a footstool over here,
uh,
that are,
you know,

989
01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.870
just have the kind of thing that you would have seen in that room,

990
01:00:59.871 --> 01:01:03.260
although they don't actually belong.
Uh,
and they've added a window.

991
01:01:03.261 --> 01:01:07.550
And so on and so forth.
But the paintings are all are genuine ancient paintings.

992
01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:12.110
And what's amazing is we have the entire spread of the room and actually there

993
01:01:12.111 --> 01:01:12.980
are mirror images.

994
01:01:12.981 --> 01:01:16.670
The scenes are mirror images of one another across the two long walls.

995
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:22.060
I want to show you just a couple of details and this is a detail from that room

996
01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:27.210
that shows a thorough loss,
uh,
seen through columns.
Uh,

997
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:30.320
once again,
we see here,
this is example of second style,

998
01:01:30.321 --> 01:01:33.890
but it's a little bit more developed here because you can see that the first

999
01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:36.770
style wall,
uh,
has really been dropped down now.
And in fact,

1000
01:01:36.771 --> 01:01:39.080
it doesn't even look like a first style wall anymore.

1001
01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:41.930
It just looks like a red parapet,
uh,
with a,

1002
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:44.570
with a green freeze and a little corners at the top.

1003
01:01:44.571 --> 01:01:47.360
But it doesn't really look like a first I'll wall.
In fact,

1004
01:01:47.361 --> 01:01:52.361
it looks like a wall with a gate that doesn't look like there's any knob or

1005
01:01:53.061 --> 01:01:55.800
anything like that.
So we kind of wondered,
can we get into this?

1006
01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:59.180
We have to jump over it.
How do we get from here into what lies beyond,

1007
01:01:59.181 --> 01:02:02.990
we're not absolutely sure,
uh,
but we see a third loss,
once again,

1008
01:02:02.991 --> 01:02:04.550
one of these sort of sacred shrines.

1009
01:02:04.551 --> 01:02:08.930
And here you can see it is surrounded by a peristyle,
by columns,

1010
01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:13.340
a peristyle just like one might find in a house,

1011
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:16.970
in a house or in a villa.
So what are we looking at here?
We have,

1012
01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:21.180
we see columns that support a pediment.
The pediment,

1013
01:02:21.181 --> 01:02:22.710
if you look a triangular pediment,

1014
01:02:22.711 --> 01:02:25.710
what's interesting about it and is it's broken at the bottom,

1015
01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.190
the Greeks would never break their pediments.
Uh,

1016
01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:32.580
the Romans have broken this pediment to allow space for the thorough loss to

1017
01:02:32.581 --> 01:02:36.690
rise up between it.
That's a very interesting thing to do.
And it shows,

1018
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:39.510
while on one hand they respect ancient Greek architecture.

1019
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:43.110
They're also willing to depart from it and break the rules,
so to speak.

1020
01:02:43.111 --> 01:02:47.460
And we're going to see that's,
uh,
that's,
uh,
emphasized by the Romans later on.

1021
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:50.250
So the thought of loss here.
So we have these different elements.

1022
01:02:50.251 --> 01:02:54.720
We have the columns projecting toward us.
We have the wall of the,
of the gateway.

1023
01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:59.400
We also have this view through the window picture window into what lies beyond

1024
01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:02.220
and we seem to have these black curtains again.

1025
01:03:02.221 --> 01:03:05.700
In fact we have three of these black curtains.
So we ask ourselves again,

1026
01:03:05.701 --> 01:03:07.380
what are those exactly?

1027
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:12.600
And another view of just showing you this in relationship to the house of the

1028
01:03:12.601 --> 01:03:14.490
fawn and uh,

1029
01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:18.330
this whole idea of Vista and panorama from one part to another.

1030
01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:23.250
We see the same thing happening in painting as we see happening in that.

1031
01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:26.890
And then one last detail of the,
uh,
of the uh,

1032
01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.760
Publius [inaudible] over here,

1033
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:34.890
a very interesting detail and I urge you to explore this on your own because

1034
01:03:34.891 --> 01:03:37.680
it's so fascinating in detail,
this doorway.

1035
01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.570
And then most interesting of all this panoply of,
uh,
of structures that are,

1036
01:03:42.571 --> 01:03:46.080
that seem to be piled one on top of another in a series of stories.

1037
01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:51.060
This again is very early.
It's 60,
it's 50 to 40,
50 to 40 BC.

1038
01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:53.910
We don't see anything like that and build architecture.

1039
01:03:53.911 --> 01:03:58.050
Then we only see second story's beginning to be added and palm pay instructors

1040
01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:02.130
Herculaneum structures between the earthquake and the,
and Vesuvius.

1041
01:04:02.131 --> 01:04:06.660
Between 62 and 79,
but here already in the mid century BC,

1042
01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:09.360
we see this depicted in paint.
Is this fanciful?

1043
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:12.870
Is it based on something that was built in wood that no longer survives?

1044
01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:15.360
These are questions,
perhaps unanswerable questions,

1045
01:04:15.361 --> 01:04:17.430
but one one's well worth pondering.

1046
01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:20.520
I want to show you in the few minutes that remain,
uh,

1047
01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:24.180
just two more houses quickly.
Uh,
one of them,

1048
01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.550
both of them are important though,
uh,

1049
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:30.270
because they belong to the emperor and empress to Augustus and to Livia.

1050
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.260
Augustus purchased some property on the Palatine Hill.

1051
01:04:34.261 --> 01:04:36.420
He wanted to live his Rome's first emperor of Rome.

1052
01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:41.100
He wanted to live where Romulus had lived before him.
Of course.
Uh,
and uh,

1053
01:04:41.101 --> 01:04:45.960
he buys some property up here,
builds a house.
Uh,
he puts a,
uh,

1054
01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:49.950
a uh,
temple to his patron,
God right next door,
Apollo.

1055
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:54.080
And then Olivia has her own house right across the street.
His wife living,

1056
01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:55.500
she lives with him in his house,

1057
01:04:55.501 --> 01:04:58.550
but she's also got her own house right across the street.
Uh,

1058
01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:01.440
and both of these houses were decorated with paintings.

1059
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.440
I want to show you first the ones in the house of Augustus,

1060
01:05:04.441 --> 01:05:08.010
the most famous room in the house of Augustus called the room of the masks.

1061
01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:13.370
And here is where we see most clearly the possible relationship between Roman

1062
01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:15.720
wall painting of the second style cause.

1063
01:05:15.721 --> 01:05:19.780
This is also second style Roman wall painting and the theater,

1064
01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.650
if you look at the uh,
uh,

1065
01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:25.380
of the restored view at the top of a typical theater facade is we think it would

1066
01:05:25.381 --> 01:05:29.770
have looked a theater stage building as we think it would have looked early on,

1067
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.650
possibly made out of wood.
Again rather than stone.

1068
01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:36.700
You can see it as the central section with a pediment and then it has two wings

1069
01:05:36.701 --> 01:05:39.670
and we say the same scheme here,
the central section,

1070
01:05:39.671 --> 01:05:43.690
which is called technically a red [inaudible] in theater architecture,
r,
e g,

1071
01:05:43.691 --> 01:05:48.310
I a and then two wings that are technically called Husky Talia,
h,
o,

1072
01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:52.510
s,
p,
I,
t,
a,
l I a Haas be Talia.

1073
01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.670
So this tripartite scheme of a Roman theater.
And if that is lost on us,

1074
01:05:57.671 --> 01:06:01.180
note that there are masks,
one on either side,

1075
01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:05.950
theatrical masks that also give us a hint that we are looking at a theater set.

1076
01:06:05.951 --> 01:06:10.480
Here's a more vivid view of one of the walls where you can see that tripartite

1077
01:06:10.481 --> 01:06:14.290
division and to central section and two wings.

1078
01:06:14.291 --> 01:06:19.291
You can see the masks and you can see a view into some sort of landscape.

1079
01:06:19.571 --> 01:06:22.030
The Sky is no longer blue,
it's white,

1080
01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.630
but it does continue back beyond behind the architecture.

1081
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:29.140
So you get the sense that you're being beckoned into.
There's no,
in fact,

1082
01:06:29.141 --> 01:06:33.070
there's no barrier here at all.
The Wall is gone here.
There's no gateway.

1083
01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:37.400
You can walk right in to this.
What is this is there's no blue skies,

1084
01:06:37.401 --> 01:06:39.940
so it doesn't look as real as the others did.

1085
01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:43.090
It's not the sort of thing that might have been right outside your window of a

1086
01:06:43.091 --> 01:06:43.690
house.

1087
01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:48.250
It's some kind of sacred landscapes and kind of strange sacred landscape with a

1088
01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:53.050
curved colonnade,
with a tree,
and with a very phallic looking,

1089
01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:58.150
um,
uh,
shrine here in the center,
some kind of sacred space.

1090
01:06:58.151 --> 01:07:00.370
We call these sacro idyllic landscape,

1091
01:07:00.371 --> 01:07:04.780
sort of idyllic and sacred at the same time that you're being beckoned into to

1092
01:07:04.781 --> 01:07:06.490
explore again,

1093
01:07:06.491 --> 01:07:10.450
is this a stage set of some sort or is it something else?

1094
01:07:10.451 --> 01:07:14.620
Is it something that makes religious Kalanick to religious connotations?

1095
01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:19.860
The other interesting thing about the room of the masks and the house of

1096
01:07:20.081 --> 01:07:24.760
Augustus is that some scholars have claimed that although it is usually said

1097
01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:29.860
that one point linear perspective in which all lines converge at a single point

1098
01:07:29.861 --> 01:07:33.820
in the distance was created in the rent.
It was invented in the renaissance.

1099
01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:39.120
A case can be made that it was invented in Roman times.
Uh,
and if,

1100
01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:39.911
if it happened,

1101
01:07:39.911 --> 01:07:44.020
it happened here in this house ware and scholars even of the renaissance have

1102
01:07:44.021 --> 01:07:48.700
studied the way in which these points converge in this painting all the way to a

1103
01:07:48.701 --> 01:07:51.650
point at the end.
So if that's true,
uh,

1104
01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:55.270
the Romans may have done that perhaps inadvertently,
perhaps on purpose.

1105
01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:57.040
They were very interested in perspective.

1106
01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:01.270
I'll say a bit more about that in a moment.
Uh,
but if they invented it here,

1107
01:08:01.271 --> 01:08:05.080
they quickly rejected it.
As we're going to see in next week's lecture,

1108
01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:06.580
just a couple of details.

1109
01:08:06.581 --> 01:08:09.820
The mask and the beautiful way in which this very talented artists,

1110
01:08:09.821 --> 01:08:14.080
probably one of the best artists of the day,
as built up this mask out of,
uh,

1111
01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:18.170
out of,
out of,
you know,
touches of gray and white and black.
Uh,

1112
01:08:18.171 --> 01:08:22.670
an extraordinary thing.
And then again,
I really do urge you to,

1113
01:08:22.970 --> 01:08:27.170
uh,
to look at these,
look at these paintings in detail because if you do,

1114
01:08:27.171 --> 01:08:28.410
you will be very rewarded.

1115
01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:31.910
You'll see all kinds of strange creatures like wing had figures,
uh,

1116
01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:34.160
this very strange thing lurking up there.

1117
01:08:34.161 --> 01:08:37.790
Is that vegetal is it animal as a human?
I mean,
what is that?
Uh,

1118
01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:41.990
these wonderful what looked like swans,
golden swans decorate this,

1119
01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.400
that when you look very close,

1120
01:08:43.401 --> 01:08:47.540
you can see this a figural freeze here and look at that wonderful representation

1121
01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:50.390
of the fruit or vegetables in a bowl,

1122
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:54.440
a bowl that has represented so magnificently and translucent,
Lee,
uh,

1123
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:58.610
by the artist and the in the maybe three minutes or so that remain,

1124
01:08:58.611 --> 01:09:03.611
I want to show you one last painting and it's a very special painting indeed and

1125
01:09:04.041 --> 01:09:07.790
I think it ties together everything that we've been talking about today.

1126
01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:12.280
It is a painting from not the house of Livia where there are some freezer

1127
01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:13.730
paintings.
We're not going to look at those,

1128
01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:19.090
but from a villa of Livia located north of Rome at a place called Prima Porta,

1129
01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:22.760
the villa of Livia at Prima Porta.
And it is the,
in a sense,

1130
01:09:22.761 --> 01:09:27.761
the ultimate example and the very last gasp of second style Roman wall painting,

1131
01:09:28.641 --> 01:09:32.420
the villa was put up in 30 to 25 BC.

1132
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:36.410
A barrel vaulted room was decorated with this garden escape.
Now,

1133
01:09:36.411 --> 01:09:37.101
as you look at this,

1134
01:09:37.101 --> 01:09:40.610
you'd probably say to me that's has doesn't look like anything we've looked at

1135
01:09:40.611 --> 01:09:42.680
today.
There's no architecture there.

1136
01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:46.430
There's no remnants of a first stall wall there,
no project in columns.

1137
01:09:46.431 --> 01:09:48.890
There are no black curtains and so on and so forth.

1138
01:09:48.891 --> 01:09:51.110
It's very different from anything we've seen,

1139
01:09:51.111 --> 01:09:54.950
but we categorize this as a second style wall.
Why do we do that?

1140
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:59.180
Because there's a division between where we stand a spectator and the space that

1141
01:09:59.181 --> 01:10:00.320
lies beyond the fence.

1142
01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:04.370
There is a fence divides our space when the space that lies outside,

1143
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:05.990
but it's a very uh,

1144
01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:10.070
various very delicate fence and wear a white kind of lattice spends not unlike

1145
01:10:10.071 --> 01:10:14.330
the one we saw in the Sam night house.
On the second story,
we don't have columns.

1146
01:10:14.331 --> 01:10:17.420
We have trees at different kind of upright here.

1147
01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:22.660
But what connects this to the second style is that it is the ultimate example of

1148
01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:26.420
a Roman painting as a panoramic picture window.

1149
01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.150
This is what this was the,
this is what they hoped.

1150
01:10:29.151 --> 01:10:32.030
You would see when you looked out of the rooms of your house,

1151
01:10:32.031 --> 01:10:35.390
of your great bay window.
In the bill of the mysteries.
You didn't see the see,

1152
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:40.510
you would see some glorious landscape out a garden scape out aside of your

1153
01:10:40.911 --> 01:10:44.360
window with beautiful trees.
This is,
if you look at these with care,

1154
01:10:44.361 --> 01:10:48.320
you will see that this is an artist who understood nature and observed at,

1155
01:10:48.321 --> 01:10:52.820
who knew the difference between among the fruits that would be on trees like

1156
01:10:52.821 --> 01:10:54.800
this,
their fruit trees here,
who knew,

1157
01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:58.370
who had a sense of the way in which birds would a light on a leaf if they were

1158
01:10:58.371 --> 01:11:03.371
headed toward one who had a sense of the way in which leaves would Russell in

1159
01:11:03.471 --> 01:11:07.670
the breeze who had a sense of the way in which light can fall differently on a

1160
01:11:07.671 --> 01:11:11.030
leaf so that you sometimes see the lighted side or the side and shadow.

1161
01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:16.260
This is an artist who has really observe nature and has depicted what he saw.

1162
01:11:16.530 --> 01:11:19.890
And here are a couple of details where you can see that very well of this tree.

1163
01:11:19.891 --> 01:11:22.660
You see what I mean by some leaves Caston Shadow.

1164
01:11:22.770 --> 01:11:27.120
Some leaves have light shining on them.
Uh,
you get a sense of the breeze.

1165
01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:30.240
You get this wonderful,
the wonderful way in which this black bird,

1166
01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:34.040
a lights on the edge of a leaf.
This bird over here,
uh,

1167
01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:38.220
surveying this piece of fruit,
deciding whether he wants to peck it or not.

1168
01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:41.010
This is very sophisticated stuff.
Uh,

1169
01:11:41.011 --> 01:11:43.470
and you can also see if you explore this,

1170
01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:46.800
this painting a bit more that it has in it,

1171
01:11:46.801 --> 01:11:50.520
it partakes of what we call today atmospheric perspective.

1172
01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.460
Not One point perspective but atmospheric perspective.

1173
01:11:53.461 --> 01:11:56.250
What does atmospheric perspective,
if you look at this carefully,

1174
01:11:56.251 --> 01:11:59.520
you will see that all of the items that are in all the objects that are in the

1175
01:11:59.521 --> 01:12:02.490
foreground have very distinct outlines.

1176
01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:05.820
Whereas those in the middle ground or a little fuzzier and those way in the

1177
01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:07.620
background are fuzzy,
are still,

1178
01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:10.140
and they're actually probably could barely see them,

1179
01:12:10.141 --> 01:12:13.140
but they're actually mountains in the distance and those mountains in the

1180
01:12:13.141 --> 01:12:16.950
distance are so fuzzy in their silhouette that you can barely see them,

1181
01:12:16.951 --> 01:12:21.930
but you get the sense of space of moving back because of this use of atmospheric

1182
01:12:21.931 --> 01:12:26.850
perspective.
So this the ultimate Roman painting second style,

1183
01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:31.400
the Roman painting as Panorama,
that again corresponds so well,
uh,

1184
01:12:31.530 --> 01:12:34.740
to all the discussions we've been having the last couple of lectures of this

1185
01:12:34.741 --> 01:12:37.530
move towards increased vista,
increased Panorama,

1186
01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:41.880
both in painting and also in architecture.
Thanks guys.
