1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,230
Good morning everybody. In the
last couple of lectures, uh,

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,320
we have looked at what happened when
Rome took over civilizations that were

3
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:15,321
older then Rome zone and arguably
even more advanced than Rome's own.

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,930
And what happened of course,

5
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:23,370
was an interesting mix
between the architecture and
the architectural forms that

6
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:27,660
the Romans brought with them and what
they found in these highly developed

7
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:28,680
civilizations.

8
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,790
And the interesting mix that
came about because of that.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,730
But we've also taken a look at,
uh,

10
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:40,320
at what happens when Rome went out and
created cities essentially from scratch

11
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:44,850
built cities where there had been
no cities before. Uh, and uh, and,

12
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:49,590
and what happened as a result tended
to be cities that look very much,

13
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,910
uh, in the Roman stamp. And we're going
to look at a number of those cities today,

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,290
uh, in the western provinces
of the empire. In fact, uh,

15
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,970
to see what happens again,

16
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:04,410
when Rome build cities from scratch
in that part of the world. Uh,

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,260
and as I mentioned already,
the distinctive stamp,

18
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:10,410
this distinctive Roman stamp that
they had, but at the same time,

19
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:13,800
there is always some impact
from the local civilization.

20
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:18,630
And to mention in passing that at least
in the part of the world that we'll be

21
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:22,710
concentrating on today,
especially in goal ancient Gaul,

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,820
the Celtic tribes, uh, we're,
we're, we're foremost they are.

23
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:31,821
And we do see that some of the impact of
those tribes makes itself felt as well

24
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:36,960
as tribes, uh, in other parts of
this part of the ancient Roman world.

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,630
Just as a reminder,

26
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:43,830
I want to show you again a couple of the
monuments that we looked at last time

27
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:48,030
when we were talking about Greece
and about Athens under the Romans.

28
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,770
And I remind you,
for example,

29
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:54,771
on the left hand side of the screen
of this temple of Olympian Zeus,

30
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:57,690
the Olympia,
he aeon in Athens,

31
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,200
which was begun already
in the archaic period.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,200
The Greek archaic period continued
to be built up are those,

33
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,650
the patrons tried to complete it in the
course of the Hellenistic period into

34
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:15,960
the Augustan period. And
ultimately, as you'll remember, uh,

35
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:18,750
it was completed under
the emperor Hadrian.

36
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:22,740
So a building with a very long
history and a very distinctive style.

37
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,080
And when it was completed
under Hadrian of course,

38
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:29,790
you'll recall that it looked entirely
Greek, very similar to what it had.

39
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,770
It would have been, uh, in the Hellenistic
period. Uh, so those, again, the,

40
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,280
the Greeks holding very
tenaciously to their own plans to,

41
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:41,940
they are building materials and
indeed to the kinds of artists,

42
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,840
architects and artisans to carve them
that that had been carving them for

43
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:46,674
centuries.

44
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,640
We also took a look at the building
on the right hand side of the screen,

45
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:54,900
which is the oral Ogi on event drawn
like this or the tower of the winds.

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,410
And you'll remember in this case that
the civilization that had impact on was

47
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:03,580
another, uh, firmly entrenched
civilization. And that is that of Egypt.

48
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,320
We talked about the fact that while the
date of this monument is controversial,

49
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,020
uh,
we'd might be second century BC,

50
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:15,760
it might be [inaudible] or even into
the Augustan period. It's controversial,

51
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,200
but we talked about the fact that
even though the date is controversial,

52
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,880
that the monument itself was built under
very strong influence from Ptolemaic

53
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,860
Egypt. Uh, the Ptolemaic Egyptians
particularly intrigued, for example,

54
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:33,040
by clocks. This was a water
clock, as you'll remember,

55
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,590
a and by these abstruse,
uh,

56
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,700
I identifications of abstruse
wins a male winds, uh,

57
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:43,960
that we see in the upper most parts.
So again, the impact of two very,

58
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,420
very high civilizations,

59
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:51,130
a Greek civilization and the Egyptian
civilization on Roman architecture in the

60
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,220
eastern part of the world. Today
we're going to go west, uh,

61
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,680
and we're going to look at Roman
architecture in a variety of places,

62
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:04,240
including a and some beautiful places,
including the south of France,

63
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:09,220
uh, a series of cities. And I'll
point those out to you in a moment,

64
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,230
uh, in the north of Italy. So the north
of Italy, the south of France, into Spain,

65
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,610
into what is now Spain. And
then also we will dip into, uh,

66
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:23,290
an area called Istria, which is the
upper most part of what is now Croatia,

67
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,860
where a place by the
name of Pola is located.

68
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:29,110
So those western provinces will be,

69
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:32,350
are the area that we're going
to concentrate on today. Now,

70
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:35,170
any of you who've traveled in this
part of the world know that it is

71
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:37,850
extraordinarily beautiful.
Uh,

72
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,430
and I show you just one example of that.
When you go along the French Riviera,

73
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:43,630
for example,
I,

74
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:48,250
you see places as sophisticated
as Monte Carlo with its yachts,

75
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:51,850
Mort here, uh, and of course
with its glittering nightlife,

76
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:54,880
and it's extremely famous, uh, uh, casino,

77
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,520
the Casino in Monte Carlo.

78
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:02,440
There are also other wonderful
cities to visit along here.

79
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:07,390
Modern cities such as that, a veal
frosh, uh, which you see here. And it's,

80
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,440
it's a fabulous pastel colored houses
with boats that are not quite as

81
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:17,740
magnificent as those at a Monte Carlo,
but nonetheless, very picturesque,

82
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:19,120
a wonderful place to visit.

83
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:23,380
So it's not a hardship to have
to travel and look at, uh,

84
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:26,290
at Roman antiquities
in the south of France.

85
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,810
I want to begin though with northern
Italy, with a city in the north of Italy,

86
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,810
uh, city, uh, at a place
called [inaudible] stuck.

87
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,550
So the first on your monument list
for today, uh, a city, uh, that was,

88
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,640
that was founded by the Romans
in 24 BC in the time of Augustus.

89
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:48,580
And therefore, it won't surprise
you to hear that it's ancient.

90
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,350
Roman name was Agusta Pretoria.
I boost to Pretoria,

91
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,020
the modern city of a asta.

92
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,100
And it the last colony that
the Romans founded in Italy,

93
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,730
the last colony. And it's
interesting to see, therefore, uh,

94
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,760
that this last Roman colony in Italy takes
almost exactly the shape of the first

95
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:13,370
Roman colony in Italy.
You'll remember the city of Ostia,

96
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,490
which the Romans founded in 350 BC,

97
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,030
and the way in which it conform
to the typical cost from plan.

98
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,390
We see the same thing here.
Uh,

99
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,140
we see this typical costume
plan for a Asta, a rectangle,

100
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:31,520
a regular rectangle laid out.
According to Roman surveying practice,

101
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,550
we see that the two major
streets of the city,

102
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:37,850
the carto and the deck
[inaudible] meat in the center,

103
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,440
and that at that intersection of
those two main said to a main streets,

104
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,740
we see the location as it
should be of the forum.

105
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,710
Most likely you'll see a question mark
there. So we're not absolutely sure,

106
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,530
but we think that the forum
was located there. Uh,

107
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,770
if you look around at
the rest of the city,

108
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:58,310
it was very regularly laid out with a
series of buildings that we've become

109
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:01,400
accustomed to seeing in
a typical Roman city.

110
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:04,940
When a typical Roman city
is built from the basics,

111
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,600
you see the boughs here, you see a temple
up there with a crip deport this, uh,

112
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,940
you see a theater and you see an
amphitheater. This site, by the way,

113
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:17,930
spectacularly located in the Italian Alps.
Uh,

114
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,960
it's at the intersection of two major
trade routes in the Saint Bernard passes.

115
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:27,680
As you can see from this plan
that comes from Ward Perkins.

116
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,880
And what you can also see that's typical
of these cities that the Romans built

117
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:35,410
from scratch, uh, around the
western part of the empire, uh,

118
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,930
is the fact that the city
is ringed with walls. Uh,

119
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,250
and that it has a series of gates,

120
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,390
the openings of which you can
also see in this excellent plan.

121
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,820
Now I can show you also a
from the city of a Asta,

122
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:54,280
a surviving Roman arch, one
of those gateways in fact, uh,

123
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,610
from the city that we know dates to the
age of Augustus. So we give it a date,

124
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,100
the same day, roughly 24
BC. You see it here. Uh,

125
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,020
you see, if you remember, uh,

126
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,320
the arches that we've discussed from the
Augustan period in the past, uh, you'll,

127
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,990
you'll note right off that this is
very consistent with other, uh, uh,

128
00:08:13,991 --> 00:08:15,380
Bustin arch design.

129
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,710
By that I mean it has one
single RQ weighted bay in
the center flanked on either

130
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:23,030
side by pedestals,

131
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:28,031
wide wide pedestals that have a set
of double columns on either side.

132
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:30,230
As you can see here,
uh,

133
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,220
the major difference between this and an
arch that might've been put up in Rome

134
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:35,700
at the same time,
uh,

135
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,310
in the Augustan period is the fact
that it is made out of local stone,

136
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:45,440
which is characteristic of so much of
provincial Roman architecture and will be

137
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:49,640
the case for most of the buildings
that we look at today. Uh,

138
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:53,300
the attic is gone. There's a modern
roof on top of the structure,

139
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:54,800
the ancient attic is gone.

140
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:59,040
But you can imagine that it would have
had a fairly traditional attic with an

141
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:04,041
inscription at the apex and probably
some kind of sculpture crowning,

142
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,630
uh,
the monument in antiquity.

143
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,550
Now there's one detail that has to do
with the orders that are used here,

144
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,330
uh, that is different from any
other arch that we've seen before.

145
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:18,000
And I wonder if any of
you notice what that is?

146
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,200
The columnar orders.

147
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,420
Okay.

148
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,410
They are what?

149
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,210
Okay.

150
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,890
Doric ionic Corinthian Corinthian.
Okay. Everyone agrees that Corinthian,

151
00:09:32,891 --> 00:09:34,740
you're absolutely correct.
Uh,

152
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,430
but what is strange about the fact that
you look above those Corinthian columns?

153
00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:43,240
What do you see? That doesn't
usually go with Corinthian columns.

154
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,100
Okay.

155
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,920
The try glyphs in the metaphase,
the triglyceride, the metal piece,

156
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,610
it's tend to accompany the doric order.
So this is very interesting.

157
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:56,260
We see this mixing of the
orders here, uh, the use of,

158
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,130
of Corinthian columns, but a doric
freeze with try glyphs and metaphase.

159
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:05,630
You'd never see that in Rome
itself. Uh, but what it is,

160
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:09,000
is an interesting playing around with the,
uh,

161
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,880
with the canonical orders that have been
passed from Rome to this part of the

162
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:17,320
world. This particular architect
or patron or the city itself,

163
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,560
but whatever was the patron
of this particular monument
made the decision to go

164
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:22,820
into somewhat different routes.

165
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:27,620
So an interesting mixing of the orders
and eccentric a arch in that regard,

166
00:10:27,621 --> 00:10:32,210
but in every other conforming quite
closely to what we would see in, uh,

167
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:37,130
in Rome, the city of Rome
contemporaneously. Uh, we,

168
00:10:37,131 --> 00:10:37,911
we,
I also,

169
00:10:37,911 --> 00:10:42,620
I wanted to go from a asta in the
north of Italy to the south of France,

170
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,330
to provost,
uh,

171
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,010
to take a look at the original
town plan of the city of Rl,

172
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,060
the well known city of Rl. And those of
you who know it or have been there? No,

173
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:57,350
it probably primarily as the
city of Vincent Van Gogh. Uh,

174
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,910
it's in the city of RL. He
spent a good deal of time, uh,

175
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:05,720
he went to this particular cafe so often
that it bears as bear born his name,

176
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,390
uh, for some time, the cafe van Gogh.

177
00:11:08,391 --> 00:11:13,010
And you'll see another view of a lovely
Piatsa in the city of our plaza in the

178
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:15,810
city of, um, of Rl a.

179
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,970
And then the famous painting of Van
Gogh, the painting that he made, uh,

180
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:24,890
of this particular cafe that he used
to spend so much time in a cafe. Again,

181
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:27,890
as you see here is still
there. Uh, and when you,

182
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:32,480
where you can yourselves go and
sip an Aperitif or whatever,

183
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:37,550
uh, this part of this, the city of RL,
wonderful place to go. It has a very,

184
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:39,470
I'm not going to show
it to you in any detail,

185
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:42,650
just a glimpse here of
it's a famous amphitheater.

186
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:47,570
It has a very well preserved
Roman amphitheater and
the fact that France is so

187
00:11:47,571 --> 00:11:52,220
close, as you can see in that map I
showed you before, uh, to uh, Spain,

188
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,750
uh, has, has, uh,

189
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,630
led to quite a bit of Spanish influence
coming into this particular part of

190
00:11:58,631 --> 00:11:59,380
France.
Uh,

191
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:03,760
and this amphitheater is used today not
only for other kinds of performances,

192
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:08,080
but even for bull fights. Uh, as you see,
this is actually bullfight in Madrid,

193
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:11,830
not in a, not in, um,
oral. Uh, but nonetheless,

194
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:16,831
it's a sort of thing that has been
performed even in the amphitheater at RL.

195
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,120
Here's the map again,

196
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:22,720
before I show you the city plan
of oral as it would've looked,

197
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:27,250
I just wanted to remind you of these
towns in relationship to one another.

198
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:29,140
So we've,
we've come up from Rome.

199
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:32,640
We've looked at [inaudible] in the
north of Italy, in the Alps, a,

200
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,860
we're making our way now
into the south of France.

201
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,300
And I wanted to point out the proximity
of northern Italy with the south of

202
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,350
France because we do believe,
uh,

203
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:47,080
that a lot of the impact of Rome was felt
through the intern on south of France

204
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,540
or what is now the south of
France was, was, felt, uh, uh,

205
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,210
through was passed through the
intermediary of the north of Italy.

206
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:58,990
That there was certain
kinds of architectural forms
that were developed in the

207
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:00,100
north of Italy,
uh,

208
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,930
that were transferred into the south of
France because of the proximity of one

209
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,150
to the other. We're going to be looking
at RL. We're going to be looking at name.

210
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,530
We're going to look at a building and
locked tour B. We'll be looking at seven,

211
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:14,300
me and at orange,

212
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:19,300
the great theater at orange as well as
a temple at van. So all of those sites,

213
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,280
we're going to dip into Spain. Uh,
we're going to look at a famous,

214
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:24,791
famous,

215
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:29,791
spectacular aqueduct of Segovia and a
less spectacular but very WellPreserved

216
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,300
aqueduct at Terra Gona. Uh, and then
we're also going to make our way,

217
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:37,050
as I mentioned before, into Istria, uh,

218
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,130
part of what was formerly Yugoslavia
to this site called Pola. Uh,

219
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,750
that is now in, as you know, Croatia.

220
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:50,350
I want to begin with the, uh,
with the city plan of RL, uh,

221
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,240
as it would've looked in ancient times.

222
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:57,100
And I show you here the city
plan, uh, of the, uh, excuse me,

223
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,120
not the city plan.

224
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,990
I want to show you the forum to give you
a sense of what fora looked like in the,

225
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:06,250
in the western provinces, uh, during
this period, especially in Gaul.

226
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,700
I want to show you the forum
plan of the city of Rl a.

227
00:14:10,701 --> 00:14:15,310
And I show it to you here with the
modern streets super imposed on top of it

228
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:19,570
because much of it is underground,
you can't see too much of it today,

229
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,880
but it has been explored underground
enough where scholars have been able,

230
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,900
archeologists have been
able to reconstruct the fact
that it was a large open

231
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:34,621
rectangular space surrounded by columns
as we have seen is characteristic of all

232
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:35,930
Roman,
uh,

233
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,510
as forum design from the time from the
forum and palm pay that we looked at very

234
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:42,670
at the very beginning of this semester.

235
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,520
And although you can't see
it on this particular plan,

236
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,670
there was also a temple on one short
and as well as a basilica that was part

237
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,000
this plan. And I think it's interesting
to think back, especially as you review a,

238
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,470
from what we'd done sit from the
midterm through the second midterm. I,

239
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,830
it's interesting to think about a
basilican architecture and because it was

240
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:06,520
usually a part of forums and
when it was a part of, and,

241
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,730
and in what buildings in what
fora it was incorporated.

242
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,140
Think back to Pompei a think
to the forum of Trajan in Rome.

243
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,750
But think of the fact that both the,

244
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,530
the forums of Julius Caesar and the
forum of Augustus in Rome did not have a

245
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:26,390
basilica, is as part of them here
already in the Augustan period in a,

246
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,150
because that's when this
dates in the Augustan period.

247
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:33,600
We see a basilica incorporated
into the forum plan, uh,

248
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,820
in what was ancient goal.
Uh,

249
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,750
I mentioned that there's a well
preserved as a WellPreserved crypt.

250
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:43,751
Deported is an underground storage area
around the colonnade and you see a view

251
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:45,111
of it here,

252
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,670
extremely well preserved and it should
remind you of those crib deport a that we

253
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:53,960
looked at very early in the semester
at the sanctuaries that we explored the

254
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:57,710
sanctuary, you know,
actively and um, Hercules,

255
00:15:57,711 --> 00:16:01,610
victor and Hercules, Victor
Tivoli and uh, Jupiter AG,

256
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:05,900
sir at Terra Cina for example, very
similar with its barrel vaulted carters.

257
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,170
This one was used for
storage within the forum,

258
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:12,200
so they would store salt and fuel,
uh,

259
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,040
and other items that they
would need for daily use. Uh,

260
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,810
but it also became eventually,

261
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,660
and you can get an inkling of
that from this view on the left.

262
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,670
It eventually became a dump,

263
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,720
a for architectural members that were
no longer needed. As you can see here,

264
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:30,990
columns and capitals, but also for
sculpture. And one of the most famous, uh,

265
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,040
portraits of the emperor Augustus was
found in this crypto porticas dumped there

266
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,750
at some time,
some later period.

267
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:42,980
And it's now on display in the
archeological museum in RL.

268
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,810
I want to turn now to the
theater at all wrongs,

269
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:52,160
which is one of the most
spectacular monuments that
I'm going to show you today.

270
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:56,930
And you see it in this
extraordinary view from the air. Uh,

271
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,880
a building that you can see from your
monument list was put up in the late first

272
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:06,740
century BC or early first century.
And it is really something special,

273
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,720
not only in its own right, but also
because of how well preserved it is.

274
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:16,340
And you can see in this view,
uh, not only the typical,

275
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,260
the typical scheme that we have seen
as we've become accustomed to for Roman

276
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:26,000
theater design, the semicircular
orchestra, the semicircular Cabiya,

277
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,830
the division into these wedge
shapes, sections or Kunae, uh,

278
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,650
the, uh, the outer wall of the structure.

279
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,330
And you should be immediately struck by
this outer wall of the structure because

280
00:17:38,331 --> 00:17:43,010
the outer wall of the structure is better
preserved than any other outer wall

281
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:44,960
that we've seen in the
course of this semester.

282
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,390
It's preserved to its full
height. It is very severe. Uh,

283
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,360
but that severity would have been lessened
in antiquity by the incorporation of

284
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:58,500
a colonnade on the front of the structure.
Uh,

285
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:00,870
so this very important building,
uh,

286
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:05,250
in that regard because we again have
this very well preserved wall which gives

287
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,250
us a good sense of what these walls
would have looked like in antiquity.

288
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,780
And you have to imagine here,
uh, the, um, again that,

289
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,700
that alleviation of this,
of this severity by that portico.

290
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,900
You can also see here though something
very interesting about this particular

291
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,440
theater, uh, that, uh,
that makes it connected.

292
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:27,770
Although it's Roman in every way,
uh,

293
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,320
that connects it also to earlier
Greek theatrical architecture.

294
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,090
Because you'll remember that the major
difference between a Roman theaters and

295
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:40,380
Greek theaters was that Romans built
their theaters on their own hill made of

296
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:43,660
concrete, but the Greeks built
their theater is on hell,

297
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,690
actual natural hillsides.

298
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,070
And if you look very carefully at this
excellent view from the air, you will see,

299
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,461
uh,

300
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:54,990
the way in which this particular theater
at [inaudible] is actually built into a

301
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:57,720
hillside.
They happen to have a natural hillside,

302
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,130
perfect for this kind of construction
right where they wanted it to be.

303
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:06,150
So they took advantage of
that hillside and they place,

304
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,650
they supported the Kavya of
this structure by that hillside.

305
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,930
As you can see,
extremely well,

306
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:18,290
the interior of the theater at [inaudible]
is also extremely well preserved.

307
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:24,030
As you can see here. Uh, you can
see the, uh, this, this stage,

308
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,240
uh,
you can see the semicircular orchestra,

309
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,960
you can see the stone seats of the Kavya.
Uh,

310
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:34,710
and you can also see that the stage
building and because the wall,

311
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:38,100
the outside retaining wall
is so well preserved. Uh,

312
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:42,990
you can also see that the interior
of the wall still stands, obviously.

313
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:43,420
Uh,

314
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:48,420
and this wall had one giant niche in the
center with a projecting element also

315
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:52,350
in the center, and then would
have had three tiers of columns,

316
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:55,020
one on one on top of one another.

317
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:57,810
Most of those are
unfortunately no longer there.

318
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,300
But you can see one set of two pairs here.
Uh,

319
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,690
one of the lowest tier with two columns,

320
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,750
the upper tier with two
partial columns above that,

321
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:11,370
which gives you some sense of what this
would have looked like in antiquity.

322
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,100
Again, we think the tears, the
columns were on three stories. Uh,

323
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,090
remember the date of this lake
for century BC probably. Uh,

324
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:26,091
and so this does post date some of the
60 to 50 beef to 40 BC paintings that we

325
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:32,840
looked at that show these
kinds of multistory skein.

326
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,250
I frons is with a columns we taught.

327
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:39,810
We speculated about the fact that some
of those may have been based on actual

328
00:20:39,811 --> 00:20:43,740
theatrical architecture, but that it
didn't survive from that early on,

329
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,990
but it made,
it may have been made out of wood.

330
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:48,410
But here we see a fairly early example,
uh,

331
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,090
in the Augustan period
in the south of France.

332
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:54,550
And it is very important in that regard.

333
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:01,620
I want to turn from theater architecture
in the western provinces to a temple

334
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:07,870
architecture. And just as in
Rome, and just as in every
city that we've looked at,

335
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:11,200
temple architecture was
extremely important. Uh,

336
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:14,260
the temples that I'm going to show you,
and I'm going to show you two of them,

337
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,670
one at Vn, uh, in France
and one at a Neem,

338
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:23,440
also in France are among our best
preserved Roman temples today.

339
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,670
Uh,

340
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:29,670
and it's important to keep in mind that
both of them were part of complex as

341
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:32,770
they stand in isolation today.
But in antiquity,

342
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:35,710
they were part of a complex,
uh,

343
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:40,420
probably some kind of forum or
central space for that city.

344
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:45,310
Uh, this is the one that van which
I show you, show you to you first,

345
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,690
that dates,
uh,

346
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,090
to the probably to before a 14,

347
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,140
and it is a temple that was
put up to Augustus in Roma.

348
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,670
It may have been the dedication may have
been changed to Augustus and his wife

349
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:04,390
Livia. Uh, at some point
we're not absolutely sure,

350
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,100
but you see it here in a very good
general view of what it looks like today.

351
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,630
It's one of these buildings that has been
preserved in large part because it has

352
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:16,810
been used for later purposes.

353
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:20,260
It was used as a, as a marketplace. Uh,

354
00:22:20,261 --> 00:22:25,120
it was used as a museum at one point and
that is what has helped to preserve it.

355
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,860
We see it again here.

356
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:31,810
And it's interesting I think to compare
it to the restored view of the temple of

357
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:36,640
Mars old tour that was part of the forum
of Augustus in Rome because the dates

358
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,900
are roughly comparable to one another.
And I think that you will see that it is,

359
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,050
that it is atypical Roman temple,
in fact,

360
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:48,190
almost indistinguishable from what we
would see in Rome. At the same time.

361
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:51,610
So here's an example again
of what happens when you go,

362
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:55,510
when the Romans go into a part of the
world that isn't already inhabited by a

363
00:22:55,511 --> 00:23:00,070
very highly developed civilization
that they make buildings that look very

364
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:04,210
similar to those that were put
up contemporaneously in Rome. Uh,

365
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,780
the temple at the end is no exception.
If we look at this temple,

366
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:12,250
we see it has the typical
Greco-Roman plan, uh,

367
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,100
with the tall podium,
the deep porch,

368
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,460
the freestanding columns in that porch.
Uh,

369
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:22,030
and we see that the order that is
used here is the Corinthian order.

370
00:23:22,031 --> 00:23:25,360
Some of the temple is made
out of local limestone. Uh,

371
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:27,900
some of it is made out of marble.
Uh,

372
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,190
but what we see here
that's very interesting.

373
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:34,210
Visa vi what was happening at the
same time in Rome is the seller.

374
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,360
You can see that the sella
is actually very shallow,

375
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,720
much more shallow than the
cell cell a usually is.

376
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,810
And you can see that quite
well in this view over here.

377
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:49,170
And that same shallow seller we find
at the temple of Mars all tour in Rome.

378
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,680
The other similarity is the fact that
at the Temple Marzel tour in Rome,

379
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,360
we have freestanding columns,
columns all the way up to the,

380
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:02,720
to the back here, uh, and
those columns and the,

381
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,040
and the space between those
columns and the wall of the Sella.

382
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,540
And that creates a tie,

383
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,600
a type of temple design that we referred
to today as a temple with ally or

384
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:17,900
wings, wings, one on either
side of the seller, uh,

385
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:22,340
formed by that space between the wall of
the Sella and the freestanding columns.

386
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,700
And we see exactly the
same thing over here.

387
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:28,490
This design of a temple with all lie,

388
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,700
there is no question that this temple in
Vienne was built under the very strong

389
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:38,300
influence of the temple
of Mars old tour in Rome.

390
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,090
All of those features,
I mean,

391
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,400
it wouldn't have come upon
those features by accident.

392
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,500
It is clearly being closely based.

393
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:50,210
One on the other here are two more
views of the temple of uh, uh,

394
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:55,260
of Augustus and Roma Slash Livia at van
where we see all of the features that

395
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:58,700
I've already shown you.
But where you can see particularly,

396
00:24:58,701 --> 00:25:01,370
well the shallow seller, uh, the plane,

397
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,610
the back wall here that has
pilasters rather than columns.

398
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:09,200
And then if you go around the back, you
will see it as a flame plain flat back,

399
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,970
uh, which was the case also for the
temple of Maura's old tour in Rome,

400
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,710
a more famous temple and
even more famous temple.

401
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:23,711
And if that's possible and even better
preserved a temple a is the one that you

402
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:25,940
now see on the left
hand side of the screen,

403
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:30,830
which is the famous Meson cafe at Neem.
It to it to,

404
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,190
uh, has been reused in ancient
times as a museum and the like,

405
00:25:34,191 --> 00:25:36,410
it's still a small museum today,

406
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,650
which is one of the main reasons
that it is so well preserved.

407
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,340
It is an extraordinary
work of Roman architecture.

408
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:48,110
I think it's interesting to compare it
to the Temple of Port Tunis that we saw

409
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,790
much earlier this semester. The major
difference of course between the two,

410
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:57,440
the materials that are used,
this is local limestone with marble.

411
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,500
Uh, this, well we won't,
we won't remind ourselves,

412
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:04,760
but the Tufa and travertine and so on and
so forth, uh, that we looked at earlier.

413
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:08,900
This is an ionic temple.
This is a Corinthian temple,

414
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,710
but once again, it seems to be
the temple of Mars old tour.

415
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,710
That was the main model,
uh,

416
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,530
for the Meson cafe or the
square house at name. Uh,

417
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,360
and I show you another view of it here
because you'll see just like the temple

418
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:24,110
of Port Tunis,

419
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:29,110
it has a pseudo peripheral colonnade
and you can see that extremely well.

420
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,390
Yes, the columns and
circle the entire monument,

421
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,830
including the back wall.
Uh,

422
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,850
but those columns are engaged or attached
to the wall going all the way around

423
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:40,941
here.

424
00:26:40,941 --> 00:26:45,941
You can again see the opas quad rotten
blocks of this local limestone that's

425
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:51,741
used for the walls and then marble use
for the columns and also for the capitals

426
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,860
of this glorious and very well preserved
Roman temple and hear some spectacular

427
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,220
details of the capitals of the,
uh,

428
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:07,221
of the temp of the Meson cafe at
Neem and the freeze and also the,

429
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,730
uh, the decoration up above. And what's
interesting about these capitals,

430
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:13,470
if you look at them in detail,

431
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,700
you will see that not only are they
Corinthian and we can see the uh, the, uh,

432
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:23,400
spiral volume it's growing out
of the canvas leaves down below.

433
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,480
But if you compare these
capitals to a capital,

434
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:32,220
a preserve capital from the
temple of Mars old tour in Rome,

435
00:27:32,221 --> 00:27:35,970
you will see that not only
are these based on these,

436
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,400
but that they are so close,

437
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:42,270
so close that there is absolutely
no question, I believe,

438
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:43,800
well this was not suggested by me,

439
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:47,640
but by a scholar who studied
these in great detail, uh,

440
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:51,450
and determined and suggested and all
of us have believed it ever since,

441
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,660
that these are not only based on those
but that the same workshop a worked these

442
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,960
capitals for the Meson cafe as for
the temple of Mars old tour in Rome.

443
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,290
Now that works well chronologically
because you'll remember that the temple of

444
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:12,140
Marzel tour in Rome was dedicated into BC.
This building,

445
00:28:12,141 --> 00:28:16,680
as you can see from your monument
list, was built in around a d five. Uh,

446
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:21,270
so there was perfect. That was, it
was perfect timing for those, uh,

447
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:26,290
architects and artisans who had been
successful at the temple of Marzel tour in

448
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:29,580
Rome. This major commission
allowed themselves, we believe,

449
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:34,530
to be hired out to those in the
south of France to make the trip,

450
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,660
uh,
to name a,

451
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:41,690
in order to build a temple in the model
of the temple of Mars old tour in Rome

452
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:47,160
at name, uh, the result, the
Meson cafe. Uh, so this, this is,

453
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:50,920
I've made this point, uh, in other
lectures about the fact that, uh,

454
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,530
there are certain times when
we can document not only
the exchange of ideas but

455
00:28:55,531 --> 00:28:57,000
even architectural ideas,

456
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:01,800
but even the exchange of architects
and artisans going from one part of the

457
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:04,680
Roman world to another
in search of commissions.

458
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:09,310
And this is one of those times where
we can document with certainty, uh,

459
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,930
that artists working in the
employ of the emperor himself.

460
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,960
Augustus made their way to the south
of France to create this amazing temple

461
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,310
from scratch.
Once again,

462
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:25,311
temple very much in the model of the
most famous temple of its day in Rome.

463
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:29,070
And that is the temple
of Mars old tour in the,

464
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:31,950
in the forum of Augustus.
One more detail.

465
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:36,340
Here's the Marzel torque capital
again, and overhear, uh, the,

466
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:40,800
the capitals of the Meson cafe
and I show you above the freeze,

467
00:29:40,801 --> 00:29:44,410
which extremely well preserved
and you'll see this flowering,

468
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:49,060
a canvas plant that should immediately
remind you of contemporary decoration and

469
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:52,900
Rome. Think of the flowering
of campus plans of the aura,

470
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:55,420
pockets out boost die.
So once again,

471
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,920
a proof that there is a very
close connection to what's
going on in Rome at this

472
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:02,410
time.
And in the south of France.

473
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,180
Here's another spectacular view of the uh,

474
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,960
Meson cafe as it looks
in its location today,

475
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:16,030
uh, in the center of a plaza
surrounded by the daily life of name.

476
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,800
As you can see so well here,
uh,

477
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,590
it's still very much a part of daily life
and very interesting is the fact that

478
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:27,220
if you look across the
street from the Meson Cafe,

479
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:31,900
you see a building that was designed
by the very famous and very talented

480
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:34,750
British architect, Norman foster. Uh,

481
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:39,751
it's also a museum and it's a play on
the word on the name of the Meson Kallai.

482
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:45,040
It's called the Cafe Dar. Uh, it's
a museum that has modern art. Uh,

483
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:49,120
and it, it mostly exhibits
it's permanent collections,

484
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,231
but you can see,

485
00:30:50,231 --> 00:30:53,290
and I'm going to show you a detail
in a moment to bring this point home.

486
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,780
You can see that Norman foster has
really looked at and studied, uh,

487
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:02,410
the Meson Kallai and has
created a modern version,

488
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,500
a very modern version of the Meson Kallai.

489
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,410
If you look at the Meson
cafe and it's, uh, it's,

490
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,700
it's deep porch and it's high
podium and it's single staircases,

491
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:16,120
facade orientation,
all the usual Roman elements.

492
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:17,950
And look at this building.

493
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,750
You will see that he too has created a
kind of portico, uh, in the front. Uh,

494
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:25,720
they're not actual columns,
uh, their, their peers,

495
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,510
but peers and it's very
slender and elegant peers.

496
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:33,511
But peers nonetheless that are clearly
being played off the columns of the Meson

497
00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:38,110
cafe. And look at the way in which
he has done, uh, the, the, the,

498
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:39,790
the glass exterior.

499
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:44,410
He has divided it into a series
of panels that are clearly,

500
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,040
I believe reflecting, and I'm sure he
knew he was doing this at the time,

501
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:53,041
clearly reflecting the panels
of the Ashleigh masonry
of the walls of the actual

502
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,100
Meson cafe. So this very interesting, we
see not only dialogue happening, you know,

503
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:04,270
within Roman buildings themselves and
various parts in Rome itself and in

504
00:32:04,271 --> 00:32:05,440
various parts of the world.

505
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:10,710
But this ongoing dialogue between
ancient monuments and modern buildings in

506
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:15,610
cities like Rome, there are pockets
in the Meyer building is one example,

507
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:21,270
but also in some of these other cities
like Neem in the south of France.

508
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:23,110
And by the way,
you can go up,

509
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:28,111
there's a roof garden that you can go up
to on the top of this kind of a Dar in

510
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:32,770
order to see a spectacular view
from above of the Meson cafe.

511
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:38,110
Now, one of the, uh, one of the
most important elements of Rome,

512
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,700
the Roman Ization of the,
uh,

513
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,680
empire was the fact that as the Romans
went in and built these new cities in

514
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:47,300
east and also in west,

515
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,810
they supplied it with amenities
that weren't there before.

516
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:54,170
And this was especially important in
the western provinces where again,

517
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:58,490
the civilization had not been all
that high, uh, prior to this period.

518
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:03,490
So the Romans come in and they build aqua
ducks with a vengeance in the western

519
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:06,710
provinces in the south of France,
in Spain,

520
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:11,330
in order to provide these
towns with a water supply.

521
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:15,860
And I want to show you a couple of
examples of our best preserved and most

522
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:19,670
spectacular Roman aqueducts anywhere in,
uh,

523
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:24,510
what was the ancient Roman empire.
I want to begin with perhaps the,

524
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,750
with certainly the most famous of these,

525
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,640
the so called [inaudible] also at Neem.
Uh,

526
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,570
and I show you first a map,

527
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,280
which gives you a sense of
what was going on here. Uh,

528
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,320
the patron by the way of the [inaudible]
at Neem was none other than Marcus

529
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:45,440
Agrippa. Marcus Agrippa, whom we've
talked about several times a semester.

530
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:48,590
The close friend,
confidant, a right hand man,

531
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:53,591
son in law that hoped for air of Augustus
who we saw was building buildings in

532
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:59,370
Rome. He built the bads that bear his
name, the best of the gripper, a anti.

533
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,730
You also built that first Pantheon,

534
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:05,960
that first temple to all the gods
were with its chorionic porch.

535
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,210
We saw that he was active
as a builder in Athens, uh,

536
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:14,220
where he built the Odi on of a gripper
and where he was honored with a statue on

537
00:34:14,331 --> 00:34:17,990
top of a pier on the Acropolis in Athens.

538
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:22,310
He also was active in the south
of France as a great builder.

539
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:27,470
And it was here that he was responsible
for commissioning an aqueduct that would

540
00:34:27,471 --> 00:34:31,220
bring water from 31 miles
away up in the mountains,

541
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:35,030
down to the city of name.
And this map gives you a very good,

542
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:39,980
a sense of exactly how that was done.
The source was up there at the top,

543
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:42,800
the top, uh, red, uh,
pink circle up there,

544
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,920
made its way all the way down
to the city of Neem here.

545
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:52,960
Uh, now the Romans were very clever
about how they built aqueducts.

546
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:57,970
They let gravity and the change in
terrain essentially do the work for them.

547
00:34:58,341 --> 00:34:59,174
They tend,
they,

548
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:04,380
they placed a terracotta pipes underground
for the most part on sloping ground,

549
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:05,460
uh,

550
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:10,190
and allow the water to come from the
hillsides and the mountains down into the

551
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,100
city just as they did here on occasion,

552
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,990
they allow those terracotta tile of
those terracotta, uh, tubes to be,

553
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:19,850
to be carried by low walls.

554
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:25,180
But sometimes they got to a point where
they had to cross a body of water.

555
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:29,870
And that is exactly what
happened here. The River Gar, uh,

556
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,590
of the city of name of the
area of Neem, uh, goes through,

557
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,530
is located at this particular point.

558
00:35:36,531 --> 00:35:40,680
And so aqueduct system
had to cross the river.

559
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,230
How did they do that?
They couldn't tunnel it underground,

560
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:47,310
that couldn't place it on a low wall.
So what they did was built a bridge.

561
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:52,080
They built a bridge to carry that
water across the body of water.

562
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:55,380
And the result of that
is what you see here.

563
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,760
This is the famous [inaudible]
at [inaudible]. Uh,

564
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:03,390
this is the bridge that serves
to carry the water across.

565
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:08,370
They place the terracotta pipes
in the aqueduct itself. Uh,

566
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,510
and that water is carried
across that aqueduct. Now,

567
00:36:12,511 --> 00:36:16,320
what's particularly extraordinary about
this monument, besides that feat of,

568
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:21,100
of taking that, that, uh,
water across the river, uh,

569
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,050
is the fact that it is, well, if you
look at the building technique, you can,

570
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,520
you can tell that it is made of
Ashleigh Masonry, Ashleigh Masonry,

571
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,790
that is local stone in
this particular case,

572
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:38,060
as much as we have seen is the case for
the most part in architecture in the

573
00:36:38,491 --> 00:36:41,360
south of France in the Roman period of,

574
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:44,100
but what is amazing about
this particular aqueduct,

575
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:46,680
besides this great engineering feat,
uh,

576
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:51,510
is the fact that the architects have
paid enormous attention to the exact

577
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:56,050
measurements, not only of the arch
itself, but of the occupations. Uh,

578
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,930
and they have, they have,
they have PE, they have, uh,

579
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,530
worked up all kinds of
elaborate art. Uh, uh,

580
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,760
mathematical theorems in order to get to
the point where they play these shapes

581
00:37:08,401 --> 00:37:11,640
and the sizes of these shapes
well off against one another.

582
00:37:11,641 --> 00:37:16,641
The larger occupations below are perfectly
mathematically worked out so that

583
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:20,520
they work well with the
smaller ones up above.

584
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:24,930
And we see in a building like this, I
think something that is really impressive,

585
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:27,570
not only a sign of Romantization,

586
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:31,770
I mean this is when you talk about Roman
imperialism and the Romans taking over

587
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,780
the world in ancient Roman times.
One could think about that in part in,

588
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,920
in a negative way. I mean, imperialism and
taking over and creating an empire, uh,

589
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,570
can,
can be viewed negatively.

590
00:37:42,571 --> 00:37:45,090
But one of the positive things
that the Romans brought,

591
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:49,500
one of the many positive things that the
Romans brought to these underdeveloped

592
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:54,000
parts of the world was what we call
Romantization, bringing these amenities,

593
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:58,770
bringing things like water to a city
so that it could live at a higher level

594
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,130
than it was able to live before.
But besides that,

595
00:38:02,131 --> 00:38:06,330
when you look at an aqueduct
liked the poem, do Gar at name?

596
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,260
I think you'll agree that although
we would call this a feat of Roman

597
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:12,120
engineering,
first and foremost,

598
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:17,420
the Romans have been adept enough
both through paying attention to these

599
00:38:17,911 --> 00:38:19,470
mathematical considerations,

600
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:24,471
but also to carving the stone to making
the stone really work aesthetically that

601
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:29,350
they have essentially in this
aqueduct transformed, uh,

602
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:34,351
engineering into architecture into
what we would define as architecture.

603
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:41,230
I want to show you two other aqua docs.
Uh, the first two, both of them in Spain,

604
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,660
uh, the first at, uh, uh, uh,

605
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,660
Tarragona and the other one
at Segovia. Uh, first, uh,

606
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,990
a reminder of the fact that Spain is,
you'll recall,

607
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:57,991
was extremely important in the Roman
period because two of Rome's emperors came

608
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,020
from Spain,
I think of Trajan who was born in Spain,

609
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:06,640
born in Spain and also Hadrian
whom we see here on the left,

610
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,820
a map of Spain showing the locations
of Etol Ilica where a Hadrian was born,

611
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,040
but also the two sites that we're
going to look at Tarragona Toronto,

612
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:21,310
which was located very close to Barcelona.
You know, the sea as you can see here.

613
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:26,170
And then further inland Segovia.
So Govia which is near Madrid,

614
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:31,270
uh, the city of Madrid, I'm
so very accessible for any
of you traveling Spain. Uh,

615
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,050
these are sites that are extremely
accessible and especially Segovia.

616
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,600
Well worth looking at.
Just want to show you the aqueduct.

617
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:43,360
Did Tara go into briefly? Uh, you
can see it here on the screen. Um,

618
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:48,510
an aqueduct that dates to
the Augustan period and uh,

619
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:53,290
it is, uh, it's a handsome work
of architecture. Uh, it has, um,

620
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:58,480
Ashleigh blocks as you can
see, local stone. Uh, but
it doesn't have the finesse.

621
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:02,530
I think you can see here now how great
the polls do, Gar is because it doesn't,

622
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,890
it's attractive. It does the job.
It's a great engineering feat,

623
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:10,870
but it doesn't have the aesthetic,
the aesthetic values that DePaul do.

624
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:13,270
Gar Does, uh, with its, you know,

625
00:40:13,271 --> 00:40:17,200
arches that are the same
size on the lower story.

626
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:22,200
And then in the upper story, uh, at, it
doesn't, it doesn't have the, um, the,

627
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:25,750
the appeal aesthetically,
visually that the Pont du Gard does,

628
00:40:25,751 --> 00:40:28,450
but it does its job. However, uh, the art,

629
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,990
the aqueduct at Segovia
is quite another story.

630
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:37,230
The aqueduct at Segovia is right up there
with the palm to Gar at name as one of

631
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:42,220
the great works of Roman engineering
and of Roman architecture.

632
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:47,020
And what makes it all the more spectacular
is how much of it is preserved.

633
00:40:47,021 --> 00:40:52,021
And I think you can see that extremely
well here in this amazing view of the

634
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:54,610
aqueduct marching,
you know,

635
00:40:54,611 --> 00:40:58,940
making its way across the center
of the city of modern, uh,

636
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,200
Segovia and this truly spectacular image.

637
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,550
As you can see from your monument lists,

638
00:41:04,551 --> 00:41:08,530
the date of the aqueduct of
Segovia is very controversial.

639
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,240
There are some people who
think it's first century,

640
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:14,770
there's some people who think it's second
century. I think it is most likely, uh,

641
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,910
to be,
uh,

642
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,940
second century and probably put up during
the time of Trajan the emperor Trajan.

643
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:25,210
But we're not sure about
that whenever it was put up.

644
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,420
It is an incredible example of aqueduct,
uh,

645
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,290
engineering and aqueduct architecture.

646
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,840
And it does allow us to see
a couple of things that we,

647
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:38,300
it's very distinctive in its own right.
It's beautiful,

648
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:42,400
but beautiful in a very different way
as we'll see from the Pont du Gard. Uh,

649
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,960
but it does allow us to look at a couple
of other features of Roman aqueduct

650
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,270
planning and design that I
think are worth talking about.

651
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:55,630
I show you here another view
of the aqueduct at Segovia.

652
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,410
Uh,
and uh,

653
00:41:57,411 --> 00:42:02,270
your see you see here that it is for the
most part a two tiered aqueduct system,

654
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,620
uh, but what they've done here to vary
it and to make it much more interesting

655
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:11,570
aesthetically then the aqueduct in
Tarragona is to make those two stories

656
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:16,400
different in height. So the lower
story is much higher as you can see,

657
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,780
a with much more attenuated arches.
Uh,

658
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:24,430
and then the upper tier is
lower, uh, with, um, with,

659
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,480
with,
with much smaller arches.

660
00:42:26,481 --> 00:42:29,860
The other thing that they've
done using local stone, uh,

661
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,480
they have left the stone in
a somewhat rougher state.

662
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:35,990
It isn't quite as rough perhaps
as Claudius is buildings,

663
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,810
but left in a fairly rough state,

664
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,490
which gives it a real
sense as you look at it,

665
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,940
of the texture of that stone stone,

666
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:48,200
of the materiality of that stone in a
way that makes this particular building

667
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:51,260
extremely attractive and impressive.

668
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,270
And you can see here this,

669
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,830
this view was also very helpful because
you can see people standing below,

670
00:42:57,831 --> 00:43:01,750
which gives, it gives you some
sense of the very large scale, uh,

671
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,910
of this particular aqueduct.
Here's another view.

672
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:09,380
This is one of my favorite views
of the aqueduct at Segovia. Uh,

673
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:13,940
because I think here you can really get
a sense of the coloration of the stone,

674
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:18,170
of the texture of this slightly
rough stone and of the way,

675
00:43:18,171 --> 00:43:21,140
even in the architecture of aqueducts,
again,

676
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:25,880
mainly an aqueduct is built mainly for
practical purpose to bring water from one

677
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:30,770
part of, of, of, uh, one
place to another place. Uh,

678
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,850
and to provide an amenity as we've
talked about it at a significant and

679
00:43:34,851 --> 00:43:39,530
important day to day amenity. Uh,
but even with that, even with,

680
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,140
even though it essentially
a practical building,

681
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:45,650
aesthetics are never far
from the Romans minds.

682
00:43:45,651 --> 00:43:48,740
And when this particular aqueduct is,
was designed,

683
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:53,030
not only did the designer have in mind
the texture of the stone and the way in

684
00:43:53,031 --> 00:43:54,650
which the light of Spain,

685
00:43:54,651 --> 00:43:58,640
this particular part of Spain hits
that stone at any given time of day.

686
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:00,800
But the whole concept
of Vistagen when you,

687
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:04,930
when you wander along this particular
aqueduct is it goes on for quite a while.

688
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,660
Uh, you can do that and you're not
on top of a body of water as well.

689
00:44:08,661 --> 00:44:13,040
So you can walk along it down
below and see what you see as you,

690
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:17,540
as you meander through it. And it
is amazing aesthetically, again,

691
00:44:17,541 --> 00:44:22,541
how they have set up a series of views
and vistas from one part of this aqueduct

692
00:44:22,881 --> 00:44:26,030
to another. As you stand
here and, and you look at it,

693
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,570
look at it making its way, almost
marching. It's way, in fact, I,

694
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,810
I like to think it's Trey Janick because
it's almost like Trojans army marching

695
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:36,210
through the city of Segovia off too.
You know,

696
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:39,590
some military exploit in the far reaches,
uh,

697
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:43,170
because the way it marches through
the city as you can see here.

698
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,760
But all of these wonderful views
and vistas in Panoramas, uh,

699
00:44:47,761 --> 00:44:50,700
that one can see depending upon
where one stands in the city,

700
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:55,680
where one stands beneath the
arches themselves is really
spectacular and clearly

701
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:59,400
was very much in the minds of
the architect who designed this.

702
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:04,610
Here's another very good view where if
you stand below the aqueduct and look up,

703
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:09,621
this is the sort of view that you see
with the rough stones even in the Balts of

704
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:13,620
the arches themselves. Uh, and,
and incredible work. And again,

705
00:45:13,621 --> 00:45:17,190
the fact that it is well PR as well
preserved as it is, is really, uh,

706
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,780
something to be grateful for.

707
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:23,040
Here's a very interesting view because
it also shows you what happens with

708
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:27,180
aqueduct design. Uh,
when the terrain changes.

709
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:29,400
So in the center of the city,

710
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:33,450
then the views that we looked at just
before they were able to build the ground

711
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:38,250
level was low enough that they were able
to build the aqueduct and two stories

712
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:41,640
with that. Very high for a story.
And then the lower second story.

713
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:46,110
But what happens when the terrain
shifts when you go? Because again,

714
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:50,460
they're taking advantage of a source
that is located higher up with the hope

715
00:45:50,461 --> 00:45:54,940
that gravity will do the work for
them and allow that water to, uh,

716
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,590
to flow from that source
down into the city.

717
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:02,760
And that is exactly what they did here.
The source is farther away and it's high.

718
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:03,481
So the,

719
00:46:03,481 --> 00:46:08,481
so the water has to be piped into this
structure and make its way down from the

720
00:46:08,701 --> 00:46:12,390
hillside to the city. So
you see the ground, uh,

721
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:15,490
rising here to go up that hill.
Uh,

722
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:20,570
and what happens is that they have to
adjust the aqueduct according to the

723
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:24,000
changing terrain.
So if you look at this particular section,

724
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:28,350
you will see that the bottom
story is just an arch. There,

725
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,470
arch rests on the
ground, uh, so that they,

726
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,910
because it has to be much shorter
at this juncture than anywhere else.

727
00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:37,460
And you see the same eye.
Well,

728
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,560
you see it changing somewhat
here as it makes its way,

729
00:46:40,561 --> 00:46:44,160
but you see it rounding the corner and
the way they have had to make these

730
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:48,940
adjustments and made them so well
and without losing the, the, uh, the,

731
00:46:48,941 --> 00:46:53,880
the impressive aesthetic quality of
this particular structure. Once again,

732
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,090
a tribute to the fact that
these Roman architects,

733
00:46:57,091 --> 00:47:01,590
we're not only great engineers,
but also without any question, uh,

734
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:06,060
world class architects. There's an
interesting monument that is located.

735
00:47:06,061 --> 00:47:09,270
You can see the aqueduct of
Segovia in the back left there.

736
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:14,420
There's an interesting monument that was
put up to celebrate the by millennium

737
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,410
of the aqueduct in Segovia.
And it's interesting to see what,

738
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,900
what they put at the top,
the,

739
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:26,910
she will suckling Romulus and Remus to
underscore the close connections between,

740
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,493
um,
uh,

741
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:32,710
ancient Romans Segovia and a wrong,

742
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,880
another very interesting building in,
uh,

743
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:40,670
France is the one that I show you now,
uh,

744
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:44,500
which was a fountain, a
these aqueducts, you know,

745
00:47:44,501 --> 00:47:48,730
these aqueducts brought not only water
for daily use, but fed fountains.

746
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:53,540
And I want to show you one fountain,
uh, from the, uh, from, uh,

747
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,980
Roman gall from France.
What is France today? Uh,

748
00:47:56,981 --> 00:48:00,870
the so called Temple of Diana
wasn't a temple. It was a founder.

749
00:48:00,871 --> 00:48:05,080
And as I mentioned that it
was built during the Hadrian
manic period between 100

750
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:10,081
and 130 what makes this
fountain particularly
interesting is if we just looked

751
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:14,410
at this, if I asked you if I put this up
and send you, what do you think this was?

752
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:14,790
A,

753
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:18,820
you would be unlikely to say a fountain
because you can see that this structure

754
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:20,410
is in the form of a basilica.

755
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:25,030
It's a barrel vault and central chamber
with side aisles that are also barrel

756
00:48:25,031 --> 00:48:28,030
vaulted. You can see the barrel
vault of this side aisle over here.

757
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,730
You can see a barrel vault
of the central space here.

758
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:33,810
You can see that there
are columns on told basis.

759
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:38,680
You can make out over here that a
triangular pediment on top of a niche.

760
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:43,300
There were a series of niches along the
wall with alternating triangular and

761
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:48,190
segmental pediments. But most
interesting of all is the central, uh,

762
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,630
central space,

763
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:53,680
the central barrel vaulted space
with these barrel vaulted side Oz,

764
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:58,090
which is exactly the scheme of
a typical basilica. Uh, and it,

765
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,720
it's another example of something I've
shown you throughout the semester that

766
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:04,120
I've called the
interchangeability of form.

767
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,250
The way in which certain building types,

768
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:11,251
in this case a basilica built initially
as a civic structure for the trying of

769
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:13,770
law cases, uh, becomes a,

770
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:16,540
a plan that is used in other contexts,

771
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:20,410
whether it's in residential architecture
as we've already seen a and in this

772
00:49:20,411 --> 00:49:24,310
case in, in the form of a fountain.
So that's particularly interesting.

773
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,450
Also interesting is the fact that although
this is a barrel vaulted structure,

774
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,150
it is made entirely out of local stone.

775
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:35,380
No concrete whatsoever in this
particular part of France,

776
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,870
no concrete stone construction.

777
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,010
It's a masterwork when you consider that
this was all done out of stone and done

778
00:49:42,011 --> 00:49:46,720
extremely well. Look how smooth, uh,
the stones are. And look, the architect,

779
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:51,721
the designers have even been a talented
enough to create ribs with stone in that

780
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,590
stone barrel vault for
this amazing structure.

781
00:49:56,591 --> 00:50:00,770
And you should be reminded when I talk
about the interchangeability of form, uh,

782
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,690
of the underground basilica that we
looked at way back when and the time of

783
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:08,560
Claudius, which was built
underground, made out of concrete, uh,

784
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:12,820
faced with Stucco as you'll recall,
but used for a secret sect. Uh,

785
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:13,810
and in this case,

786
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:18,990
the use of this Basilican structure
for a fountain in Roman France.

787
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,330
Up to this point,

788
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:27,360
we have looked at monuments that were
made possible by Rome's subjugation of

789
00:50:28,011 --> 00:50:30,750
this particular part of the world.
Uh,

790
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:35,830
the subjugation we know of
at least a 44 Alpine tribes.

791
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,640
Uh, and so while all of these buildings
that I've shown you come because of that

792
00:50:40,641 --> 00:50:43,940
subjugation and subsequent
Roman [inaudible] of the area,

793
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:48,770
there is one monument spectacularly
cited that actually celebrates honors,

794
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,210
that very subjugation. And it's to that,
that I now want to turn, uh, it is,

795
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,021
as I mentioned,

796
00:50:54,021 --> 00:50:58,580
spectacular spectacularly
cited along the French Riviera,

797
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:03,500
not far from niece, not far from
Monte Carlo. Uh, you see it here.

798
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,450
It is the a trophy of Augustus.
The trope, pay him. I'll gousty is,

799
00:51:08,451 --> 00:51:11,300
you'll see on your monument
list that is located in a,

800
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,190
in a town called lock tour B.

801
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:17,930
And you can see it rising up in the
midst of modern law tour. Be here.

802
00:51:17,931 --> 00:51:22,790
It dates we believe to seven
to eight, two, seven, two,

803
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:23,600
six B,

804
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:28,600
c a and thus in the age of Augustus and
celebrates quite specifically Augustus.

805
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:34,080
And the inscription tells us this Augustus
is subjugation of 44 Alpine tribes.

806
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,460
Uh,
in this particular part of the world,

807
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:41,420
a monument put up to honor
that victory of Augustus.

808
00:51:41,421 --> 00:51:44,000
So essentially a trophy monument.

809
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:47,720
You can see that it is only
partially preserved. Uh,

810
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:51,170
and I show you here a view of,
uh,

811
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:55,880
it down the street of the,
the modern street as it looks today,

812
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,120
uh, where you can see it
rising up over that street.

813
00:51:59,121 --> 00:52:00,560
And if you look very carefully,

814
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:04,610
you will see that the stone that
the structure is made out of,

815
00:52:04,611 --> 00:52:06,260
it's very similar,
in fact,

816
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:10,460
exactly the same as the stone
used for the local houses. Now,

817
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:14,930
this is very interesting because
what the monument, uh, did not look,

818
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:19,230
even though it's only partially preserve
today, even less of it was preserved, uh,

819
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:24,740
earlier on.
And it was in the 1930s that an American,

820
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:30,130
a patron decided that he
wanted to reconstruct the
as best that could be done,

821
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:36,730
the trophy monument at La Torre B
because there was recognition that the

822
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:38,420
monument at La Torre be,

823
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:42,560
had served as a quarry essentially
for the local inhabitants.

824
00:52:42,561 --> 00:52:47,561
And the over the years they had been
taking the stone from the victory monument

825
00:52:48,021 --> 00:52:49,610
of Augustus and using it.

826
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:53,180
That's why it's the same stone
using it in their houses. Uh,

827
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,260
and this American wanted to
rectify it. So he gay, he, he,

828
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:01,790
he donated the funds, uh,
that enabled them to take,

829
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:05,860
to tear down, to demolish 32 houses, uh,

830
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:10,400
and come up with 3000 fragments
from the Victory Monument,

831
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:12,290
the trophy at lock to our B,

832
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:16,310
and reconstruct it as best as
they could from those fragments.

833
00:53:16,311 --> 00:53:20,420
And that's what you see there. Now,
here's a view of it as it looks today, uh,

834
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,650
as well as a model.

835
00:53:21,651 --> 00:53:24,620
And what you can see from both of these
is not only the inscription and the

836
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:29,400
trophy in relief on this side that
mentions the 44 Alpine tribes,

837
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:34,380
but the monument itself and this model
makes it very clear what the general form

838
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:38,520
was, a round structure with
columns and circling it on a base.

839
00:53:38,521 --> 00:53:43,521
And then the whole thing placed on a
very large and tall pedestal with a

840
00:53:43,531 --> 00:53:47,970
pyramidal element at the top and a
crowning statue at the very apex.

841
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:52,970
This scheme of placing a rotunda on top
of a tall base is something that we have

842
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:58,701
seen as characteristic of funerary
architecture from the age of Augustus.

843
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:03,100
Think of the Tomb of Cecilia
Patella for example. Uh,

844
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,950
and it is that scheme that is used here.

845
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:09,951
So another example of this
interchangeability of form
that a form that was used

846
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:15,081
for a mausoleum architecture now used a
for a trophy monument of the same time,

847
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,380
uh,
but in a different part of the world.

848
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:24,420
The model also shows you that there
were niches around the, uh, central,

849
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:28,200
uh, circular structure. Uh, those were,

850
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:33,090
those had in them portraits of Augustus,
his lieutenants who have, who helped him,

851
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:36,270
uh,
placate this particular part of the world.

852
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,260
And then at the top of the step
pyramidal structure, a portrait,

853
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:45,270
a bronze statue of the
emperor Augustus himself.

854
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,630
Here's a detail of a law of law.

855
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:53,160
The victory monument at La Torre
be with all of those stones, uh,

856
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:58,560
from the, from those 32 demolished
houses. Reused here to reconstruct it.

857
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,510
We do, there is concrete used here, but
it's a Gallo Roman form of concrete.

858
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:08,300
You'll see in ward Perkins that he refers
to this work as putty at the high p e

859
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:13,200
t I t a p p a r e I l putty at Belle vie,

860
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:18,470
which is a essentially a gala Roman
version of concrete construction with,

861
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,470
with a stone facing that
little little work, you know,

862
00:55:22,471 --> 00:55:26,250
little pieces of stone that are very
similar to opus and cared them but

863
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:29,370
different enough, uh, and,
and distinctively French,

864
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:34,400
enough to be called the putty
at Belle vie the victories.

865
00:55:34,681 --> 00:55:39,150
Augustus is victories and pacification
of this part of the world also led to the

866
00:55:39,151 --> 00:55:40,740
construction of arches.

867
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:46,080
And I want to turn to a couple of
those now. Uh, the arch at Sephora,

868
00:55:46,081 --> 00:55:49,920
me also in the south of
France, you see it here. Uh,

869
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:53,610
it dates to around 20 BC.
Uh,

870
00:55:53,611 --> 00:55:58,130
and it probably served as both an arch
in honor of these victories that Augustus

871
00:55:58,131 --> 00:56:02,340
celebrated here, but also as a gateway
into the city. It's very simple.

872
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:06,750
It looks very much like we've come to
know Augustan arches are with a single RQ

873
00:56:06,751 --> 00:56:08,530
weighted bay in the center,
uh,

874
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:13,500
columns in this case on two separate
bases, fluted columns there.

875
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:16,710
The capitals are not preserved so that
we don't know if they were Corinthian,

876
00:56:16,711 --> 00:56:18,240
but they were probably Corinthian,

877
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,390
a very elaborate Archibold as you can
see here with the coffee [inaudible]

878
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:23,830
extremely preserved.

879
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,460
And then if you look very
closely at the decoration,

880
00:56:27,461 --> 00:56:30,640
you see a couple of figures standing
on either side. These are actually,

881
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:34,570
they're headless now, but they're
actually figures of captives, of captives,

882
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:35,740
of local captives.

883
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,940
To make reference again to the
fact that this was military,

884
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:41,600
a military operation,
uh,

885
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:46,710
that allowed Augustus to take over these
to subjugate these 44 Alpine tribes.

886
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:50,920
Uh, and, and others in this
particular area, uh, and that,

887
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:53,720
that subjugation is referred to here,
uh,

888
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:57,760
by the representation of
those captured barbarians.

889
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:01,930
A much more important and more
interesting arch is this one a,

890
00:57:01,931 --> 00:57:05,280
it's an arch that is located in um,

891
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:08,710
oh longish back to a home
also in the south of France.

892
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,910
The date of this monument
is very controversial and
I think by looking at the

893
00:57:12,911 --> 00:57:14,530
general view and also a detail,

894
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:19,060
you can see why it is a triple bade
arch with a large central arch,

895
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:23,110
two smaller ones on either side
with columns on tall basis,

896
00:57:23,111 --> 00:57:25,000
Corinthian columns in between them.

897
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:30,160
You can see that the central element with
its pediment projects into the viewer

898
00:57:30,161 --> 00:57:33,160
space. You can also see that the, uh,

899
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:38,080
every inch of space is completely covered
with decoration, figural decoration,

900
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:41,070
piles of arms and armor from the enemy.
Uh,

901
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:44,890
so much show that it tends
to dematerialize the arch.

902
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:48,280
These are all characteristics
of later Roman architecture.

903
00:57:48,281 --> 00:57:52,000
Think the arches Septum you severity,
which I'll show you again in a moment,

904
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:57,150
which has led some scholars to date
this as late as a d 200 or 82 oh three,

905
00:57:57,251 --> 00:58:01,810
two oh four at the same time as
the arch of Septimius severities.

906
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,640
And it was long thought to be that also
because no one could conceive that this

907
00:58:06,641 --> 00:58:11,410
idea of the triple bait arch could turn
up in let's say Augustan or Tiberian,

908
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,790
uh, France goal, uh,

909
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,750
at before it turned up in Rome.

910
00:58:16,751 --> 00:58:20,650
So getting back to that issue of race
on several occasions about center and

911
00:58:20,651 --> 00:58:24,560
periphery, does everything flow from
the center or are sometimes or forms,

912
00:58:24,561 --> 00:58:28,420
sometimes developed in the periphery
and then make their way back into the

913
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:32,440
center is a, an age old and very
interesting question to ask.

914
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:35,830
But I think you can see
the reasons why a scholars,

915
00:58:35,831 --> 00:58:40,410
some scholars have dated
this to the seven period. Uh,

916
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,670
here's the view and I'll say
more about that in a moment.

917
00:58:42,671 --> 00:58:46,690
Have you here with a another
view showing an engraving,

918
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:50,990
giving you a sense of the
kind of sculptural decoration
that would have been, uh,

919
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:54,700
placed at the top, the
omnipresent, a figure in a chariot,

920
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,310
a four horse or warm in this case, four
horse, I think in this case, chariot. Uh,

921
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,780
and then, uh, figures of captured,

922
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,470
captured Indivi captured barbarians,
uh,

923
00:59:05,471 --> 00:59:08,860
as well as trophies on the apex.

924
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,950
Here's our comparison
with the arch of CEP.

925
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,960
Timmy is severities and the Roman forum.
And I think you can see the close,

926
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:17,230
the close association between the two,
the triple bay,

927
00:59:17,231 --> 00:59:19,850
the profusion of Decoration,
uh,

928
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:23,720
that we see in the arch on
the lefthand side as well.

929
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:26,620
Here's a detail of the attic,
uh,

930
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:31,280
which shows you an interesting battle
scene where the figures are very heavily

931
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:34,580
outlined as you can see
here, which is unusual. Uh,

932
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:37,790
scholars have suggested,
and I think correctly,

933
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,070
that the reason for that is that these,

934
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,340
these artists and this part of a goal,

935
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:48,230
we're probably working from copy books or
his copy scrolls, I guess I should say,

936
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,590
a drawings, drawings,
uh, of battle scenes,

937
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:54,280
typical Greco Roman battle scenes,
uh,

938
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,630
that they could use
Hellenistic battle scenes,

939
00:59:56,631 --> 01:00:01,190
perhaps early Roman battle scenes
that Wa that they copied and they,

940
01:00:01,191 --> 01:00:05,180
these were drawings and consequently
they copied them quite, quite,

941
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:10,310
quite exactly. Uh, by showing
the outlines, uh, around
the figures. It's one,

942
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:11,300
it's a speculation,

943
01:00:11,301 --> 01:00:16,100
but I think it's interesting speculation
in this very frenzied battle scene from

944
01:00:16,101 --> 01:00:19,550
the upper most part with regard
to the date of this monument,

945
01:00:19,551 --> 01:00:23,270
though the plot thickens,
uh, one other detail. If you
look at the side of the art,

946
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:27,140
you see a,
an RQ weighted element inside.

947
01:00:27,141 --> 01:00:31,460
You can barely see the
triangular pediment, but
there's an occupation inside a,

948
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,690
an unbroken,
a complete triangular pediment.

949
01:00:35,691 --> 01:00:39,860
So that scheme of placing the occupation
and also tends to be a late feature.

950
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:40,903
However,

951
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:45,020
scholars who have spent a lot of time
looking at the sculptural decoration of

952
01:00:45,021 --> 01:00:49,280
this monument, of the piles of arms and
armor, uh, that when finds there, uh,

953
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:53,240
which by the way includes piles of
arms and armor from a naval victory,

954
01:00:53,241 --> 01:00:57,650
which is interesting as well as piles of
armor arms and armor from victories on

955
01:00:57,651 --> 01:00:58,071
land,

956
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:02,780
which has made some scholars speculate
that this refers to a kind of generic

957
01:01:02,781 --> 01:01:05,360
victory to victory on land and sea,
uh,

958
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:10,390
by whoever this honored but very
interesting is the fact that there is a,

959
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:15,540
a, a, um, some, some, uh,
there is one armament, uh,

960
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:20,510
that is inscribed with the name
sock grow. We're sac R o. V.

961
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:23,390
I R. SOC grow. We're a soccer. We are,

962
01:01:23,391 --> 01:01:26,690
we know was someone who
is living and active, uh,

963
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,970
in the time of Tiberius.

964
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:34,210
He led a revolt in this part of a gall
in Aidy 21 against the local Roman

965
01:01:36,231 --> 01:01:39,920
governor and his excessive
taxes. Uh, and uh,

966
01:01:39,921 --> 01:01:44,180
it has been speculated that that Sacro
we're who is mentioned here is that very

967
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:48,590
same soccer. We're, uh, and that
it is very conceivable conceivable,

968
01:01:48,591 --> 01:01:52,190
therefore, that this arch was put
up in the time of tybee areas.

969
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:56,450
I've given you a date of Aidy 25.
I believe that myself,

970
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,750
although it does defy,
you know,

971
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:02,720
define imagination to a certain extent
to think of an arch with all of these

972
01:02:02,721 --> 01:02:07,721
features that I've described today as
early in the south of France as a d 25.

973
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:11,390
But it's something for you to think about
in terms of our whole question of the

974
01:02:11,391 --> 01:02:16,340
relationship between a periphery
and, um, center and periphery.

975
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:20,880
I want to show you the last
group relatively quickly. Uh,

976
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:25,710
just to dip into a Istria is I said
I would to the upper most part of,

977
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:29,640
uh, of what is today Croatia
to look at one more arch, uh,

978
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:33,480
in a different part of the Roman world.
But during the same period,

979
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:37,320
the end of the first
century BC and arch at Polo,

980
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:42,500
I show you the location here of
a polo or pula at the very upper,

981
01:02:43,231 --> 01:02:47,030
most part of Croatia. Very
close. Exactly at the Emmy's.

982
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,340
Just when I went there.
Once you're literally,

983
01:02:50,341 --> 01:02:53,820
you go all across the border and
there you are, uh, the Italian border,

984
01:02:53,821 --> 01:02:58,360
you're in Pola and you see the rest of
Croatia here with the other great, uh,

985
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:01,230
site of Split, which we'll
look at next time. Uh,

986
01:03:01,231 --> 01:03:04,320
and of course the famous city
of Dubrovnik at the base,

987
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,480
you see the arch extremely well preserved.
Uh, another typical Augustan arch,

988
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:14,460
single Bayed, uh, two columns,
Corinthian order on a shared base.

989
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:18,330
Uh, if you look at the attic, the attic
is interesting. Local stone. Once again,

990
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:21,810
look at the attic, you'll see bases
that are inscribed at the top.

991
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,590
And those bases are very helpful in
terms of telling us something quite

992
01:03:25,591 --> 01:03:30,090
extraordinary. And that is that this arch
was put up by a woman we know her name.

993
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:34,650
Salave'A Postuma, Salvia
Postuma, s a l V. I,

994
01:03:34,651 --> 01:03:36,300
a p. O. S t, u, m,

995
01:03:36,301 --> 01:03:41,301
a Salvia Postuma who put this monument
up to three male members of her family

996
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:46,350
who were involved in military
operations at this particular time, uh,

997
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:49,800
died. Uh, and then we're
honored by this monument.

998
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:55,850
I show you a reconstruction of what the
upper most part probably looked like

999
01:03:56,191 --> 01:03:59,220
when there were statues of those
three male members of the family,

1000
01:03:59,221 --> 01:04:01,530
possibly in their military costumes.

1001
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:04,950
Although we don't know for sure
at the apex of the structure.

1002
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:09,180
Here's a detail of it. Also over here
where you see victories in the spandrels,

1003
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:13,180
you see the Corinthian capitals,
you see cupid's carrying garlands,

1004
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:17,520
all the kinds of decoration you see some
a Qantas leaves very much like those in

1005
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:18,354
the our pockets,

1006
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:23,510
all the kinds of decoration that have
been transported from Rome to be used,

1007
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,600
uh, in, uh,

1008
01:04:24,601 --> 01:04:29,600
in this case in the north
of former Yugoslavia. Uh,

1009
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,930
for this arch we see the Corinthian
capitals. Here we see the victories.

1010
01:04:33,931 --> 01:04:37,740
Here we see the cupids with
the garlands over there,

1011
01:04:37,741 --> 01:04:40,350
we see a chariot scene here.

1012
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:44,130
Cherry had seen as interesting
reference to the race of life. Uh,

1013
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:48,930
it referenced a victory and Athletic
Competition as well as victory,

1014
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:53,590
uh, over, oh, you see the Ukrainian, they
are also clearly another touch of, uh,

1015
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:56,610
roam of the RF pockets.
But this, this interesting,

1016
01:04:56,611 --> 01:04:57,990
we've seen this throughout the semester.

1017
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,920
The close correlation in the minds of
the Romans between victory in battle,

1018
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:06,790
victory in athletic competition,
uh, victory in the hunt, uh,

1019
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,670
and also victory over death.

1020
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:12,360
And all of that comes together
well in the our cheer.

1021
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:17,390
If you look up into the vault, it's very
well preserved. And the center, uh, a,

1022
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,430
a representation of an eagle with
a serpent holding a serpent, a,

1023
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:25,390
this is probably a reference
to death and rebirth.

1024
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,400
And remember this is Augustan and date,

1025
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:30,610
so it predates the vault of
the arch of Titus in Rome.

1026
01:05:30,611 --> 01:05:32,590
But this whole idea of placing the vault,

1027
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:35,920
a scene of death and rebirth leads,

1028
01:05:35,921 --> 01:05:39,520
ultimately I think to that
divinization scene of Titus,

1029
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:44,280
I want to take you very
quickly, uh, to show you a,

1030
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:48,570
an important tower tomb in
the city of San High. Me.

1031
01:05:48,571 --> 01:05:52,960
We're back in the south of France. Samurai
me, the ancient glom them g, L A,N ,

1032
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:57,730
u m ancient Glonass, which was a
very highly developed town, uh,

1033
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:02,290
also in the Greek period. So here we
see some overlay. We have local, local,

1034
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:06,880
local, Celtic, custom, uh, the
Greeks were, were infiltrated here.

1035
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:07,900
Then the Romans,

1036
01:06:07,901 --> 01:06:12,070
all of that piled one on top of another
to make a very distinctive city.

1037
01:06:12,071 --> 01:06:16,300
You can also see from the remains that
were extensive remains at them more than

1038
01:06:16,301 --> 01:06:17,900
most of these ancient,
uh,

1039
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:22,950
French towns where you can see Babs and
temples and at parts of houses and Paris

1040
01:06:24,641 --> 01:06:29,530
styles and so on, quite well
preserved. I show you here for example,

1041
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:34,580
some honorific basis as an altars and
overhear a hypo cost from one of the

1042
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:35,884
baths,
uh,

1043
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:40,150
looking very much like a hyper cost
we would see in Pompei of like date.

1044
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:43,690
I also want to mention in case any of
you are making your way to the south of

1045
01:06:43,691 --> 01:06:47,140
France anytime soon.
It is located in the city of Glonass,

1046
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,530
located very close to the
wonderful town of Lebo. In fact,

1047
01:06:50,531 --> 01:06:54,520
blonde is in the shadow of Lebo that
lies in the mountains on the top,

1048
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,520
fabulous place to just wanted
nothing to do with Roman antiquity,

1049
01:06:57,521 --> 01:07:01,660
but just a great place to wander. As you
can see here in every one of the caves.

1050
01:07:01,661 --> 01:07:04,810
And there are a lot of them
have a places for wine tasting.

1051
01:07:04,811 --> 01:07:09,310
So it's a fun place to go. Here are the
two monuments we saw the arch already.

1052
01:07:09,311 --> 01:07:13,300
This is the tower tomb. These are
referred to by the locals as liaison,

1053
01:07:13,301 --> 01:07:18,280
teak liaison teak, the arch, the
antiquities, the arch, and the tower tomb.

1054
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,650
And the fact that they
are in close proximity.

1055
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:22,810
I mentioned the arch may
have well been a city gate.

1056
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:27,640
The Romans always buried their dead
outside the city gate, city gate cemetery,

1057
01:07:27,641 --> 01:07:32,590
right outside extremely WellPreserved
tower tomb tower to him because it's

1058
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:34,120
taller than it is wide.

1059
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:38,950
This area of of France is particularly
famous because of Vincent Van Gogh.

1060
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:39,813
Once again,

1061
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:44,290
then go spend his last
years in an insane asylum.

1062
01:07:44,291 --> 01:07:48,580
As many of you may know in satisfy me,
this insane asylum, which you can see,

1063
01:07:48,581 --> 01:07:52,660
this is a van Gogh painting of that asylum
in which he spent those last days is

1064
01:07:52,661 --> 01:07:56,020
located exactly across the
street from liaison teak.

1065
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,000
So if you make the pilgrimage,
they are,

1066
01:07:58,001 --> 01:08:00,700
I hope you'll make the pilgrimage
not only to see van Gogh,

1067
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:03,940
but I hope that your aficionados,
and now I'm in fact,

1068
01:08:03,941 --> 01:08:07,560
I hope that you go to see liaison
teak and then also go to see, uh,

1069
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,040
the asylum of Van Gogh.

1070
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:14,280
Here's the monument of the Giulia Julie
attack a tower tomb that was put up in a

1071
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:20,090
Samurai meet in 30 to 20 BC. Uh, so, uh,

1072
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:21,930
a sort of the cusp,
the,

1073
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:26,200
this late says area and into the
Augustine period and we think the Julie

1074
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:31,300
represented here are in fact veterans of
Julius Caesar's Army who have taken his

1075
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:35,750
name, Julius Caesar. All of his
battle, you know, is, is great. Uh,

1076
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:40,450
military exploits in goal, uh,
referred to here by his veterans, uh,

1077
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:41,090
who,
uh,

1078
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:46,090
have taken his name and have settled
here on land that they were given in a,

1079
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:49,580
in reward for their good work.
Again, it's a tower tomb,

1080
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:52,250
a taller than it is wide.
A stepped base,

1081
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:57,280
a Sokal with sculptural figural
freeze a quadra fronds up here,

1082
01:08:57,291 --> 01:09:01,850
Corinthian columns, and then at
the very apex [inaudible] loss, uh,

1083
01:09:01,851 --> 01:09:05,200
that has a two statues inside that Bolus.

1084
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:08,750
This is pretty much the best
preserved Rome and tomb that we have.

1085
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:11,300
Everything is intact here.
We believe,

1086
01:09:11,301 --> 01:09:15,230
remember I mentioned way at the beginning
that we think that a lot of these

1087
01:09:15,231 --> 01:09:16,990
Roman ideas came,
uh,

1088
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:21,170
to the south of France via north Italy
and we think this was indeed the case.

1089
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:22,580
North Italy in north Italy.

1090
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:26,540
We know they put up a lot of these tower
tombs and we think it's likely that

1091
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:31,130
this sort of thing imitates some of
those tower tombs in the north of Italy.

1092
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:36,310
I show you a detail of two of the
figural freezes from the Sokal of the

1093
01:09:36,741 --> 01:09:37,221
monument,

1094
01:09:37,221 --> 01:09:40,940
which you can see represent battle
scenes and you can also see those deep

1095
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:44,030
outlines just as we
saw at the orange arch,

1096
01:09:44,031 --> 01:09:48,560
which once again suggest to us that
these artists are looking at drawings of

1097
01:09:48,561 --> 01:09:52,610
this kind of thing that come from the
Greco Roman world and they are copying

1098
01:09:52,611 --> 01:09:55,130
what they see.
I don't have time to go into it here.

1099
01:09:55,131 --> 01:09:58,640
But if you look with care at some of
these, when you're studying this monument,

1100
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:02,390
you will see the, you will see
that there are some figures, well,

1101
01:10:02,391 --> 01:10:06,570
for the most part, it makes sense. There
are some figures in this crowded seen, uh,

1102
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:09,530
that don't work. For
example, here's a figure, uh,

1103
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:11,930
on the ground with his
shield above his head,

1104
01:10:11,931 --> 01:10:15,260
trying to protect himself
obviously from a combatant,

1105
01:10:15,261 --> 01:10:16,970
but there is no combatant there.

1106
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:20,570
And that seems to underscore again
that they are using copybooks books,

1107
01:10:20,571 --> 01:10:23,390
that they're looking at these things
that they're copying what they like.

1108
01:10:23,391 --> 01:10:24,790
They're copying the
scene for the most part,

1109
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,490
throwing in some other figures that they
like that don't sometimes don't even

1110
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:29,840
make any sense.

1111
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:33,650
The detail up here of the thaw
loss with the two statues.

1112
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,240
I spent about six weeks at
this monument at one point, uh,

1113
01:10:38,241 --> 01:10:43,100
and in that area at south by me and a
little, um, little place near, near,

1114
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,330
near the liaison teak.

1115
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:48,980
And I remember when I was there that
there was this wonderful, um, uh,

1116
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:53,210
headline in the local newspaper that
said it was a huge storm with lightening

1117
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:56,030
and so on. And the next morning
there was a headline that said,

1118
01:10:56,031 --> 01:10:58,430
has Gaius lost his head,
uh,

1119
01:10:58,431 --> 01:11:01,310
because the locals want to
believe that this is a monument,

1120
01:11:01,311 --> 01:11:04,460
not have local army veterans,
but of the Augusta and family.

1121
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:08,180
And that the two figures that the upper
most part were Gaius and Lucia sees,

1122
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:12,650
well, they were not Gaius
and Lucius Caesar, uh, they
were local veterans, but, uh,

1123
01:11:12,651 --> 01:11:15,930
nonetheless less the
myth has continued on.

1124
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:21,320
And I want to show you lastly for just
a minute or so that remains to try to

1125
01:11:21,331 --> 01:11:25,860
underscore that point that the north of
Italy may have been a source for this

1126
01:11:25,861 --> 01:11:29,750
kind of tower two that
we see at sal by me, uh,

1127
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,480
just by showing you one example,
it's by no means exactly the same,

1128
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:35,550
but it's the best that I can do,
uh,

1129
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:38,460
because most of these tower
tombs no longer survive.

1130
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,490
But it is a thorough
loss tomb, uh, from, uh,

1131
01:11:41,491 --> 01:11:46,440
Aquileia and the north of Italy. The
dates to the early Augustan period. Uh,

1132
01:11:46,441 --> 01:11:51,441
and you can see that it has a large base
with a figural sculptural decoration

1133
01:11:52,411 --> 01:11:57,100
here. This isles of the blessed kind of
imagery with a full loss at the top, uh,

1134
01:11:57,101 --> 01:12:01,390
that includes a statue and
then a pyramidal roof, uh,

1135
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:05,280
with a decorative element
at the upper most part. Uh,

1136
01:12:05,281 --> 01:12:09,870
and then as you can see,
some lions statues, uh, out
in front to guard. That too,

1137
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,200
it's not by no means the same
thing as what I've shown you,

1138
01:12:13,201 --> 01:12:17,130
but it gives you is an idea that these
kinds of throw loss tombs on decorated

1139
01:12:17,131 --> 01:12:20,490
basis, uh, were popular
in the north of Italy.

1140
01:12:20,491 --> 01:12:25,491
And the idea may have made its way to
the south of France via these north

1141
01:12:26,881 --> 01:12:30,460
Italian examples. And lastly, uh,

1142
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:35,460
just one last monument
because we've tended to be
looking at tombs in isolation,

1143
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:40,050
individual tumors rather than tune complex
complexes because it's the individual

1144
01:12:40,051 --> 01:12:43,000
tombs and not the complexes
themselves that are well preserved.

1145
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,160
But I want to show you one excellent
example from the north of Italy.

1146
01:12:47,161 --> 01:12:51,540
Again from this wonderful town called
upper layer and early Augustan, uh,

1147
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:52,403
set of,

1148
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:57,390
of alter tombs that are still preserved
in the actual original burial plots,

1149
01:12:57,391 --> 01:13:00,720
which gives you a very good idea of what
one of these plots would have looked

1150
01:13:00,721 --> 01:13:04,200
like. These are of course not
monumental tombs, but small, uh,

1151
01:13:04,201 --> 01:13:08,630
two markers in the shapes of altars.
Uh, and then other smaller, uh,

1152
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:11,760
smaller items as you
can see very well here,

1153
01:13:11,761 --> 01:13:16,680
but it shows you the way in which the
Romans had the justice one has today a

1154
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:18,780
these burial plots for the family,

1155
01:13:18,781 --> 01:13:23,160
these family burial plots that have
individual markers of different family

1156
01:13:23,161 --> 01:13:28,161
members in them and then has a kind
of a stone fence that in circles and

1157
01:13:29,311 --> 01:13:33,450
protects their plot. And you can
see that stone fence down here,

1158
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:37,890
a stone fence that should immediately
remind you of some of the stone fences

1159
01:13:37,891 --> 01:13:41,730
that we saw in second style
Roman wall painting, for example,

1160
01:13:41,731 --> 01:13:45,960
that were omnipresent and second
style Roman wall painting.

1161
01:13:45,961 --> 01:13:49,740
And the last point I'll make today
is just to underscore once again,

1162
01:13:49,741 --> 01:13:53,130
I think there were lots of examples of
it today, the [inaudible], for example,

1163
01:13:53,131 --> 01:13:57,990
to throw loss, uh, and these fences as
well as the theatrical architecture.

1164
01:13:57,991 --> 01:14:00,780
We saw it all wrong. That
underscore, once again,

1165
01:14:00,781 --> 01:14:05,190
the closest association between
architecture and painting, uh,

1166
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:06,870
from the republic,
uh,

1167
01:14:06,871 --> 01:14:11,070
all the way up to the
Augustan age and still beyond.

1168
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:12,630
Thank you all.
