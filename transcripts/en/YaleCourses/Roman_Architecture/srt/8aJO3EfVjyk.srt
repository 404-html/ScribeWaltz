1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:01,950
Good morning.

2
00:00:01,951 --> 00:00:06,951
All the title of today's lecture is the
Roman way of life and death at Ostia,

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,710
the port of Rome.
On Tuesday,

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,220
we spoke about architecture
under the emperor Hadrian,

5
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:20,570
the extraordinary Emperor Hadrian.
Uh,

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,580
we talked about the buildings that he
commissioned and some of which he also had

7
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:30,240
a hand in designing since,
as we mentioned, he was an
amateur architect himself.

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,980
Uh, we spoke about that Greek
import, the temple of Venus in Roma,

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,840
and also about the two major
commissions during his principles,

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,340
the Pantheon in Rome and
Hadrian's villa at Tivoli,

11
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,600
the main takeaway point,

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,090
visa vi both of these buildings and you
see them once again now on the screen at

13
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:52,520
left and right,
uh,

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,300
is that Hadrian followed the
lead of Trajan before him. Uh,

15
00:00:57,301 --> 00:01:02,301
what Trajan had done and Apollo Doris
of Damascus had done in the forum of

16
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,440
Trajan and in the markets of Trajan.

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,040
And that is to combine in
one building complex, uh,

18
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:13,041
both the traditional and the innovative
strands of Roman architecture.

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,090
Uh, the traditional that goes back to
Greek and a trust can architecture and is

20
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:22,650
marked by the traditional elements that
traditional vocabulary of architecture,

21
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:26,460
namely columns and walls and
the roofs that they support.

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,520
And then more innovative
Roman architecture,

23
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:32,860
which is predicated on
concrete construction, uh,

24
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:37,590
faced with a variety of materials from
stone to what we'll see today is the

25
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:41,010
ascendance of brick, uh,
as a facing, which began,

26
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:45,630
as you'll recall after the fire
in [inaudible] 64 in Rome. Again,

27
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:49,480
looking at these two buildings
as examples of what Hadrian, uh,

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,690
he and his architects,
uh, tried to do, uh,

29
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:57,090
the Pantheon you'll recall on
the left has a traditional porch,

30
00:01:57,091 --> 00:02:02,091
the porch that looks very much like a
typical Greek trust skin or Roman temple,

31
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,720
but then at a revolutionary body
when you walk inside the building,

32
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:07,800
a revolutionary,

33
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,760
a cylindrical drum and hemispherical dome.

34
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,650
And then with regard to the,
uh, Hadrian's villa at Tivoli,

35
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,090
I show you a view of the Chronopolis
and you'll recall that the CANopen makes

36
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:25,170
use of columnar architecture.
There are columns that border, uh,

37
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,210
one end of the pool,

38
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,500
although they are columns with a twist
because you can see they support a

39
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:33,540
straight and an RQ weighted lintel,

40
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:37,590
which we saw in second style Roman
wall painting in painting. Uh,

41
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,020
and then eventually it
begins to infiltrate.

42
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:43,140
Built architecture comes
to the fore under Hadrian.

43
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,430
So that's a playing around with those
lintels in a way you wouldn't have seen in

44
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:48,930
Greek and a trust can architecture,

45
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:53,580
but still realize in the main on the
traditional vocabulary of architecture.

46
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,820
But then you'll recall on the
other end of the pool, uh,

47
00:02:56,821 --> 00:03:00,010
a building that was meant
to conjure up the, uh,

48
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:04,240
the Sarah p m in the temple of is in,
uh,

49
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,130
CANopen in Egypt, but that was made
out of concrete construction. Uh,

50
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:11,440
and that had a segment,
a dome,

51
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,460
a kind of Pumpkin dome that we
believe that Hadrian designed himself.

52
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:20,461
So this extraordinary combination
of traditional and innovative Roman

53
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:25,040
architecture that we see the hallmark
of Hadrian Anik architecture, uh,

54
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,060
and a gift that he gave to the
future evolution of architecture.

55
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,920
The other major contribution of the
Hadrian panic period that Hadrian himself

56
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:40,921
had less to do with because it was already
bubbling up after the fire and had 64

57
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,060
a is this is the move that we're going
to see today toward multistory housing.

58
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:52,270
We saw that begin already at the last
gasp of Pompeii and Herculaneum you'll

59
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:56,470
remember after the earthquake
of 62 and before the, uh,

60
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,110
the eruption of Vesuvius,

61
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,550
the Pompei ions and the those who
lived in Herculaneum began to build to,

62
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:08,480
began to add additional stories to
their residential structures usually.

63
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,730
And that meant for the most part,

64
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:13,240
a second story being added to
their residential structures,

65
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:17,020
but they never went beyond that.
What we see beginning to happen,

66
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,300
especially under Hadrian is the ae an
increased tastes for multistory buildings,

67
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,150
a multistory domiciles, but
multistory residences, uh,

68
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,910
that had more than two stories,

69
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:35,500
even up to as many as five stories
essentially apartment houses.

70
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,770
And our best example for such apartment
houses are in the city of Ostia,

71
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:42,310
the port city of Rome.

72
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,580
And it's therefore to the
city of Australia that we
are going to turn to today.

73
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:48,101
And in fact,

74
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:52,740
we will spend the entire lecture on the
city of Ostia because like Pompei and

75
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,520
Herculaneum before it, uh, especially
like palm pay, uh, we have,

76
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:57,791
uh,

77
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:02,620
an extraordinary array of not only
private domiciles but also public

78
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:07,150
architecture from the city of Osteo that
gives us an outstanding sense of what

79
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:09,340
the city looked like in antiquity.

80
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,910
I show you a plan of Ostia in its heyday.

81
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,770
You'll remember that the city was
actually founded very early on, uh,

82
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:22,090
at the very beginning of the semester.
We looked at the town plan of Ostia,

83
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,440
which data to the mid fourth century BC,
around 350 BC.

84
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,920
And you'll recall, and I'll remind
you of this plan in a moment. Uh,

85
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:34,921
you'll recall that it was founded as
it was actually Rome's first colony.

86
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,890
Uh, although it was a colony
in Italy, obviously night,
not outside the main land,

87
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,730
but it's first colony in Italy or
anywhere for that matter. Uh, and uh,

88
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,570
it was founded as so many of these
first colonies were as a military camp.

89
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,810
It was laid out as a costume,
as you'll recall.

90
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,470
And that costs from a one
can see in the very center.

91
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:59,680
I'm going to show you a better view of
this from Ward Perkins in a moment, uh,

92
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,080
but you can see that that
colonel, uh, of the, uh,

93
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:06,860
the costume plan or right here
in the center of this plan,

94
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:11,720
but what this plan shows you is the way
in which the city grew over time. Again,

95
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:15,560
it began in the republic. It continued
to be developed during the republic.

96
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:17,800
It was under Augustus
that some new buildings,

97
00:06:17,801 --> 00:06:22,760
some public buildings were added to
the locale, uh, including the theater.

98
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:26,000
And we're going to look at the
theater today. Uh, and then, uh,

99
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,150
ports were added as you'll remember.
And I'll review that momentarily.

100
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:31,220
Ports were added at Portas,
uh,

101
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,040
by Claudius and also by Trajan. And, uh,

102
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,910
it was after the port of Trajan that the
city really began to take off in terms

103
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:45,911
of its commercial activity and much of
the building that we see in the city as

104
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,680
well as it looks still today,

105
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,920
a belongs to the Adriatic period and into
the time of the successors of Hadrian,

106
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:57,620
the so called and to nine
emperors whom will also be,

107
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:02,621
who's architecture will also be studying
this semester a while this plan is on

108
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:07,700
the screen. Let me just point
out the location of Rome.

109
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,350
The Arrow points this way.

110
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:14,530
The so called via osteon say the root
the street that leads from Rome to Ostia,

111
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,970
the via osteon say, and actually
the city road becomes the town,

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,910
the, uh, the, uh, country road.

113
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,200
The country thoroughfare becomes the
city street, the main city street,

114
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,100
the a deck humanness of the city of Ostia.
Uh,

115
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,030
you can also see in
this, in this plan, uh,

116
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:38,990
the location of a place called Easel,
a Socra up there,

117
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,860
which we will see was the
main cemetery for Osteo. Yes,

118
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:46,400
there are tombs outside the city walls,
uh,

119
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:48,110
also elsewhere in the city.

120
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:52,110
But our most best preserve tombs are
from this area called Easel a Sabra.

121
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:56,240
And I'll show that to you also today.
And here you can see the Tiber river,

122
00:07:56,241 --> 00:08:01,241
the Tevere of the Tiber River
wending its way from Rome to osteon.

123
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,270
It is of course along the Tiber that we'll
see warehouses were located and where

124
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:10,271
the ships I went back and forth to export
or import material pro products from

125
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,330
Rome to Ostia. And back
again. We talked about again,

126
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,760
we talked about the
building of ports at Ostia.

127
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:24,540
We talked especially about the port,
the Claudius commissioned at Portas. Uh,

128
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,890
and I remind you of it on the
back of a neurone, one coin,

129
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:30,620
a coin of Nero adverse
with neuros portrait,

130
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:35,330
reverse representing that Claudia
and port. And we see it there.

131
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:37,460
You'll remember it had
curved break waters,

132
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:42,200
which you can see in that coin depiction,
uh, and uh, a river God at the bottom,

133
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:46,760
boats in the center as well
as the lighthouse. We see
all of that on the coin.

134
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:50,690
And you'll remember that the breakwaters
we're made up of columns that partook

135
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,520
of that rustication masonry,

136
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,220
that Claudius so favored down here.

137
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,280
I painting that I've shown you before,
that now is on,

138
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,920
that is on the walls
of the Vatican in Rome,

139
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:06,921
the Vatican museums in Rome where you
can see Claudia says port this cr,

140
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,850
it's curved breakwaters and
it's light house over here. Uh,

141
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,840
and then the port that was added by
Trajan during his reign, a multi-sided,

142
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,510
uh, additional port right
here. And it was again,

143
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:21,180
the construction of that particular port.
Uh,

144
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,460
that really brought commerce even
more. I mean, it had been used,

145
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,810
this area had been used since
the mid fourth century BC,

146
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,790
but it begins to really take off.

147
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,360
There's a real efflorescence
during this period. And, uh,

148
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,930
it is therefore not surprising
that with commerce booming,

149
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,900
there was more need for residential,

150
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,510
residential architecture
for those who live there,

151
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:47,430
for the traders and so on and so forth
who lived there. Uh, and we see this, um,

152
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,310
this,
uh,

153
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:53,310
the building of not only civic buildings
but especially of private domiciles

154
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,460
begins to move very rapidly.

155
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,720
A pace of the city becomes more crowded
and there becomes this need to build up

156
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:05,310
vertically as well as horizontally.
And we'll see that development today,

157
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,280
uh, tourists who go to Rome really missed
the boat by not going out to Ostia in

158
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:11,520
more,

159
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,680
in larger numbers because at most tourists
don't tend to take the trip out to

160
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:19,050
Ostia, but it's well worth it
and it's very easy to get to.

161
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:24,051
It only takes about 25 minutes to a half
an hour on a suburban train to get from

162
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:29,730
Rome to Ostia. So, uh, it's, it's
a not to be missed, uh, experience.

163
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,690
And I show you one of these trains in the
upper left that takes you very easily,

164
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,530
uh, from Rome to the site of Ostia. Uh,

165
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:41,290
there are a number of stations in Ostia.
One of them is Ostia change row,

166
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,580
the downtown of Ostia, which you
see in that view in the upper left.

167
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,880
And the other is Lido di Ostia,
which means the beach.

168
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,940
And I show you a view of
Lido di Ostia down here.

169
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:54,270
Now looking at that nice view of
the ocean. I know we've all been,

170
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,540
you're back from spring
break, but still it's, it's,

171
00:10:56,541 --> 00:11:00,450
it's nice to reminisce about what some
of you may have been doing during spring

172
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,630
break and see this wonderful view of
the scene and it looks very enticing.

173
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,070
But I can tell you that it's not, once
you get there, I mean, it's very polluted.

174
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:12,240
This is not one of the great beaches
of the world. Uh, so don't be,

175
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:14,950
don't be seduced by Lido di Di Ostia.

176
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:19,680
Stay on the train and make your way to
the site called Scobie Diasio Ostia,

177
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:22,010
which is the excavations of Osteo,

178
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:27,011
the archeological excavations where you
can see as you saw as one season Pompei

179
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,280
and ancient Roman city, extremely
well preserved. Uh, and you see,

180
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,740
uh, a, a glimpse of it over here.

181
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,630
And you can tell even
just from this glimpse a,

182
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,630
that we are dealing here with a
city that is not unlike Pompei.

183
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,900
It has streets and sidewalks and it has
buildings along the side of either of

184
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:52,260
those. But there is one main difference
between this and what we saw at palm pay.

185
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:56,250
And you can see it very well in this
image and that is that these build, these,

186
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,430
these houses are that are along the street
look different than those did in palm

187
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:04,420
pay in that they are made out of concrete,
faced with brick,

188
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,640
a very different kind of appearance, uh,
and one that is quintessentially Osteon,

189
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,960
uh, and makes this city well
worthwhile, well worth a visit. In fact,

190
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:18,961
if we think of palm pay as
the quintessential first
century a d Roman city,

191
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:24,301
we should think of the city of Ostia
as the quintessential second century A.

192
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,571
Dot.
D City.

193
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:29,950
The best example that we have of what
a second century a Hadria Anik and

194
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:33,310
[inaudible] city would have looked like.

195
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:37,630
And that is what makes it
so important to us here.

196
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:42,100
I remind you again of the original plan
that we looked at the plan from the mid

197
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:46,450
fourth century BC,
350 BC from Ward Perkins.

198
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,520
That shows you the original
costume of the first colony, uh,

199
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:55,480
this rectangular space, very
regular with its own wall. Uh,

200
00:12:55,481 --> 00:13:00,340
surrounding the city with the Carto,
these north South Street and the deck,

201
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:00,821
your Montas,

202
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:05,800
the east West Street intersecting
exactly at the center of that city.

203
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,420
And then at that intersection,
as was Roman practice,

204
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,150
the placement of the forum of the city,

205
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,770
a great open rectangular space with the
temple pushed up against the back wall

206
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:21,170
in this case at Temple of
Jupiter, a capital Eum, uh,

207
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,910
dominating the space in front of it.
And then other buildings around it.

208
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,840
As you can see,

209
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,740
although there's a striking difference
between this forum and the forum that we

210
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:33,220
saw at palm pay,
because you'll remember at palm pay,

211
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:38,140
the various major buildings, the
basilica, the temple of Apollo, and so on,

212
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,043
uh,
uh,

213
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,640
sort of radiating out from
the central core of the forum.

214
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,640
We don't see that here.
We see the buildings, uh,

215
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,460
sort of placed separately
from that main forum space,

216
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:52,840
but in every other respect,

217
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:57,010
very similar to the general plan
of these early Roman cities.

218
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,690
What's also useful about this particular
plan is the fact that it shows you the

219
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:04,480
way, though, as time went
by and as the city grew,

220
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,500
it shows you the way in which the carto
and the deck your Montas were extended.

221
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,050
And then the other buildings of the
city were added a here and there,

222
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,690
a number of baths,
lots of private residences.

223
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,110
This is a particularly important
building here at 15 and 16,

224
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:21,400
which we'll look at today.

225
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,640
The 15 is the theater and 16 is the so
called a Piatsa of the corporations,

226
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:30,670
the pee out solid daily corporates Yoni,
uh,

227
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:34,300
which is very significant
and we'll look at that soon.

228
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,700
If you go and visit the
city of Ostia today, uh,

229
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:42,730
and enter at the ticket booth.
Uh,

230
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,110
what you see almost immediately
is again, a polygonal, uh,

231
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:52,040
masonry, uh, street looking very
much like pom pay. But once again,

232
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,400
there are no stepping stones in Ostia
unlike Pompei, which is which a,

233
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,550
the plot thickens there in terms of why
we see those in Pompei and don't seem to

234
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:03,020
see them anywhere else.

235
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,650
You walk along that polygonal
Masonry Street pavement, uh,

236
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,500
and you see both the remains up here
in the upper left of the original

237
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:14,030
Republican city wall.

238
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:19,250
And it should bring back memories of opus
contract them or Ashleigh masonry that

239
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,780
we saw at the beginning of the semester.

240
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:24,560
You can see it's consistent with the age
in which it was built in the republic.

241
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,000
Uh, but then over here, as you
make your way along, one of them,

242
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,080
one of the main streets,
uh,

243
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:33,710
you see what is characteristic
of Ostia as a whole.

244
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:37,130
And that is concrete construction,
brick face, concrete construction,

245
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,450
both for the residences and also for
the public buildings and also for the

246
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:44,890
religious structures,
namely the temples, uh,

247
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,600
in this city. The reason
for this, of course,

248
00:15:48,601 --> 00:15:51,040
it takes us back to the
neurone and period, the fact,

249
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,970
the great fire of 64 when it was realized,
you'll remember the Sabura,

250
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,650
uh, which was located back beyond the
precinct walls of the forum of Augustus.

251
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,760
The area where the working poor of
Rome lived primarily in Rickety, uh,

252
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,170
apartment houses that were made
out of wood, multistory to houses.

253
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,740
Those were actually multistory,
but they were always going up in flames.

254
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,780
And there was a recognition after the
great destruction of the fire of 64 that

255
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:20,000
the Romans needed to
fireproof their buildings.

256
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:24,020
And so they big and they recognize
the fact that brick is better at,

257
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,040
at protecting the structure
from fire than stone is a,

258
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:31,820
and they stoned Ken burn. Uh,
and they actually began to,

259
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:33,650
as we know we talked about this before,

260
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:37,670
they began to build their houses and
many of their civic structures out of

261
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:40,450
concrete faced, uh, with brick. Uh,

262
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,460
and we see that development especially
well here in Ostia and Osteo is extremely

263
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:50,891
important for us also because many of
many comparable buildings that were put up

264
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:55,510
in the city of Rome itself no longer
survive the same apartment houses that

265
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,240
we're going to see it. Ostia did exist
in Rome. We have some remains of them.

266
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,990
There's a very prominent one at the base
of the Capitol on hill to the left of

267
00:17:02,991 --> 00:17:05,840
the hill as you,
as you climb up that hill.

268
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,200
But we have very little
evidence for this in Rome.

269
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,910
And so we have to rely on Ostia to
give us the best picture of apartment

270
00:17:13,911 --> 00:17:18,440
building in Rome, in Roman
architecture in the second century.

271
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,470
A D here is a spectacular view of
Ostia as it looks today from the air.

272
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:31,250
And we are obviously looking down on
the forum on the great open rectangular

273
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:34,160
space as the forum with columns around it.

274
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,180
We are looking also at the Capitol,
Liam at the Temple of Jupiter,

275
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,930
which is a very large structure.
As you can see here.

276
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:45,290
It made out of concrete,
faced with brick.

277
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,890
It is a typical Roman temple,
unlike Hadrian's Temple of Venus in Roma,

278
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,380
because we can see that it has a facade
orientation. It has a single staircase,

279
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,370
it has a deep porch,
freestanding columns in that porch.

280
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,750
So a typical Roman, uh,
structure, uh, and uh,

281
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:07,860
and it's typical Roman temple.
And then you can also see its vast scale.

282
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:11,670
There are a couple of people standing
here who look minuscule in relationship to

283
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:14,850
this building. And, uh, only
part of the building. In fact,

284
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:18,120
full height of the building
is not even preserved here.

285
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:21,630
So it was even larger still
than what you see. Uh,

286
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:26,220
the reason for its size is two fold. One,
because we have already seen that this,

287
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:31,050
uh, this taste for larger and larger
buildings has really taken off.

288
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,690
Uh,
we saw it in Hadrian's forum in Rome.

289
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:36,390
We saw it in demolitions
palace on the Palatine Hill.

290
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:41,520
We saw it in Hadrian's villa at Tivoli
and in the Pantheon, the largest span,

291
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:45,930
the largest dome, uh, ever built.
So this taste for four largeness,

292
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:48,690
grandiosity and architecture
has really taken off.

293
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:51,990
So it's not surprising
to see this capital IOM,

294
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:53,970
which was built in the Adriatic periods,

295
00:18:53,971 --> 00:18:58,200
specifically one 20 a d
also being large in scale,

296
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,470
but there's a second and perhaps
even more important reason.

297
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:06,710
And that is in a city in which all of the
most of the houses are what are called

298
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:07,771
Insoo lie,

299
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:12,120
I n s u l a and the singular
AIE in the plural into lie.

300
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,310
A multistory apartment buildings
often have as many as five stories.

301
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,350
If you want your capital,
Liam,

302
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:24,351
to stand out in that city and be
seen up above those apartment houses,

303
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:26,400
you've got to build it very high.

304
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,900
And that is undoubtedly the reason
that they are one of the two reasons,

305
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:34,770
the more important reason that they
have built this temple so large and

306
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:39,630
especially so tall so that you could see
the temple of Jupiter from everywhere

307
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,790
in the city of Ostia.

308
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,020
Here's the view of the temple as
it looks today in isolation, again,

309
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:50,970
only part of its hype preserved but
enough for us to get a very good sense of

310
00:19:50,971 --> 00:19:55,350
it's concrete construction
brick facing here. Uh,

311
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:59,100
and as I've already described, the
single staircase, the columns, uh,

312
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,110
in the porch and so on.

313
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,400
I mentioned already that it
was under Augustus that uh,

314
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,400
a theater and an entertainment district
was added to the city of Ostia.

315
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,580
And, uh, it, it, that building,

316
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:19,610
you see the remains of it here a along
one of the major streets of the city of

317
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:20,544
Ostia.

318
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:25,730
It was renovated in around 200 a d
that is in the early part of the third

319
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:27,751
century,
a d.

320
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:32,751
So considerably later it was
expanded to be able to hold 200,

321
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,690
2,500 spectators at that particular point.
And uh,

322
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,740
much of the concrete and brick faced
construction belongs to that renovation.

323
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:48,040
One can't imagine a building quite
like this in the age of Augustus.

324
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:52,540
So what you're seeing here is
PR primarily the restored, uh,

325
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,750
view,
the restored version of this building.

326
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,180
But what you can see that does,
uh,

327
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,410
at least link it back to the Augusta and
period is the fact that the design of

328
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:06,880
the facade is very similar to the design
of the theater of Marcellus in Rome

329
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,530
with the art, with the arches and the,
in this case pilasters between them.

330
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,970
That same general scheme that we
saw for theater and for amphitheater

331
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:17,800
architecture use tier.

332
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,550
The main difference of course is the
fact that we have concrete construction

333
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:22,940
with brick facing,
uh,

334
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,400
rather than concrete construction
with stone facing travertine.

335
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:30,310
In the case of the theater of Marcellus,

336
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,970
I haven't yet shown you a Roman latrine,

337
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,730
but today is the day for the
Roman latrine. Uh, we and,

338
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,610
but you have to imagine of course,

339
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:43,900
that in any major public building like
a theater where you're going to have a

340
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:48,640
lot of people, they are the same time.
You have to provide a public latrine.

341
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,140
And when I say a public latrine,

342
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:56,110
I really mean a public lottery and there
was no privacy as you can see in this

343
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,950
latrine, a whatsoever.
Uh, what it, what it is,

344
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,510
what it is composed of as you can see
is a bench that lines the walls with a

345
00:22:04,511 --> 00:22:09,430
series of holes in it. And then just
one single drain, uh, that in circles,

346
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,120
uh, the building. So this gives you
an idea of where you have to go.

347
00:22:13,121 --> 00:22:17,140
If you needed to go, uh, during
intermission, if you were attending, uh,

348
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,110
the theater at the theater in Ostia,

349
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,010
one of the most important
buildings at osteon is, is, uh,

350
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,860
connected to this theater I'm showing
you now the plan of the theater,

351
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:34,150
which corresponds a two theaters that
we've looked at throughout this semester

352
00:22:34,151 --> 00:22:39,130
of typical Roman plan.
It has a semicircular orchestra.

353
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:43,330
It has a stage building
or scan I frons here. Uh,

354
00:22:43,331 --> 00:22:48,040
it has a semicircular Kavya the
street, they seats, which are,

355
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,960
um, which are, which are placed on
top of, of course, in this case,

356
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:55,840
a concrete foundation.
Uh,

357
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,940
this like other Roman Roman
theaters is an urban phenomenon.

358
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,740
There was no hill to build this on.
So the Romans had to build the osteons,

359
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:10,660
had to build their own hill
out of concrete and then
support the caveat on top

360
00:23:10,661 --> 00:23:15,070
of that. But the coffee is made of stone
seats. They used stone for the seats,

361
00:23:15,071 --> 00:23:19,300
as is traditional in Roman
theater architecture. Uh,

362
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:20,470
and then,
uh,

363
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,450
but we see that this theater
is appended to a portico us.

364
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,510
Now we've seen a porticas with these,
uh,

365
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,680
with these theaters before it was in
fact characteristic of theater design.

366
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:36,490
And if you think back to the
theater in palm pay, for example,

367
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:38,150
you'll remember that that port it goes,

368
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,380
which had a little cool little shops all
around it or small cubicles all around

369
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:46,131
it,
uh,

370
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:51,020
was used as a place where you could
go during intermission to relax,

371
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:51,920
to walk around,

372
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:56,921
to buy a playbill to pick up a souvenir
tee shirt or what the equivalent was in

373
00:23:57,471 --> 00:23:58,680
those days,
uh,

374
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:03,670
a souvenir of your experience
that evening at the theater. Um,

375
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,470
and so we see that same
general scheme here,

376
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:10,780
this whole idea of this open
rectangular space with some columns. Uh,

377
00:24:10,781 --> 00:24:14,430
and then with these little cubicles
all along. But in this case, uh,

378
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,490
it was not meant to be a place for
souvenirs or a place to store props,

379
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,480
but instead what we see is something
quite fascinating giving the,

380
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:28,010
given the fact that the city of Osteo
was primarily a commercial city,

381
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,730
a place where, uh, items were,

382
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,760
were exported and imported because
it was a major port or harbor city.

383
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,430
What this was used for instead,
uh, at hence its name, the P. Dot.

384
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,050
Salay daily corporates.

385
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:47,051
Yoni is a series of businesses that
were spent the import export business

386
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:53,210
essentially a is what these
spaces were used for. Uh,

387
00:24:53,211 --> 00:24:55,010
and I'll show you, we, there are actually,

388
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:58,670
some of them are quite well preserved
and I can show you indeed what they look

389
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:00,590
like then in the center or something.

390
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:05,540
We also don't see in the palm pay
theater a small temple in the center,

391
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:10,580
a temple that corresponds to a Roman
temples that we've looked at thus far.

392
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:15,080
It's rectangular shape, uh, it's
flat side and back walls. Uh,

393
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,270
it's some columns in the deep porch,

394
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,260
a single staircase facade
emphasis as you can see here,

395
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,470
relatively small and scale
as these kinds of things go.

396
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,610
And it has been speculated by the
main excavator of this site that uh,

397
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,170
it was used as a it,

398
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,480
that it was dedicated to some
God whose name we don't know.

399
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:37,850
We don't know which God or
goddess this was dedicated to.

400
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:43,150
But the excavator has speculated that
it was probably some God that had

401
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:45,530
something to do with commerce.

402
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,550
And the blessing of commerce and
that probably some trade guild,

403
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:53,000
one of the trade guilds that
had its business is set up here,

404
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:57,170
may have been the commissioners may
have paid for indeed commission this

405
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,960
particular temple. And I
think that's uh, you know,

406
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:04,010
as good a theory is any
and may well be the case.

407
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,510
This is a view we're standing
at the top of the caveat.

408
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,760
Looking down over that coffee,

409
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:14,330
we can see the COO nay or wedge
shaped sections of, of seats.

410
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,590
We can see the stone stone that
has been used, uh, for those seats.

411
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:23,810
We can see the semicircular
orchestra, the scalloped, uh,

412
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,640
the scallop face of the,
uh,

413
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,670
of the or of the stage.
Uh,

414
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:35,210
and then one can imagine the skein I
frons with its forest of columns behind

415
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:38,450
that part is not well preserved.
Uh, and there also would have been,

416
00:26:38,451 --> 00:26:41,840
I'll show you a restored view it a little
bit later where you'll see that there

417
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:45,290
was a much higher wall in
between this and the p. Dot.

418
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:48,930
Salie that lay beyond the
wall is no longer there.

419
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,990
So we can see very well
through these columns.

420
00:26:51,991 --> 00:26:56,130
The small temple that was debt put
up by that trade guild to some God of

421
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:56,964
commerce.

422
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,970
And then we can also see these cubicles
all along the way that were used,

423
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:06,030
uh, as these import and
export, uh, Emporia.

424
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:11,130
This is a view of the temple as it looks
today. We can see that single staircase,

425
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:14,550
fairly narrow staircase here,
the facade orientation,

426
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:19,551
a couple of the columns including a
Corinthian column that are still preserved

427
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,390
from that small structure.

428
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,830
And then here are very useful
view showing us again, uh, these,

429
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,450
these interesting spaces,
rectangular spaces along here,

430
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,790
a fronted in each case by columns.

431
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:37,020
We'll see that those columns are made
out of cement, faced with bricks.

432
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:40,950
So it's shades of the sanctuary
of Hercules at Tivoli.

433
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,660
We haven't seen this before.

434
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:46,320
I've been since then and that
was a very unusual use here.

435
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:49,890
We're seeing something that actually
becomes more common in the second century,

436
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,820
uh, making concrete columns and
then facing them with brick.

437
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,910
I'd like to show you a few views
of these, uh, of these, uh,

438
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:04,890
of these import export businesses is,
I've called them, uh, one of them here.

439
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,530
Uh, where we can see that
the architecture itself,

440
00:28:07,531 --> 00:28:10,870
the walls and the columns are
only partially preserved. Uh,

441
00:28:10,871 --> 00:28:14,870
you have to imagine that an antiquity,
they went up higher than this. Uh,

442
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,670
but what is well preserved are
the mosaics on the floor, uh,

443
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:22,350
of each of these are many of these spaces.

444
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,790
And you can see they're all done in black
and white mosaic. Just the two colors.

445
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:31,060
You can see the interest
that the osteons had, uh,

446
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,180
in geometric shapes. Uh, they, uh,

447
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,220
have inside these very
abstract inside the shop here,

448
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:43,140
these abstract patterns. Uh,
although they, they've made
an attempt to vary them.

449
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,250
Uh, but then in the front, uh, something
very interesting that we see throughout,

450
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,190
uh,
is the use of see imagery because again,

451
00:28:50,191 --> 00:28:53,560
they were in the import and export
business. They were busy, uh, you know,

452
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,260
sending ships,
uh,

453
00:28:55,261 --> 00:28:59,220
back and forth for Middle East to other
parts of the Roman world by sea. Uh,

454
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:03,960
and so it's almost all see imagery here.
We see two Geraldo Dolphins.

455
00:29:03,961 --> 00:29:07,530
Dolphins are particularly
popular in these scenes, uh,

456
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:12,040
facing one another as a kind
of advertisement or shops on a,

457
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,600
for this particular enterprise.
Here's another one,

458
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,210
a where you can see I like
this dolphin in particular,

459
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:22,710
he's nicely preserved and he has a
wonderful serpentine tail with a lot of

460
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:25,650
flourish at the end
here. As you can see, I,

461
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,820
and then inside a an image of a boat,
you can see it,

462
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,260
it's partially preserved.

463
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,760
What's wonderful about this example
is it shows us that although these are

464
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:40,530
fairly simple in design and
are meant essentially as
advertisements for the shop,

465
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:46,150
the artist and the patron have taken real
care to think about what you're going

466
00:29:46,371 --> 00:29:51,130
to see when you're standing where so that
they have oriented these so that when

467
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:54,550
you're facing the shop and deciding
whether you're going to pick this one,

468
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:58,150
there's 61 of these by the way,
around the perimeter of the structure.

469
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:02,710
So you had a lot of choice in terms of
which enterprise you were going to. Uh,

470
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:02,951
you know,

471
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:06,640
you were where you were going to go to
if you wanted to ship something from

472
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:10,330
Ostia somewhere else or receive a
delivery, you had a lot of choices,

473
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,200
although I don't doubt
some of them specialize in
different parts of the world,

474
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:17,130
you know, and shipping to Egypt
or shipping to Asia Minor. Uh,

475
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,850
but you can see here the dolphin when
you standing deciding whether you want to

476
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:23,980
go in the dolphin,
you face the dolphin.

477
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,310
Once you're inside a and standing
and talking to the owner. If you,

478
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,130
if you turn around and look back
or you're going to see the ship,

479
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:35,660
the boat head on. So they've really,
they've orchestrated this and such.

480
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:38,080
They paid real attention.
It's not done willy nilly.

481
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,860
They paid attention to what
you're going to see where, uh,

482
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,580
when you are entering and
inside of these spaces.

483
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,850
Here's another one. Not only dolphins,
dolphins, dolphins, you know,

484
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:52,810
more dolphins and more dolphins.
Uh, but you also see in this case,

485
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:56,260
a light house which could either be a
representation of their local lighthouse

486
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:01,060
or some light house, uh, somewhere else,
uh, that this particular place ships too.

487
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:06,670
And then the last one, which is the one
on your monument list, uh, with two boats.

488
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:11,830
Uh, so again, how does one ship
things from a Ostia elsewhere by boat?

489
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:14,710
And so they tend to represent boats. And
you've see, you've kind of seen it all.

490
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:18,150
Dolphins, boats and light
houses tend to be, uh,

491
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,210
the items that are chosen for
these so called advertisements.

492
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:25,660
But this one is very useful too
because you can see the, uh,

493
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:29,860
the shapes and the colors of the
tests or I that are used here.

494
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,870
And although these are very effective,

495
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:35,340
you can see that this is
not the Alexander mosaic a,

496
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:38,660
these are not done with that
kind of skill. Uh, they,

497
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:43,450
they use only black and white, the
simplest possible scheme, no colors. Uh,

498
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:46,930
and you don't get the sense as you do
with something like the Alexander Mosaic.

499
00:31:46,931 --> 00:31:49,540
When you step back from it,
it could almost be a painting.

500
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:54,180
It's done that well with the cast shadows
and the, and the crumpling figures.

501
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:58,850
So well presented, uh, here at something
quite different, more abstract. Uh,

502
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,820
and the stones are not as fine.

503
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:04,780
You can see they haven't
paid as much attention to
getting them perfectly shaped.

504
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,530
Uh, but nonetheless it's very
effective. Uh, and it really does.

505
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:12,220
It does what it intended to do.
One of the sad things, I mean,

506
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:15,340
it's great to see and if you go out to
osteon make a special point of seeing

507
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:19,540
these and taking pictures because I've
been looking at these for many years and

508
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,220
uh,
every time I'm there,

509
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:24,160
it seems that there are fewer tests
awry ride there then that these are the

510
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:27,280
originals are there are fewer tests
arrived than there were before.

511
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,970
I'm not saying that people take them,
although I think people do take them. Uh,

512
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:35,770
but, but just that over time by a, by
tourists walking on them extensively,

513
00:32:35,771 --> 00:32:37,090
they get on,
they got,

514
00:32:37,091 --> 00:32:41,720
they get loose and they get spread around
the site and they haven't done as good

515
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:46,040
a job as I think they should have at all
as they should at osteon keeping these

516
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,390
mosaics together.

517
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:52,280
Here's a restored view of the whole
complex where I think you can see that

518
00:32:52,281 --> 00:32:57,281
although the theater and the [inaudible]
are connected to one another and are

519
00:32:57,621 --> 00:33:00,380
part of the same scheme
and are a development,

520
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:02,520
a further development and evolution,
uh,

521
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:06,710
that is particularly appropriate for
this commercial city of Ostia that comes

522
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:09,670
out of the orbit of that earlier, uh, uh,

523
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,530
theater and porticas complex at Pompei,

524
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,200
we can see that although they're
part of that same complex,

525
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,210
they are distinct from one another.
Uh,

526
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,800
if you look at the theater and the copy
up above with the original wall of the

527
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:23,180
skein high frons preserve,

528
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:26,790
we're looking at it from the back or
you can see that that was very high. Uh,

529
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:30,560
so only if you were way up at the top of
the copy of what you really get a sense

530
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:34,340
of what lay beyond on that once
you got into the p. Dot. Saul,

531
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:38,470
I over here with its temple, uh,
and with its various shops. Uh,

532
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,100
you were in another world,

533
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:44,600
the commercial world also interesting is
the fact that although they're open to

534
00:33:44,601 --> 00:33:48,190
the sky today in antiquity,
there was a covered call,

535
00:33:48,191 --> 00:33:52,340
an aid as you can see here that would
have covered, uh, those shops. Uh,

536
00:33:52,341 --> 00:33:56,150
and you would have had to go in
between the columns and back along the

537
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,620
passageway in order to check
out what the options were.

538
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:06,370
The city of Ostia, uh, like
all Roman cities that we've
talked about, Rome, Pompeii,

539
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,470
Herculaneum,
so on all obviously had a,

540
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,790
a selection of bath establishment.
Osteo was no exception.

541
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:18,500
There are a number of bows preserved
from the Roman city of Osteo,

542
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:22,220
uh, this being one of them,
the so called bads of Neptune,

543
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,690
the dates to 139,
a d the boughs of Neptune,

544
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:31,691
so called because of a spectacular mosaic
black and white mosaic of Neptune on

545
00:34:32,241 --> 00:34:34,280
the, on the floor. I'll
show it to you in a moment,

546
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:37,520
but go into it in more detail
a bit later in the lecture.

547
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:42,080
If we look at the plan of the
bads of Neptune in Australia.

548
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:47,380
I wondered if any of you can tell me
whether this is a plan that corresponds to

549
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:53,180
the earlier bath buildings at palm pay,
the Stop and Basil, the foreign bas,

550
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,200
or conforms more closely to the imperial
bath type that we saw in Rome from the

551
00:34:58,611 --> 00:35:03,230
time of Titus, let's say the boughs
of Titus and Trajan. Any thoughts?

552
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,160
Brooke's new grimaced but maybe I'll ask
you, do you have a pick on you earlier,

553
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,610
the earlier one? Absolutely.
And why, why do you say that?

554
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:23,100
Because,
um,

555
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,440
the series of bathrooms are coming here.

556
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,990
Excellent. Excellent.
That's exactly right.

557
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:33,340
We see the Palestra on one side
with the natal CTO or the PC.

558
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:37,890
Now that was usually usually accompanied
it over here. And then on other side,

559
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,600
all aligned in a row. Uh, the
typical bath, the bathing block, uh,

560
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:46,970
including the Apo d Terry
on the, uh, the caldarium,

561
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,810
the tip of Dory,

562
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:51,030
the tip of diarrhea in the call Dorian
and the frigate Dari and mold of the

563
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:55,380
frigging Dharm is not a round alcove
structure at all. So in that sense,

564
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,100
perhaps influenced by some
of what came in between, uh,

565
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:02,700
those early bands at palm pay
and the imperial Baz in Rome.

566
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,680
But [inaudible] and of
course also a note here,

567
00:36:05,681 --> 00:36:07,680
the shops that line the front of it,

568
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:12,570
which is also characteristic of this dobby
and baths and the foreign bas at palm

569
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:14,970
pay. Uh, so they could
have chosen the other,

570
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:19,850
but obviously felt that this was much
more appropriate, uh, to this, uh,

571
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,540
commercial town to use the smaller,
more intimate bath type, uh, here. Uh,

572
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:29,370
then the imperial bas that
had been developed in Rome
from, uh, the first century,

573
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:34,371
a date on a just a glimpse of the black
and white mosaic that gives this bath.

574
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:38,670
It's name of the bads of Neptune.
You see Neptune here. Uh,

575
00:36:38,671 --> 00:36:42,150
but you can also see the way in
which every room in the bath, uh,

576
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,580
which was made out of concrete,
faced with brick.

577
00:36:44,581 --> 00:36:47,170
As you can also tell from this view,
uh,

578
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,240
every room was covered with
these black and white mosaics.

579
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,080
Ostia is the land of the
black and white mosaic.

580
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,070
A return to that in a moment.
Perhaps most importantly,

581
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:03,360
anything that I show you today are
the apartment houses of osteopath.

582
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,070
And it's to those that
I'd like now to turn, uh,

583
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,130
what you're looking at on the screen is
a model of what one of these apartment

584
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:16,030
houses would have looked like. This one
is the so called Insula, I, N S U l,

585
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:19,870
a Ciraphorus, the insula
of [inaudible]. Uh,

586
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:24,870
and we're looking at it in a model that
is in that Museum of casts that I've

587
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:28,650
referred to a number of times
this semester at a place
at a part of Rome called

588
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,470
Ar, e, u r, a that, uh, fashion,

589
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,450
that area that was built up in the
fascist period by miscellany in the 1930s.

590
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,400
It's, it, this model
is in that museum, uh,

591
00:37:39,401 --> 00:37:43,470
and it gives us as good an idea as
anything I could show you of what one of

592
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:48,471
these apartment houses looked like in
its hay day in the time of Hadrian.

593
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,580
The word Insula, I should mention,
uh, it can be used in two ways.

594
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:56,310
And insula either refers to an apartment,

595
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:58,650
a multistory apartment house,

596
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,430
or it refers to a block of houses.

597
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,120
In a city like Ostia,
it's used for whatever reason,

598
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:11,380
it was used interchangeably to refer to
either block or to an individual house.

599
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:16,320
Uh, so pay attention to that when you
read about an insula or ensue lie.

600
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:21,390
Again, this one dates to the
second century had the, uh,

601
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,390
the, uh, insula of Syrup is, and it,

602
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:29,391
it basically was like a modern condominium
and often more than one of these

603
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:33,660
Insulite of where next w were
clearly next to one another,

604
00:38:33,661 --> 00:38:37,270
but more than one sometimes
shared a common bath.

605
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,110
So they would sometimes build a
bathing bill, a bath building, uh,

606
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:46,030
that would be used by those who
lived in those two apartment houses.

607
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,630
Now, what's characteristic of this,
and especially as we think about it,

608
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,540
think about it in relationship to early
Domus architecture that we saw at palm

609
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:54,100
pay,

610
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:59,100
those single family dwellings is the
need in this teaming commercial city,

611
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,440
uh,
to accommodate a very large,

612
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,880
a population and a small amount of space.
Uh,

613
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,330
people on the whole who could not
afford single family dwellings, uh,

614
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:14,380
who needed to be housed in these apartment
buildings. They build up vertically.

615
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,190
Uh, and as you can see, they go
up to as many as five stories.

616
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:22,690
And we see that the insula of Syrup is,
was indeed a five storied structure.

617
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,110
It is made out of concrete.
It is faced with brick.

618
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:30,010
I and what is particularly interesting
about the brick facing here,

619
00:39:30,011 --> 00:39:32,620
and this is going to be
our first example of this,

620
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:37,621
that Australia is the fact that some
point the Romans realize that brick was

621
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:41,260
really attractive in its own right.
Uh,

622
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:43,690
and that didn't need to
be stuck out over anymore.

623
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,380
If you think back to the dome is our area,
even in the Dome is our area.

624
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,550
The building was made out of the palace,
was made out of concrete,

625
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:54,460
faced with brick,
but the facade was gilded.

626
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:59,730
And inside you'll remember fabulous
was commissioned to cover the entire,

627
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:04,630
uh, stock, the entire interior of the
structure with stucco and then paint it.

628
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,480
So you would have had no sense,
uh,

629
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:11,200
when you were standing in the palace
of Nero and Nero's day that it,

630
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:16,030
that it was a brick face,
concrete structure. Uh, but
somewhere along the way,

631
00:40:16,031 --> 00:40:19,390
and it comes to the fore. And the
second century Aidy, they realize, hey,

632
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,680
this brick is actually pretty
attractive in its own right. Uh,

633
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:27,700
it has texture. We can vary the
color. We can use a reddish brick.

634
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:29,350
We can use a slightly yellowish brick.

635
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:34,210
We can add some stucco to make some
decorative effects. This looks awesome.

636
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:39,570
Uh, and we think, uh, well, you
know, we, we, uh, some, some, uh, uh,

637
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,860
innovative architects got the idea in
innovative designers to let's leave it,

638
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:48,250
let's not stuck with it over. Let's
let, let it speak for itself. Uh,

639
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,230
and that was a very wise decision
because as you'll see today,

640
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,760
these are the buildings that we
have remaining from Osteo that were

641
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:59,820
unadulterated brick exteriors without
stucco are absolutely magnificent.

642
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,440
Uh, and, and they, and
they became the art.

643
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,080
The designer's became real experts at
rendering it in an extraordinary way.

644
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:11,590
I think you can get a sense of that
even in this model. So exposed,

645
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,390
exposed brick work here.
Uh,

646
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,330
you see these arches a made
of bricks that are, uh,

647
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,390
kind of wedge shaped and, and, um,

648
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:24,390
look like the sort of thing we saw
earlier in stone. Those wedge shape, uh,

649
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,660
sections of stone that we saw. For
example, in the Fillery, Novi a gate.

650
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,250
We see that sort of thing here.

651
00:41:30,251 --> 00:41:32,770
It may have been used just
as it was in the Pantheon.

652
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:35,330
You'll remember how they use
them during the building,

653
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:40,250
a process to keep the concrete
from settling before it dried.

654
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:40,670
Uh,

655
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:44,570
but they realized afterwards that these
could be positioned in a way that made

656
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:47,630
them very attractive in their own right.
Ultimately,

657
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,750
we can also see that
they have added moldings,

658
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,440
usually with Stucco added
moldings, uh, that have,

659
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,690
that make the building more attractive.

660
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:01,040
Sometimes even little pediments as you
can see over some of the windows over

661
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:01,850
here.

662
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:06,320
So they come up with strategies to make
this brick look even more attractive

663
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:10,760
than it was on its own note. Also,
the shops in the first story. Uh,

664
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:11,870
some of these are shops,

665
00:42:11,871 --> 00:42:16,460
some of these are actually staircases
that lead you to the upper most stories.

666
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,700
And once again,
uh,

667
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:22,490
it's clear that the Romans have become
so adept at using it and using concrete

668
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,650
that they are able to open up these walls.
The,

669
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:30,710
the openings are larger than they had been
even before. Uh, and so they're there.

670
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:35,420
They become very good at, at, at, at,
at, at, at d materializing the wall,

671
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,610
uh, in a way that, um, becomes
increasingly sophisticated over time.

672
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:46,180
The most famous house at Ostia is in a
sense mine because it's called the Casa

673
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:52,280
de Deana, the house of Diana,
uh, at, uh, [inaudible] and, uh,

674
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,550
we see a view of it
here as it looks today.

675
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:59,410
It was a multistory apartment building,
a multistory insula.

676
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,610
Only two of those stories are preserved.

677
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:06,320
Now I'll show you a restored view of what
the original looked like momentarily.

678
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:10,220
Uh, but we see it here as it
looks today, concrete, uh,

679
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,750
faced with brick exposed brick,
brick and joy in its own right,

680
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:19,970
very large openings that lead into their
either entrance ways into the structure,

681
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,800
uh, or uh, or,

682
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:26,780
or lead to stare Wa two
staircases or open up onto shops.

683
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:31,610
We can see here in actuality the same sort
of thing we saw in the model from AOR.

684
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,720
And that is the use,

685
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:37,700
not only have exposed brick but also
have moldings that are added either in

686
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:41,760
brick sometimes or also sometimes
in Stucco of the Nice uh,

687
00:43:41,761 --> 00:43:46,610
overhangs that they have created above
the second story windows up there.

688
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:51,230
We also see a lot of Italian
schoolchildren osteon po on Pompei also,

689
00:43:51,231 --> 00:43:55,610
but particularly osteon because of its
proximity to Rome and all the schools

690
00:43:55,611 --> 00:43:56,960
that they have in the city of Rome.

691
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:00,710
Lots of kids always out in
groups and they always were,

692
00:44:00,711 --> 00:44:03,070
they always seem to have t
shirts of the same color.

693
00:44:03,071 --> 00:44:06,110
So you'll see one red school and one
yellow school. And when blue school,

694
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:09,410
it's a lot of fun and every one of them
has their set. It's so funny to me,

695
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,570
they have their cell phones and
they're all clicking, clicking,

696
00:44:11,571 --> 00:44:13,610
clicking as they walk
through these buildings.

697
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:14,810
I'm not sure they're looking at anything,

698
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:18,530
but they're definitely clicking to
record the fact that they were at Osteo.

699
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,480
Perhaps that's for student papers,
I don't know.

700
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:26,050
But here I detail of the insula of Diana
looking through one of these entrance

701
00:44:27,741 --> 00:44:31,030
ways into the rest of the structure.
And I bet yours and struck,

702
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,110
I am in looking at this,
that with regard to vista,

703
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,240
the interest in Panorama and vista,

704
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:40,620
it doesn't matter whether you're building
out of rubble or stone or opus and

705
00:44:40,621 --> 00:44:45,570
carrot them or concrete or faced with
brick. Uh, there, there is that aesthetic,

706
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:46,860
that Roman aesthetic of,

707
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,420
of building things in such
a way that wherever you're
standing in that structure,

708
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:54,870
you're going to be looking from one part
of the building to another and you're

709
00:44:54,871 --> 00:44:59,750
going to be struck by the wonderful
scenes that you see, uh, from, uh,

710
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:04,050
you know, within and from within that
building. And from that building.

711
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:06,330
Outside of that structure,

712
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,100
here's the restored view
of the insula of Diana, uh,

713
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:14,850
where you can see that originally
it was a four story structure.

714
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,360
It's a cutaway in an accident
metric view for story structure.

715
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,570
And this particular, uh, v,

716
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:25,050
this particular restored view is also
extremely helpful because it shows us that

717
00:45:25,051 --> 00:45:29,820
these houses did not have, uh, the
peristyle courts or the Hortus, uh,

718
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:33,150
that we know from the Dome Missy
Tahlequah or the Hellenized Domus.

719
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:37,260
There was no space for that. Uh, in
this commercial [inaudible] city, uh,

720
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:41,860
there is no emphasis on the greenery
and the, um, the wonderful, uh,

721
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,050
fountains and, and statuary that we saw
in Palm Bay. And keep in mind of course,

722
00:45:46,051 --> 00:45:49,620
it Pompei in Campania was
essentially a resort town,

723
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:53,880
a very different kind of feel then
Ostia this team in commercial center.

724
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,420
So what they replaced those with here
in order to get more light into the

725
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:02,090
structure is a kind of a lightwell. And
you see that light lightwell up here, uh,

726
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,760
where there are also windows on
multiple stories. And in fact,

727
00:46:05,761 --> 00:46:10,580
I would imagine that those were the
choices, uh, apartments to have, uh,

728
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:13,120
because they would have been less noisy.
Uh,

729
00:46:13,121 --> 00:46:17,210
then what you can imagine a apartment
along the street must have been a,

730
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,380
with all the activity going in
and out of the therma polio,

731
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:25,590
the other shops down below, um, and
the cart traffic and so on. So again,

732
00:46:25,591 --> 00:46:29,280
I imagine the light, well apartment
would have been highly desirable.

733
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,110
Speaking of Thermo Polio,

734
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:34,860
we have them at Ostia as
we have them at palm pay.

735
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:36,600
Quite a number of them.

736
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,840
And I show you the best preserve which
happens to be in Diana's house. Uh,

737
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,060
and I show it to you here,

738
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:46,680
the Thermop Oleum of the Casa
de Deanna at a Ostia. Uh,

739
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:49,410
you can see that right
at the entrance way,

740
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:51,570
they have put a black and white mosaic.

741
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:56,690
You see inside just what we saw at,
uh,

742
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,000
just exactly the same thing
that we saw at palm pay,

743
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:03,240
one of these counters that
would've had recesses in it. Uh,

744
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,210
so you have to imagine just
the same as we saw there,

745
00:47:06,211 --> 00:47:09,910
a kind of fast food emporium where
you would take a peek at what was, uh,

746
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,540
what looked good for the day.
Make your choice.

747
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,350
If you go inside the
Thermop Oleum of Diana, uh,

748
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:19,020
you see hanging on the wall,
a painting,

749
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,950
which it seems likely may have
served as a kind of shop sign.

750
00:47:22,951 --> 00:47:27,951
It might've been a hung
outside the building to
advertise what you could get in

751
00:47:28,351 --> 00:47:32,300
this particular Polian. And if we
look at what's depicted here, uh,

752
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:36,640
it's a still life of objects and we see
what seems to be a pomegranate on the

753
00:47:36,641 --> 00:47:40,090
right hanging on a nail
on the wall in the center.

754
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:41,670
I don't know if you can
see it from where you sit,

755
00:47:41,671 --> 00:47:44,230
but in the center of
block that supports a,

756
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:48,610
what looks like a drinking cup that
has little round things floating in it,

757
00:47:48,611 --> 00:47:52,690
lentils or chickpeas or something
like that. And then at the far left,

758
00:47:52,691 --> 00:47:55,090
there's a plate that also is on a block,

759
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:58,510
a plate that has a carrot
and some other vegetables.

760
00:47:58,511 --> 00:48:00,310
So this may have been a vegetarian,

761
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:04,890
I guess this was a vegetarian
restaurant in palm pay, one of that,

762
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:09,580
one of the healthier places one
could go if one wanted a snack,

763
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,710
uh, in, in, in, in osteon. Excuse
me. Uh, for a very long, if, if,

764
00:48:14,711 --> 00:48:16,420
if you go to Osteo,
by the way,

765
00:48:16,421 --> 00:48:21,250
you really do want to set aside a day
to do that because the time you take the

766
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:25,140
half an hour ride out there, uh,
get there. There's a lot to see. Uh,

767
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:29,410
and it used to be, if you'd go there for
a day, which I've done many, many times,

768
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,510
uh,
there was absolutely nowhere to eat.

769
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:34,690
So you had to remember to bring your
band nowhere to get a bottle of water.

770
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,320
So you would have to remember to bring
your bottle of water and maybe a snack a,

771
00:48:38,321 --> 00:48:41,860
but they have rectified that in most
in recent years. The last few years,

772
00:48:41,861 --> 00:48:45,640
they finally put up the cafe
cafe therea daily Scobie,

773
00:48:45,641 --> 00:48:50,430
which loosely translated as
the, the excavation cafe, uh,

774
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:55,300
the cafeteria of the excavations at Ostia.
And it's actually a wonderful place.

775
00:48:55,301 --> 00:48:59,530
I have to say. It's very modern.
It has a wonderful deck with, uh,

776
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:04,450
tables and the ubiquitous Italian white
umbrella where one and the food is

777
00:49:04,451 --> 00:49:06,680
actually, you know, for
a cafeteria. Ain't bad,

778
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:10,690
but Italian pasta is always hard to make
bad, so he's good. Uh, and then inside,

779
00:49:10,691 --> 00:49:14,590
I thought you'd be amused to see when
they decided on the decor for the interior

780
00:49:14,591 --> 00:49:18,900
of the cafeteria with its, with
its simple tables and chairs, uh,

781
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:23,950
they put brick on the wall and they
then hung up these wonderful versions,

782
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:27,720
uh, of the, uh, of the P. Dot.
Saul laid daily Corporates, Yoni,

783
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:32,140
a black and white mosaic. So again, very
attuned and Italians are really, I mean,

784
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:35,620
they do build Ferrari's after all.
They are very good, uh, at, uh,

785
00:49:35,621 --> 00:49:39,460
at design and aesthetic and pay a
great deal of attention to that and

786
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:44,230
consequently always make one surroundings.
Pleasant warehouses.

787
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,240
This was up,
this was a commercial port.

788
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,340
We've talked about the fact that in
commercial ports, one needs warehouses.

789
00:49:51,341 --> 00:49:54,640
We talked, we, it, we began the
semester with a warehouse. In fact,

790
00:49:54,641 --> 00:49:59,170
the Porticos Amelia, uh, in Rome,
along the banks of the Tiber.

791
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:01,960
And I remind you of that here.
Here's the Tiber,

792
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:04,100
a model of the Tiber with the porticos.
Amelia,

793
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,310
you'll remember that was
made out of concrete.

794
00:50:06,311 --> 00:50:10,450
It was one of the earliest examples of
concrete construction in the Republican

795
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:14,530
Rome. Uh, a series of barrel vaults
linked to one another on three tiers,

796
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:17,290
as you'll recall with axial and lateral,

797
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:22,110
a spatial relations inside that structure,
uh,

798
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,070
Po osteon needed its own warehouses as
well. It had them in the republic already.

799
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:30,920
Uh, but it began to add to
them in the second century a d.

800
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:35,360
And it's fascinating to see what happens
when you build a warehouse out of

801
00:50:35,361 --> 00:50:36,980
concrete.
Faced with brick,

802
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:40,850
you get an extraordinary structure that
looks very much like an insula. I mean,

803
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:43,670
if I had put this up and said, what is
this? And you said it's an Insula, uh,

804
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:44,840
you would,
you would,

805
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,560
you would be sort of be on
the mark because it looks
exactly like an insula. Uh,

806
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:52,640
but it is a warehouse and this is
the most famous warehouse in Ostia,

807
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:57,050
this so called Auria because
the word Auria, h o, r, r, e a,

808
00:50:57,051 --> 00:51:00,290
his warehouse in Latin,
the Orencia epic Athena,

809
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:05,120
which you have on your monument list,
which dates to one 45 to 150.

810
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:09,400
And this is the entrance to
the Ra at the got the, uh,

811
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:13,970
it is again made out of concrete
faced with brick exposed, brick work,

812
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:18,550
brick work enjoyed in its own right
for its own aesthetic here. Uh,

813
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,850
we can see that, that it is like the, um,

814
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,560
like the apartment houses in
that it is multistory, uh,

815
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:30,670
with the large entrance ways or entrance
ways into the structure down below.

816
00:51:30,831 --> 00:51:33,020
And then the smaller windows up above,

817
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,960
they have monumental ISED the entrance,

818
00:51:35,961 --> 00:51:40,961
the main entrance to the structure by
giving it a columns supporting a pediment

819
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,590
very grand in fact. And we haven't, we,

820
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:49,070
it's interesting to see that even with
this brick face concrete architecture,

821
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:54,110
the Romans have not lost their interest
in Helen Ising works of art and using

822
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:58,970
touches of ancient Greece to
monumental lies and to make more,

823
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:03,610
more, um, you know, more,
more cultured in a sense, uh,

824
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,810
the entrance way into this structure.

825
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:10,811
So we see these columns engaged columns
supporting a pediment above capitals on

826
00:52:11,841 --> 00:52:15,950
those columns. As you can see
here, all of this done in concrete,

827
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:18,560
faced with brick.
And you can see here,

828
00:52:18,561 --> 00:52:23,510
this is an outstanding example of the
way in which they have used brick,

829
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:27,050
uh, to their advantage. They have
recognized that you can vary the color,

830
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:29,750
you can have a reddish brick, you
can have a yellow, which brick.

831
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:34,751
So here they've used red brick to face
the column shaft and then a yellow brick

832
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,400
to,
for the capital.

833
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,060
So there's a distinction between
the shaft and the capital.

834
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:44,180
And they have even used the
most expensive material,

835
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:49,210
a marble for the inscription plaque where
they identify this building as the Ra,

836
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:53,330
epic God, Brianna, uh, and
then the pediment above.

837
00:52:53,331 --> 00:52:57,200
And you can see if you look at the
pediment decoration and if you look at the

838
00:52:57,201 --> 00:52:59,030
volume of the capitals,

839
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:03,740
you will see they have used a small
amount of stucco to enable them to ha,

840
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:08,090
to create, uh, the vault, the
spirals of the volumes, for example.

841
00:53:08,091 --> 00:53:13,091
And some of the more delicate decorative
work in the pediment above another

842
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,000
subtlety,
a very another nice subtlety.

843
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,800
It just shows you the amount of effort
and time and money that went into this

844
00:53:21,801 --> 00:53:26,550
commission. Also this very nice pilaster
that is placed right next to the column,

845
00:53:26,551 --> 00:53:27,720
which makes a wonderful,

846
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:31,950
a wonderful transition from the column,

847
00:53:31,951 --> 00:53:34,530
the roundness of the column to
the squareness of the Pilaster,

848
00:53:34,531 --> 00:53:37,190
to the shape of the doorway,
the aesthetics,

849
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:42,270
a very much on the mind of this
particular designer as well as the list is

850
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:46,170
again, this idea of looking through
one space, seeing another opening,

851
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:49,650
and wondering where that opening is going.
All of that very,

852
00:53:49,651 --> 00:53:52,140
very carefully designed by the architect.

853
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:57,290
Here's another view head on
of this elaborate doorway
leading into the Ra epic,

854
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,750
the Yana announcing with the inscription,
uh,

855
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:05,370
exactly where you are and what this
building was used for in antiquity.

856
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:09,300
A detail of the pediment, uh,
where we can see the inscription.

857
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:13,950
We can also see the capital's the use of
Stucco work here on the very elaborate,

858
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:18,770
uh, work that they have done to
decorate the pediment above. Uh,

859
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:23,160
just a few more details of the columns
where you can see even better, uh,

860
00:54:23,161 --> 00:54:26,280
this capital and the way in
which they have used brick.

861
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:30,420
They have used brick for the,
even for the, uh, campus leaves.

862
00:54:30,421 --> 00:54:33,630
You can see that there are a campus
leaves here. This is actually an example,

863
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:37,890
one of the few we've seen of the composite
capital with the canvas leaves of the

864
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:42,360
Corinthian and the volumes of the ionic.
We saw it on the arch of Titus and Rome.

865
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:45,690
Uh, but here we see that they've used
brick and then only at the upper,

866
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:50,630
most part with the leaf has to curve over
a do they add the stucco so tremendous.

867
00:54:50,631 --> 00:54:54,780
And this is just a warehouse and yet a
tremendous amount of effort has gone into

868
00:54:54,781 --> 00:54:57,870
making it an extraordinarily
beautiful building.

869
00:54:57,871 --> 00:55:02,660
And it shows again that they
are absolutely going over
the top in terms of their,

870
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:02,840
uh,

871
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:07,840
of being a Namor of what they can do with
brick facing that they are now able to

872
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,840
expose once they can expose it,

873
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:14,190
they're much more willing
to put the effort into it to
make it really attractive.

874
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:18,060
And if you go into the courtyard of
the Ra, epic, Athena, and by the way,

875
00:55:18,061 --> 00:55:22,650
behind within these areas here
we have a annual or vaulting.

876
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,260
You can see these niches
that have been placed here.

877
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:29,100
I mean they don't really need these
niches in this courtyard of this warehouse

878
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:31,140
of what did they use these niches for?
Well,

879
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:35,520
perhaps they put a little statuettes
of, of, of God's, uh, that the, the,

880
00:55:35,521 --> 00:55:39,820
those who worked here favored and
protected their, their daily, uh, their,

881
00:55:39,821 --> 00:55:43,530
their daily toil, uh, here in
the [inaudible] got the Ana.

882
00:55:43,531 --> 00:55:48,531
But look at the attention that they have
paid to these niches that have no other

883
00:55:49,261 --> 00:55:53,280
purpose than to be attractive and possibly
again to hold these statuettes. Uh,

884
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:56,880
but you can see here again with this
combination of Stucco work for the

885
00:55:56,881 --> 00:56:00,000
pilasters and the capitals and brick work,

886
00:56:00,001 --> 00:56:04,920
brick work creating these interestingly
shaped lozenges and triangles, uh,

887
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:06,010
to create,
uh,

888
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:11,390
shows an interest again in geometric form
and the contrast of one geometric form

889
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:15,100
to another justice we saw in
black and white mosaic, uh,

890
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:20,070
capitalized on by these designers.
Now,

891
00:56:20,071 --> 00:56:25,071
I don't want to leave you
with the impression that
because brick is now exposed

892
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:30,240
at four and enjoyed in its own right,
uh,

893
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:33,370
that there are no walls that were
stuck out and painted in Ostia.

894
00:56:33,371 --> 00:56:38,080
That would be a mis misconception
because there are still painted walls in

895
00:56:38,081 --> 00:56:40,660
Australia on the insides
of some of these buildings.

896
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,410
They still opted to stucco
over the wall and to paint in.

897
00:56:44,411 --> 00:56:47,410
And I want to show you
just one glorious example.

898
00:56:47,411 --> 00:56:52,411
The insula of the painted vaults and
which dates to one 50 to 200 is one that

899
00:56:53,111 --> 00:56:55,810
has one of our best preserved ceilings,

900
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,680
walls and ceilings
anywhere in a Roman house.

901
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:02,020
You can see how well preserved it is here.

902
00:57:02,021 --> 00:57:05,220
And it is what we call the
spoked wheel effect, uh,

903
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:09,880
because what the ceiling decoration
does look like a spoked wheel. Uh,

904
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:12,960
we can also see this division.
In fact, as you look at it, I,

905
00:57:12,961 --> 00:57:16,680
I think you'll be as struck as I am by
the fact that as we look at this boat

906
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,441
spoked wheel,

907
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:21,670
we really get the sense that we're looking
at one of Hadrian's pumpkin domes and

908
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:26,660
paint because you can see, uh, the
segmented dome effect here, uh,

909
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:29,890
and, and also the octagonal ice
in a sense, the octagonal effect.

910
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:35,160
That one also gets from this structure
as well as the effect of the ribs.

911
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,780
Of a groin vault, uh, as
you can see, well here,

912
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:42,930
but it's a painted version of a pumpkin
dome and it's not surprising to see that

913
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:46,360
Hadrian's, uh, pumpkin
domes took off in this way.

914
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:50,710
I also just want to mention to you that
while there is a fair amount of post

915
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:55,580
what we call postpone pay and painting,
Roman painting after a d 79,

916
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:57,610
almost all of it is,
uh,

917
00:57:57,611 --> 00:58:02,550
an exploitation of the fourth style of
Roman painting as we know it from palm

918
00:58:02,551 --> 00:58:02,800
pay.

919
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:07,800
There's actually not as much invention
as one would expect it after 79 in Roman

920
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,533
painting.

921
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:15,940
I want to show you very briefly
the insula of the muses,

922
00:58:15,941 --> 00:58:20,650
the insula of the muses in Ostia,
which dates to around 81 30.

923
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,050
Uh, because this is one of the few, uh,

924
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:28,660
single family dwellings that we see
in the second century in Ostia. Uh,

925
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:31,270
you can see if you look at
the plan that it is a range,

926
00:58:31,271 --> 00:58:35,200
not around an atrium but around
a Paris style court here,

927
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,950
although there aren't a columns,
there are these, uh, these, uh,

928
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:41,560
peers as you can see also in plan.

929
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:46,210
But just as we saw in the
late Roman house, the late,

930
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:51,390
how's the late first century Aidy
houses in Herculaneum from between the,

931
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:56,020
the, the, uh, earthquake and
the eruption of Vesuvius, uh,

932
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:59,500
the try Klinean has become the
most important room in the house.

933
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:03,460
You enter into it here. Uh, you have
a vestibule, you have this court,

934
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,820
and then you'll have on access
the try Clinique of the house.

935
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:11,410
But what makes this particular house
most distinctive is the fact that every

936
00:59:11,411 --> 00:59:15,850
single,
every single floor is covered with mosaic.

937
00:59:15,851 --> 00:59:17,750
So as I said to you before,
uh,

938
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:22,820
the black and white mosaic reign
supreme in the city of Osteon,

939
00:59:22,821 --> 00:59:24,560
it's clear that everyone
who could afford it,

940
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,040
a decorated there every room
of their house with mosaic.

941
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:31,400
And although this doesn't come
from this particular house, has,

942
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,560
comes from the house of
Apple layups in osteous,

943
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:35,150
not on your monument
list down to remember it,

944
00:59:35,151 --> 00:59:36,900
but I just wanted to show it to you,
uh,

945
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:39,740
because it's a marvelous
example of what can be done.

946
00:59:39,741 --> 00:59:41,030
I wish it were a little more in focus,

947
00:59:41,031 --> 00:59:43,580
but it's a marvelous example
of what could be done.

948
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:48,470
And was done using black and white mosaic
in Ostia only black and white test to

949
00:59:48,471 --> 00:59:51,870
ride with a Medusa head in the center.
And then if you,

950
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:54,170
this is one of these examples,
uh,

951
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:57,320
illusionistic examples that as
you look at it and focus on it,

952
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,560
it's hard to tell exactly what's,
you know, what's in the foreground,

953
01:00:00,561 --> 01:00:01,520
what's in the background.

954
01:00:01,521 --> 01:00:06,410
It's got that [inaudible] op art effect
that those of you who know our op art of

955
01:00:06,411 --> 01:00:10,610
the 1960s. And I, and I show
you an example of it, a, uh,

956
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,700
a painting from the blaze
series by the AAP artists,

957
01:00:13,701 --> 01:00:16,410
Bridget Riley of the 1960s.
I've,

958
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,420
I've mentioned so many times in the course
of this semester that there isn't the

959
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:24,080
anything that the Romans didn't do, uh,
before anybody else. And this is, uh,

960
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:29,030
an op art is an example of that.
So we do see op art in Ostia, uh,

961
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:32,690
and um,
we see it obviously also much later in,

962
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,970
in more contemporary painting,

963
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,960
another bath structure in Ostia.
This one,

964
01:00:38,961 --> 01:00:43,961
the bads of the seven wise men or
the seven sages dates to a d one 30.

965
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:48,550
I show it to you only to show you this
one circular room and not because it's a

966
01:00:48,551 --> 01:00:52,760
bad building, but rather because it
has a wonderful mosaic on the floor.

967
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,240
I get a circular structure with
a circular mosaic once again,

968
01:00:56,241 --> 01:00:58,580
done in black and white.
And if you look at this,

969
01:00:58,581 --> 01:01:00,860
you can see that what we
have represented here,

970
01:01:00,861 --> 01:01:03,880
I'll show you a detail in a moment,
is a flowering a can't.

971
01:01:03,881 --> 01:01:07,250
This plant that has
intertwined within its leaves,

972
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:12,400
hunters and the hunted hunted animals
and they're hunters in combat as you can

973
01:01:13,251 --> 01:01:14,390
see here.
Uh,

974
01:01:14,391 --> 01:01:18,740
and here's the detail where you can see
once again done entirely in black and

975
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:21,920
white mosaic, the hunters, the animals,

976
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:26,990
very carefully depicted interspersed
among these, uh, these, uh,

977
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:30,230
flowering a canvas plants.
Very effectively done.

978
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:34,760
This is another view of the
bads of Neptune in Ostia,

979
01:01:34,761 --> 01:01:38,240
which we looked at
before dates to 139 a d.

980
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:42,200
And this is a good view because it shows
you not only they, uh, uh, brick face,

981
01:01:42,201 --> 01:01:45,800
concrete construction of these
structures, but also, uh,

982
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:47,980
the mosaics themselves.
Uh,

983
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:52,990
and how every single room of this bath
was covered with black and white mosaic.

984
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:58,460
The PSD raise the stalks. The finest
mosaic in the complex is this one,

985
01:01:58,461 --> 01:02:02,060
and it's the one from which the bath
gets its name, the bads of Neptune.

986
01:02:02,061 --> 01:02:05,120
Because we see Neptune himself
in the center of the scene.

987
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:07,150
It's not surprising that the,
uh,

988
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:12,140
that the god of the sea was chosen as an
appropriate subject for a bath building.

989
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:17,260
We see him here with his trident. That's
how we know it's him being, uh, being, uh,

990
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:21,570
carried along by four horses.
He's holding the reins of those horses.

991
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:26,290
His mantle is billowing up behind him.
One expects to see a cherry at here.

992
01:02:26,291 --> 01:02:29,810
One thinks of this is Neptune in a cherry,
but it's not Neptune in a chariot. Uh,

993
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,970
you can see that these horses,
by the way, aren't fully horses,

994
01:02:32,971 --> 01:02:36,840
but are the front part is a horse
and the rest is a sea creature.

995
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:40,290
And you can see that the
legs of a of Neptune,

996
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:45,150
our interests are interwoven, uh, with
the, with the tail of the sea creature.

997
01:02:45,151 --> 01:02:49,560
He's in fact using the tales of
those sea creatures, almost like,

998
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:54,360
um, uh, you know, I'll miss
like skates or, uh, as he,

999
01:02:54,361 --> 01:02:58,800
as he makes his way along
this or waterskiis I guess
is a better way of putting

1000
01:02:58,801 --> 01:03:03,630
it waterskiis as he makes his way from
right to left across the white background.

1001
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,060
Uh, one of the interesting things about
this mosaic is you see the tension, uh,

1002
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:12,870
in the, in the minds and, and, and,
uh, you know, and work of, of this,

1003
01:03:12,871 --> 01:03:16,110
of this artist, uh, in,
in, out in one hand,

1004
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:19,980
making these very abstract black
shapes against a white background,

1005
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:23,730
but at the same time paying a lot of
attention to the actual musculature,

1006
01:03:23,731 --> 01:03:26,600
to what the chest of the God, uh, uh,

1007
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:30,610
beside and would have looked like. As you
look at [inaudible], there's, you know,

1008
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:34,980
very pronounced musculature that's
carefully done here by the artists.

1009
01:03:34,981 --> 01:03:35,611
Here are our friends.

1010
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:40,590
The dolphins frolicking a dolphins with
cupid's on their back, uh, some fairly,

1011
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:42,900
uh,
other floating figures,

1012
01:03:42,901 --> 01:03:47,550
a female figure on the back of another
sea creature. All of this going on,

1013
01:03:47,551 --> 01:03:51,870
on the floor of the Bas of Neptune.
But what's particularly interesting,

1014
01:03:51,871 --> 01:03:55,140
I think is the same sort of thing
that we saw on the [inaudible] daily

1015
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:56,040
corporates Yoni.

1016
01:03:56,610 --> 01:04:00,810
And that is that the artist has designed
this in such a way that it doesn't

1017
01:04:00,811 --> 01:04:04,890
matter which part of the room you're
standing in, wherever you are standing,

1018
01:04:04,891 --> 01:04:09,420
you can look onto the floor from where
you were standing and see at least some

1019
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:12,030
of the figures head on,
whether you're standing here,

1020
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:15,030
whether you're standing here, whether
you're standing up there or to the right.

1021
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:19,530
You are always seeing some, not all, but
some of the figures head on. So again,

1022
01:04:19,531 --> 01:04:22,030
this is not, this is
done with great care, uh,

1023
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:27,110
and orchestrated to fit the space in
which it was located here at detail of the

1024
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:32,930
mosaic that we just looked at showing
Neptune and his horses and sea creatures.

1025
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:38,210
The most important development
that happens at Ostia, uh,

1026
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:42,930
with regard to residential architecture
later in its history is we do begin to

1027
01:04:42,931 --> 01:04:47,040
see the reemergence of the Domus
already in the second century.

1028
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:51,120
And then even more so in the
third and fourth centuries. A d.

1029
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:56,121
And I want to show you
quickly two examples of that
because they tell us a good

1030
01:04:56,551 --> 01:05:01,551
deal about late residential architecture
in Australia and also by association in

1031
01:05:02,371 --> 01:05:03,204
Rome.

1032
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:08,210
This is the Domus of tuna on an Aria and
acts and a metric view of that house.

1033
01:05:08,641 --> 01:05:13,260
It dates to the late second century Aidy
but was remodeled significantly in the

1034
01:05:13,261 --> 01:05:14,280
fourth century, A. Dot.

1035
01:05:14,281 --> 01:05:17,530
D and I think we really need to think of
it as more a fourth century house then

1036
01:05:17,531 --> 01:05:22,330
as a, um, as a second century
house. And by the way,

1037
01:05:22,331 --> 01:05:26,170
pump Osteo was still thriving
in the third century by the 400.

1038
01:05:26,171 --> 01:05:29,440
By the year 480, it was abandoned,
but in the third century,

1039
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:34,000
still a thriving and early fourth
century is still a thriving city. Uh,

1040
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:37,990
we see this house here. It's a, an
accident metric view from Ward Perkins.

1041
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:42,250
The most important features besides the
fact that it's a single story dwelling,

1042
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:47,080
single family dwelling, is the fact that
it has an open court here with a pool,

1043
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:51,310
that it has a, the [inaudible] idiom as
the most important room of the house.

1044
01:05:51,311 --> 01:05:54,340
So that continues on in
residential architecture,

1045
01:05:54,341 --> 01:05:58,510
but there's a particular taste for
apses in these late Roman buildings.

1046
01:05:58,511 --> 01:06:02,980
You can see that this one has an apps
not so unlike the apps that we saw in

1047
01:06:02,981 --> 01:06:05,590
demolitions palatine palace
on the Palatine Hill.

1048
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:09,060
It is finally starting to
catch on among others. Uh,

1049
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:12,220
we see that you go into
that, uh, that, uh,

1050
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:17,520
that room through a and three arches on
columns a and this idea of supporting a

1051
01:06:18,941 --> 01:06:23,941
triple arch on columns is also a very
popular motif in domestic architecture in

1052
01:06:24,821 --> 01:06:25,810
later antiquity.

1053
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,680
And look also at the fact that on the
left hand side of the track Klinean there

1054
01:06:29,681 --> 01:06:32,980
is a fountain. So the incorporation
of a fountain, a fountain,

1055
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,520
a pool court here,
uh,

1056
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:40,700
a fountain there and Apps try Clint Iom
and then views through triple a triple

1057
01:06:42,011 --> 01:06:43,660
arch is supported by columns,

1058
01:06:43,661 --> 01:06:47,680
all characteristic features of
late Roman domestic architecture.

1059
01:06:47,681 --> 01:06:52,681
This a view obviously through the columns
supporting that triple arch toward the

1060
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:58,900
fountain on the left and toward the
apps in the center of the structure.

1061
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:03,820
Uh, and you can see the remains of marble
revetment real marble revetment. Uh,

1062
01:07:03,821 --> 01:07:08,290
that was used both on the floor for
the pavement and also on the walls.

1063
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:13,390
The other house I want to show you briefly
is the dullness of cupid and psyche.

1064
01:07:13,391 --> 01:07:14,350
The more famous of the,

1065
01:07:14,351 --> 01:07:19,150
to this dates without any question
to late antiquity to around a d 300,

1066
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:23,530
uh, the house of cupid and psyche.
We see at first and plan a,

1067
01:07:23,531 --> 01:07:28,120
and you can see it's very simple
and entranceway here, a long Carter,

1068
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:33,270
a series of cubic ula on either on one
side of that card or there may have been

1069
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:37,390
a second story on a small part of the
house. You can see the stairway there.

1070
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:42,080
As you walk along the card, you
eventually end up in the very large try.

1071
01:07:42,081 --> 01:07:43,120
Klinean so again,

1072
01:07:43,121 --> 01:07:47,620
from the time of the house and the mosaic
Atrium and Herculaneum to hear the try

1073
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,513
Klinean,
uh,

1074
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:52,300
gaining in importance as you walk along
that Carter and you look through a

1075
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:56,860
series of columns supporting arches as
we'll see customary of buildings of this

1076
01:07:56,861 --> 01:08:01,420
time. And then look at this wall,
which is scallops, uh, for a fountain.

1077
01:08:01,421 --> 01:08:05,650
So another one of these fountain courts
that seems to be popular during this

1078
01:08:05,651 --> 01:08:08,860
period. Here's a view into
the room with the lovers,

1079
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:13,420
the famous statue of cupid and psyche.
The young Cuban debate,

1080
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:18,510
little young cupid's cupid and
psyche are embracing one another.

1081
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:22,910
That's from that statute
that the house gets its name,

1082
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:27,790
one of the best preserved marble
reverted rooms in the history. And the,

1083
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:31,400
and the history of Roman
architecture is this room here,

1084
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:35,990
the probably the TriClare diem
in the house of cupid and psyche.

1085
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:40,730
You can see that even marble from the
walls is preserved as well as on the

1086
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:45,731
pavement and on the steps and on the
side of the base of the walls as well.

1087
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:49,040
Brick face, concrete construction
faced with real marble.

1088
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:51,330
What makes this particular house,
uh,

1089
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:55,340
especially appealing besides that
wonderful statue is the fact that although

1090
01:08:55,341 --> 01:08:59,600
there's the usual touches of Maroon and
green that we tend to see in many of

1091
01:08:59,601 --> 01:09:01,220
these Roman pavements.
Uh,

1092
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:05,930
most of the color is a pastel and it
makes it look particularly attractive.

1093
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:10,160
Uh, and it goes particularly nicely
with the red and yellow of the brick

1094
01:09:10,161 --> 01:09:14,540
construction. And I show you a detail
here, uh, of that marble revetment,

1095
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:18,740
which gives you as good an idea as
anything I have shown you this semester of

1096
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:22,340
what the original Hellenistic
palaces of the Kings,

1097
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:27,790
the palaces of Nero and Domitian would
have looked like in their heyday and a

1098
01:09:28,851 --> 01:09:33,380
detail of the statue of cupid and psyche
and the room in which that found itself,

1099
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:36,750
uh, it can still be
seen. They are today, uh,

1100
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:38,780
and the marble revetment once again,

1101
01:09:38,781 --> 01:09:43,580
done in pastel colors of the floor
and of the walls, uh, giving us again,

1102
01:09:43,581 --> 01:09:48,500
an excellent sense, not only a fourth
century domestic architecture decor,

1103
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:52,550
but also what so many of the buildings
that are no longer preserved, well,

1104
01:09:52,551 --> 01:09:55,460
who's revetment is no longer as
well preserved as one would wish.

1105
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:59,750
What they would've looked like in
antiquity, a view through the Carter,

1106
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:01,760
through the columns,
in this case,

1107
01:10:01,761 --> 01:10:06,020
gray granite columns that probably
would have supported an arcade a,

1108
01:10:06,021 --> 01:10:10,310
but then without question,
the fountain on the side of the wall,

1109
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,360
that is scallop, uh, both
down here on the wall itself.

1110
01:10:14,361 --> 01:10:17,270
And then the columns
there do support arches.

1111
01:10:17,271 --> 01:10:20,450
So this whole concept of
columns supporting arches,

1112
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:24,580
very much a part of late
Roman Haus design, uh,

1113
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:29,480
in very few minutes that remain.
I just want to say a few words about,

1114
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:29,930
uh,

1115
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:34,340
we've talked about the life of this port
city I want to talk about since I said

1116
01:10:34,341 --> 01:10:36,230
that lecture was about life and death.

1117
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:41,390
I want to just end with saying a few
words about the tombs in which the people

1118
01:10:41,391 --> 01:10:43,520
who lived here were buried.
Uh,

1119
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:48,530
people all up and down the social
pyramid lived in this commercial center.

1120
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,060
The simplest tombs,

1121
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:53,870
and by the way I mentioned to you already
that there are tombs both outside the

1122
01:10:53,871 --> 01:10:58,010
city of palm pay on the major roads and
then a little bit further away at this

1123
01:10:58,011 --> 01:10:58,880
place called Easel,

1124
01:10:58,881 --> 01:11:03,881
a soccer or the sacred island where one
can see particularly WellPreserved tombs

1125
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:08,950
from those who lived in Ostia of
the second century. Those who the,

1126
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,890
the working poor,
we're buried in very simple tombs of two.

1127
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,220
The upper part of clay am
for is just the upper part.

1128
01:11:17,221 --> 01:11:21,210
They were broken and then the upper part
was stuck with stuck into the ground.

1129
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:23,820
The remains of the person
we're placed below the ground.

1130
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:28,900
And then the spout could be used
to pour wine libations into, uh,

1131
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:33,510
the other simple type was tiles that were
part of the body was placed below and

1132
01:11:33,511 --> 01:11:37,140
then tiles were ranged around
it looking almost like a, uh,

1133
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:38,750
a kind of a house,
uh,

1134
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:41,640
that helped to protect this idea of
the houses of the living in the houses,

1135
01:11:41,641 --> 01:11:44,850
the dead that were meant
to protect the body.

1136
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:48,120
But most of the tombs are
what we call the house type.

1137
01:11:48,121 --> 01:11:51,540
We looked at the house type on the
VOP and the age of Augustus in Rome,

1138
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:55,920
a tomb that resembles a house from the
front with a doorway and a couple of

1139
01:11:55,921 --> 01:11:56,431
windows,

1140
01:11:56,431 --> 01:12:00,930
and then an inscription plaque and
note the use of the travertine jams and

1141
01:12:00,931 --> 01:12:04,350
lintel around it just as we saw
on the markets of Trajan in Rome.

1142
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,080
But if you look at these in this
very good view from the side,

1143
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:10,470
you will see that almost all of
these are barrel vaulted tombs,

1144
01:12:10,471 --> 01:12:14,490
which is characteristic of second
century to market texture at Ostia.

1145
01:12:14,491 --> 01:12:19,491
Add easily Socra these barrel vaulted
structures with facades that make them

1146
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:23,520
look like houses.
Here's a detail of one of them.

1147
01:12:23,521 --> 01:12:28,521
One of these house tombs with again
the travertine jams down below with the

1148
01:12:30,301 --> 01:12:33,210
touch of a pediment up above and
they haven't lost their interest in

1149
01:12:33,211 --> 01:12:34,950
Hellenization to a certain extent.

1150
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:39,450
Windows here slipped windows here and
inscription along inscription plaque that

1151
01:12:39,451 --> 01:12:40,740
tells us who was buried there.

1152
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:44,730
And then very often in these wonderful
tombs for this commercial center,

1153
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:49,440
these panels that are done in terracotta
that tell us something about the

1154
01:12:49,441 --> 01:12:52,920
profession of those who are buried here.
Here's probably a shipper.

1155
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:57,180
I was buried here, someone who made his
money in the import and export business.

1156
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:01,980
And over here you can maybe barely make
out a representation of a mill just as

1157
01:13:01,981 --> 01:13:04,020
those that we would have saw.
I saw on palm payer,

1158
01:13:04,021 --> 01:13:08,010
we saw on the tomb of the baker,
you Rissa keys, a mill with a uh,

1159
01:13:08,011 --> 01:13:13,011
a worker and a mule that is helping
to rotate the mill of the bakery.

1160
01:13:13,231 --> 01:13:17,220
So perhaps a baker also from
this particular family. I've,

1161
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:20,310
I've super imposed a couple
of other terracotta plaques,

1162
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:25,300
making them a little larger here to
show you that these two belong to uh,

1163
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:28,110
people who made their
profession by sharpening knives,

1164
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:31,920
knife sharpeners and they not only
sharpen knives and you can see them both

1165
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:34,110
doing this in this scene,
but they also sold them.

1166
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:35,910
And I love the way in this still life.

1167
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:40,890
They've a raid every possible knife
that you can sharpen here or buy a from

1168
01:13:40,891 --> 01:13:43,920
these individuals. And what do you think
the profession's where of these two?

1169
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:46,930
This one clearly has shopped
someone selling things in a shop.

1170
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:48,750
It looks like vegetables once again,

1171
01:13:48,751 --> 01:13:53,340
asparagus and maybe Broccoli or some
such over there. But what about this one?

1172
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:57,630
What was the profession of
this one? Midwife. Midwife.

1173
01:13:57,631 --> 01:14:00,930
And I love this because here we
have this woman about to give birth.

1174
01:14:00,931 --> 01:14:04,890
She's got another woman I holding her
and giving her support and hear the

1175
01:14:04,891 --> 01:14:09,150
midwife instead of looking at what
she's doing, she's reaching in,

1176
01:14:09,151 --> 01:14:10,430
but she's not. She's, she's,

1177
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,750
instead of looking at what she's
supposed to be concentrating on,

1178
01:14:13,751 --> 01:14:17,800
she's looking out at the spectator just
to make sure that we don't forget her

1179
01:14:17,801 --> 01:14:18,790
features.
Uh,

1180
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:23,200
for posterity on this tomb
relief from her tomb in Ostia,

1181
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:25,060
uh,

1182
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:29,770
we saw columbaria these underground
columbaria with these niches where they

1183
01:14:29,771 --> 01:14:33,160
placed the cremated remains of
the deceased and had inscriptions.

1184
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,750
We see the same sort of thing in the
interiors of tombs that Ostia but they are

1185
01:14:37,751 --> 01:14:41,440
on, they are above ground rather
than subterranean at Ostia.

1186
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:42,910
And we also see,

1187
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:46,540
and basically the last point I want
to make today is we also see in the

1188
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:51,160
interiors of these tombs that osteon
not only those niches for the cremated

1189
01:14:51,161 --> 01:14:53,290
remains,
but it's in the second century ID,

1190
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:58,010
the time of Hadrian on that information,
burial becomes the norm, uh,

1191
01:14:58,011 --> 01:15:02,260
largely on, under the influence of
the spread of Christianity. The idea,

1192
01:15:02,261 --> 01:15:05,440
the of the stole soul
needs to ascend to heaven.

1193
01:15:05,441 --> 01:15:07,870
And so you have to maintain
the bodily remains.

1194
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:12,430
And so we begin to see in these
interiors what we call Arca Soliah, arc,

1195
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:16,150
Arco, AARC, O, s, O, l, I, a Arco Soliah,

1196
01:15:16,151 --> 01:15:19,960
which are these much larger
niches where bodies are placed,

1197
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:21,190
bodies are buried,

1198
01:15:21,191 --> 01:15:25,060
and then they are covered over with
a marble slab that might have the

1199
01:15:25,061 --> 01:15:28,960
inscription naming the deceased
or, uh, a figural scene.

1200
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:30,790
And just in closing,

1201
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:33,880
to show you one last tomb that
we're going to look at next time,

1202
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:37,480
the tomb of the [inaudible] II
and the Vatican cemetery in Rome.

1203
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:42,690
I to show you that these concrete brick
faced build as tombs with windows and

1204
01:15:43,181 --> 01:15:48,181
with very elaborate interiors also
begin to be put up in Rome in the second

1205
01:15:48,521 --> 01:15:50,260
century ID.
We'll look at those.

1206
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:54,130
We'll look at the title of next
time's lecture is bigger, is better.

1207
01:15:54,131 --> 01:15:57,970
We're really going to culminate our
move toward larger and more grandiose

1208
01:15:57,971 --> 01:15:58,804
buildings then.

1209
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:03,850
And then on Thursday we will finally move
out to the provinces by studying, uh,

1210
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:07,600
Roman architecture in Roman North Africa.
Thank you.
