1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,093
Good morning.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,300
From the time of Julius Caesar.

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:12,110
We have seen the rulers of Rome Brag
about building buildings that were bigger

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,550
than any others in the world.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,480
You'll remember Cesar referred to his,
uh,

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,430
to his temple of Mars in that way that
he was building the largest temple of

7
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:25,130
Mars in the world.
Uh,

8
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:30,131
and we also saw the same for demission
with his palace on the Palatine Hill for

9
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:34,860
Trajan with his enormous forum
for, uh, Hadrian building,

10
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:38,820
the greatest largest dome that
had been built up until that time.

11
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,030
And as we discussed,
uh,

12
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:45,031
still the largest diameter dome in the
city of Rome today and Hadrian's villa at

13
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:45,871
Tivoli.

14
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:50,871
Just as a selection of examples we're
going to see today that have bigger,

15
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:54,180
was better,
biggest is best.

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,990
And in the case of the Emperor Caracalla,
uh,

17
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:02,991
an emperor who was a
megalomaniac megalomaniac in the,

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,540
in the tradition of Nero and Domitian,

19
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,410
that he built the largest
imperial bath structure to date.

20
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,390
And we're going to be looking at
that bath structure today. Uh,

21
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:19,170
and we're going to see it is really a
colossal and fascinating building in all

22
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:22,050
kinds of ways. But before
I get to that, in fact,

23
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:25,980
we'll end with that bath structured today.
Before I get to that,

24
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:30,981
I would like to look with
you at a architecture in
Rome in the second and third

25
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,380
centuries.

26
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,380
Ady and we'll see that architecture is
quite varied in terms of whether it's

27
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:42,210
private, it's civic.
Uh, it's also funerary.

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,140
I want to,
uh,

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,680
begin though by just reminding you
of what we talked about last time.

30
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:53,430
We looked at the city of Australia
and we looked at the city of Osteo,

31
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:57,570
the port of Rome in its entirety.
Once again, it's public buildings,

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,490
it's civic structures, it's
commercial enterprises. Uh,

33
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,820
and we also went at the very end of the
lecture out to easily software where the

34
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:09,120
tombs of the, of the, uh, of the,

35
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:13,230
of those who lived in
an Osteo were located.

36
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,360
And I show you a couple of those again
now on the screen. These brick face tombs,

37
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:22,980
these tombs that are made of concrete
at easily Socra that were put up for the

38
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:26,010
professionals, but the
traders, the commercial,

39
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:29,480
a merchants and so on that
lived in the city of Ostia. Uh,

40
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,980
they were made of brick,
face, concrete construction.

41
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:35,430
They had barrel bolts or
groin vaults inside. I do,

42
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:38,550
can see also that they
were faced with brick, uh,

43
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,580
and they were faced with brick
as we discussed that was exposed,

44
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,490
the idea of brick being
attractive in its own right,

45
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:48,170
if a fabulously beautiful facing,
uh,

46
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,150
that they take advantage
of in the second century,

47
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:56,100
a d a and decide not to stucco it over.
As you can see so well here,

48
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,520
the doorways into those tombs,
uh,

49
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,520
surrounded by travertine jams and
lintels the inscription in the center,

50
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:08,290
the small slit windows, and then,
uh, a pediment at the top. Uh,

51
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,700
we saw when we looked at funerary
architecture in the age of Augustus,

52
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:14,530
for example,
that it was very varied,

53
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,890
very varied p peer to tombs and the shape
of pyramids in the shape of a circular

54
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:24,490
tombs tombs that made reference to
bakeries like the tomb of the baker,

55
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:25,324
your Rissa keys.

56
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,530
There is still a certain amount of
variety in to market texture in the second

57
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:34,360
century, a d, but they tend to
hone in on one type in particular.

58
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,060
And that type is the so
called house to him type,

59
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,680
which is exactly what we see here at
tomb that is rectangular in shape for the

60
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:46,630
most part box like a and does
resemble very closely a house.

61
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:50,080
This close relationship that we've
talked about so many times this semester

62
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:53,500
between houses of the living
and houses of the debt.

63
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,760
So we looked at those last time and
where I want to begin today is just to

64
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:02,761
demonstrate to you that these same kinds
of house tombs that we see in Ostia and

65
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:07,951
easily soft grow in the second
century d we also see in Rome,

66
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,131
uh,

67
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:14,131
and in some cases they are commissioned
by individuals of comparable a social

68
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,180
status to those in Ostia,

69
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:19,840
but sometimes they are
commissioned by the most elite.

70
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,970
And I'd like to begin with an example of
a similar tomb commissioned by the most

71
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:29,770
elite. This is the so called
tomb of [inaudible] in Rome.

72
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:33,130
It was put up on the famous
via Apia or the Apia Ian Way.

73
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,930
It dates to around a d 161 in this case,

74
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:42,400
we know who the commissioner was and I
can show you what he looked like as well.

75
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:45,340
You see him here on the right
hand side of the screen.

76
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,910
He was a man by the name of her roadies.
Atticus.

77
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:53,500
I put his name on the monument
lists for you. Her roadies,
Atticus, uh, her roadies.

78
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:58,180
Atticus was actually a Greek. He was
Athenian, the Greek part of the empire.

79
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:00,280
He lived in Athens for the most part,

80
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:04,270
and he commissioned a very
famous music hall and Odi on,

81
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:08,830
which still survives a, you can see it
over here. It's without his roof today,

82
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:13,750
but it was originally one of these roofed
music halls in Odi on it is located on

83
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:17,980
the slope of the Acropolis in Athens.
The Acropolis that of course,

84
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:22,981
we know primarily for its
great architectural feats
of the fifth century BC in

85
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:28,600
Greece. This is the Roman building put
up by her roadies in the second century.

86
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,150
Uh, and we see it on the
slope of the Acropolis,

87
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:33,310
very well preserved in modern times.

88
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:38,311
It's great as fame is the fact that
Jani performed his live at the Acropolis

89
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:43,110
concert, uh, at the Odi on of a Agrippa.

90
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:46,690
And even if you have a roadies addict is,
and even if you don't like Jani,

91
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:51,530
it's actually quite an interesting, a
concert to view and one can view it, uh,

92
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,480
in video and so on,
uh,

93
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,460
because it does take such wonderful
advantage of this extraordinary,

94
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,740
uh, ancient structure, as you know,
and he presents his music. At any rate,

95
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,450
uh, at one point, her roadies advocates
who had a lot of, um, connections,

96
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,970
not only in Athens but around
the empire at one point, uh,

97
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,340
through those connections, he gets
himself appointed a senator in Rome.

98
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,500
And in order to take up that position,
he needs to leave Athens, uh, behind, uh,

99
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:25,460
and go spend some time in Rome.
And he and his wife Andrea Magilla,

100
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:27,590
a set up house in Rome,

101
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,900
a Antia Magilla unfortunately dies in
Rome and he needs to bury her and he

102
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:36,470
decides to bury her in
Rome instead of in Athens.

103
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,030
And he bills for her,
a tomb on the,

104
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,940
on the [inaudible] way on the
via Apia in around 161 ID.

105
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:47,360
That's the date, the date
that we believe she died. Uh,

106
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:51,940
and we see a, a, a view of that, uh,

107
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,620
of that tomb here.
What we're looking at,

108
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:57,410
and you probably recognize this already
because we've looked at a number of

109
00:06:57,411 --> 00:07:02,411
models from this museum of casts and
roam the Museo del achievable tall Romana

110
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:04,430
in ar in Rome.

111
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:09,350
And I show you two views of this model
of the tomb of Ani regular one that we

112
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:13,520
see from the front and another that we
see from if we're facing the monument,

113
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:15,710
the left side of the tomb.

114
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,090
And these are extremely helpful because
they give us a very good sense of what

115
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:21,200
we are dealing with here.

116
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,330
It is clear that we are dealing with a
tumor type that is not that different

117
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,070
from what we saw in Austria.

118
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:33,050
Although this looks more like a temple
then it looks like a house and you can

119
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:36,860
see that right off it looks exactly
like a typical Roman temple.

120
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:40,580
We see that it is on a high podium.
It has a deep porch,

121
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:42,800
it has a freestanding
columns in that porch.

122
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,980
It has a single staircase on the front
of the structure has facade orientation a

123
00:07:48,871 --> 00:07:51,020
than an entrance way into the structure.

124
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,440
It also has freestanding
columns that support a pediment.

125
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:58,730
So if I were to show you this, uh, and,
and not identify it and say, do you,

126
00:07:58,731 --> 00:07:59,960
what kind of a building is,
is,

127
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:03,380
I'm sure you would've said it was a temple
and you would have been right in the

128
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:05,570
sense that it looks most like a temple,

129
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,260
but it is a tomb in the form of a temple.

130
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,010
As you can see here,
uh, looking on the, uh,

131
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:14,750
on the side of the monument,

132
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:19,070
you can also see those same features
that I've just described. And while, uh,

133
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,920
we are looking at this view because
I'm not going to bring it back,

134
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,550
I want to point out one detail that
will loom large as we look further at,

135
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,370
at this structure.
Uh,

136
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,250
you will see on the left side of the,
uh,

137
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:35,730
of the of the tomb that the architect has,
uh,

138
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,460
has created, has kind of scalloped
out the side, uh, on either side,

139
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:43,490
creating niches, told
niches on, on the side,

140
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:48,320
and placed columns into that space,
which is a very unusual thing to do.

141
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:50,600
It's not true on the other
side of the monument,

142
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:53,720
only on this side of the structure.
Uh,

143
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:57,690
why has the architect that I
think it might have something
to do with the siding,

144
00:08:57,691 --> 00:08:59,730
perhaps how you viewed it from the street.

145
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,170
Maybe it was skewed in such a way that
you would see not only the facade but

146
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:08,950
also the side. And he wanted to
emphasize the, uh, the, um, the, the,

147
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,020
the columns on that particular
side of the structure.

148
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,230
But it may also have just tapped to
do with, with a quirk, with this, uh,

149
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:18,870
particular interest that the,
uh,

150
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:23,871
that the architect or the patron had in
doing something different than any other

151
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:26,790
tomb. And I want to re, uh,
return to that point in a moment.

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,740
But most significant of all is that
in terms of the building technique,

153
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:34,500
the use of concrete
faced with exposed brick,

154
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:37,870
this is exactly what we saw in Ostia.
Uh,

155
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,200
and you can see that just as an Australia,

156
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,180
they have taken that brick as far as it
can go in terms of its aesthetic value,

157
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,150
uh,
by respecting the texture of the brick,

158
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:51,060
playing that texture off a play in color,

159
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:55,500
different colored bricks of reddish brick
against a more yellowish colored brick,

160
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:57,700
playing those off against one another.
Uh,

161
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,280
and then adding certain very highly
decorative decorative details, uh,

162
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,580
like a meander pattern that we're
going to see in a moment, uh,

163
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:10,581
and decoration around the windows
of the tomb done in Stucco.

164
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:16,110
The columns however, are marble columns
are marble. And in that sense, again,

165
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:19,530
something somewhat different
than what we saw at Ostia.

166
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,830
This is a view of the
tomb as it looks today.

167
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:26,520
The porch is not WellPreserved
and I can't show you any of that,

168
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:30,390
but I can show you the rest of the
structure and you can see it quite well in

169
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:32,430
this particular view. Uh, and again,

170
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:36,540
you see that it is indeed WellPreserved
concrete construction phase with brick

171
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,490
brick left exposed,
a respected and enjoyed in its own right.

172
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,900
What I've already described,

173
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:45,720
the playing off of one color
of brick against another,

174
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:49,800
this meander pattern done and
Stucco stucco declaration,

175
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:54,801
very elaborate decoration as we're
going to see a around the windows tall

176
00:10:55,201 --> 00:11:00,000
podium. We see that here as well.
Uh, and extraordinary structure.

177
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,760
And what's interesting,
I think to note, uh,

178
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,830
at least culturally and in terms of social
status is the fact that although this

179
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:11,960
structure was put up for one
of the most wealthy men, uh,

180
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,890
in or the wife of one of the most wealthy
men in Rome at this particular time,

181
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:21,870
the general aesthetic is very similar to
what we saw for professional people in

182
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,860
the city of Ostia.

183
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:27,720
That is a concrete tomb in the form of
a house or a temple in this case, uh,

184
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:31,070
that is co that that has
as its facing brick, uh,

185
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:35,010
and a respect for that
brick in its own right here.

186
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:36,240
A couple of details.

187
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:39,970
I show you once again a detail
of the warehouse or the array a,

188
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,790
a Gothy Yanna at,
uh,

189
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,850
Ostia that we looked at a and also a
detail of the tomb of [inaudible] in Rome.

190
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,690
And I think you can see here what I mean.
Again,

191
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:54,400
the different coloration
of the yellowish brick,

192
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:57,100
the reddish brick played
off one against the other,

193
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,060
the use of a stucco
decoration in this case, uh,

194
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:05,620
for the volumes of the composite
capitals. Uh, in this case. And in fact,

195
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,160
in fact you'll remember I pointed out
what was interesting about these capitals

196
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,800
at the warehouse was that they were,

197
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,020
that the brick was used to make
up the main body of the, uh,

198
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:18,910
of the capitol.
And this is not one of them,

199
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:23,911
but I also showed you one where you could
see the way in which that brick form

200
00:12:23,961 --> 00:12:27,190
the actual a campus leaves of the Capitol,

201
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,560
and then the volume it's added and Stucco.

202
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,850
We see the same thing at the tomb of
Antioch. Magilla we see those here.

203
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,930
I think you can see it.
Well,

204
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:39,550
the brick used to create the lower part
of the campus leaves and then Stucco

205
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,450
added for the curving part and for
some of the additional decoration,

206
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:47,320
the flower and so on, up above.
Uh, and so we see, and here again,

207
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,320
very elaborate decoration around the
windows, which we also saw at, uh,

208
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,380
the,
um,

209
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,210
warehouse in Ostia to more details
of the tomb of Ani irregular. Here.

210
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,640
You see what I was talking about before,
the way they,

211
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,430
the architect has scooped out to
areas on the left side of this,

212
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,480
of the tomb and place the columns
inside of those, which is a unique,

213
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:13,810
I don't know of any other example
of this enrollment architecture.

214
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:18,460
And it underscores once again that
when it came to two markitecture, uh,

215
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:19,360
that the,
uh,

216
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:22,750
that the patron could pretty much
do whatever he wanted as long as the

217
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,840
architects could build it.
Uh, it could, it could,

218
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,660
it could be quite idiosyncratic
as a form of architecture.

219
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,800
And we see not only has he scooped
out these niches in which to place the

220
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:33,520
columns,

221
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,210
but if you look at those columns very
carefully and at the bases of those

222
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:41,580
columns, you will see that they are
not round, they are multi-sided. Uh,

223
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:46,280
and the bases are also multi-sided.
So doing something very unique, uh,

224
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,650
in the context of this particular tomb.
A of an irregular.

225
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:52,030
So two main points,

226
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:57,031
one that there is clearly an aesthetic
that is used a four to market texture

227
00:13:57,131 --> 00:13:58,880
concrete faced with brick,
uh,

228
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,990
that is used in the upper
most levels of Roman society.

229
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:06,870
And then further down in Roman society,
not only in Rome but also in Ostia.

230
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,060
Uh, but at the same
time, uh, individuality,

231
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:15,061
eccentricity is valued into marketecture
allowed into market texture in a way

232
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:20,080
that perhaps it isn't in other forms
of Roman architecture. And we see it,

233
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:25,180
uh, taken to its limit in this particular
building. I just a few more details.

234
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,350
We see a niche from the
tomb of Annie Magilla.

235
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,370
We also see here both the meander pattern
and this very elaborate decoration

236
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,060
around the windows,
uh,

237
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:40,070
a frame around the windows and then a
projecting element up above with these

238
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:43,030
great spiral volumes on either side.

239
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,830
Very similar to the same sort of
thing that was happening at Ostia.

240
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:51,060
I remind you of the niche in the
courtyard of the [inaudible],

241
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,950
the warehouses at Ostia where you see
the same sort of thing. Uh, these, uh,

242
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,690
stucco co, uh, pilasters added and Stucco,

243
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,900
the brick work creating
triangles and laws and Jews.

244
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:09,500
As you can see here, same idea over
here in the tomb of [inaudible] gala.

245
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,460
And if you look very closely at the
pediment that is located above the niche

246
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,810
from the tomb in Rome,
uh,

247
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,630
you see the projecting and
tablatures you see where the Co,

248
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,930
the capital's would have been.

249
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,640
There would also have been either call
probably columns added here on either

250
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:28,370
side of the niche,
making it look much more similar to here,

251
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,140
but look closely at the pediment.

252
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:34,820
You will see that there is projecting
and tablature on odd above each column.

253
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:38,990
But then in the center the
triangular pediment is cut back. Uh,

254
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:43,730
and that playing around with the
traditional vocabulary of architecture is

255
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:47,540
something that I've noted is going to
be a part of what we call the baroque

256
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,370
trend in Roman architecture.

257
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:53,720
I'm going to devote an entire lecture to
the baroque trend in Roman architecture

258
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:57,650
around the empire, not just enrollment,
but mostly in the provinces.

259
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,570
And we'll see that same sort of thing,

260
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:04,190
which creates a kind of in and
out a lively movement, uh, to the,

261
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:08,660
uh, to the facade that
is part of that approach.

262
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,580
The tomb itself again. Uh, and just
to point out, interestingly enough,

263
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,590
a couple of female figures with capital's
on there on the top of their head or

264
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,940
what looked like maybe more like
vases on the top of their head. Uh,

265
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,130
but looking very much like [inaudible].

266
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,090
It's like the car he audits we saw from
the Eric theone and Athens fifth century

267
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:34,030
BC from the forum of Augustus and from
Hadrian's villa around the Sarah pm.

268
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,360
Uh, they are not, they are not
duplicates of those in Athens.

269
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,260
Like the other two are a, but they
do seem to make reference to them.

270
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:44,930
They're a bit more casual. When
I look at these, this pair,

271
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:47,870
they always look to me like they're
kind of standing at a cocktail party

272
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:52,871
together and conversing with one another
using the usual adjusters that Italians

273
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:57,740
are so famous for. We see them doing
that sort of thing here, but even,

274
00:16:57,741 --> 00:16:59,900
but they do seem to
have that same pedigree.

275
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:02,240
Going back to the whole idea of the car,

276
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:03,770
he audits and I only mentioned it to you,

277
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:07,130
they were found right near this
tomb and so it has been speculated,

278
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:10,760
although it is by no means certain that
they might have belonged to the tomb.

279
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:12,950
They might've been located
in front of the tumor,

280
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:17,951
had been some kind of for part of some
kind of for court or for space to that

281
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:20,930
tomb.
It's pure conjecture,

282
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:24,460
but it would be interesting if it were
the case because remember her odis addict

283
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,640
has comes from Athens.

284
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,950
We see that the tomb is a thoroughly
Roman tomb of the second century, a d.

285
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:31,340
Uh,

286
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,120
but it would be interesting to think that
he might have added some touches that

287
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:39,080
might have made some reference a for him
and also especially for his wife was to

288
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:43,460
him. It was a to the Athens
of his, uh, of his birth

289
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,680
with regard to tomb interiors in
the second century. Aidy in Rome.

290
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:53,460
There are two major types and I
want to treat both of those today.

291
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,820
One of them is a type that we've seen
before and that is where you stuck over

292
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:01,600
the interior of the tomb.
You will,

293
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,620
you stop it over and then you add
additional stucco in relief to a form,

294
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:12,810
the decoration and then you paint it.
Uh, that's one type. And the second type,

295
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,340
which might also use that for
the bald but for the walls.

296
00:18:17,341 --> 00:18:21,660
The second type is to use
instead architectural members,

297
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,700
columns, uh, pediments and the
like to enliven the wall, uh,

298
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:29,160
and to create a much
more sculptural effect.

299
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,760
Both of these types are used
in Rome in the second century,

300
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:37,380
Aidy in to market texture. And I want to
show you examples of both of them today.

301
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,850
The first type one a with
stucco painted stucco.

302
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:45,990
We see in the so called tomb of the
Valarie, the tumor, the Valarie,

303
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:50,991
which dates to around a d 159 and is
located on the via Latina and in Rome.

304
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:57,090
We haven't looked at the,
uh, via Latina before. Uh,

305
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,150
but it is one of Rome's main streets
that had a long it a cemeteries and there

306
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:06,990
are a fair number of concrete tombs
faced with brick that are preserved very

307
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,600
well preserved on the via Latina today.

308
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,800
And what makes them particularly
special is the interiors are, uh, are,

309
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,240
are almost pristine. It's
quite extraordinary to go
into these and see how uh,

310
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,000
how well they have stood the test
of time. The tumor, the Valarie,

311
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:27,050
you see the lunette and the vault of
the interior of that tomb right here.

312
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,490
Uh, and uh, as you look at the, a
canvas leaves growing up in the, uh,

313
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:37,140
in the Lunette all done in stucco
relief and the barrel vault with its

314
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:42,141
individual compartments round and square
compartments with floating figures

315
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:46,410
inside. I, you should
certainly be reminded of things
we've already seen before.

316
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:48,060
When one looks at the Qantas leaves,

317
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,960
one ha can't help but think back to the
delicate leaves of the Arra pockets.

318
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:54,990
The delicate, a canvas leaves of
the Arra pop is our boost die.

319
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,400
Would you see on the left hand side
of the screen, and I'm sure you are,

320
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:02,460
as reminded is I am looking at this,
uh,

321
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,300
bald by other things that we
have seen earlier this semester.

322
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,230
What's this over here?
The domus salary.

323
00:20:10,231 --> 00:20:11,940
It's one of the vaults
of the domus salary,

324
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:16,600
a third style done we believe
by fabulous himself. Uh,

325
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:18,600
and you'll recall very delicate,

326
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:21,570
very light floral motifs
compartments in this case,

327
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:24,720
rectangular with floating
sea creatures in the center.

328
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,360
We see exactly the same
sort of thing here,

329
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,640
although done in stucco instead of paint,

330
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:34,641
but this was painted originally
in antiquity and we see
these floating these new

331
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:37,590
ads on the back of sea creatures,
uh,

332
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,600
in inside floating inside these.
And we think the message here of course,

333
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:47,601
is of the soul of the deceased being
carried to the isles of the blessed by

334
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:52,930
these sea creatures. So very much
stucco decorations, second century, a d,

335
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:56,650
but very dependent on third style,
a Roman,

336
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,080
a wall painting and third style deck
stucco decoration of earlier dates,

337
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:06,760
uh, the tomb of the punk Crotty
in Rome, which dates to one 69.

338
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,760
Also on the via Latina has similar
similarly WellPreserved stucco decoration

339
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:13,631
also painted.

340
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:17,350
And I'll show you a color view in a
moment for you to get a sense of that

341
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:21,820
coloration. Uh, but here you get an idea
of the scheme of the wall. Very, very,

342
00:21:21,821 --> 00:21:25,030
very elaborate stuccoed over stucco.

343
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:29,410
Much of the Stucco is done in relief.
You can see it here if the, uh,

344
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,440
if the stucco decoration
of the tomb of the Valarie,

345
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:34,570
he made reference to the third style.

346
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:37,060
I think the inspiration
here was fourth style,

347
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,490
a Roman wall painting and
stucco decoration. Uh,

348
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:45,040
because although you continue to see
floating mythological figures in these

349
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:48,880
rectangular or triangular compartments,
if you look very closely,

350
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:50,560
especially in this zone here,

351
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:55,060
you will also see these
architectural cages done in stucco.

352
00:21:55,061 --> 00:22:00,061
Very similar to the architecturals cages
that we saw at the top of fourth style

353
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,130
Roman wall design.

354
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,580
So this taking its cue from
four style Roman wall painting.

355
00:22:06,581 --> 00:22:10,510
And I had mentioned to you a couple of
times already this term that in fact most

356
00:22:10,511 --> 00:22:15,511
Pompei it most postpone pay and painting
and Stucco decoration post 79 a d a

357
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,270
does seem to be inspired
by the third style,

358
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:23,050
but even more so by the fourth
style of Roman wall painting.

359
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:28,051
And we see that very well here with this
stucco decorating the Lou nets and also

360
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:29,590
the vaulting.

361
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:34,780
Here's a view in color of the
interior of the tomb of the pond,

362
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:36,050
Crotty e,
uh,

363
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:40,240
where you can see the same sort of
scheme that I've already described,

364
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:41,290
but with the color.

365
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:46,330
And you can also see that we are dealing
here with a groin vaulted interior. Uh,

366
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,320
and uh,

367
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,340
what's interesting is that sometimes the
walls have a small niches for urns and

368
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:56,680
the so called Arca Soliah.
I've mentioned those to you before,

369
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,200
that were used for the placement
of bodies once inhumane, uh,

370
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,050
became as popular in deed even
more popular than cremation.

371
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,950
But we also sometimes see
the sarcophagi themselves,

372
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:13,660
the free standing coffins, uh,
located in these tombs as we see here.

373
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,470
And it's interesting to keep in mind
that all of the money and time that was

374
00:23:17,471 --> 00:23:20,260
expended on this interior decoration,

375
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,460
keep in mind that very few
people entered into these tombs.

376
00:23:23,461 --> 00:23:26,170
When you looked at a tomb you
saw primarily it's exterior,

377
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:29,620
some family members on special
occasions might go inside,

378
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:34,570
but it was relatively rare. So all of
this, all of this done in fact to give uh,

379
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,100
the, the deceased, uh,

380
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,320
a pleasant home in perpetuity and to help
them on their journey to the isles of

381
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:46,100
the blessed this, this structure also
has sea creatures, uh, depicted in it.

382
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,540
So travel is clearly also alluded to
and scholars who have worked on this

383
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:55,541
particular monument in particular have
noted that they think it has to do with

384
00:23:55,671 --> 00:24:00,290
one of these secret mystery religions. In
this case, the orphan, O, r, p, h. I. C,

385
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,333
the orphan,

386
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,360
a religion that was practiced in secret
initially and then eventually came up

387
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:11,531
above ground to more details of
the upon Crotty ceilings in Stucco.

388
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:12,381
These,

389
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:16,490
I think give you a particularly good
sense of the way in which they were built

390
00:24:16,491 --> 00:24:21,380
up almost as reliefs. And some
parts of the scenes, uh, this, uh,

391
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:25,340
this figure here for example,
at some of the rest was painted.

392
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:29,570
We see heraldic leopards over
here on either side of a boss,

393
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,370
the shell and the niche, also
done in Stucco and raised
in a very sculptural way.

394
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:34,760
Uh,

395
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,760
and then the whole painted in a variety
of attractive maroons and blues and

396
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,203
Greens.

397
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:47,170
The most interesting to him from my
point of view actually, uh, is uh,

398
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,920
a tomb that is located a Roman tomb
of the second century that is located

399
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:54,470
beneath the Vatican today.

400
00:24:54,471 --> 00:24:59,471
And I show you a view again of the Dome
of Saint Peter's Cathedral in Rome,

401
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:02,630
designed by Michelangelo himself.

402
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,720
Another view over here showing
also Michelangelo's Dome, uh,

403
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:11,670
but showing below it the so-called
ball, the Kino, uh, that was, uh,

404
00:25:11,671 --> 00:25:16,671
put up by the famous 17th century
Italian architect Borromini Francesco

405
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,040
Borromini, uh, the, uh,

406
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,980
the Cathedral of Saint Peter's
in any of you who've been there.

407
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:25,310
I will agree with me on this as one
of the great wonders of the world.

408
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:26,091
There's no question.

409
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,750
It is if you want to talk about
bigger is better or biggest is best.

410
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:35,070
This is a truly a colossal buildings.
Any of you have been there? No. Uh,

411
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,690
but it does give me occasion to mention
as I've mentioned a couple of times

412
00:25:38,691 --> 00:25:42,020
already this term that one of the really
great things to do when you visit Rome

413
00:25:42,021 --> 00:25:44,060
is decline things is to climb.

414
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:48,290
If you're so lucky to climb the column
of Trajan or the Pantheon up to the Dome,

415
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,240
those you'd have to get
special permission to do.

416
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:52,610
But what you don't need special
permission to do. And one is,

417
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:57,680
it is one of the great climbs in Rome is
to go up Saint Peters and you can go up

418
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,340
Saint Peter's either on the
outside of the building, uh,

419
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,700
to various levels from which you can
see some of the greatest views of Rome,

420
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:07,970
including back over central Rome,
ancient Rome,

421
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:09,650
all the buildings that
we've been talking about.

422
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,570
You can see the dome of the Pantheon
from the top of Saint Peter's.

423
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,150
And you can see the victor of
manual monument, tall and proud, uh,

424
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:20,000
from the dome of Saint Peter's.
But you can also climb up to the,

425
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:24,140
to the dome from the inside, which is
an another extraordinary experience.

426
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:25,970
You can go almost,
not quite,

427
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:30,840
but almost to the apex of Michelangelo's
Dome, Walk Around a Carter.

428
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,720
Uh, they are, and look down on, uh,
Bernini's Baldor keynote. So, uh,

429
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:39,650
for those of you who are going to Rome
anytime soon or in the future, uh, it's a,

430
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:42,320
it's a not to be missed
experience to climb, uh,

431
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:47,350
the Cathedral of Saint Peter's on
the outside and also on the inside.

432
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,760
I bring you to Saint Peter's because w
one can also go down underneath Saint

433
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:53,011
Peter's.

434
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:56,930
And that's another very interesting
experience to go down in the depths of

435
00:26:56,931 --> 00:27:00,600
beneath Saint Peter's and get a
really great sense of the centuries of

436
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:05,601
civilization that had been piled one on
top of another from ancient Rome or from

437
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:09,600
the time of Romulus, indeed,
all the way up to today. Uh,

438
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:12,990
and in order to see the
tomb of the [inaudible],

439
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:14,790
which is a tomb that I want to turn to,
now,

440
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:18,420
you do have to go down underneath
Saint Peters. You, you have to,

441
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:20,970
this is something you can't just walk it,
you can climb,

442
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,190
you can climb Saint Peter's
any day of the week,

443
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,470
but if you want to go
underneath Saint Peter's,

444
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:27,630
you have to make special arrangements.
Uh,

445
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:31,320
you have to get special tickets to do
that. And now one can do that online.

446
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:32,910
You can plan that online.
Uh,

447
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:37,710
and you can get tickets to go to the so
called Vatican cemeteries a underneath,

448
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,430
underneath. And they don't have them.
They have a small number of hours on,

449
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,200
on a variety of days.

450
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,850
So it is something one needs to plan
for well in advance, but you can do it.

451
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,630
You go to the left of
the ball at the Kino,

452
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,890
you go down and you go
down century upon century.

453
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:57,300
You see primarily the tombs of the pope's,
the crips with the tombs of the popes.

454
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,550
And I show you Pope Boniface here,

455
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,650
just to give you an idea of what some of
these look like lying in eternity here

456
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:09,651
on the top of his sarcophagus or a space
sculptured portrait of him on the top

457
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:14,010
of his sarcophagus. But if you go all
the way down, all the way down in,

458
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:16,680
most tourists don't do this.
But if you go all the way to the bottom,

459
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,940
what you end up with is one of
Rome's great tomb streets. Uh,

460
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:24,390
and this tomb street was out in the
light of day, of course in antiquity,

461
00:28:24,391 --> 00:28:29,190
like all the other tunes,
streets. But because of the
passage of time, because, uh,

462
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,830
other buildings that were built on top,
primarily the cathedral of Saint Peters,

463
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,830
uh, and just the, the rising ground
level over time, it now is, uh,

464
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,210
it is subterranean. But when you, it's
amazing, you go down, you walk along it,

465
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:45,480
it is like you are. Well, I mean it's
a dark street. Uh, but nonetheless,

466
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:50,310
I wouldn't want it. I wouldn't
want to record that in that,
uh, in that street. Uh,

467
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,640
but, uh, you go down under,
it's a dark street, but it is,

468
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:58,140
you feel like you are walking along
a major, a tomb street in Rome,

469
00:28:58,141 --> 00:28:59,070
and indeed you are.

470
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,730
And I show you a plan of it here so
that you can see it is very much like

471
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:06,660
walking along the tomb street in east la
soccer. You see at your left and right,

472
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:07,770
uh, these, uh,

473
00:29:07,771 --> 00:29:12,650
these concrete brick face
tombs that looked very much
like the tumor [inaudible]

474
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:15,200
Magilla or the ones that
we saw in Isla Socra,

475
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,110
a typical house tombs
of the second century,

476
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,510
a d one of the,

477
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:26,520
one of the tombs that is located down
there has long been thought by scholars

478
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,890
and believers to be the tomb of St Peter.
Uh,

479
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,590
no one has been able to prove
this. Incontrovertibly but
there is fair, you know,

480
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:38,070
there is some interesting
evidence both pro and con. Uh,

481
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:42,420
and it has been thought and you
know, uh, Peters famous, uh,

482
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,210
statement, uh, you know, upon this
rock, I shall build this church,

483
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,930
namely the Church of Saint
Peters. Uh, we believe, uh,

484
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,520
that when Constantine
the last pagan emperor,

485
00:29:52,521 --> 00:29:55,750
and we're going to talk about him
in the last lecture this semester,

486
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,550
when Constantine built the first
basilica Christian basilica on this site,

487
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:05,580
the basilica that we referred to as old
Saint Peter's that obviously predated

488
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,560
new St Peter's, uh, he, uh, he, uh, he,

489
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:13,650
we think he may have built it on that
very rock and on that very tomb of St

490
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:17,890
Peter. And that's what this, uh,
restored view shows you here.

491
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,570
If you walk along though, and look
at these tombs, for the most part,

492
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:26,600
they look like typical Roman tombs
from the second century, brick face,

493
00:30:26,601 --> 00:30:30,400
concrete construction, uh, with
interesting decoration inside.

494
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:33,910
And I show you just the most famous
mosaic that is located down there,

495
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,130
which you see is a figure in a chariot.

496
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,320
We think it's a
representation of the Sun God,

497
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:42,480
Saul or Helios in the cherry cause
you can see the raid crown, uh,

498
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:46,870
but some believe it is a
representation of Christ as Helios.

499
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:50,950
And I show it to you only because it is
the single most famous mosaic down there.

500
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:52,870
And one of the most
famous mosaics in Rome,

501
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,400
but also because it heralds of what
we're going to be begin to see happening,

502
00:30:57,401 --> 00:30:58,780
especially in the last lecture.

503
00:30:58,781 --> 00:31:03,280
And that is this transition from
paganism to Christianity in Rome,

504
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:06,010
Constantine being the last pagan,
first Christian emperor.

505
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:11,250
And this interesting a way in which a
pagan imagery aligned into Christian

506
00:31:11,861 --> 00:31:14,920
imagery,
both in terms of of figural decoration,

507
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:17,650
but also in terms of architecture.

508
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:23,290
I can't because it's so poorly lighted
down there. I can't show you, uh, the, uh,

509
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:26,470
a good picture of the tombs
a beneath Saint Peter's.

510
00:31:26,471 --> 00:31:29,430
But I can show you another set of tombs,
uh,

511
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,700
beneath a that they're very well lighted
and can be photograph better, uh,

512
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:37,240
beneath a, uh, Columbaria
I'm and underground

513
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,910
catacomb actually an underground
burial area that was used by the early

514
00:31:42,911 --> 00:31:45,100
Christians in Rome.
And you see that it's called,

515
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,640
you don't have to worry about it. It's
called the Church of Sansa boss Jonno.

516
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:51,220
And these, uh, these
tombs are underneath that.

517
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,790
But I showed them to you here just to
give you a sense of what that tomb street

518
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:55,560
looked like.

519
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,590
A underneath the Vatican or looks like
underneath the Vatican with the concrete

520
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,770
brick faced tombs looking
very similar to those.

521
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:05,410
We saw these easily Socra the same,
uh,

522
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,950
same travertine door jams and
scriptions slipped windows.

523
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,410
And if you look through the
entrance way of this one,

524
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:16,330
you will see its barrel vaulted and it
has a scheme that is very similar to the

525
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:20,290
stucco decoration of the tomb of
the Valarie with these circles, uh,

526
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:25,380
done in a raised stucco and with the
floating figures in between them.

527
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:29,440
And this is exactly what it
looks like beneath the Vatican.

528
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:34,720
I can show you some views of the interiors
of some of the Vatican tombs because

529
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:38,230
those have lights in them, they're better
lighted. Uh, you can see them here.

530
00:32:38,231 --> 00:32:42,620
We see this interesting combination that
we also saw these [inaudible] of the

531
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:45,590
smaller niches that are used for,
uh,

532
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:50,120
earned a and the larger arc Arca Solea
that are used for the placement of

533
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:52,850
bodies. And then you can see
in this view on the right,

534
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:57,650
the way in which they have closed off
those Arca Soliah by placing a marble

535
00:32:57,651 --> 00:33:01,940
plaques on them that either
have inscriptions, are
sometimes figural scenes.

536
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,120
And then again here a freestanding
sarcophagi on these interiors as well.

537
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,620
This is an accident,

538
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:12,300
a metric view from ward Perkins
of the Tomb of the Chi Tainui.

539
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:16,100
It dates to one 60 Aidy in
the Vatican cemetery in Rome.

540
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,470
And I think you can see here, uh, both
the brick face, concrete construction,

541
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:26,240
uh, the way in which the
windows have similar stucco
decoration to what we saw on

542
00:33:26,241 --> 00:33:29,480
the tomb of Antioch Gala on the,
via Apia in Rome.

543
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:33,500
But most interesting for us is the
way in which the interior is treated.

544
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:37,880
Because this is my type two a
here we will see some Stucco,

545
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,780
but you will see here that the walls
are in live and in a different way.

546
00:33:41,781 --> 00:33:46,340
They are enlivened through architect
tonic means through the use of columns,

547
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,820
through the use of niches or the use
of pediments, triangular pediments, uh,

548
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,330
but also broken triangular pediments.

549
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,610
Here you see a pediment
that has been split apart,

550
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:00,080
triangular pediment split apart to the,
to show what is inside.

551
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:04,940
This is the same scheme that we saw in
second style Roman wall painting way back

552
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:05,301
when.

553
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:10,070
This whole idea of taking the traditional
vocabulary of architecture and uh,

554
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:11,520
and Dan and uh,

555
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:16,180
dealing with it in a very different
way than had been done before. Uh,

556
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,970
breaking the rules so to speak.
We see that happening here.

557
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,030
But the main thing is that
we're looking at at, at these,

558
00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:25,930
this designer using architectural members,
uh,

559
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,780
to create the visual interest
of the walls of the structure.

560
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,210
You can also see in this
accident and metric view,

561
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:37,420
this combination of a small niches for
cinerary urns and then these larger arc

562
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,550
is Soliah, uh, for the body.

563
00:34:40,551 --> 00:34:44,730
So cremation and inflammation
still going on hand in hand, uh,

564
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,750
during the second century a d this is
a spectacular view of the interior,

565
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:54,290
of the tomb, of the Chi Taney. And here
you can really see what I mean. Yes,

566
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:57,350
there is some stucco. If you look at
the vaults, you will see that those,

567
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:02,210
that there, this is again, a groin vault
that has been stuck out over, uh, and uh,

568
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:02,991
and uh,

569
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:07,460
it has the same kind of co had had the
same kind of compartments and painted

570
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:12,290
decoration relief decoration that we
saw in the tomb of the punk Crotty.

571
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,910
But you can see that most of the effects
have been done through architectural

572
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:19,400
means.
If you look carefully,

573
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:22,430
you will see that there is a black and
white mosaic on the floor and not so

574
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:26,600
different from what we see in Ostia.
Uh, there are niches on the walls.

575
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:30,910
These niches used for the cinerary
urns, Arca Soliah down here for, uh,

576
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,050
the bodies. Uh, but, uh,

577
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:37,620
and there are the stucco decoration in
the use of the shells are that you can

578
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:38,310
see here.

579
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,060
But if you look very carefully at the
combination of sort of Maroon and cherry

580
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:43,220
red walls,
uh,

581
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:47,540
you will see the remains of
the architectural members
that serve to enliven in

582
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:49,110
this space.
Look up here,

583
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:52,650
you will see that there was a triangular
pediment over the central niche.

584
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:57,630
You can see parts of the broken triangle,
triangular pediments on either side,

585
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,670
you can see the remains of capitals.

586
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:03,510
And beneath those would have been the
projecting columns that we saw in the

587
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:06,750
accident and metric view in ward Perkin.
So this again,

588
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:11,070
the second type where the walls are
enlivened with architectural members and

589
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:15,480
those architectural members when intact
would have created a scheme in which you

590
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:19,440
had progression, recession, progression,
recession all along the wall.

591
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:24,060
This in and out scheme that we're going
to see becomes the hallmark of what I'm

592
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:28,980
going to term here this semester.
The Baroque element in Roman antiquity,

593
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,300
enrollment,
architecture,

594
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:36,150
all of these buildings were being put up
during the reign of Hadrian. Successor.

595
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:41,151
Hadrian had died in a 138 and he was
succeeded by a man by the name of Antonio

596
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:48,420
as pious, whose portrait you
see here on the upper right.

597
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,440
And tonight as pious again, uh, was, uh,

598
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,630
he reigned for a quite long time.

599
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:59,631
He a rain between one 38 and 161 a d
it was a period of extraordinary piece.

600
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:03,060
He liked Hadrian was a peace loving man.

601
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:08,061
He was able to maintain that peace
exceedingly well and Rome really thrived

602
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,990
under his emperorship.

603
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:15,450
He's also interesting because he seems
to have had more of a love relationship

604
00:37:15,451 --> 00:37:19,730
with his wife than any other Roman
emperor that I can think of a,

605
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:24,210
a relationship that was so
strong that when his wife died,

606
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:27,030
he became emperor.
Here's his wife [inaudible] the elder,

607
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:30,600
when he became emperor in,
he became emperor when 38.

608
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,410
But she died already in 141.
And as I mentioned,

609
00:37:34,411 --> 00:37:36,840
he stayed on for four until one 61.

610
00:37:36,841 --> 00:37:40,950
So he was emperor for 20 more years
after her death. He never forgot her.

611
00:37:40,951 --> 00:37:45,720
He stayed and he stayed, you
know, completely enamored
of her. He never remarried.

612
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,970
We don't even have any, any, any,

613
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,030
any rumors that he had any
concubines or anything like that.

614
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:55,060
He seems to have stayed
completely true to her. And uh,

615
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:59,130
what's interesting is that,
uh, when the two of them died,

616
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,560
their successors of Marcus Aurelius and
Lucius verus put up a monument to them,

617
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:07,530
and it's not on your monument. Listen,
I'm not holding you responsible for it,

618
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:11,760
but I just want to show it to you because
it will eliminate a monument that I am

619
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:16,350
going to show you in a moment. Uh,
this, this, uh, base which was,

620
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:21,420
which served as the base for a porphyry
column that was located on top.

621
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,250
Uh,

622
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:27,250
it represents a scene in which we see a
[inaudible] as and his wife Festina the

623
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:33,861
elder being carried to heaven on
the back of a male personification.

624
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,600
We see Roma in the bottom right,
and she is saluting them.

625
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:42,601
She is bearing witness to what is a
representation of their joint divinization

626
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:48,961
the two of them Falstino the elder
divinized that her death in one 41 and

627
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,840
tinnitus pious divinize
at his death in one 61.

628
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:56,610
And yet we see them being carried to
heaven as if they're divinization has

629
00:38:56,611 --> 00:39:01,090
happened exactly at the same time.
This is obviously a fiction.

630
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:06,190
It is conflation of time. Uh, it is a
fiction of which the Romans were a pet,

631
00:39:06,191 --> 00:39:10,150
particularly adept in their
sculptural representations.

632
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,850
But I show it to you here because
it has some bearing on, uh,

633
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,680
a temple that I now want to talk about.

634
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,210
This is the so called Temple of
Antonius Pius and Faustina, the elder.

635
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,750
It is a temple that Antonius Pius put
up in honor of his wife in one 41 to her

636
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:33,220
as a diva after she was divinized.
Uh, but at his own death,

637
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:35,110
20 years later in one 61,

638
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:40,111
his successors again Marcus a release
and Lucius verus a rededicated it to the

639
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:45,400
two of them to the divine and to non
as pious and to the divine fell, Stena.

640
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:50,470
It is quite well preserved today and
it is important for two main reasons.

641
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,800
It is important because it is our best
surviving temple that was put up to an

642
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:59,890
emperor and an embrace.
It wasn't the only one,

643
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:03,330
but it's the best surviving
example of that. Uh,

644
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:08,370
and it is another example of the way in
which antiquities are reused over time

645
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,730
in other contexts and at later times.

646
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:16,060
And how that reuse sometimes
helps to preserve them.

647
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,330
What I show you now on the screen
is a coin on the upper left, uh,

648
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,990
representing Fao, Stena the elder on
the odd verse of the coin on the left,

649
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:30,320
her portrait,
and it refers to her as diva Palestina.

650
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,430
So it is a coined that and tonight is,

651
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,350
is struck after her death
and after her divinization.

652
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:38,710
And we see on the back the
temple that n to nine is pious,

653
00:40:38,711 --> 00:40:40,540
originally made in her honor.

654
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:46,110
Over here we see a series of sketch of
drawings that come from the Ward Perkins

655
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,740
Textbook that show once again a
depiction of that original temple on the,

656
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:53,020
on the coin,
and with a legend that says,

657
00:40:53,021 --> 00:40:57,280
I Tearny toss for eternity because
now she is a diva for eternity.

658
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,200
And then a restored view over here of
what the temple would've looked like after

659
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:07,030
it was rededicated to and
tinnitus and Faustina in one 61.

660
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,280
And then over here,
uh,

661
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:14,370
the Baroque building that was built into
it in the 17th century had when it was

662
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:19,570
turned into the Church of
San Lorenzo in Miranda.

663
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:23,770
And I put the names on the Renzo
and Miranda on your monument list.

664
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:28,560
If we look at the view of it as it
was after it was rededicated to,

665
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:33,320
and tonight as pious and Faustina,
we will see a typical Roman temple.

666
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,540
All the features that we have described.

667
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:39,800
So very often in the course of
this semester, the deep porch,

668
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:43,880
the freestanding columns in the
porch and the very tall podium, uh,

669
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:48,830
the single staircase, the facade
emphasis, we see all of that, uh,

670
00:41:48,831 --> 00:41:50,690
here. Very, uh, very tip,

671
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,700
a very conventional Roman temple with
sculpture in the pediment and a decoration

672
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,310
on the eaves of the temple as well.

673
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:02,870
What we see in the bottom left is what
happened to this temple in the 17th

674
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:07,070
century. Part of it was preserved.
Uh, maybe more of it was preserved.

675
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:10,970
We're not absolutely sure, but at least
part of it was preserved. The walls,

676
00:42:10,971 --> 00:42:15,440
the sidewalls, uh, and also
the columns and the, um,

677
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:20,390
the front of the well, the sidewalls
primarily and the columns. And the,

678
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:25,070
uh, the lintel over here that has the
inscription that dedicates the temple to,

679
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,050
and tonight as pious and foul Stina.

680
00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:32,051
But what you see behind it is the baroque
facade rising up a baroque facade that

681
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:34,280
has buttresses.

682
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:37,370
And I'm going to show it
to you in actuality in a
moment that has buttresses on

683
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:41,540
either side that has this wonderful
split RQ weighted pediment,

684
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,990
a split RQ weighted pediment that
would have been impossible to conceive,

685
00:42:44,991 --> 00:42:49,640
I believe, without these architects,
baroque architects of 17th century.

686
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:54,410
Looking back, uh, to the Baroque element
in Roman antiquity, the cross is,

687
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,990
is added in the center of course,

688
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,590
but there's one major difference
between this building and this building.

689
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:02,480
Does anyone see what that is

690
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,990
besides the addition
of the Baroque facade?

691
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,870
What little louder.
Okay.

692
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,730
The podium. Exactly. Emily
Wright. The podium is not there.

693
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,880
The podium is not there.
The staircase is not there.

694
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:20,770
Why is that Emily?

695
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,670
I don't know if it up like
yes,

696
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:28,863
you can see it a little.

697
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:30,980
Yes.

698
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:35,980
The ground level has risen so that at
the time that they decide to turn the

699
00:43:36,561 --> 00:43:40,400
temple event and not as pious and
fell into Song Lorenzo in Miranda,

700
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,710
this is where the ground level is.
There's no podium anymore.

701
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:47,900
The podium is completely underground.
As our part of the columns,

702
00:43:47,901 --> 00:43:52,610
we see only the part of the car.
So they put the door at the,

703
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:55,970
at the bottom. Oh, what is the
bottom at that particular time?

704
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:59,660
Now let me show you the building today.
It's very well preserved.

705
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:03,720
So you see what I mean by the best
preserved a monument to the best preserve

706
00:44:03,721 --> 00:44:07,100
temple to an emperor and an emphasis
in Rome, extremely well preserved.

707
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:12,110
You see its location is in the Roman
forum with the backdrop of the imperial

708
00:44:12,111 --> 00:44:16,670
fora behind it. The forum of Augustus
Forum of Trajan in the Roman forum.

709
00:44:16,671 --> 00:44:19,820
So prime real estate, uh, for this temple.

710
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,610
When Antonius Pius pious
decides to build it to his wife.

711
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,900
We see here the original podium,
the original staircase,

712
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:31,470
the original columns, gray granite
columns, white marble capitals.

713
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,850
We see the original lintel with the
inscription still preserve to divine Anta

714
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:37,680
nine as pie as to divine Faustina.

715
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,220
We see the original two
full walls of the side.

716
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,170
We see the lintel on this
side that also has a,

717
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:49,050
a freeze that is preserved from antiquity.
And then we see growing up behind it,

718
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:52,560
the 17th century Baroque church with uh,

719
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:56,760
it's buttresses and with its
broken, uh, RQ weighted pediment.

720
00:44:56,761 --> 00:45:00,840
And if you look very carefully,
you will see this is,

721
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,850
this was ground level in the 17th century.
This is the 17th century door.

722
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,520
This is the ancient door down here.

723
00:45:08,521 --> 00:45:11,370
I'll show you a couple of views where
you can see that even more clearly.

724
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,760
Here's another view showing you
those great gray granite columns,

725
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:19,680
the white capitals, the 17th
century door, and then down here,

726
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:21,300
the ancient door,

727
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,900
which shows you more dramatically than
anything else I've been able to show you

728
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:28,920
this semester. This change and
ground level. And two more views, uh,

729
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:32,550
that I took that show you the same here,
the 17th century doors.

730
00:45:32,551 --> 00:45:35,700
So you have to think of all of this
underground in the 17th century.

731
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:40,480
And then only in more modern
times, uh, was the, uh,

732
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:45,360
was the temple excavated temple in church
excavated down to their original level.

733
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,510
Here's another view showing you again,
the 17th century doorway,

734
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:51,680
the earlier doorway, the staircase,
a little baby down here, uh,

735
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,550
which I was happy to have four scale.
Uh,

736
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,970
it gives you a sense once again of how,

737
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:01,140
and that makes it even more dramatic
because I don't know if it's a he or she.

738
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:05,490
Um, she, she, uh, sit sitting there, uh,

739
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,200
that she, uh, it makes it even more
dramatic to demonstrate to you, again,

740
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:14,870
since this is a lecture on
bigger is better that this
temple to nine is and fell.

741
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:18,600
Stena was also very,
very also is very,

742
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:22,980
very large in scale.
When an to nine is pious,

743
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:25,080
died in one 61.

744
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:29,220
He was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius and
Lucius verus mark is a really released,

745
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:32,700
one of the most famous of the Roman
emperors, the great stoic philosopher.

746
00:46:32,701 --> 00:46:37,230
And you see him in a portrait here you
see Lucius verus on the left hand side.

747
00:46:37,231 --> 00:46:42,060
The two of them, uh, were co
emperors between one 61 and one 69,

748
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:42,810
uh,

749
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:47,550
Lucius verus died in battle and one 69
Marcus or release continued on alone

750
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:51,450
until the year 180 a d.

751
00:46:51,451 --> 00:46:56,280
So he too had a very long rein.
Marcus spent most of his reign,

752
00:46:56,281 --> 00:47:00,480
however, on the front during
the period that he was emperor,

753
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:03,360
the barbarians were
literally at the gates.

754
00:47:03,361 --> 00:47:07,320
There was concern that they were
going to in fact overrun the city,

755
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:09,840
completely overrun the empire completely.

756
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,130
And he had to spend most of his reign
on the frontiers. Uh, and he did, uh,

757
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:17,640
beating back those barbarians.
For that reason,

758
00:47:17,641 --> 00:47:20,250
there was very little
architectural construction,

759
00:47:20,251 --> 00:47:22,440
even though he had a very long reign.

760
00:47:22,441 --> 00:47:26,970
There was very little architectural
construction during the time of Marcus

761
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:31,150
Aurelius, uh, because of, uh,
the, that he had to spend in war.

762
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:35,620
He was succeeded by his son.
Comedies whose portrait you see down here,

763
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,680
a comedy in the line,
also in the,

764
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:43,681
in the megaloads maniacal
line of a Nero and Domitian,

765
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:49,050
a man who saw himself as a god on earth
who saw himself as the Greek hero,

766
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:53,280
Hercules. He called himself
self Hercules' Romanos. Uh,

767
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:57,190
and we see him in his most famous and
most fabulous is about one of the best

768
00:47:57,191 --> 00:48:01,270
portraits preserved from ancient Rome.
It's in the capital, I'm museums today.

769
00:48:01,271 --> 00:48:06,160
And you see him masquerading here
as Hercules, uh, with his, uh,

770
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:09,550
with the lion skin around
his head holding the club,

771
00:48:09,551 --> 00:48:11,770
holding the apples of the Hispera cities,

772
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:16,510
demonstrating that he has completed that
last labor justice Hercules had done

773
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:20,500
and is going to become a god
in the manner of Hercules.

774
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:23,590
He used to parade around
in Rome openly in this way,

775
00:48:23,591 --> 00:48:27,520
and actually struck coins showing himself
as Hercules Romanos just to get to

776
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:31,840
give you a sense of how extreme it was.
And he was always challenging people to,

777
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:36,310
uh, to, um, to, to hand to
hand combat. Uh, and in fact,

778
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:41,140
he eventually got his comeuppance because
although he himself also range for

779
00:48:41,141 --> 00:48:45,070
quite a while between one 81 92.
So he lasted for 12 years.

780
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,810
But nonetheless, even his closest, uh,

781
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:53,250
his closest advisors eventually turned
against him and plotted behind his back

782
00:48:53,411 --> 00:48:58,330
and arranged for the most, one of the
most famous gladiators of the day,

783
00:48:58,331 --> 00:49:02,320
Narcissus interestingly called
Narcissus, uh, to, to, uh,

784
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:05,360
take up comedy.
This is a common,

785
00:49:05,361 --> 00:49:10,210
this is offered to fight anybody. Oh,
wanted to fight him in the Colosseum. Uh,

786
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,630
and of course he thought that being
him for protected him and that he,

787
00:49:13,631 --> 00:49:17,830
he liked Nero who fixed the Olympic
Games in his favor, that, that, uh,

788
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,880
that communists would also never lose
in a contest like this because he was by

789
00:49:21,881 --> 00:49:25,600
definition emperor. Uh, but his
advisers turned against him. Let,

790
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:30,630
let narcis is loose and communist was
slain by narcissists in the Colosseum.

791
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:36,010
Uh, but he did, I, I do want to just
mention, and only in passing comment is,

792
00:49:36,011 --> 00:49:38,350
did put up a column to his father,

793
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:43,000
Marcus and release a that is based very
closely on the column of Trajan in Rome.

794
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:47,170
I'm not going to go into it with you
today because the architectural complex in

795
00:49:47,171 --> 00:49:49,330
which it was originally
found no longer survives,

796
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:54,130
but I just wanted you to be aware that
the column of Trajan was succeeded by the

797
00:49:54,131 --> 00:49:57,340
column of Marcus released.
I want to, however,

798
00:49:57,341 --> 00:50:02,320
returned for the rest of the lecture
to a new dynasty that came to the fore

799
00:50:02,321 --> 00:50:05,290
after the end of the so
called and nine emperors.

800
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:09,790
When communists died, there were
no more and to nines to succeed.

801
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:13,150
Him and Rome, once again,
fell into a civil war.

802
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:17,110
And there were rivals warring with
one another for supreme power.

803
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,530
And the man who came to the fore was
a man by the name of pertinent facts.

804
00:50:20,531 --> 00:50:24,490
P. E. R. T. I. N. A Ex. Uh,
but he had other rivals.

805
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:28,580
And one of them was the man who
eventually really came on out on top.

806
00:50:28,581 --> 00:50:33,200
And His name was Lucius Septimius
saveras Lucia Septimius.

807
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:36,920
The bears was within that
year between 92 and 93,

808
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:41,330
able to get rid of not only pertinent
acts but other rivals and become supreme

809
00:50:41,331 --> 00:50:42,164
ruler of Rome.

810
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:47,560
And because he liked Vespasian before
him had two sons to succeed him Caracalla

811
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:50,870
and data,
he was able to set up a new dynasty.

812
00:50:50,871 --> 00:50:53,620
The so called Severen what
we call the sovereign SCV,

813
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,230
ran the Severen dynasty in Rome,

814
00:50:58,310 --> 00:50:59,870
the Severen dynasty and Rome,

815
00:50:59,871 --> 00:51:03,860
extremely important because September
Severus commissioned some important

816
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:06,680
structures,
both public structures and private.

817
00:51:06,681 --> 00:51:10,280
He was an interesting emperor because
he combined an interest in the two.

818
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:15,500
And then his son Caracalla,
who epitomizes as I began today,

819
00:51:15,501 --> 00:51:18,810
the whole bigger is better
or biggest is best, uh,

820
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:22,010
philosophy in life and in architecture.

821
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,300
I want to show you first just to
introduce you to these two patrons. Uh,

822
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,690
this wonderful painted Tondo,
uh,

823
00:51:29,691 --> 00:51:34,010
that is preserved from Rome.
It was, was found, excuse me,
not in Rome, but in Egypt,

824
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:38,210
uh, and is now in the
museum, a museum in Berlin.

825
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:43,930
But it is important because it is our
only surviving painting of an emperor.

826
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:47,870
And not only an emperor,
but an emperor and his whole family,

827
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:52,160
his wife and his children. The only
surviving painting of an emperor today.

828
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,160
But there were obviously
many of these in antiquity.

829
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,460
It's a fascinating painting we see set.

830
00:51:57,461 --> 00:52:02,090
Timmy is severity with his gray hair and
beard and his wonderful jeweled crown.

831
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:07,100
We see his wife, Julia Domino,
who buy, oh, and by the
way, I neglected to mention,

832
00:52:07,101 --> 00:52:09,560
but one of the interesting things about,
uh,

833
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:14,561
about Septimius Severus his biography
is the fact that he was born not in Rome

834
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:17,600
and not in Spain,
is Trajan and Hadrian had been,

835
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:22,760
but rather in north Africa in a place
called Leptin is Magdna, Lep, t, t,

836
00:52:22,761 --> 00:52:27,380
I s, new word, m, a,G , N, a in
[inaudible], born in North Africa.

837
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:32,290
He hooked up with a woman from
Syria, uh, whose name was Juliet Dom.

838
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:37,220
She was the daughter of an important
priest in Syria called Bossy, ANA's.

839
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:41,810
Uh, she was famous in Rome for
her wigs. She used to wear wigs,

840
00:52:41,811 --> 00:52:45,500
and you can see her wearing one of her
wigs in this wonderful painted portrait.

841
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,570
She also clearly liked jewelry because
you can see her with these fabulous, uh,

842
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,150
triple pearl earrings and a wonderful,
uh,

843
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:57,710
pearl necklace here. Also,
uh, looking very vibrant, uh,

844
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,060
in this portrait. And then the two of
them with their sons, their elder son,

845
00:53:01,061 --> 00:53:05,510
car color over here, and their younger
son, or what remains of him. Uh,

846
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:09,130
gala on the left, uh, Gava and gay to,

847
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:14,160
and Caracalla succeeded their
father together as co rulers,

848
00:53:14,511 --> 00:53:17,360
but, uh, Carra call a very
jealous of his brother,

849
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:22,310
who was much more popular with the Roman
populace. Then Caracalla himself was a,

850
00:53:22,311 --> 00:53:25,690
and Caracalla eventually had
his brother murdered, uh,

851
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,140
and after his brother
was murdered, he, uh,

852
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:32,760
he convinced that as Caracalla convinced
the Roman Senate to issure issue a dop,

853
00:53:32,761 --> 00:53:36,690
not tio memoria or damnation
of the memory of data.

854
00:53:36,691 --> 00:53:40,800
And an attempt was made to eradicate
data from history by eradicating and from

855
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:45,510
art. And you can see that he was snuffed
out, his face was removed on this,

856
00:53:45,511 --> 00:53:49,800
but then it was left to stand to show
the power that Carra call a had to

857
00:53:49,801 --> 00:53:52,530
destroy, uh, his brother.
As you can see here,

858
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:57,531
this gives you a glimpse into
the mind and psyche of Caracalla.

859
00:53:58,290 --> 00:53:59,610
I want to show you first though,

860
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:03,150
to buildings before we look at
the baths of Caracalla up. Uh,

861
00:54:03,151 --> 00:54:07,450
I do want to show you two
buildings, uh, of Septimius Savara.

862
00:54:07,451 --> 00:54:08,880
It's a public building.
First,

863
00:54:08,881 --> 00:54:11,730
the so-called arch of the
severity and the Roman forum,

864
00:54:11,731 --> 00:54:14,790
and then an extension
to the palatine palace.

865
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:20,300
The arch of me severity and the
Roman forum dates to add 203,

866
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:25,840
and it commemorates a the
Parthian victory of Septimius.

867
00:54:25,841 --> 00:54:28,170
Severna Septimius Severus
I already mentioned to you,

868
00:54:28,171 --> 00:54:30,660
came to power in a civil war.

869
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:34,200
So like Augustus and like
Vespasian before him.

870
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:39,300
He needed to gain legitimacy by
having an important foreign victory.

871
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:43,200
And he does this by looking east
as Augustus had done before.

872
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:45,170
Him Looking to Parthenia,
uh,

873
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:50,380
and does war with Partha and in fact
has an important victory and celebrates

874
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:55,521
that important victory in this triumphal
arch that is put up in his honor in 203

875
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,700
Aidy in once again,
the choices spot a real estate in Rome,

876
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:02,640
the forum Romana the Roman Forum.

877
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:06,540
I show you a Google earth view over here.
We've seen this one before,

878
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:09,510
so you've undoubtedly got
this one memorized by now.

879
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:13,950
There's Google Earth image of the
Roman forum as it looks today with the

880
00:55:13,951 --> 00:55:18,450
coliseum up there with the via de Fori
am periodically imperial for over here,

881
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,120
the circus maximus,
the Palatine Hill,

882
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:25,800
the comp Udofia capital on hill
is redesigned by Michelangelo,

883
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:31,040
the wedding cake of Victor Emmanuel
here between the [inaudible] and the

884
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:37,140
coliseum, we see, of course the
remains of the ancient Roman forum,

885
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:42,060
much lower ground level than the
modern ground level. Uh, you'll recall,

886
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:42,420
uh,

887
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:47,420
the location of the Temple of Venus in
Roma just underneath the coliseum of the

888
00:55:47,671 --> 00:55:49,750
arch of Titus on the Veolia.
Uh,

889
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:53,340
and you should remember also that we
talked way in the beginning of the term

890
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:58,110
about two arches to succeed. Successive
arches built in honor of Augustus.

891
00:55:58,111 --> 00:55:59,670
First his act in victory,

892
00:55:59,671 --> 00:56:04,050
victory enact Actium and then his victory
over the Parthians, which is over here.

893
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:06,090
And then, uh, if we look very close,

894
00:56:06,091 --> 00:56:09,090
it's a little hard to see when I'm up
this close, but we look very closely.

895
00:56:09,091 --> 00:56:10,460
We will see the location,

896
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:14,640
I think it's roughly around
here of the arch of is severity.

897
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:16,350
We can see it better in this,

898
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:21,390
a plan of the Roman forum as a developed
between the third and seventh centuries

899
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:25,300
a d we see the top Yulara and at the top,

900
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:28,090
which means we're close
to the Capitoline hill.

901
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,850
We see two basilicas that were put
up in the Republican period. Uh,

902
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:37,020
we see a temple that we did not study
that was put up in honor of the divine

903
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:40,930
Julius Caesar by Augustus.
We see the speakers platform,

904
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:44,560
we see the Senate House, which I
will show you in a later lecture. Uh,

905
00:56:44,561 --> 00:56:48,940
and over here we see the location of
what was originally the acting arch of

906
00:56:48,941 --> 00:56:53,941
Augustus and then the Parthian arch of
Augustus and remember that the Parthian

907
00:56:54,071 --> 00:56:56,230
arch of Augustus had a triple opening.

908
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,350
I and then if you look
at the rest of the plan,

909
00:56:59,351 --> 00:57:03,790
you will see the location of the
arch of Septimius Rivera's over there

910
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:09,240
diagonally across in dialogue with
the Parthian arch of Augustus.

911
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,430
Was this coincidence?
Absolutely not.

912
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:17,140
This was clearly very
carefully orchestrated by
September to severity and his

913
00:57:17,141 --> 00:57:22,141
advisors to build his Parthian arch
in dialogue with the Parthian arch of

914
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:26,740
Augustus with regard to its form,

915
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:29,350
it also made reference
to the Augusta and arch.

916
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,800
I show you here the arch of
Septimus severity as it looks today.

917
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:38,050
It is our first example that we've seen
this semester of a Roman arch with a

918
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:42,420
triple open, a triple RQ
weighted opening, a large RQ,

919
00:57:42,421 --> 00:57:44,800
wade RQ weighted opening in the center,

920
00:57:44,801 --> 00:57:48,520
flanked by two smaller
lower RQ weighted entrance.

921
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:52,000
We have not seen that before.
First surviving example in Rome.

922
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:56,080
Will we remember? If we look,
think back to the arches.

923
00:57:56,081 --> 00:57:58,510
We have explored from
the time of Augustus on,

924
00:57:58,511 --> 00:58:01,870
you'll remember that they
are single bade arches.

925
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:03,610
Augustus is acting arch,

926
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:08,380
the arch of Titus and even the second
century arch of Trajan at a Vento.

927
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:11,650
But as I've already said today,
the,

928
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:14,890
if we look back to the coin,
the arch no longer exists,

929
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:19,300
but we look back to a coin depiction
of the Parthian arch of Augustus.

930
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,680
It had three openings,

931
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:25,180
a central RQ weighted opening and
then two rectangular openings.

932
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:29,350
Trey be aided openings with
pediments on either side flanking it.

933
00:58:29,351 --> 00:58:33,790
So this is not the Parthian arch of
Augustus is not a triple RQ weighted arch,

934
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:36,490
but it is a three opening arch.

935
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,750
And I think there is no question that
those three openings are being alluded to

936
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:45,730
in the Severn arch and being and being
transformed into something that was new,

937
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:50,140
which was the idea of the triple arcuate
and bay or maybe it wasn't so new

938
00:58:50,141 --> 00:58:51,310
because there's an arch,

939
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:55,840
the arch that you see down here in the
south of France at [inaudible] and we'll

940
00:58:55,841 --> 00:58:56,920
look at this arch when we,

941
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:01,750
when we make our journey to the south
of France in an upcoming lecture, uh,

942
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:04,930
we will look at this arch and it's,
it's a triple bait arch,

943
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,820
just like the arch of
September [inaudible] severity.

944
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,730
It's covered with sculpture,
just like the arch of Septum is severity.

945
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:13,760
So for a while there were scholars who
dated this to the time of September.

946
00:59:13,761 --> 00:59:14,640
He is severities,

947
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:19,330
although put up in the provinces
a bought a recent scholarship,

948
00:59:19,331 --> 00:59:21,560
more reasons scholarship has demonstrated,

949
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:25,190
scholars have looked at the
piles of arms and armor on here.

950
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:29,900
And identified it as piles of arms and
armor that had to do with battles that

951
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:34,460
took place in the south of France or what
is now the south of France in the age

952
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:34,640
of Augustus.

953
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,360
There's also an inscription referring to
a specific historical figure who lived

954
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:42,800
during the time, the late period of
Augustus and into the time of Tiberius.

955
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:47,570
So it seems very likely that this is not
a sever and arch, but a tie Berian arch.

956
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:51,050
Uh, and I show it to you here
only because while we usually,

957
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:54,500
and this may be helpful to some
of you who are doing, uh, papers,

958
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:57,370
topics or city plans in the provinces,
uh,

959
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:01,220
we usually think of ideas flowing
from the center to the periphery.

960
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:05,360
But here we seem to have an idea that
comes to the fore first in the periphery

961
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:08,360
and then ends up ultimately in the center.

962
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:12,020
Although of course there are lots of
missing pieces to the ancient puzzle.

963
01:00:12,021 --> 01:00:14,270
I mean, there are lots of monuments
that have not come down to us.

964
01:00:14,271 --> 01:00:18,410
So it is not inconceivable that a triple
bade arch was built in Rome earlier,

965
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:20,210
but we just have no evidence for it.

966
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:24,560
I want to show you the arch itself very
quickly because it's mainly a work of

967
01:00:24,561 --> 01:00:29,540
sculpture. But just to show you the three
bays victories in the spandrels river.

968
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:31,610
God's down here in scription at the top,

969
01:00:31,611 --> 01:00:35,960
you'll have to imagine the great bronze
Quad Droga of the emperor at the apex,

970
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:36,590
uh,

971
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:41,590
decorated bases down here but most
interesting are the panels that we see.

972
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:45,620
Four panels that we see,
two on either side of the arch.

973
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:48,860
And I show you a detail,
a very good detail of one of them here.

974
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:51,340
Although it's weathered, you
can see it quite well. Uh,

975
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,790
you can see that this panel,

976
01:00:52,791 --> 01:00:56,750
instead of having full length figure
standing on a single ground line as we saw

977
01:00:56,751 --> 01:01:00,350
for example, in the, uh, in the,
in the freeze of the our pockets,

978
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:05,480
we see figures on a number of tears here,
small figures on a number of tears.

979
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:09,860
It should remind you of the scenes on
the column of Trajan. Those spiral,

980
01:01:09,861 --> 01:01:14,600
the spiral freeze with the individual
figures telling the story of Ward.

981
01:01:14,601 --> 01:01:19,510
In this case the Parthian more of
of uh, September. He is severity.

982
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:22,550
Uh, but, and so what I
think happened here, my, my,

983
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,770
my theory and there are
others who've said the same,

984
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,300
is that what happened to your,

985
01:01:26,301 --> 01:01:31,010
is that the designer of this got the
idea to take excerpts in a sense from the

986
01:01:31,011 --> 01:01:34,940
columns of trades under the column of
mark is a release and put them in panel

987
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:39,460
format on this monument. Uh, whether,

988
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:40,251
I don't know whether,
you know,

989
01:01:40,251 --> 01:01:42,860
you can think to yourselves whether
you think this is successful or not.

990
01:01:42,861 --> 01:01:46,730
I think it probably was not deemed to
be particularly successful because it is

991
01:01:46,731 --> 01:01:48,500
the only arch design of its type.

992
01:01:48,501 --> 01:01:53,000
No one picked up afterwards and
imitated this particular eye.

993
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:56,660
Dia the basis down below
representing Romans,

994
01:01:56,661 --> 01:02:01,460
bringing back Parthian prisoners.
I want to speak very briefly also,

995
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:03,500
uh, about, uh, uh,

996
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:07,850
Septimius saveras is extension of the
Imperial Palace on the Palatine Hill.

997
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:09,560
He extended it to the south.

998
01:02:09,561 --> 01:02:11,960
He lived there just like
every emperor since demission.

999
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:16,370
He extended it on the southern side.
That's the side nearest the forum.

1000
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:20,220
And he added a facade,
a to it,

1001
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:23,430
a very elaborate facade
that does not survive.

1002
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:28,670
It doesn't survive because we know it
was torn down in 1588 to 1589 by one of

1003
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:33,780
the pope's because the pope wanted
to use it in his own paypal building,

1004
01:02:33,781 --> 01:02:38,460
wanted to use the building materials in
his own paypal building. But fortunately,

1005
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,760
uh, the artist Martin von
Heemskerck, the renaissance artists,

1006
01:02:41,761 --> 01:02:45,690
and I put his name on the monument list
for you. Martin von Heemskerck, uh,

1007
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:49,710
uh, drew some of it while
it was being dismantled.

1008
01:02:49,711 --> 01:02:53,940
And you see a piece of it over here
in the Martin von Heemskerck drawing.

1009
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:58,240
There's also a, uh, a,
uh, the, um, the, um,

1010
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:02,340
plan of this structure also
preserved on the forma orbis.

1011
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,970
And we can see that marble plan
of Rome from the Severn period.

1012
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:08,850
We take both of those,
that evidence together.

1013
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:13,500
We can reconstruct it quite effectively.
We can see that it was a, a,

1014
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:16,500
a facade that look very
much like a theater, uh,

1015
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:21,120
with wings on either side with apses here,
three large apses,

1016
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:21,690
uh,

1017
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:26,690
and columns inside those apps is with
other elements that have columns in three

1018
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:31,320
tiers looking very much like a theater
stage set all done in marble. Uh,

1019
01:03:31,321 --> 01:03:33,480
it might have been also a fountain.

1020
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,450
There might've been a base in
down here with a water display.

1021
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:41,490
All of this serving as a new facade for
dimensions palace on the Palatine Hill.

1022
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:45,960
It's important because it's
another example of this use
of progression recession

1023
01:03:45,961 --> 01:03:47,250
progression, recession, uh,

1024
01:03:47,251 --> 01:03:51,570
Kloss across the facade to give an in
and out undulating movement using the

1025
01:03:51,571 --> 01:03:56,571
traditional vocabulary of architecture
in a way that is striking and in a way

1026
01:03:56,611 --> 01:04:01,020
that it again, Harold's, this new
baroque style in Roman architecture.

1027
01:04:01,021 --> 01:04:05,430
I also mentioned, uh, just as the last
point about this monument that we also,

1028
01:04:05,431 --> 01:04:09,660
the reason it's called the CEP disodium
or the CEP disodium and you see that

1029
01:04:09,661 --> 01:04:11,280
name on the monument list for you.

1030
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:16,170
The reason is referred to as
a step disodium is because
it was thought to honor

1031
01:04:16,171 --> 01:04:19,010
the or to commemorate the seven planets,
uh,

1032
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:22,320
which is not surprising in the orbit
of symptom you severities and Julia

1033
01:04:22,321 --> 01:04:26,100
dominant because we know that Julia
dominant was an avid follower of

1034
01:04:26,101 --> 01:04:27,630
astrological signs,

1035
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:31,110
used to predict what was going to
happen in her husband's a rain, uh,

1036
01:04:31,111 --> 01:04:32,100
through those signs.

1037
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:37,390
And this is likely a nod to her particular
astrological interests and the in the

1038
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:41,730
nine or 10 minutes that remain,

1039
01:04:41,731 --> 01:04:46,731
I want to end today with
this extraordinary imperial
bath structure that was

1040
01:04:48,661 --> 01:04:53,661
designed at the behest of the Emperor
Caracalla when Septicemia severities died

1041
01:04:55,341 --> 01:04:56,220
in two 11.

1042
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:01,780
He was succeeded by car call and by Gayda
I've already told you what Caracalla

1043
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:04,070
did to get rid of data.
Uh,

1044
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:09,080
and Caracalla became sole emperor in 212
212 id and remained emperor until his

1045
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:17,061
death in 217 a d a and one of his major
commissions was this imperial bath

1046
01:05:18,641 --> 01:05:19,474
structure.

1047
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:23,650
He wanted to eight his father because
we know that Septum Mya Savara said also

1048
01:05:23,651 --> 01:05:27,820
built a major public bath. And
roam the tear my Septa, me on. I,

1049
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,030
they do not survive.
We have very little knowledge of them.

1050
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:34,270
So there isn't anything that I can
show you or tell you about them.

1051
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:36,970
But we know he built it.
So like father like son,

1052
01:05:36,971 --> 01:05:41,800
he wanted to outdo his father's is like
Bush one Bush to wanting to outdo his

1053
01:05:41,801 --> 01:05:46,150
father and to build an even
larger, uh, bathing establishment.

1054
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:48,760
And he does it here in Rome,

1055
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:53,200
a a bathing establishment called
the baths of Caracalla or the tear.

1056
01:05:53,201 --> 01:05:54,570
My Antonia Neon.

1057
01:05:54,571 --> 01:05:59,500
I as of Caracalla dates to 212 to 216.

1058
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:04,130
And uh, any of you who have seen it
will agree with me. This is one if you,

1059
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:06,820
if we hadn't have been outrageous
for them was the mother of all forms.

1060
01:06:06,821 --> 01:06:10,210
This is certainly the mother of
all imperial bath structures.

1061
01:06:10,211 --> 01:06:12,670
This is quite something. Uh, fortunately,

1062
01:06:12,671 --> 01:06:16,200
much of it survives mainly
the concrete shell, uh,

1063
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:18,810
sh concrete shell of itself. Uh, but, uh,

1064
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,030
we can see the outlines here
in this Google earth image,

1065
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:24,400
which shows you not
only the bathing block,

1066
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:27,610
but also part of the
precinct that surrounded it.

1067
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:32,170
Because we shall see if we look at
a plan of the baths of Caracalla,

1068
01:06:32,171 --> 01:06:34,090
which you see here in the bottom left.

1069
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:37,420
This is a detail of
just the bathing block.

1070
01:06:37,421 --> 01:06:42,421
And if we compare the general plan with
the plan of the bads of Trajan in Rome,

1071
01:06:42,671 --> 01:06:46,570
we will see that the bands of Trajan,
which were very large in their own day,

1072
01:06:46,571 --> 01:06:51,190
have been exceeded,
succeeded here in terms of size,

1073
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:55,810
but are very much in the same
general format. By that, I mean,

1074
01:06:56,130 --> 01:07:00,130
I large bathing block here
inside a larger precinct.

1075
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:02,290
That precinct has around it,

1076
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:06,850
a host of rooms that were used as lecture
halls and seminar rooms and Greek and

1077
01:07:06,851 --> 01:07:11,710
Latin libraries. So again, great
locus of intellectual as well as uh,

1078
01:07:11,711 --> 01:07:16,310
as, as wellness, uh, in the city of
Rome in the third century, a d, uh,

1079
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:20,860
we see that in the baths of Caracalla
just as if we look at the bathing block,

1080
01:07:20,861 --> 01:07:25,750
just as in the bads of Trajan,
we see that all the main bathing rooms,

1081
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:27,400
which were used both for men and women,

1082
01:07:27,401 --> 01:07:31,960
but probably at different times of
Day are aligned with one another.

1083
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:36,010
We see the great figure Doriam here
with the triple groin vault over that

1084
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:39,430
buttressed by rooms with
barrel bolts on either side.

1085
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,440
We see a conventional,

1086
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:46,510
a vertically oriented tepid
Doriam essentially a rectangle
here leading into the

1087
01:07:46,511 --> 01:07:47,081
call Darren.

1088
01:07:47,081 --> 01:07:51,370
So all of these analysis Brigador him
tepid Arrium called RM called Arrium

1089
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:56,050
around dish, a structure
with alcoves, uh, and uh,

1090
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:58,360
but very large in scale.
In fact,

1091
01:07:58,361 --> 01:08:02,640
you'll be interested to hear that
the span of the Dome of the call,

1092
01:08:02,641 --> 01:08:07,641
Darian of the baths of Caracalla was
almost as large as the span of the,

1093
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:11,020
at the Dome of the Pantheon in Rome.
Just to get you,

1094
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:15,370
give you a sense of the extraordinary,
bigger is better scale. Uh,

1095
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,790
in this particular bath over
here, a Natacha Geo located
where it usually isn't,

1096
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:23,690
but here on access with the other rooms
and interesting to talk to Ya with a

1097
01:08:23,691 --> 01:08:24,920
scallop aside,

1098
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:29,510
screened by columns and then otherwise
all the rooms symmetrically disposed

1099
01:08:29,511 --> 01:08:31,880
around two polestar I one on either side,

1100
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:36,250
matching room symmetrically disposed
around the central building blocks.

1101
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:41,250
So the same imperial bath structure type
a that we saw developed under Titus and

1102
01:08:42,081 --> 01:08:45,200
Trajan but taken too
much larger scale here.

1103
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:48,950
This model shows you
that the, the, the whole,

1104
01:08:48,951 --> 01:08:52,910
here we are looking back at the walls
which were very plain on three sides

1105
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:57,140
toward the Taco, toward
the vaulting of the, uh,

1106
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:58,900
of the frigging Darian.

1107
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:02,540
And then the Dome as you can
see there of the caldarium.

1108
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:05,090
Interesting is the,
uh,

1109
01:09:05,091 --> 01:09:10,091
the front side of the or the the side
where you can see the caldarium projecting

1110
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:11,001
over here,

1111
01:09:11,001 --> 01:09:16,001
which you can see is opened up much more
than the other sides with a series of

1112
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:18,500
columns,
uh,

1113
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:23,200
screened columns a and then columns
screening and opening up the call,

1114
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:27,980
Darian as well on the southern
side of the monument. Uh,

1115
01:09:27,981 --> 01:09:31,940
just a few views to give you a sense of
what this structure looks like today.

1116
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:36,290
Again, it's mainly piles of
concrete, uh, faced with brick. Uh,

1117
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:40,820
but you can see some of the soaring
vaults still there. This is a, this is,

1118
01:09:40,821 --> 01:09:44,600
this is in fact, uh, you know,
this is even in this view,

1119
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:47,630
it's much smaller than it would have
been because so much of the ceilings and

1120
01:09:47,631 --> 01:09:48,980
the bolts are missing today.

1121
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:53,570
But you can get a sense by looking at this
family of four, a standing next to it,

1122
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:57,350
the colossal scale of the
baths of Caracalla in Rome.

1123
01:09:57,351 --> 01:10:01,160
Here's another view with some tourists
as well, uh, to also give you a sense of,

1124
01:10:01,161 --> 01:10:02,900
and this is very incomplete today,

1125
01:10:02,901 --> 01:10:07,030
but it still gives you some idea
of the colossal magnitude, uh,

1126
01:10:07,031 --> 01:10:10,310
of this particular bath structure.
As one walks through it,

1127
01:10:10,311 --> 01:10:14,030
there's actually very little, uh,
ornamental decorations still preserved,

1128
01:10:14,031 --> 01:10:18,860
but there was plenty in antiquity you can
see here and there some fragments of a

1129
01:10:18,861 --> 01:10:23,450
freeze. This is a restored view of what
the Frig Darian would have looked like,

1130
01:10:23,451 --> 01:10:28,370
the most important room in the bath, which
would have been tripled groin vaulted,

1131
01:10:28,371 --> 01:10:33,350
as you can see here, which would have had
gray granite columns with white marble.

1132
01:10:33,351 --> 01:10:38,351
Capital's a and would have had
an incredible sculptural display,

1133
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,030
uh,

1134
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:43,540
and Caracalla like demission before him
remembered emissions Al Reggio and those

1135
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:47,080
colossal statues of Dionysus and Apollo,
uh,

1136
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,770
with whom demission wanted to
associate himself Caracalla, uh,

1137
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:55,780
of the same ilk who also wanted to ally
himself with great heroes of the past,

1138
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:58,040
a great gods of the past.

1139
01:10:58,041 --> 01:11:02,920
And he follows the lead of communists
and who's in, who's mode and model. He,

1140
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:07,520
he, he kind of, and he looked back again
to Nero Domitian to communists. Uh,

1141
01:11:07,521 --> 01:11:10,430
and he, he, he likens himself to Hercules.

1142
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:15,150
And we have sculpture that is preserved
from the Darian that represents

1143
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:18,510
Hercules, Hercules, the weary,
the famous weary Hercules type.

1144
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:22,350
This is now in Naples. And
the Archeological Museum
[inaudible] the statute,

1145
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:25,590
but it comes from the frigging
Darian up the baths of Caracalla.

1146
01:11:25,591 --> 01:11:30,000
We're absolutely sure of that. And
it depicts the weary Hercules. Uh,

1147
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:34,050
it is a Roman copy. Uh, the
artists, we know his name,

1148
01:11:34,051 --> 01:11:37,200
I put his name on the monument
list for you, Gli con of Athens.

1149
01:11:37,201 --> 01:11:42,180
So an Athenian sculptor working in
the time of Caracalla makes this copy,

1150
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:46,620
but he makes it a very of a very
famous last Greek original by the Greek

1151
01:11:46,621 --> 01:11:50,270
sculptor lie sipfest, whose name is
also on your monument list, a, uh,

1152
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:54,300
a work of art that he originally
made in the three thirties BC.

1153
01:11:54,301 --> 01:11:56,460
So glycone of Athens copies lie.

1154
01:11:56,461 --> 01:12:01,200
Sip is also a grease this statue
at the behest, again of Caracalla.

1155
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:05,130
And the fact that this was a theme or
a light motif that ran through all the

1156
01:12:05,131 --> 01:12:10,131
decoration of the frigging Darian is
underscored by the fact that a composite

1157
01:12:10,741 --> 01:12:14,070
capitol that survives also
from the Frig, Darian, uh,

1158
01:12:14,071 --> 01:12:19,071
shows a figure of that same weary Hercules
interspersed with the canvas leaves

1159
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:22,080
of that capital.
So again,

1160
01:12:22,081 --> 01:12:27,081
a very carefully orchestrated program
to try to underscore the relationships

1161
01:12:27,121 --> 01:12:30,470
between Caracalla and Hercules,
uh,

1162
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:34,440
mosaics a black and a geometric mosaics.

1163
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:39,441
And not unlike those in Ostia found
a and still exist in the bas of car.

1164
01:12:41,051 --> 01:12:45,150
Call it today, black and
white with a little addition
of color here. Another, uh,

1165
01:12:45,151 --> 01:12:49,440
another section that shows you the
interest in geometry as well as floral

1166
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:50,920
motifs.
Uh,

1167
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:55,190
this detail that you can also see on the
state sites still today showing the see

1168
01:12:55,191 --> 01:12:57,080
scenes that we're not [inaudible],

1169
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:00,870
we're the kind of scenes one
would expect in a bath. Uh,

1170
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:05,130
very similar to those that Ostia but
done in a somewhat more of a better way.

1171
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:10,350
And then the PS to raise this daunts
I think of the mosaics of the baths of

1172
01:13:10,351 --> 01:13:12,710
Caracalla and WellPreserved today,
uh,

1173
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:17,800
was a mosaic that you can see his curve
to s two s to be placed into a room of

1174
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:23,361
this shape that depict on the floor all
the famous athletes and gladiators of

1175
01:13:23,431 --> 01:13:24,180
the day,

1176
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:29,180
either in full length statues or and full
length images or in a portrait images.

1177
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:33,870
Uh, and I don't doubt that these would
have been recognizable stars, superstars,

1178
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:34,591
you know,

1179
01:13:34,591 --> 01:13:39,390
the Alex Rodriguez of their day a
superstars flexing their muscles for the

1180
01:13:39,391 --> 01:13:44,391
public and hoping to be recognized
by everyone who came to this bath.

1181
01:13:44,761 --> 01:13:49,470
And you can just imagine men and women
standing above looking and trying to pick

1182
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:50,970
out who is depicted here.

1183
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:54,900
Here's another view that I took
that is in its current location,

1184
01:13:54,901 --> 01:13:57,300
which is in the Vatican museums in Rome.

1185
01:13:57,301 --> 01:14:01,560
That's where one needs to go to see what
survives up this wonderful mosaic with

1186
01:14:01,561 --> 01:14:05,730
the athletes and gladiators of the day.
And I showed them to you here as well.

1187
01:14:05,731 --> 01:14:09,480
And if you look at these, you can see that
they not only are shown, you know, some,

1188
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:13,540
some are already Victor's, some are taking
part in their sport. Uh, but once again,

1189
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:15,090
just as in the Alexander Mosaic,

1190
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:19,390
we see the use of a lot of different
colored tests awry. We see cast shadows.

1191
01:14:19,391 --> 01:14:21,490
This is very well done. Wonderful. Uh,

1192
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:26,540
facial configurations done by what must
have been the leading mosaicism of the

1193
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:29,620
day for the baths of Caracalla.
And just in closing today,

1194
01:14:29,621 --> 01:14:34,540
I thought I would show you a,
a one of those heads blown up,

1195
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,820
uh,
to poster size as you can see here,

1196
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:40,660
but also put it next to an
actual portrait of Caracalla.

1197
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:44,770
This is not important as a course in
sculpture, but I wanted to show this to,

1198
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:47,260
especially since it's a
portrait that you can see,

1199
01:14:47,261 --> 01:14:49,600
it's in New York at the
Metropolitan Museum of art,

1200
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:53,470
a very powerful portrait
of a very intense,

1201
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:57,280
a Roman emperor. As you can see
on the left. But I think there is,

1202
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:01,180
there is some relationship between the
way in which the sculptors have depicted

1203
01:15:01,181 --> 01:15:06,181
Caracalla with his very cubic and abstract
face is short military hairstyle and

1204
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,280
the depictions of the
athletes and the gladiator.

1205
01:15:09,281 --> 01:15:12,550
So I think he was not only
trying to, uh, to, uh,

1206
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:16,120
draw a relationship between
himself and Hercules Romanos,

1207
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:21,150
but also between himself and some of the
greatest athletes and gladiators of the

1208
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:25,580
day to underscore his strength as
a leader. It was all for naught,

1209
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,600
ultimately. Uh, but
nonetheless, he achieved it.

1210
01:15:28,601 --> 01:15:33,601
And I think it also speaks to him
as a man with that bigger is better

1211
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,200
philosophy.
Thank you.
