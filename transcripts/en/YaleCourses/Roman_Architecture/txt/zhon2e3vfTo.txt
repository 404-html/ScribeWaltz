Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Good morning. From the time of Julius Caesar. We have seen the rulers of Rome Brag about building buildings that were bigger than any others in the world. You'll remember Cesar referred to his, uh, to his temple of Mars in that way that he was building the largest temple of Mars in the world. Uh, and we also saw the same for demission with his palace on the Palatine Hill for Trajan with his enormous forum for, uh, Hadrian building, the greatest largest dome that had been built up until that time. And as we discussed, uh, still the largest diameter dome in the city of Rome today and Hadrian's villa at Tivoli. Just as a selection of examples we're going to see today that have bigger, was better, biggest is best. And in the case of the Emperor Caracalla, uh, an emperor who was a megalomaniac megalomaniac in the, in the tradition of Nero and Domitian, that he built the largest imperial bath structure to date.

Speaker 1:          00:01:10       And we're going to be looking at that bath structure today. Uh, and we're going to see it is really a colossal and fascinating building in all kinds of ways. But before I get to that, in fact, we'll end with that bath structured today. Before I get to that, I would like to look with you at a architecture in Rome in the second and third centuries. Ady and we'll see that architecture is quite varied in terms of whether it's private, it's civic. Uh, it's also funerary. I want to, uh, begin though by just reminding you of what we talked about last time. We looked at the city of Australia and we looked at the city of Osteo, the port of Rome in its entirety. Once again, it's public buildings, it's civic structures, it's commercial enterprises. Uh, and we also went at the very end of the lecture out to easily software where the tombs of the, of the, uh, of the, of those who lived in an Osteo were located.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       And I show you a couple of those again now on the screen. These brick face tombs, these tombs that are made of concrete at easily Socra that were put up for the professionals, but the traders, the commercial, a merchants and so on that lived in the city of Ostia. Uh, they were made of brick, face, concrete construction. They had barrel bolts or groin vaults inside. I do, can see also that they were faced with brick, uh, and they were faced with brick as we discussed that was exposed, the idea of brick being attractive in its own right, if a fabulously beautiful facing, uh, that they take advantage of in the second century, a d a and decide not to stucco it over. As you can see so well here, the doorways into those tombs, uh, surrounded by travertine jams and lintels the inscription in the center, the small slit windows, and then, uh, a pediment at the top.

Speaker 1:          00:03:08       Uh, we saw when we looked at funerary architecture in the age of Augustus, for example, that it was very varied, very varied p peer to tombs and the shape of pyramids in the shape of a circular tombs tombs that made reference to bakeries like the tomb of the baker, your Rissa keys. There is still a certain amount of variety in to market texture in the second century, a d, but they tend to hone in on one type in particular. And that type is the so called house to him type, which is exactly what we see here at tomb that is rectangular in shape for the most part box like a and does resemble very closely a house. This close relationship that we've talked about so many times this semester between houses of the living and houses of the debt. So we looked at those last time and where I want to begin today is just to demonstrate to you that these same kinds of house tombs that we see in Ostia and easily soft grow in the second century d we also see in Rome, uh, and in some cases they are commissioned by individuals of comparable a social status to those in Ostia, but sometimes they are commissioned by the most elite.

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       And I'd like to begin with an example of a similar tomb commissioned by the most elite. This is the so called tomb of [inaudible] in Rome. It was put up on the famous via Apia or the Apia Ian Way. It dates to around a d 161 in this case, we know who the commissioner was and I can show you what he looked like as well. You see him here on the right hand side of the screen. He was a man by the name of her roadies. Atticus. I put his name on the monument lists for you. Her roadies, Atticus, uh, her roadies. Atticus was actually a Greek. He was Athenian, the Greek part of the empire. He lived in Athens for the most part, and he commissioned a very famous music hall and Odi on, which still survives a, you can see it over here. It's without his roof today, but it was originally one of these roofed music halls in Odi on it is located on the slope of the Acropolis in Athens.

Speaker 1:          00:05:16       The Acropolis that of course, we know primarily for its great architectural feats of the fifth century BC in Greece. This is the Roman building put up by her roadies in the second century. Uh, and we see it on the slope of the Acropolis, very well preserved in modern times. It's great as fame is the fact that Jani performed his live at the Acropolis concert, uh, at the Odi on of a Agrippa. And even if you have a roadies addict is, and even if you don't like Jani, it's actually quite an interesting, a concert to view and one can view it, uh, in video and so on, uh, because it does take such wonderful advantage of this extraordinary, uh, ancient structure, as you know, and he presents his music. At any rate, uh, at one point, her roadies advocates who had a lot of, um, connections, not only in Athens but around the empire at one point, uh, through those connections, he gets himself appointed a senator in Rome.

Speaker 1:          00:06:16       And in order to take up that position, he needs to leave Athens, uh, behind, uh, and go spend some time in Rome. And he and his wife Andrea Magilla, a set up house in Rome, a Antia Magilla unfortunately dies in Rome and he needs to bury her and he decides to bury her in Rome instead of in Athens. And he bills for her, a tomb on the, on the [inaudible] way on the via Apia in around 161 ID. That's the date, the date that we believe she died. Uh, and we see a, a, a view of that, uh, of that tomb here. What we're looking at, and you probably recognize this already because we've looked at a number of models from this museum of casts and roam the Museo del achievable tall Romana in ar in Rome. And I show you two views of this model of the tomb of Ani regular one that we see from the front and another that we see from if we're facing the monument, the left side of the tomb.

Speaker 1:          00:07:15       And these are extremely helpful because they give us a very good sense of what we are dealing with here. It is clear that we are dealing with a tumor type that is not that different from what we saw in Austria. Although this looks more like a temple then it looks like a house and you can see that right off it looks exactly like a typical Roman temple. We see that it is on a high podium. It has a deep porch, it has a freestanding columns in that porch. It has a single staircase on the front of the structure has facade orientation a than an entrance way into the structure. It also has freestanding columns that support a pediment. So if I were to show you this, uh, and, and not identify it and say, do you, what kind of a building is, is, I'm sure you would've said it was a temple and you would have been right in the sense that it looks most like a temple, but it is a tomb in the form of a temple.

Speaker 1:          00:08:09       As you can see here, uh, looking on the, uh, on the side of the monument, you can also see those same features that I've just described. And while, uh, we are looking at this view because I'm not going to bring it back, I want to point out one detail that will loom large as we look further at, at this structure. Uh, you will see on the left side of the, uh, of the of the tomb that the architect has, uh, has created, has kind of scalloped out the side, uh, on either side, creating niches, told niches on, on the side, and placed columns into that space, which is a very unusual thing to do. It's not true on the other side of the monument, only on this side of the structure. Uh, why has the architect that I think it might have something to do with the siding, perhaps how you viewed it from the street.

Speaker 1:          00:08:59       Maybe it was skewed in such a way that you would see not only the facade but also the side. And he wanted to emphasize the, uh, the, um, the, the, the columns on that particular side of the structure. But it may also have just tapped to do with, with a quirk, with this, uh, particular interest that the, uh, that the architect or the patron had in doing something different than any other tomb. And I want to re, uh, return to that point in a moment. But most significant of all is that in terms of the building technique, the use of concrete faced with exposed brick, this is exactly what we saw in Ostia. Uh, and you can see that just as an Australia, they have taken that brick as far as it can go in terms of its aesthetic value, uh, by respecting the texture of the brick, playing that texture off a play in color, different colored bricks of reddish brick against a more yellowish colored brick, playing those off against one another.

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       Uh, and then adding certain very highly decorative decorative details, uh, like a meander pattern that we're going to see in a moment, uh, and decoration around the windows of the tomb done in Stucco. The columns however, are marble columns are marble. And in that sense, again, something somewhat different than what we saw at Ostia. This is a view of the tomb as it looks today. The porch is not WellPreserved and I can't show you any of that, but I can show you the rest of the structure and you can see it quite well in this particular view. Uh, and again, you see that it is indeed WellPreserved concrete construction phase with brick brick left exposed, a respected and enjoyed in its own right. What I've already described, the playing off of one color of brick against another, this meander pattern done and Stucco stucco declaration, very elaborate decoration as we're going to see a around the windows tall podium.

Speaker 1:          00:10:55       We see that here as well. Uh, and extraordinary structure. And what's interesting, I think to note, uh, at least culturally and in terms of social status is the fact that although this structure was put up for one of the most wealthy men, uh, in or the wife of one of the most wealthy men in Rome at this particular time, the general aesthetic is very similar to what we saw for professional people in the city of Ostia. That is a concrete tomb in the form of a house or a temple in this case, uh, that is co that that has as its facing brick, uh, and a respect for that brick in its own right here. A couple of details. I show you once again a detail of the warehouse or the array a, a Gothy Yanna at, uh, Ostia that we looked at a and also a detail of the tomb of [inaudible] in Rome.

Speaker 1:          00:11:49       And I think you can see here what I mean. Again, the different coloration of the yellowish brick, the reddish brick played off one against the other, the use of a stucco decoration in this case, uh, for the volumes of the composite capitals. Uh, in this case. And in fact, in fact you'll remember I pointed out what was interesting about these capitals at the warehouse was that they were, that the brick was used to make up the main body of the, uh, of the capitol. And this is not one of them, but I also showed you one where you could see the way in which that brick form the actual a campus leaves of the Capitol, and then the volume it's added and Stucco. We see the same thing at the tomb of Antioch. Magilla we see those here. I think you can see it. Well, the brick used to create the lower part of the campus leaves and then Stucco added for the curving part and for some of the additional decoration, the flower and so on, up above.

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       Uh, and so we see, and here again, very elaborate decoration around the windows, which we also saw at, uh, the, um, warehouse in Ostia to more details of the tomb of Ani irregular. Here. You see what I was talking about before, the way they, the architect has scooped out to areas on the left side of this, of the tomb and place the columns inside of those, which is a unique, I don't know of any other example of this enrollment architecture. And it underscores once again that when it came to two markitecture, uh, that the, uh, that the patron could pretty much do whatever he wanted as long as the architects could build it. Uh, it could, it could, it could be quite idiosyncratic as a form of architecture. And we see not only has he scooped out these niches in which to place the columns, but if you look at those columns very carefully and at the bases of those columns, you will see that they are not round, they are multi-sided.

Speaker 1:          00:13:41       Uh, and the bases are also multi-sided. So doing something very unique, uh, in the context of this particular tomb. A of an irregular. So two main points, one that there is clearly an aesthetic that is used a four to market texture concrete faced with brick, uh, that is used in the upper most levels of Roman society. And then further down in Roman society, not only in Rome but also in Ostia. Uh, but at the same time, uh, individuality, eccentricity is valued into marketecture allowed into market texture in a way that perhaps it isn't in other forms of Roman architecture. And we see it, uh, taken to its limit in this particular building. I just a few more details. We see a niche from the tomb of Annie Magilla. We also see here both the meander pattern and this very elaborate decoration around the windows, uh, a frame around the windows and then a projecting element up above with these great spiral volumes on either side.

Speaker 1:          00:14:43       Very similar to the same sort of thing that was happening at Ostia. I remind you of the niche in the courtyard of the [inaudible], the warehouses at Ostia where you see the same sort of thing. Uh, these, uh, stucco co, uh, pilasters added and Stucco, the brick work creating triangles and laws and Jews. As you can see here, same idea over here in the tomb of [inaudible] gala. And if you look very closely at the pediment that is located above the niche from the tomb in Rome, uh, you see the projecting and tablatures you see where the Co, the capital's would have been. There would also have been either call probably columns added here on either side of the niche, making it look much more similar to here, but look closely at the pediment. You will see that there is projecting and tablature on odd above each column.

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       But then in the center the triangular pediment is cut back. Uh, and that playing around with the traditional vocabulary of architecture is something that I've noted is going to be a part of what we call the baroque trend in Roman architecture. I'm going to devote an entire lecture to the baroque trend in Roman architecture around the empire, not just enrollment, but mostly in the provinces. And we'll see that same sort of thing, which creates a kind of in and out a lively movement, uh, to the, uh, to the facade that is part of that approach. The tomb itself again. Uh, and just to point out, interestingly enough, a couple of female figures with capital's on there on the top of their head or what looked like maybe more like vases on the top of their head. Uh, but looking very much like [inaudible]. It's like the car he audits we saw from the Eric theone and Athens fifth century BC from the forum of Augustus and from Hadrian's villa around the Sarah pm.

Speaker 1:          00:16:34       Uh, they are not, they are not duplicates of those in Athens. Like the other two are a, but they do seem to make reference to them. They're a bit more casual. When I look at these, this pair, they always look to me like they're kind of standing at a cocktail party together and conversing with one another using the usual adjusters that Italians are so famous for. We see them doing that sort of thing here, but even, but they do seem to have that same pedigree. Going back to the whole idea of the car, he audits and I only mentioned it to you, they were found right near this tomb and so it has been speculated, although it is by no means certain that they might have belonged to the tomb. They might've been located in front of the tumor, had been some kind of for part of some kind of for court or for space to that tomb.

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       It's pure conjecture, but it would be interesting if it were the case because remember her odis addict has comes from Athens. We see that the tomb is a thoroughly Roman tomb of the second century, a d. Uh, but it would be interesting to think that he might have added some touches that might have made some reference a for him and also especially for his wife was to him. It was a to the Athens of his, uh, of his birth with regard to tomb interiors in the second century. Aidy in Rome. There are two major types and I want to treat both of those today. One of them is a type that we've seen before and that is where you stuck over the interior of the tomb. You will, you stop it over and then you add additional stucco in relief to a form, the decoration and then you paint it.

Speaker 1:          00:18:10       Uh, that's one type. And the second type, which might also use that for the bald but for the walls. The second type is to use instead architectural members, columns, uh, pediments and the like to enliven the wall, uh, and to create a much more sculptural effect. Both of these types are used in Rome in the second century, Aidy in to market texture. And I want to show you examples of both of them today. The first type one a with stucco painted stucco. We see in the so called tomb of the Valarie, the tumor, the Valarie, which dates to around a d 159 and is located on the via Latina and in Rome. We haven't looked at the, uh, via Latina before. Uh, but it is one of Rome's main streets that had a long it a cemeteries and there are a fair number of concrete tombs faced with brick that are preserved very well preserved on the via Latina today.

Speaker 1:          00:19:09       And what makes them particularly special is the interiors are, uh, are, are almost pristine. It's quite extraordinary to go into these and see how uh, how well they have stood the test of time. The tumor, the Valarie, you see the lunette and the vault of the interior of that tomb right here. Uh, and uh, as you look at the, a canvas leaves growing up in the, uh, in the Lunette all done in stucco relief and the barrel vault with its individual compartments round and square compartments with floating figures inside. I, you should certainly be reminded of things we've already seen before. When one looks at the Qantas leaves, one ha can't help but think back to the delicate leaves of the Arra pockets. The delicate, a canvas leaves of the Arra pop is our boost die. Would you see on the left hand side of the screen, and I'm sure you are, as reminded is I am looking at this, uh, bald by other things that we have seen earlier this semester.

Speaker 1:          00:20:06       What's this over here? The domus salary. It's one of the vaults of the domus salary, a third style done we believe by fabulous himself. Uh, and you'll recall very delicate, very light floral motifs compartments in this case, rectangular with floating sea creatures in the center. We see exactly the same sort of thing here, although done in stucco instead of paint, but this was painted originally in antiquity and we see these floating these new ads on the back of sea creatures, uh, in inside floating inside these. And we think the message here of course, is of the soul of the deceased being carried to the isles of the blessed by these sea creatures. So very much stucco decorations, second century, a d, but very dependent on third style, a Roman, a wall painting and third style deck stucco decoration of earlier dates, uh, the tomb of the punk Crotty in Rome, which dates to one 69.

Speaker 1:          00:21:06       Also on the via Latina has similar similarly WellPreserved stucco decoration also painted. And I'll show you a color view in a moment for you to get a sense of that coloration. Uh, but here you get an idea of the scheme of the wall. Very, very, very elaborate stuccoed over stucco. Much of the Stucco is done in relief. You can see it here if the, uh, if the stucco decoration of the tomb of the Valarie, he made reference to the third style. I think the inspiration here was fourth style, a Roman wall painting and stucco decoration. Uh, because although you continue to see floating mythological figures in these rectangular or triangular compartments, if you look very closely, especially in this zone here, you will also see these architectural cages done in stucco. Very similar to the architecturals cages that we saw at the top of fourth style Roman wall design.

Speaker 1:          00:22:03       So this taking its cue from four style Roman wall painting. And I had mentioned to you a couple of times already this term that in fact most Pompei it most postpone pay and painting and Stucco decoration post 79 a d a does seem to be inspired by the third style, but even more so by the fourth style of Roman wall painting. And we see that very well here with this stucco decorating the Lou nets and also the vaulting. Here's a view in color of the interior of the tomb of the pond, Crotty e, uh, where you can see the same sort of scheme that I've already described, but with the color. And you can also see that we are dealing here with a groin vaulted interior. Uh, and uh, what's interesting is that sometimes the walls have a small niches for urns and the so called Arca Soliah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:55       I've mentioned those to you before, that were used for the placement of bodies once inhumane, uh, became as popular in deed even more popular than cremation. But we also sometimes see the sarcophagi themselves, the free standing coffins, uh, located in these tombs as we see here. And it's interesting to keep in mind that all of the money and time that was expended on this interior decoration, keep in mind that very few people entered into these tombs. When you looked at a tomb you saw primarily it's exterior, some family members on special occasions might go inside, but it was relatively rare. So all of this, all of this done in fact to give uh, the, the deceased, uh, a pleasant home in perpetuity and to help them on their journey to the isles of the blessed this, this structure also has sea creatures, uh, depicted in it.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       So travel is clearly also alluded to and scholars who have worked on this particular monument in particular have noted that they think it has to do with one of these secret mystery religions. In this case, the orphan, O, r, p, h. I. C, the orphan, a religion that was practiced in secret initially and then eventually came up above ground to more details of the upon Crotty ceilings in Stucco. These, I think give you a particularly good sense of the way in which they were built up almost as reliefs. And some parts of the scenes, uh, this, uh, this figure here for example, at some of the rest was painted. We see heraldic leopards over here on either side of a boss, the shell and the niche, also done in Stucco and raised in a very sculptural way. Uh, and then the whole painted in a variety of attractive maroons and blues and Greens.

Speaker 1:          00:24:42       The most interesting to him from my point of view actually, uh, is uh, a tomb that is located a Roman tomb of the second century that is located beneath the Vatican today. And I show you a view again of the Dome of Saint Peter's Cathedral in Rome, designed by Michelangelo himself. Another view over here showing also Michelangelo's Dome, uh, but showing below it the so-called ball, the Kino, uh, that was, uh, put up by the famous 17th century Italian architect Borromini Francesco Borromini, uh, the, uh, the Cathedral of Saint Peter's in any of you who've been there. I will agree with me on this as one of the great wonders of the world. There's no question. It is if you want to talk about bigger is better or biggest is best. This is a truly a colossal buildings. Any of you have been there? No. Uh, but it does give me occasion to mention as I've mentioned a couple of times already this term that one of the really great things to do when you visit Rome is decline things is to climb.

Speaker 1:          00:25:44       If you're so lucky to climb the column of Trajan or the Pantheon up to the Dome, those you'd have to get special permission to do. But what you don't need special permission to do. And one is, it is one of the great climbs in Rome is to go up Saint Peters and you can go up Saint Peter's either on the outside of the building, uh, to various levels from which you can see some of the greatest views of Rome, including back over central Rome, ancient Rome, all the buildings that we've been talking about. You can see the dome of the Pantheon from the top of Saint Peter's. And you can see the victor of manual monument, tall and proud, uh, from the dome of Saint Peter's. But you can also climb up to the, to the dome from the inside, which is an another extraordinary experience. You can go almost, not quite, but almost to the apex of Michelangelo's Dome, Walk Around a Carter.

Speaker 1:          00:26:31       Uh, they are, and look down on, uh, Bernini's Baldor keynote. So, uh, for those of you who are going to Rome anytime soon or in the future, uh, it's a, it's a not to be missed experience to climb, uh, the Cathedral of Saint Peter's on the outside and also on the inside. I bring you to Saint Peter's because w one can also go down underneath Saint Peter's. And that's another very interesting experience to go down in the depths of beneath Saint Peter's and get a really great sense of the centuries of civilization that had been piled one on top of another from ancient Rome or from the time of Romulus, indeed, all the way up to today. Uh, and in order to see the tomb of the [inaudible], which is a tomb that I want to turn to, now, you do have to go down underneath Saint Peters. You, you have to, this is something you can't just walk it, you can climb, you can climb Saint Peter's any day of the week, but if you want to go underneath Saint Peter's, you have to make special arrangements.

Speaker 1:          00:27:27       Uh, you have to get special tickets to do that. And now one can do that online. You can plan that online. Uh, and you can get tickets to go to the so called Vatican cemeteries a underneath, underneath. And they don't have them. They have a small number of hours on, on a variety of days. So it is something one needs to plan for well in advance, but you can do it. You go to the left of the ball at the Kino, you go down and you go down century upon century. You see primarily the tombs of the pope's, the crips with the tombs of the popes. And I show you Pope Boniface here, just to give you an idea of what some of these look like lying in eternity here on the top of his sarcophagus or a space sculptured portrait of him on the top of his sarcophagus. But if you go all the way down, all the way down in, most tourists don't do this.

Speaker 1:          00:28:15       But if you go all the way to the bottom, what you end up with is one of Rome's great tomb streets. Uh, and this tomb street was out in the light of day, of course in antiquity, like all the other tunes, streets. But because of the passage of time, because, uh, other buildings that were built on top, primarily the cathedral of Saint Peters, uh, and just the, the rising ground level over time, it now is, uh, it is subterranean. But when you, it's amazing, you go down, you walk along it, it is like you are. Well, I mean it's a dark street. Uh, but nonetheless, I wouldn't want it. I wouldn't want to record that in that, uh, in that street. Uh, but, uh, you go down under, it's a dark street, but it is, you feel like you are walking along a major, a tomb street in Rome, and indeed you are.

Speaker 1:          00:28:59       And I show you a plan of it here so that you can see it is very much like walking along the tomb street in east la soccer. You see at your left and right, uh, these, uh, these concrete brick face tombs that looked very much like the tumor [inaudible] Magilla or the ones that we saw in Isla Socra, a typical house tombs of the second century, a d one of the, one of the tombs that is located down there has long been thought by scholars and believers to be the tomb of St Peter. Uh, no one has been able to prove this. Incontrovertibly but there is fair, you know, there is some interesting evidence both pro and con. Uh, and it has been thought and you know, uh, Peters famous, uh, statement, uh, you know, upon this rock, I shall build this church, namely the Church of Saint Peters. Uh, we believe, uh, that when Constantine the last pagan emperor, and we're going to talk about him in the last lecture this semester, when Constantine built the first basilica Christian basilica on this site, the basilica that we referred to as old Saint Peter's that obviously predated new St Peter's, uh, he, uh, he, uh, he, we think he may have built it on that very rock and on that very tomb of St Peter.

Speaker 1:          00:30:14       And that's what this, uh, restored view shows you here. If you walk along though, and look at these tombs, for the most part, they look like typical Roman tombs from the second century, brick face, concrete construction, uh, with interesting decoration inside. And I show you just the most famous mosaic that is located down there, which you see is a figure in a chariot. We think it's a representation of the Sun God, Saul or Helios in the cherry cause you can see the raid crown, uh, but some believe it is a representation of Christ as Helios. And I show it to you only because it is the single most famous mosaic down there. And one of the most famous mosaics in Rome, but also because it heralds of what we're going to be begin to see happening, especially in the last lecture. And that is this transition from paganism to Christianity in Rome, Constantine being the last pagan, first Christian emperor.

Speaker 1:          00:31:06       And this interesting a way in which a pagan imagery aligned into Christian imagery, both in terms of of figural decoration, but also in terms of architecture. I can't because it's so poorly lighted down there. I can't show you, uh, the, uh, a good picture of the tombs a beneath Saint Peter's. But I can show you another set of tombs, uh, beneath a that they're very well lighted and can be photograph better, uh, beneath a, uh, Columbaria I'm and underground catacomb actually an underground burial area that was used by the early Christians in Rome. And you see that it's called, you don't have to worry about it. It's called the Church of Sansa boss Jonno. And these, uh, these tombs are underneath that. But I showed them to you here just to give you a sense of what that tomb street looked like. A underneath the Vatican or looks like underneath the Vatican with the concrete brick faced tombs looking very similar to those.

Speaker 1:          00:32:02       We saw these easily Socra the same, uh, same travertine door jams and scriptions slipped windows. And if you look through the entrance way of this one, you will see its barrel vaulted and it has a scheme that is very similar to the stucco decoration of the tomb of the Valarie with these circles, uh, done in a raised stucco and with the floating figures in between them. And this is exactly what it looks like beneath the Vatican. I can show you some views of the interiors of some of the Vatican tombs because those have lights in them, they're better lighted. Uh, you can see them here. We see this interesting combination that we also saw these [inaudible] of the smaller niches that are used for, uh, earned a and the larger arc Arca Solea that are used for the placement of bodies. And then you can see in this view on the right, the way in which they have closed off those Arca Soliah by placing a marble plaques on them that either have inscriptions, are sometimes figural scenes.

Speaker 1:          00:33:02       And then again here a freestanding sarcophagi on these interiors as well. This is an accident, a metric view from ward Perkins of the Tomb of the Chi Tainui. It dates to one 60 Aidy in the Vatican cemetery in Rome. And I think you can see here, uh, both the brick face, concrete construction, uh, the way in which the windows have similar stucco decoration to what we saw on the tomb of Antioch Gala on the, via Apia in Rome. But most interesting for us is the way in which the interior is treated. Because this is my type two a here we will see some Stucco, but you will see here that the walls are in live and in a different way. They are enlivened through architect tonic means through the use of columns, through the use of niches or the use of pediments, triangular pediments, uh, but also broken triangular pediments.

Speaker 1:          00:33:53       Here you see a pediment that has been split apart, triangular pediment split apart to the, to show what is inside. This is the same scheme that we saw in second style Roman wall painting way back when. This whole idea of taking the traditional vocabulary of architecture and uh, and Dan and uh, dealing with it in a very different way than had been done before. Uh, breaking the rules so to speak. We see that happening here. But the main thing is that we're looking at at, at these, this designer using architectural members, uh, to create the visual interest of the walls of the structure. You can also see in this accident and metric view, this combination of a small niches for cinerary urns and then these larger arc is Soliah, uh, for the body. So cremation and inflammation still going on hand in hand, uh, during the second century a d this is a spectacular view of the interior, of the tomb, of the Chi Taney.

Speaker 1:          00:34:51       And here you can really see what I mean. Yes, there is some stucco. If you look at the vaults, you will see that those, that there, this is again, a groin vault that has been stuck out over, uh, and uh, and uh, it has the same kind of co had had the same kind of compartments and painted decoration relief decoration that we saw in the tomb of the punk Crotty. But you can see that most of the effects have been done through architectural means. If you look carefully, you will see that there is a black and white mosaic on the floor and not so different from what we see in Ostia. Uh, there are niches on the walls. These niches used for the cinerary urns, Arca Soliah down here for, uh, the bodies. Uh, but, uh, and there are the stucco decoration in the use of the shells are that you can see here.

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       But if you look very carefully at the combination of sort of Maroon and cherry red walls, uh, you will see the remains of the architectural members that serve to enliven in this space. Look up here, you will see that there was a triangular pediment over the central niche. You can see parts of the broken triangle, triangular pediments on either side, you can see the remains of capitals. And beneath those would have been the projecting columns that we saw in the accident and metric view in ward Perkin. So this again, the second type where the walls are enlivened with architectural members and those architectural members when intact would have created a scheme in which you had progression, recession, progression, recession all along the wall. This in and out scheme that we're going to see becomes the hallmark of what I'm going to term here this semester.

Speaker 1:          00:36:25       The Baroque element in Roman antiquity, enrollment, architecture, all of these buildings were being put up during the reign of Hadrian. Successor. Hadrian had died in a 138 and he was succeeded by a man by the name of Antonio as pious, whose portrait you see here on the upper right. And tonight as pious again, uh, was, uh, he reigned for a quite long time. He a rain between one 38 and 161 a d it was a period of extraordinary piece. He liked Hadrian was a peace loving man. He was able to maintain that peace exceedingly well and Rome really thrived under his emperorship. He's also interesting because he seems to have had more of a love relationship with his wife than any other Roman emperor that I can think of a, a relationship that was so strong that when his wife died, he became emperor. Here's his wife [inaudible] the elder, when he became emperor in, he became emperor when 38.

Speaker 1:          00:37:30       But she died already in 141. And as I mentioned, he stayed on for four until one 61. So he was emperor for 20 more years after her death. He never forgot her. He stayed and he stayed, you know, completely enamored of her. He never remarried. We don't even have any, any, any, any rumors that he had any concubines or anything like that. He seems to have stayed completely true to her. And uh, what's interesting is that, uh, when the two of them died, their successors of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius verus put up a monument to them, and it's not on your monument. Listen, I'm not holding you responsible for it, but I just want to show it to you because it will eliminate a monument that I am going to show you in a moment. Uh, this, this, uh, base which was, which served as the base for a porphyry column that was located on top.

Speaker 1:          00:38:21       Uh, it represents a scene in which we see a [inaudible] as and his wife Festina the elder being carried to heaven on the back of a male personification. We see Roma in the bottom right, and she is saluting them. She is bearing witness to what is a representation of their joint divinization the two of them Falstino the elder divinized that her death in one 41 and tinnitus pious divinize at his death in one 61. And yet we see them being carried to heaven as if they're divinization has happened exactly at the same time. This is obviously a fiction. It is conflation of time. Uh, it is a fiction of which the Romans were a pet, particularly adept in their sculptural representations. But I show it to you here because it has some bearing on, uh, a temple that I now want to talk about. This is the so called Temple of Antonius Pius and Faustina, the elder.

Speaker 1:          00:39:22       It is a temple that Antonius Pius put up in honor of his wife in one 41 to her as a diva after she was divinized. Uh, but at his own death, 20 years later in one 61, his successors again Marcus a release and Lucius verus a rededicated it to the two of them to the divine and to non as pious and to the divine fell, Stena. It is quite well preserved today and it is important for two main reasons. It is important because it is our best surviving temple that was put up to an emperor and an embrace. It wasn't the only one, but it's the best surviving example of that. Uh, and it is another example of the way in which antiquities are reused over time in other contexts and at later times. And how that reuse sometimes helps to preserve them. What I show you now on the screen is a coin on the upper left, uh, representing Fao, Stena the elder on the odd verse of the coin on the left, her portrait, and it refers to her as diva Palestina.

Speaker 1:          00:40:30       So it is a coined that and tonight is, is struck after her death and after her divinization. And we see on the back the temple that n to nine is pious, originally made in her honor. Over here we see a series of sketch of drawings that come from the Ward Perkins Textbook that show once again a depiction of that original temple on the, on the coin, and with a legend that says, I Tearny toss for eternity because now she is a diva for eternity. And then a restored view over here of what the temple would've looked like after it was rededicated to and tinnitus and Faustina in one 61. And then over here, uh, the Baroque building that was built into it in the 17th century had when it was turned into the Church of San Lorenzo in Miranda. And I put the names on the Renzo and Miranda on your monument list.

Speaker 1:          00:41:24       If we look at the view of it as it was after it was rededicated to, and tonight as pious and Faustina, we will see a typical Roman temple. All the features that we have described. So very often in the course of this semester, the deep porch, the freestanding columns in the porch and the very tall podium, uh, the single staircase, the facade emphasis, we see all of that, uh, here. Very, uh, very tip, a very conventional Roman temple with sculpture in the pediment and a decoration on the eaves of the temple as well. What we see in the bottom left is what happened to this temple in the 17th century. Part of it was preserved. Uh, maybe more of it was preserved. We're not absolutely sure, but at least part of it was preserved. The walls, the sidewalls, uh, and also the columns and the, um, the front of the well, the sidewalls primarily and the columns.

Speaker 1:          00:42:19       And the, uh, the lintel over here that has the inscription that dedicates the temple to, and tonight as pious and foul Stina. But what you see behind it is the baroque facade rising up a baroque facade that has buttresses. And I'm going to show it to you in actuality in a moment that has buttresses on either side that has this wonderful split RQ weighted pediment, a split RQ weighted pediment that would have been impossible to conceive, I believe, without these architects, baroque architects of 17th century. Looking back, uh, to the Baroque element in Roman antiquity, the cross is, is added in the center of course, but there's one major difference between this building and this building. Does anyone see what that is besides the addition of the Baroque facade?

Speaker 2:          00:43:08       What little louder. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:10       The podium. Exactly. Emily Wright. The podium is not there. The podium is not there. The staircase is not there. Why is that Emily?

Speaker 2:          00:43:23       I don't know if it up like yes, you can see it a little.

Speaker 1:          00:43:30       Yes. The ground level has risen so that at the time that they decide to turn the temple event and not as pious and fell into Song Lorenzo in Miranda, this is where the ground level is. There's no podium anymore. The podium is completely underground. As our part of the columns, we see only the part of the car. So they put the door at the, at the bottom. Oh, what is the bottom at that particular time? Now let me show you the building today. It's very well preserved. So you see what I mean by the best preserved a monument to the best preserve temple to an emperor and an emphasis in Rome, extremely well preserved. You see its location is in the Roman forum with the backdrop of the imperial fora behind it. The forum of Augustus Forum of Trajan in the Roman forum. So prime real estate, uh, for this temple.

Speaker 1:          00:44:19       When Antonius Pius pious decides to build it to his wife. We see here the original podium, the original staircase, the original columns, gray granite columns, white marble capitals. We see the original lintel with the inscription still preserve to divine Anta nine as pie as to divine Faustina. We see the original two full walls of the side. We see the lintel on this side that also has a, a freeze that is preserved from antiquity. And then we see growing up behind it, the 17th century Baroque church with uh, it's buttresses and with its broken, uh, RQ weighted pediment. And if you look very carefully, you will see this is, this was ground level in the 17th century. This is the 17th century door. This is the ancient door down here. I'll show you a couple of views where you can see that even more clearly. Here's another view showing you those great gray granite columns, the white capitals, the 17th century door, and then down here, the ancient door, which shows you more dramatically than anything else I've been able to show you this semester.

Speaker 1:          00:45:25       This change and ground level. And two more views, uh, that I took that show you the same here, the 17th century doors. So you have to think of all of this underground in the 17th century. And then only in more modern times, uh, was the, uh, was the temple excavated temple in church excavated down to their original level. Here's another view showing you again, the 17th century doorway, the earlier doorway, the staircase, a little baby down here, uh, which I was happy to have four scale. Uh, it gives you a sense once again of how, and that makes it even more dramatic because I don't know if it's a he or she. Um, she, she, uh, sit sitting there, uh, that she, uh, it makes it even more dramatic to demonstrate to you, again, since this is a lecture on bigger is better that this temple to nine is and fell.

Speaker 1:          00:46:14       Stena was also very, very also is very, very large in scale. When an to nine is pious, died in one 61. He was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius and Lucius verus mark is a really released, one of the most famous of the Roman emperors, the great stoic philosopher. And you see him in a portrait here you see Lucius verus on the left hand side. The two of them, uh, were co emperors between one 61 and one 69, uh, Lucius verus died in battle and one 69 Marcus or release continued on alone until the year 180 a d. So he too had a very long rein. Marcus spent most of his reign, however, on the front during the period that he was emperor, the barbarians were literally at the gates. There was concern that they were going to in fact overrun the city, completely overrun the empire completely.

Speaker 1:          00:47:09       And he had to spend most of his reign on the frontiers. Uh, and he did, uh, beating back those barbarians. For that reason, there was very little architectural construction, even though he had a very long reign. There was very little architectural construction during the time of Marcus Aurelius, uh, because of, uh, the, that he had to spend in war. He was succeeded by his son. Comedies whose portrait you see down here, a comedy in the line, also in the, in the megaloads maniacal line of a Nero and Domitian, a man who saw himself as a god on earth who saw himself as the Greek hero, Hercules. He called himself self Hercules' Romanos. Uh, and we see him in his most famous and most fabulous is about one of the best portraits preserved from ancient Rome. It's in the capital, I'm museums today. And you see him masquerading here as Hercules, uh, with his, uh, with the lion skin around his head holding the club, holding the apples of the Hispera cities, demonstrating that he has completed that last labor justice Hercules had done and is going to become a god in the manner of Hercules.

Speaker 1:          00:48:20       He used to parade around in Rome openly in this way, and actually struck coins showing himself as Hercules Romanos just to get to give you a sense of how extreme it was. And he was always challenging people to, uh, to, um, to, to hand to hand combat. Uh, and in fact, he eventually got his comeuppance because although he himself also range for quite a while between one 81 92. So he lasted for 12 years. But nonetheless, even his closest, uh, his closest advisors eventually turned against him and plotted behind his back and arranged for the most, one of the most famous gladiators of the day, Narcissus interestingly called Narcissus, uh, to, to, uh, take up comedy. This is a common, this is offered to fight anybody. Oh, wanted to fight him in the Colosseum. Uh, and of course he thought that being him for protected him and that he, he liked Nero who fixed the Olympic Games in his favor, that, that, uh, that communists would also never lose in a contest like this because he was by definition emperor.

Speaker 1:          00:49:23       Uh, but his advisers turned against him. Let, let narcis is loose and communist was slain by narcissists in the Colosseum. Uh, but he did, I, I do want to just mention, and only in passing comment is, did put up a column to his father, Marcus and release a that is based very closely on the column of Trajan in Rome. I'm not going to go into it with you today because the architectural complex in which it was originally found no longer survives, but I just wanted you to be aware that the column of Trajan was succeeded by the column of Marcus released. I want to, however, returned for the rest of the lecture to a new dynasty that came to the fore after the end of the so called and nine emperors. When communists died, there were no more and to nines to succeed. Him and Rome, once again, fell into a civil war.

Speaker 1:          00:50:13       And there were rivals warring with one another for supreme power. And the man who came to the fore was a man by the name of pertinent facts. P. E. R. T. I. N. A Ex. Uh, but he had other rivals. And one of them was the man who eventually really came on out on top. And His name was Lucius Septimius saveras Lucia Septimius. The bears was within that year between 92 and 93, able to get rid of not only pertinent acts but other rivals and become supreme ruler of Rome. And because he liked Vespasian before him had two sons to succeed him Caracalla and data, he was able to set up a new dynasty. The so called Severen what we call the sovereign SCV, ran the Severen dynasty in Rome, the Severen dynasty and Rome, extremely important because September Severus commissioned some important structures, both public structures and private. He was an interesting emperor because he combined an interest in the two.

Speaker 1:          00:51:10       And then his son Caracalla, who epitomizes as I began today, the whole bigger is better or biggest is best, uh, philosophy in life and in architecture. I want to show you first just to introduce you to these two patrons. Uh, this wonderful painted Tondo, uh, that is preserved from Rome. It was, was found, excuse me, not in Rome, but in Egypt, uh, and is now in the museum, a museum in Berlin. But it is important because it is our only surviving painting of an emperor. And not only an emperor, but an emperor and his whole family, his wife and his children. The only surviving painting of an emperor today. But there were obviously many of these in antiquity. It's a fascinating painting we see set. Timmy is severity with his gray hair and beard and his wonderful jeweled crown. We see his wife, Julia Domino, who buy, oh, and by the way, I neglected to mention, but one of the interesting things about, uh, about Septimius Severus his biography is the fact that he was born not in Rome and not in Spain, is Trajan and Hadrian had been, but rather in north Africa in a place called Leptin is Magdna, Lep, t, t, I s, new word, m, a,G , N, a in [inaudible], born in North Africa.

Speaker 1:          00:52:27       He hooked up with a woman from Syria, uh, whose name was Juliet Dom. She was the daughter of an important priest in Syria called Bossy, ANA's. Uh, she was famous in Rome for her wigs. She used to wear wigs, and you can see her wearing one of her wigs in this wonderful painted portrait. She also clearly liked jewelry because you can see her with these fabulous, uh, triple pearl earrings and a wonderful, uh, pearl necklace here. Also, uh, looking very vibrant, uh, in this portrait. And then the two of them with their sons, their elder son, car color over here, and their younger son, or what remains of him. Uh, gala on the left, uh, Gava and gay to, and Caracalla succeeded their father together as co rulers, but, uh, Carra call a very jealous of his brother, who was much more popular with the Roman populace.

Speaker 1:          00:53:19       Then Caracalla himself was a, and Caracalla eventually had his brother murdered, uh, and after his brother was murdered, he, uh, he convinced that as Caracalla convinced the Roman Senate to issure issue a dop, not tio memoria or damnation of the memory of data. And an attempt was made to eradicate data from history by eradicating and from art. And you can see that he was snuffed out, his face was removed on this, but then it was left to stand to show the power that Carra call a had to destroy, uh, his brother. As you can see here, this gives you a glimpse into the mind and psyche of Caracalla. I want to show you first though, to buildings before we look at the baths of Caracalla up. Uh, I do want to show you two buildings, uh, of Septimius Savara. It's a public building. First, the so-called arch of the severity and the Roman forum, and then an extension to the palatine palace.

Speaker 1:          00:54:15       The arch of me severity and the Roman forum dates to add 203, and it commemorates a the Parthian victory of Septimius. Severna Septimius Severus I already mentioned to you, came to power in a civil war. So like Augustus and like Vespasian before him. He needed to gain legitimacy by having an important foreign victory. And he does this by looking east as Augustus had done before. Him Looking to Parthenia, uh, and does war with Partha and in fact has an important victory and celebrates that important victory in this triumphal arch that is put up in his honor in 203 Aidy in once again, the choices spot a real estate in Rome, the forum Romana the Roman Forum. I show you a Google earth view over here. We've seen this one before, so you've undoubtedly got this one memorized by now. There's Google Earth image of the Roman forum as it looks today with the coliseum up there with the via de Fori am periodically imperial for over here, the circus maximus, the Palatine Hill, the comp Udofia capital on hill is redesigned by Michelangelo, the wedding cake of Victor Emmanuel here between the [inaudible] and the coliseum, we see, of course the remains of the ancient Roman forum, much lower ground level than the modern ground level.

Speaker 1:          00:55:40       Uh, you'll recall, uh, the location of the Temple of Venus in Roma just underneath the coliseum of the arch of Titus on the Veolia. Uh, and you should remember also that we talked way in the beginning of the term about two arches to succeed. Successive arches built in honor of Augustus. First his act in victory, victory enact Actium and then his victory over the Parthians, which is over here. And then, uh, if we look very close, it's a little hard to see when I'm up this close, but we look very closely. We will see the location, I think it's roughly around here of the arch of is severity. We can see it better in this, a plan of the Roman forum as a developed between the third and seventh centuries a d we see the top Yulara and at the top, which means we're close to the Capitoline hill.

Speaker 1:          00:56:28       We see two basilicas that were put up in the Republican period. Uh, we see a temple that we did not study that was put up in honor of the divine Julius Caesar by Augustus. We see the speakers platform, we see the Senate House, which I will show you in a later lecture. Uh, and over here we see the location of what was originally the acting arch of Augustus and then the Parthian arch of Augustus and remember that the Parthian arch of Augustus had a triple opening. I and then if you look at the rest of the plan, you will see the location of the arch of Septimius Rivera's over there diagonally across in dialogue with the Parthian arch of Augustus. Was this coincidence? Absolutely not. This was clearly very carefully orchestrated by September to severity and his advisors to build his Parthian arch in dialogue with the Parthian arch of Augustus with regard to its form, it also made reference to the Augusta and arch.

Speaker 1:          00:57:29       I show you here the arch of Septimus severity as it looks today. It is our first example that we've seen this semester of a Roman arch with a triple open, a triple RQ weighted opening, a large RQ, wade RQ weighted opening in the center, flanked by two smaller lower RQ weighted entrance. We have not seen that before. First surviving example in Rome. Will we remember? If we look, think back to the arches. We have explored from the time of Augustus on, you'll remember that they are single bade arches. Augustus is acting arch, the arch of Titus and even the second century arch of Trajan at a Vento. But as I've already said today, the, if we look back to the coin, the arch no longer exists, but we look back to a coin depiction of the Parthian arch of Augustus. It had three openings, a central RQ weighted opening and then two rectangular openings.

Speaker 1:          00:58:25       Trey be aided openings with pediments on either side flanking it. So this is not the Parthian arch of Augustus is not a triple RQ weighted arch, but it is a three opening arch. And I think there is no question that those three openings are being alluded to in the Severn arch and being and being transformed into something that was new, which was the idea of the triple arcuate and bay or maybe it wasn't so new because there's an arch, the arch that you see down here in the south of France at [inaudible] and we'll look at this arch when we, when we make our journey to the south of France in an upcoming lecture, uh, we will look at this arch and it's, it's a triple bait arch, just like the arch of September [inaudible] severity. It's covered with sculpture, just like the arch of Septum is severity.

Speaker 1:          00:59:10       So for a while there were scholars who dated this to the time of September. He is severities, although put up in the provinces a bought a recent scholarship, more reasons scholarship has demonstrated, scholars have looked at the piles of arms and armor on here. And identified it as piles of arms and armor that had to do with battles that took place in the south of France or what is now the south of France in the age of Augustus. There's also an inscription referring to a specific historical figure who lived during the time, the late period of Augustus and into the time of Tiberius. So it seems very likely that this is not a sever and arch, but a tie Berian arch. Uh, and I show it to you here only because while we usually, and this may be helpful to some of you who are doing, uh, papers, topics or city plans in the provinces, uh, we usually think of ideas flowing from the center to the periphery.

Speaker 1:          01:00:01       But here we seem to have an idea that comes to the fore first in the periphery and then ends up ultimately in the center. Although of course there are lots of missing pieces to the ancient puzzle. I mean, there are lots of monuments that have not come down to us. So it is not inconceivable that a triple bade arch was built in Rome earlier, but we just have no evidence for it. I want to show you the arch itself very quickly because it's mainly a work of sculpture. But just to show you the three bays victories in the spandrels river. God's down here in scription at the top, you'll have to imagine the great bronze Quad Droga of the emperor at the apex, uh, decorated bases down here but most interesting are the panels that we see. Four panels that we see, two on either side of the arch.

Speaker 1:          01:00:45       And I show you a detail, a very good detail of one of them here. Although it's weathered, you can see it quite well. Uh, you can see that this panel, instead of having full length figure standing on a single ground line as we saw for example, in the, uh, in the, in the freeze of the our pockets, we see figures on a number of tears here, small figures on a number of tears. It should remind you of the scenes on the column of Trajan. Those spiral, the spiral freeze with the individual figures telling the story of Ward. In this case the Parthian more of of uh, September. He is severity. Uh, but, and so what I think happened here, my, my, my theory and there are others who've said the same, is that what happened to your, is that the designer of this got the idea to take excerpts in a sense from the columns of trades under the column of mark is a release and put them in panel format on this monument.

Speaker 1:          01:01:38       Uh, whether, I don't know whether, you know, you can think to yourselves whether you think this is successful or not. I think it probably was not deemed to be particularly successful because it is the only arch design of its type. No one picked up afterwards and imitated this particular eye. Dia the basis down below representing Romans, bringing back Parthian prisoners. I want to speak very briefly also, uh, about, uh, uh, Septimius saveras is extension of the Imperial Palace on the Palatine Hill. He extended it to the south. He lived there just like every emperor since demission. He extended it on the southern side. That's the side nearest the forum. And he added a facade, a to it, a very elaborate facade that does not survive. It doesn't survive because we know it was torn down in 1588 to 1589 by one of the pope's because the pope wanted to use it in his own paypal building, wanted to use the building materials in his own paypal building.

Speaker 1:          01:02:37       But fortunately, uh, the artist Martin von Heemskerck, the renaissance artists, and I put his name on the monument list for you. Martin von Heemskerck, uh, uh, drew some of it while it was being dismantled. And you see a piece of it over here in the Martin von Heemskerck drawing. There's also a, uh, a, uh, the, um, the, um, plan of this structure also preserved on the forma orbis. And we can see that marble plan of Rome from the Severn period. We take both of those, that evidence together. We can reconstruct it quite effectively. We can see that it was a, a, a facade that look very much like a theater, uh, with wings on either side with apses here, three large apses, uh, and columns inside those apps is with other elements that have columns in three tiers looking very much like a theater stage set all done in marble. Uh, it might have been also a fountain.

Speaker 1:          01:03:33       There might've been a base in down here with a water display. All of this serving as a new facade for dimensions palace on the Palatine Hill. It's important because it's another example of this use of progression recession progression, recession, uh, Kloss across the facade to give an in and out undulating movement using the traditional vocabulary of architecture in a way that is striking and in a way that it again, Harold's, this new baroque style in Roman architecture. I also mentioned, uh, just as the last point about this monument that we also, the reason it's called the CEP disodium or the CEP disodium and you see that name on the monument list for you. The reason is referred to as a step disodium is because it was thought to honor the or to commemorate the seven planets, uh, which is not surprising in the orbit of symptom you severities and Julia dominant because we know that Julia dominant was an avid follower of astrological signs, used to predict what was going to happen in her husband's a rain, uh, through those signs.

Speaker 1:          01:04:32       And this is likely a nod to her particular astrological interests and the in the nine or 10 minutes that remain, I want to end today with this extraordinary imperial bath structure that was designed at the behest of the Emperor Caracalla when Septicemia severities died in two 11. He was succeeded by car call and by Gayda I've already told you what Caracalla did to get rid of data. Uh, and Caracalla became sole emperor in 212 212 id and remained emperor until his death in 217 a d a and one of his major commissions was this imperial bath structure. He wanted to eight his father because we know that Septum Mya Savara said also built a major public bath. And roam the tear my Septa, me on. I, they do not survive. We have very little knowledge of them. So there isn't anything that I can show you or tell you about them.

Speaker 1:          01:05:34       But we know he built it. So like father like son, he wanted to outdo his father's is like Bush one Bush to wanting to outdo his father and to build an even larger, uh, bathing establishment. And he does it here in Rome, a a bathing establishment called the baths of Caracalla or the tear. My Antonia Neon. I as of Caracalla dates to 212 to 216. And uh, any of you who have seen it will agree with me. This is one if you, if we hadn't have been outrageous for them was the mother of all forms. This is certainly the mother of all imperial bath structures. This is quite something. Uh, fortunately, much of it survives mainly the concrete shell, uh, sh concrete shell of itself. Uh, but, uh, we can see the outlines here in this Google earth image, which shows you not only the bathing block, but also part of the precinct that surrounded it.

Speaker 1:          01:06:27       Because we shall see if we look at a plan of the baths of Caracalla, which you see here in the bottom left. This is a detail of just the bathing block. And if we compare the general plan with the plan of the bads of Trajan in Rome, we will see that the bands of Trajan, which were very large in their own day, have been exceeded, succeeded here in terms of size, but are very much in the same general format. By that, I mean, I large bathing block here inside a larger precinct. That precinct has around it, a host of rooms that were used as lecture halls and seminar rooms and Greek and Latin libraries. So again, great locus of intellectual as well as uh, as, as wellness, uh, in the city of Rome in the third century, a d, uh, we see that in the baths of Caracalla just as if we look at the bathing block, just as in the bads of Trajan, we see that all the main bathing rooms, which were used both for men and women, but probably at different times of Day are aligned with one another.

Speaker 1:          01:07:32       We see the great figure Doriam here with the triple groin vault over that buttressed by rooms with barrel bolts on either side. We see a conventional, a vertically oriented tepid Doriam essentially a rectangle here leading into the call Darren. So all of these analysis Brigador him tepid Arrium called RM called Arrium around dish, a structure with alcoves, uh, and uh, but very large in scale. In fact, you'll be interested to hear that the span of the Dome of the call, Darian of the baths of Caracalla was almost as large as the span of the, at the Dome of the Pantheon in Rome. Just to get you, give you a sense of the extraordinary, bigger is better scale. Uh, in this particular bath over here, a Natacha Geo located where it usually isn't, but here on access with the other rooms and interesting to talk to Ya with a scallop aside, screened by columns and then otherwise all the rooms symmetrically disposed around two polestar I one on either side, matching room symmetrically disposed around the central building blocks.

Speaker 1:          01:08:36       So the same imperial bath structure type a that we saw developed under Titus and Trajan but taken too much larger scale here. This model shows you that the, the, the whole, here we are looking back at the walls which were very plain on three sides toward the Taco, toward the vaulting of the, uh, of the frigging Darian. And then the Dome as you can see there of the caldarium. Interesting is the, uh, the front side of the or the the side where you can see the caldarium projecting over here, which you can see is opened up much more than the other sides with a series of columns, uh, screened columns a and then columns screening and opening up the call, Darian as well on the southern side of the monument. Uh, just a few views to give you a sense of what this structure looks like today.

Speaker 1:          01:09:31       Again, it's mainly piles of concrete, uh, faced with brick. Uh, but you can see some of the soaring vaults still there. This is a, this is, this is in fact, uh, you know, this is even in this view, it's much smaller than it would have been because so much of the ceilings and the bolts are missing today. But you can get a sense by looking at this family of four, a standing next to it, the colossal scale of the baths of Caracalla in Rome. Here's another view with some tourists as well, uh, to also give you a sense of, and this is very incomplete today, but it still gives you some idea of the colossal magnitude, uh, of this particular bath structure. As one walks through it, there's actually very little, uh, ornamental decorations still preserved, but there was plenty in antiquity you can see here and there some fragments of a freeze.

Speaker 1:          01:10:20       This is a restored view of what the Frig Darian would have looked like, the most important room in the bath, which would have been tripled groin vaulted, as you can see here, which would have had gray granite columns with white marble. Capital's a and would have had an incredible sculptural display, uh, and Caracalla like demission before him remembered emissions Al Reggio and those colossal statues of Dionysus and Apollo, uh, with whom demission wanted to associate himself Caracalla, uh, of the same ilk who also wanted to ally himself with great heroes of the past, a great gods of the past. And he follows the lead of communists and who's in, who's mode and model. He, he, he kind of, and he looked back again to Nero Domitian to communists. Uh, and he, he, he likens himself to Hercules. And we have sculpture that is preserved from the Darian that represents Hercules, Hercules, the weary, the famous weary Hercules type.

Speaker 1:          01:11:18       This is now in Naples. And the Archeological Museum [inaudible] the statute, but it comes from the frigging Darian up the baths of Caracalla. We're absolutely sure of that. And it depicts the weary Hercules. Uh, it is a Roman copy. Uh, the artists, we know his name, I put his name on the monument list for you, Gli con of Athens. So an Athenian sculptor working in the time of Caracalla makes this copy, but he makes it a very of a very famous last Greek original by the Greek sculptor lie sipfest, whose name is also on your monument list, a, uh, a work of art that he originally made in the three thirties BC. So glycone of Athens copies lie. Sip is also a grease this statue at the behest, again of Caracalla. And the fact that this was a theme or a light motif that ran through all the decoration of the frigging Darian is underscored by the fact that a composite capitol that survives also from the Frig, Darian, uh, shows a figure of that same weary Hercules interspersed with the canvas leaves of that capital.

Speaker 1:          01:12:21       So again, a very carefully orchestrated program to try to underscore the relationships between Caracalla and Hercules, uh, mosaics a black and a geometric mosaics. And not unlike those in Ostia found a and still exist in the bas of car. Call it today, black and white with a little addition of color here. Another, uh, another section that shows you the interest in geometry as well as floral motifs. Uh, this detail that you can also see on the state sites still today showing the see scenes that we're not [inaudible], we're the kind of scenes one would expect in a bath. Uh, very similar to those that Ostia but done in a somewhat more of a better way. And then the PS to raise this daunts I think of the mosaics of the baths of Caracalla and WellPreserved today, uh, was a mosaic that you can see his curve to s two s to be placed into a room of this shape that depict on the floor all the famous athletes and gladiators of the day, either in full length statues or and full length images or in a portrait images.

Speaker 1:          01:13:29       Uh, and I don't doubt that these would have been recognizable stars, superstars, you know, the Alex Rodriguez of their day a superstars flexing their muscles for the public and hoping to be recognized by everyone who came to this bath. And you can just imagine men and women standing above looking and trying to pick out who is depicted here. Here's another view that I took that is in its current location, which is in the Vatican museums in Rome. That's where one needs to go to see what survives up this wonderful mosaic with the athletes and gladiators of the day. And I showed them to you here as well. And if you look at these, you can see that they not only are shown, you know, some, some are already Victor's, some are taking part in their sport. Uh, but once again, just as in the Alexander Mosaic, we see the use of a lot of different colored tests awry.

Speaker 1:          01:14:18       We see cast shadows. This is very well done. Wonderful. Uh, facial configurations done by what must have been the leading mosaicism of the day for the baths of Caracalla. And just in closing today, I thought I would show you a, a one of those heads blown up, uh, to poster size as you can see here, but also put it next to an actual portrait of Caracalla. This is not important as a course in sculpture, but I wanted to show this to, especially since it's a portrait that you can see, it's in New York at the Metropolitan Museum of art, a very powerful portrait of a very intense, a Roman emperor. As you can see on the left. But I think there is, there is some relationship between the way in which the sculptors have depicted Caracalla with his very cubic and abstract face is short military hairstyle and the depictions of the athletes and the gladiator. So I think he was not only trying to, uh, to, uh, draw a relationship between himself and Hercules Romanos, but also between himself and some of the greatest athletes and gladiators of the day to underscore his strength as a leader. It was all for naught, ultimately. Uh, but nonetheless, he achieved it. And I think it also speaks to him as a man with that bigger is better philosophy. Thank you.
