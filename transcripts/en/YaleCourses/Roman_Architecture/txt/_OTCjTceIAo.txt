Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Good morning everybody. In the last couple of lectures, uh, we have looked at what happened when Rome took over civilizations that were older then Rome zone and arguably even more advanced than Rome's own. And what happened of course, was an interesting mix between the architecture and the architectural forms that the Romans brought with them and what they found in these highly developed civilizations. And the interesting mix that came about because of that. But we've also taken a look at, uh, at what happens when Rome went out and created cities essentially from scratch built cities where there had been no cities before. Uh, and uh, and, and what happened as a result tended to be cities that look very much, uh, in the Roman stamp. And we're going to look at a number of those cities today, uh, in the western provinces of the empire. In fact, uh, to see what happens again, when Rome build cities from scratch in that part of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       Uh, and as I mentioned already, the distinctive stamp, this distinctive Roman stamp that they had, but at the same time, there is always some impact from the local civilization. And to mention in passing that at least in the part of the world that we'll be concentrating on today, especially in goal ancient Gaul, the Celtic tribes, uh, we're, we're, we're foremost they are. And we do see that some of the impact of those tribes makes itself felt as well as tribes, uh, in other parts of this part of the ancient Roman world. Just as a reminder, I want to show you again a couple of the monuments that we looked at last time when we were talking about Greece and about Athens under the Romans. And I remind you, for example, on the left hand side of the screen of this temple of Olympian Zeus, the Olympia, he aeon in Athens, which was begun already in the archaic period.

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       The Greek archaic period continued to be built up are those, the patrons tried to complete it in the course of the Hellenistic period into the Augustan period. And ultimately, as you'll remember, uh, it was completed under the emperor Hadrian. So a building with a very long history and a very distinctive style. And when it was completed under Hadrian of course, you'll recall that it looked entirely Greek, very similar to what it had. It would have been, uh, in the Hellenistic period. Uh, so those, again, the, the Greeks holding very tenaciously to their own plans to, they are building materials and indeed to the kinds of artists, architects and artisans to carve them that that had been carving them for centuries. We also took a look at the building on the right hand side of the screen, which is the oral Ogi on event drawn like this or the tower of the winds.

Speaker 1:          00:02:55       And you'll remember in this case that the civilization that had impact on was another, uh, firmly entrenched civilization. And that is that of Egypt. We talked about the fact that while the date of this monument is controversial, uh, we'd might be second century BC, it might be [inaudible] or even into the Augustan period. It's controversial, but we talked about the fact that even though the date is controversial, that the monument itself was built under very strong influence from Ptolemaic Egypt. Uh, the Ptolemaic Egyptians particularly intrigued, for example, by clocks. This was a water clock, as you'll remember, a and by these abstruse, uh, I identifications of abstruse wins a male winds, uh, that we see in the upper most parts. So again, the impact of two very, very high civilizations, a Greek civilization and the Egyptian civilization on Roman architecture in the eastern part of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       Today we're going to go west, uh, and we're going to look at Roman architecture in a variety of places, including a and some beautiful places, including the south of France, uh, a series of cities. And I'll point those out to you in a moment, uh, in the north of Italy. So the north of Italy, the south of France, into Spain, into what is now Spain. And then also we will dip into, uh, an area called Istria, which is the upper most part of what is now Croatia, where a place by the name of Pola is located. So those western provinces will be, are the area that we're going to concentrate on today. Now, any of you who've traveled in this part of the world know that it is extraordinarily beautiful. Uh, and I show you just one example of that. When you go along the French Riviera, for example, I, you see places as sophisticated as Monte Carlo with its yachts, Mort here, uh, and of course with its glittering nightlife, and it's extremely famous, uh, uh, casino, the Casino in Monte Carlo.

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       There are also other wonderful cities to visit along here. Modern cities such as that, a veal frosh, uh, which you see here. And it's, it's a fabulous pastel colored houses with boats that are not quite as magnificent as those at a Monte Carlo, but nonetheless, very picturesque, a wonderful place to visit. So it's not a hardship to have to travel and look at, uh, at Roman antiquities in the south of France. I want to begin though with northern Italy, with a city in the north of Italy, uh, city, uh, at a place called [inaudible] stuck. So the first on your monument list for today, uh, a city, uh, that was, that was founded by the Romans in 24 BC in the time of Augustus. And therefore, it won't surprise you to hear that it's ancient. Roman name was Agusta Pretoria. I boost to Pretoria, the modern city of a asta.

Speaker 1:          00:05:56       And it the last colony that the Romans founded in Italy, the last colony. And it's interesting to see, therefore, uh, that this last Roman colony in Italy takes almost exactly the shape of the first Roman colony in Italy. You'll remember the city of Ostia, which the Romans founded in 350 BC, and the way in which it conform to the typical cost from plan. We see the same thing here. Uh, we see this typical costume plan for a Asta, a rectangle, a regular rectangle laid out. According to Roman surveying practice, we see that the two major streets of the city, the carto and the deck [inaudible] meat in the center, and that at that intersection of those two main said to a main streets, we see the location as it should be of the forum. Most likely you'll see a question mark there. So we're not absolutely sure, but we think that the forum was located there.

Speaker 1:          00:06:51       Uh, if you look around at the rest of the city, it was very regularly laid out with a series of buildings that we've become accustomed to seeing in a typical Roman city. When a typical Roman city is built from the basics, you see the boughs here, you see a temple up there with a crip deport this, uh, you see a theater and you see an amphitheater. This site, by the way, spectacularly located in the Italian Alps. Uh, it's at the intersection of two major trade routes in the Saint Bernard passes. As you can see from this plan that comes from Ward Perkins. And what you can also see that's typical of these cities that the Romans built from scratch, uh, around the western part of the empire, uh, is the fact that the city is ringed with walls. Uh, and that it has a series of gates, the openings of which you can also see in this excellent plan.

Speaker 1:          00:07:46       Now I can show you also a from the city of a Asta, a surviving Roman arch, one of those gateways in fact, uh, from the city that we know dates to the age of Augustus. So we give it a date, the same day, roughly 24 BC. You see it here. Uh, you see, if you remember, uh, the arches that we've discussed from the Augustan period in the past, uh, you'll, you'll note right off that this is very consistent with other, uh, uh, Bustin arch design. By that I mean it has one single RQ weighted bay in the center flanked on either side by pedestals, wide wide pedestals that have a set of double columns on either side. As you can see here, uh, the major difference between this and an arch that might've been put up in Rome at the same time, uh, in the Augustan period is the fact that it is made out of local stone, which is characteristic of so much of provincial Roman architecture and will be the case for most of the buildings that we look at today. Uh, the attic is gone. There's a modern roof on top of the structure, the ancient attic is gone. But you can imagine that it would have had a fairly traditional attic with an inscription at the apex and probably some kind of sculpture crowning, uh, the monument in antiquity. Now there's one detail that has to do with the orders that are used here, uh, that is different from any other arch that we've seen before. And I wonder if any of you notice what that is?

Speaker 1:          00:09:22       The columnar orders.

Speaker 2:          00:09:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:25       They are what?

Speaker 2:          00:09:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:28       Doric ionic Corinthian Corinthian. Okay. Everyone agrees that Corinthian, you're absolutely correct. Uh, but what is strange about the fact that you look above those Corinthian columns? What do you see? That doesn't usually go with Corinthian columns.

Speaker 2:          00:09:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:46       The try glyphs in the metaphase, the triglyceride, the metal piece, it's tend to accompany the doric order. So this is very interesting. We see this mixing of the orders here, uh, the use of, of Corinthian columns, but a doric freeze with try glyphs and metaphase. You'd never see that in Rome itself. Uh, but what it is, is an interesting playing around with the, uh, with the canonical orders that have been passed from Rome to this part of the world. This particular architect or patron or the city itself, but whatever was the patron of this particular monument made the decision to go into somewhat different routes. So an interesting mixing of the orders and eccentric a arch in that regard, but in every other conforming quite closely to what we would see in, uh, in Rome, the city of Rome contemporaneously. Uh, we, we, I also, I wanted to go from a asta in the north of Italy to the south of France, to provost, uh, to take a look at the original town plan of the city of Rl, the well known city of Rl.

Speaker 1:          00:10:50       And those of you who know it or have been there? No, it probably primarily as the city of Vincent Van Gogh. Uh, it's in the city of RL. He spent a good deal of time, uh, he went to this particular cafe so often that it bears as bear born his name, uh, for some time, the cafe van Gogh. And you'll see another view of a lovely Piatsa in the city of our plaza in the city of, um, of Rl a. And then the famous painting of Van Gogh, the painting that he made, uh, of this particular cafe that he used to spend so much time in a cafe. Again, as you see here is still there. Uh, and when you, where you can yourselves go and sip an Aperitif or whatever, uh, this part of this, the city of RL, wonderful place to go. It has a very, I'm not going to show it to you in any detail, just a glimpse here of it's a famous amphitheater.

Speaker 1:          00:11:42       It has a very well preserved Roman amphitheater and the fact that France is so close, as you can see in that map I showed you before, uh, to uh, Spain, uh, has, has, uh, led to quite a bit of Spanish influence coming into this particular part of France. Uh, and this amphitheater is used today not only for other kinds of performances, but even for bull fights. Uh, as you see, this is actually bullfight in Madrid, not in a, not in, um, oral. Uh, but nonetheless, it's a sort of thing that has been performed even in the amphitheater at RL. Here's the map again, before I show you the city plan of oral as it would've looked, I just wanted to remind you of these towns in relationship to one another. So we've, we've come up from Rome. We've looked at [inaudible] in the north of Italy, in the Alps, a, we're making our way now into the south of France.

Speaker 1:          00:12:35       And I wanted to point out the proximity of northern Italy with the south of France because we do believe, uh, that a lot of the impact of Rome was felt through the intern on south of France or what is now the south of France was, was, felt, uh, uh, through was passed through the intermediary of the north of Italy. That there was certain kinds of architectural forms that were developed in the north of Italy, uh, that were transferred into the south of France because of the proximity of one to the other. We're going to be looking at RL. We're going to be looking at name. We're going to look at a building and locked tour B. We'll be looking at seven, me and at orange, the great theater at orange as well as a temple at van. So all of those sites, we're going to dip into Spain. Uh, we're going to look at a famous, famous, spectacular aqueduct of Segovia and a less spectacular but very WellPreserved aqueduct at Terra Gona. Uh, and then we're also going to make our way, as I mentioned before, into Istria, uh, part of what was formerly Yugoslavia to this site called Pola. Uh, that is now in, as you know, Croatia.

Speaker 1:          00:13:45       I want to begin with the, uh, with the city plan of RL, uh, as it would've looked in ancient times. And I show you here the city plan, uh, of the, uh, excuse me, not the city plan. I want to show you the forum to give you a sense of what fora looked like in the, in the western provinces, uh, during this period, especially in Gaul. I want to show you the forum plan of the city of Rl a. And I show it to you here with the modern streets super imposed on top of it because much of it is underground, you can't see too much of it today, but it has been explored underground enough where scholars have been able, archeologists have been able to reconstruct the fact that it was a large open rectangular space surrounded by columns as we have seen is characteristic of all Roman, uh, as forum design from the time from the forum and palm pay that we looked at very at the very beginning of this semester.

Speaker 1:          00:14:42       And although you can't see it on this particular plan, there was also a temple on one short and as well as a basilica that was part this plan. And I think it's interesting to think back, especially as you review a, from what we'd done sit from the midterm through the second midterm. I, it's interesting to think about a basilican architecture and because it was usually a part of forums and when it was a part of, and, and in what buildings in what fora it was incorporated. Think back to Pompei a think to the forum of Trajan in Rome. But think of the fact that both the, the forums of Julius Caesar and the forum of Augustus in Rome did not have a basilica, is as part of them here already in the Augustan period in a, because that's when this dates in the Augustan period. We see a basilica incorporated into the forum plan, uh, in what was ancient goal.

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       Uh, I mentioned that there's a well preserved as a WellPreserved crypt. Deported is an underground storage area around the colonnade and you see a view of it here, extremely well preserved and it should remind you of those crib deport a that we looked at very early in the semester at the sanctuaries that we explored the sanctuary, you know, actively and um, Hercules, victor and Hercules, Victor Tivoli and uh, Jupiter AG, sir at Terra Cina for example, very similar with its barrel vaulted carters. This one was used for storage within the forum, so they would store salt and fuel, uh, and other items that they would need for daily use. Uh, but it also became eventually, and you can get an inkling of that from this view on the left. It eventually became a dump, a for architectural members that were no longer needed. As you can see here, columns and capitals, but also for sculpture.

Speaker 1:          00:16:29       And one of the most famous, uh, portraits of the emperor Augustus was found in this crypto porticas dumped there at some time, some later period. And it's now on display in the archeological museum in RL. I want to turn now to the theater at all wrongs, which is one of the most spectacular monuments that I'm going to show you today. And you see it in this extraordinary view from the air. Uh, a building that you can see from your monument list was put up in the late first century BC or early first century. And it is really something special, not only in its own right, but also because of how well preserved it is. And you can see in this view, uh, not only the typical, the typical scheme that we have seen as we've become accustomed to for Roman theater design, the semicircular orchestra, the semicircular Cabiya, the division into these wedge shapes, sections or Kunae, uh, the, uh, the outer wall of the structure.

Speaker 1:          00:17:33       And you should be immediately struck by this outer wall of the structure because the outer wall of the structure is better preserved than any other outer wall that we've seen in the course of this semester. It's preserved to its full height. It is very severe. Uh, but that severity would have been lessened in antiquity by the incorporation of a colonnade on the front of the structure. Uh, so this very important building, uh, in that regard because we again have this very well preserved wall which gives us a good sense of what these walls would have looked like in antiquity. And you have to imagine here, uh, the, um, again that, that alleviation of this, of this severity by that portico. You can also see here though something very interesting about this particular theater, uh, that, uh, that makes it connected. Although it's Roman in every way, uh, that connects it also to earlier Greek theatrical architecture.

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       Because you'll remember that the major difference between a Roman theaters and Greek theaters was that Romans built their theaters on their own hill made of concrete, but the Greeks built their theater is on hell, actual natural hillsides. And if you look very carefully at this excellent view from the air, you will see, uh, the way in which this particular theater at [inaudible] is actually built into a hillside. They happen to have a natural hillside, perfect for this kind of construction right where they wanted it to be. So they took advantage of that hillside and they place, they supported the Kavya of this structure by that hillside. As you can see, extremely well, the interior of the theater at [inaudible] is also extremely well preserved. As you can see here. Uh, you can see the, uh, this, this stage, uh, you can see the semicircular orchestra, you can see the stone seats of the Kavya.

Speaker 1:          00:19:30       Uh, and you can also see that the stage building and because the wall, the outside retaining wall is so well preserved. Uh, you can also see that the interior of the wall still stands, obviously. Uh, and this wall had one giant niche in the center with a projecting element also in the center, and then would have had three tiers of columns, one on one on top of one another. Most of those are unfortunately no longer there. But you can see one set of two pairs here. Uh, one of the lowest tier with two columns, the upper tier with two partial columns above that, which gives you some sense of what this would have looked like in antiquity.

Speaker 1:          00:20:13       Again, we think the tears, the columns were on three stories. Uh, remember the date of this lake for century BC probably. Uh, and so this does post date some of the 60 to 50 beef to 40 BC paintings that we looked at that show these kinds of multistory skein. I frons is with a columns we taught. We speculated about the fact that some of those may have been based on actual theatrical architecture, but that it didn't survive from that early on, but it made, it may have been made out of wood. But here we see a fairly early example, uh, in the Augustan period in the south of France. And it is very important in that regard.

Speaker 1:          00:20:56       I want to turn from theater architecture in the western provinces to a temple architecture. And just as in Rome, and just as in every city that we've looked at, temple architecture was extremely important. Uh, the temples that I'm going to show you, and I'm going to show you two of them, one at Vn, uh, in France and one at a Neem, also in France are among our best preserved Roman temples today. Uh, and it's important to keep in mind that both of them were part of complex as they stand in isolation today. But in antiquity, they were part of a complex, uh, probably some kind of forum or central space for that city. Uh, this is the one that van which I show you, show you to you first, that dates, uh, to the probably to before a 14, and it is a temple that was put up to Augustus in Roma.

Speaker 1:          00:21:56       It may have been the dedication may have been changed to Augustus and his wife Livia. Uh, at some point we're not absolutely sure, but you see it here in a very good general view of what it looks like today. It's one of these buildings that has been preserved in large part because it has been used for later purposes. It was used as a, as a marketplace. Uh, it was used as a museum at one point and that is what has helped to preserve it. We see it again here. And it's interesting I think to compare it to the restored view of the temple of Mars old tour that was part of the forum of Augustus in Rome because the dates are roughly comparable to one another. And I think that you will see that it is, that it is atypical Roman temple, in fact, almost indistinguishable from what we would see in Rome.

Speaker 1:          00:22:47       At the same time. So here's an example again of what happens when you go, when the Romans go into a part of the world that isn't already inhabited by a very highly developed civilization that they make buildings that look very similar to those that were put up contemporaneously in Rome. Uh, the temple at the end is no exception. If we look at this temple, we see it has the typical Greco-Roman plan, uh, with the tall podium, the deep porch, the freestanding columns in that porch. Uh, and we see that the order that is used here is the Corinthian order. Some of the temple is made out of local limestone. Uh, some of it is made out of marble. Uh, but what we see here that's very interesting. Visa vi what was happening at the same time in Rome is the seller. You can see that the sella is actually very shallow, much more shallow than the cell cell a usually is.

Speaker 1:          00:23:40       And you can see that quite well in this view over here. And that same shallow seller we find at the temple of Mars all tour in Rome. The other similarity is the fact that at the Temple Marzel tour in Rome, we have freestanding columns, columns all the way up to the, to the back here, uh, and those columns and the, and the space between those columns and the wall of the Sella. And that creates a tie, a type of temple design that we referred to today as a temple with ally or wings, wings, one on either side of the seller, uh, formed by that space between the wall of the Sella and the freestanding columns. And we see exactly the same thing over here. This design of a temple with all lie, there is no question that this temple in Vienne was built under the very strong influence of the temple of Mars old tour in Rome.

Speaker 1:          00:24:38       All of those features, I mean, it wouldn't have come upon those features by accident. It is clearly being closely based. One on the other here are two more views of the temple of uh, uh, of Augustus and Roma Slash Livia at van where we see all of the features that I've already shown you. But where you can see particularly, well the shallow seller, uh, the plane, the back wall here that has pilasters rather than columns. And then if you go around the back, you will see it as a flame plain flat back, uh, which was the case also for the temple of Maura's old tour in Rome, a more famous temple and even more famous temple. And if that's possible and even better preserved a temple a is the one that you now see on the left hand side of the screen, which is the famous Meson cafe at Neem.

Speaker 1:          00:25:29       It to it to, uh, has been reused in ancient times as a museum and the like, it's still a small museum today, which is one of the main reasons that it is so well preserved. It is an extraordinary work of Roman architecture. I think it's interesting to compare it to the Temple of Port Tunis that we saw much earlier this semester. The major difference of course between the two, the materials that are used, this is local limestone with marble. Uh, this, well we won't, we won't remind ourselves, but the Tufa and travertine and so on and so forth, uh, that we looked at earlier. This is an ionic temple. This is a Corinthian temple, but once again, it seems to be the temple of Mars old tour. That was the main model, uh, for the Meson cafe or the square house at name. Uh, and I show you another view of it here because you'll see just like the temple of Port Tunis, it has a pseudo peripheral colonnade and you can see that extremely well.

Speaker 1:          00:26:29       Yes, the columns and circle the entire monument, including the back wall. Uh, but those columns are engaged or attached to the wall going all the way around here. You can again see the opas quad rotten blocks of this local limestone that's used for the walls and then marble use for the columns and also for the capitals of this glorious and very well preserved Roman temple and hear some spectacular details of the capitals of the, uh, of the temp of the Meson cafe at Neem and the freeze and also the, uh, the decoration up above. And what's interesting about these capitals, if you look at them in detail, you will see that not only are they Corinthian and we can see the uh, the, uh, spiral volume it's growing out of the canvas leaves down below. But if you compare these capitals to a capital, a preserve capital from the temple of Mars old tour in Rome, you will see that not only are these based on these, but that they are so close, so close that there is absolutely no question, I believe, well this was not suggested by me, but by a scholar who studied these in great detail, uh, and determined and suggested and all of us have believed it ever since, that these are not only based on those but that the same workshop a worked these capitals for the Meson cafe as for the temple of Mars old tour in Rome.

Speaker 1:          00:28:03       Now that works well chronologically because you'll remember that the temple of Marzel tour in Rome was dedicated into BC. This building, as you can see from your monument list, was built in around a d five. Uh, so there was perfect. That was, it was perfect timing for those, uh, architects and artisans who had been successful at the temple of Marzel tour in Rome. This major commission allowed themselves, we believe, to be hired out to those in the south of France to make the trip, uh, to name a, in order to build a temple in the model of the temple of Mars old tour in Rome at name, uh, the result, the Meson cafe. Uh, so this, this is, I've made this point, uh, in other lectures about the fact that, uh, there are certain times when we can document not only the exchange of ideas but even architectural ideas, but even the exchange of architects and artisans going from one part of the Roman world to another in search of commissions.

Speaker 1:          00:29:04       And this is one of those times where we can document with certainty, uh, that artists working in the employ of the emperor himself. Augustus made their way to the south of France to create this amazing temple from scratch. Once again, temple very much in the model of the most famous temple of its day in Rome. And that is the temple of Mars old tour in the, in the forum of Augustus. One more detail. Here's the Marzel torque capital again, and overhear, uh, the, the capitals of the Meson cafe and I show you above the freeze, which extremely well preserved and you'll see this flowering, a canvas plant that should immediately remind you of contemporary decoration and Rome. Think of the flowering of campus plans of the aura, pockets out boost die. So once again, a proof that there is a very close connection to what's going on in Rome at this time.

Speaker 1:          00:30:00       And in the south of France. Here's another spectacular view of the uh, Meson cafe as it looks in its location today, uh, in the center of a plaza surrounded by the daily life of name. As you can see so well here, uh, it's still very much a part of daily life and very interesting is the fact that if you look across the street from the Meson Cafe, you see a building that was designed by the very famous and very talented British architect, Norman foster. Uh, it's also a museum and it's a play on the word on the name of the Meson Kallai. It's called the Cafe Dar. Uh, it's a museum that has modern art. Uh, and it, it mostly exhibits it's permanent collections, but you can see, and I'm going to show you a detail in a moment to bring this point home. You can see that Norman foster has really looked at and studied, uh, the Meson Kallai and has created a modern version, a very modern version of the Meson Kallai.

Speaker 1:          00:31:05       If you look at the Meson cafe and it's, uh, it's, it's deep porch and it's high podium and it's single staircases, facade orientation, all the usual Roman elements. And look at this building. You will see that he too has created a kind of portico, uh, in the front. Uh, they're not actual columns, uh, their, their peers, but peers and it's very slender and elegant peers. But peers nonetheless that are clearly being played off the columns of the Meson cafe. And look at the way in which he has done, uh, the, the, the, the glass exterior. He has divided it into a series of panels that are clearly, I believe reflecting, and I'm sure he knew he was doing this at the time, clearly reflecting the panels of the Ashleigh masonry of the walls of the actual Meson cafe. So this very interesting, we see not only dialogue happening, you know, within Roman buildings themselves and various parts in Rome itself and in various parts of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:32:05       But this ongoing dialogue between ancient monuments and modern buildings in cities like Rome, there are pockets in the Meyer building is one example, but also in some of these other cities like Neem in the south of France. And by the way, you can go up, there's a roof garden that you can go up to on the top of this kind of a Dar in order to see a spectacular view from above of the Meson cafe. Now, one of the, uh, one of the most important elements of Rome, the Roman Ization of the, uh, empire was the fact that as the Romans went in and built these new cities in east and also in west, they supplied it with amenities that weren't there before. And this was especially important in the western provinces where again, the civilization had not been all that high, uh, prior to this period.

Speaker 1:          00:32:58       So the Romans come in and they build aqua ducks with a vengeance in the western provinces in the south of France, in Spain, in order to provide these towns with a water supply. And I want to show you a couple of examples of our best preserved and most spectacular Roman aqueducts anywhere in, uh, what was the ancient Roman empire. I want to begin with perhaps the, with certainly the most famous of these, the so called [inaudible] also at Neem. Uh, and I show you first a map, which gives you a sense of what was going on here. Uh, the patron by the way of the [inaudible] at Neem was none other than Marcus Agrippa. Marcus Agrippa, whom we've talked about several times a semester. The close friend, confidant, a right hand man, son in law that hoped for air of Augustus who we saw was building buildings in Rome.

Speaker 1:          00:33:54       He built the bads that bear his name, the best of the gripper, a anti. You also built that first Pantheon, that first temple to all the gods were with its chorionic porch. We saw that he was active as a builder in Athens, uh, where he built the Odi on of a gripper and where he was honored with a statue on top of a pier on the Acropolis in Athens. He also was active in the south of France as a great builder. And it was here that he was responsible for commissioning an aqueduct that would bring water from 31 miles away up in the mountains, down to the city of name. And this map gives you a very good, a sense of exactly how that was done. The source was up there at the top, the top, uh, red, uh, pink circle up there, made its way all the way down to the city of Neem here.

Speaker 1:          00:34:48       Uh, now the Romans were very clever about how they built aqueducts. They let gravity and the change in terrain essentially do the work for them. They tend, they, they placed a terracotta pipes underground for the most part on sloping ground, uh, and allow the water to come from the hillsides and the mountains down into the city just as they did here on occasion, they allow those terracotta tile of those terracotta, uh, tubes to be, to be carried by low walls. But sometimes they got to a point where they had to cross a body of water. And that is exactly what happened here. The River Gar, uh, of the city of name of the area of Neem, uh, goes through, is located at this particular point. And so aqueduct system had to cross the river. How did they do that? They couldn't tunnel it underground, that couldn't place it on a low wall.

Speaker 1:          00:35:44       So what they did was built a bridge. They built a bridge to carry that water across the body of water. And the result of that is what you see here. This is the famous [inaudible] at [inaudible]. Uh, this is the bridge that serves to carry the water across. They place the terracotta pipes in the aqueduct itself. Uh, and that water is carried across that aqueduct. Now, what's particularly extraordinary about this monument, besides that feat of, of taking that, that, uh, water across the river, uh, is the fact that it is, well, if you look at the building technique, you can, you can tell that it is made of Ashleigh Masonry, Ashleigh Masonry, that is local stone in this particular case, as much as we have seen is the case for the most part in architecture in the south of France in the Roman period of, but what is amazing about this particular aqueduct, besides this great engineering feat, uh, is the fact that the architects have paid enormous attention to the exact measurements, not only of the arch itself, but of the occupations.

Speaker 1:          00:36:55       Uh, and they have, they have, they have PE, they have, uh, worked up all kinds of elaborate art. Uh, uh, mathematical theorems in order to get to the point where they play these shapes and the sizes of these shapes well off against one another. The larger occupations below are perfectly mathematically worked out so that they work well with the smaller ones up above. And we see in a building like this, I think something that is really impressive, not only a sign of Romantization, I mean this is when you talk about Roman imperialism and the Romans taking over the world in ancient Roman times. One could think about that in part in, in a negative way. I mean, imperialism and taking over and creating an empire, uh, can, can be viewed negatively. But one of the positive things that the Romans brought, one of the many positive things that the Romans brought to these underdeveloped parts of the world was what we call Romantization, bringing these amenities, bringing things like water to a city so that it could live at a higher level than it was able to live before.

Speaker 1:          00:38:01       But besides that, when you look at an aqueduct liked the poem, do Gar at name? I think you'll agree that although we would call this a feat of Roman engineering, first and foremost, the Romans have been adept enough both through paying attention to these mathematical considerations, but also to carving the stone to making the stone really work aesthetically that they have essentially in this aqueduct transformed, uh, engineering into architecture into what we would define as architecture. I want to show you two other aqua docs. Uh, the first two, both of them in Spain, uh, the first at, uh, uh, uh, Tarragona and the other one at Segovia. Uh, first, uh, a reminder of the fact that Spain is, you'll recall, was extremely important in the Roman period because two of Rome's emperors came from Spain, I think of Trajan who was born in Spain, born in Spain and also Hadrian whom we see here on the left, a map of Spain showing the locations of Etol Ilica where a Hadrian was born, but also the two sites that we're going to look at Tarragona Toronto, which was located very close to Barcelona.

Speaker 1:          00:39:19       You know, the sea as you can see here. And then further inland Segovia. So Govia which is near Madrid, uh, the city of Madrid, I'm so very accessible for any of you traveling Spain. Uh, these are sites that are extremely accessible and especially Segovia. Well worth looking at. Just want to show you the aqueduct. Did Tara go into briefly? Uh, you can see it here on the screen. Um, an aqueduct that dates to the Augustan period and uh, it is, uh, it's a handsome work of architecture. Uh, it has, um, Ashleigh blocks as you can see, local stone. Uh, but it doesn't have the finesse. I think you can see here now how great the polls do, Gar is because it doesn't, it's attractive. It does the job. It's a great engineering feat, but it doesn't have the aesthetic, the aesthetic values that DePaul do.

Speaker 1:          00:40:10       Gar Does, uh, with its, you know, arches that are the same size on the lower story. And then in the upper story, uh, at, it doesn't, it doesn't have the, um, the, the appeal aesthetically, visually that the Pont du Gard does, but it does its job. However, uh, the art, the aqueduct at Segovia is quite another story. The aqueduct at Segovia is right up there with the palm to Gar at name as one of the great works of Roman engineering and of Roman architecture. And what makes it all the more spectacular is how much of it is preserved. And I think you can see that extremely well here in this amazing view of the aqueduct marching, you know, making its way across the center of the city of modern, uh, Segovia and this truly spectacular image. As you can see from your monument lists, the date of the aqueduct of Segovia is very controversial.

Speaker 1:          00:41:08       There are some people who think it's first century, there's some people who think it's second century. I think it is most likely, uh, to be, uh, second century and probably put up during the time of Trajan the emperor Trajan. But we're not sure about that whenever it was put up. It is an incredible example of aqueduct, uh, engineering and aqueduct architecture. And it does allow us to see a couple of things that we, it's very distinctive in its own right. It's beautiful, but beautiful in a very different way as we'll see from the Pont du Gard. Uh, but it does allow us to look at a couple of other features of Roman aqueduct planning and design that I think are worth talking about. I show you here another view of the aqueduct at Segovia. Uh, and uh, your see you see here that it is for the most part a two tiered aqueduct system, uh, but what they've done here to vary it and to make it much more interesting aesthetically then the aqueduct in Tarragona is to make those two stories different in height.

Speaker 1:          00:42:13       So the lower story is much higher as you can see, a with much more attenuated arches. Uh, and then the upper tier is lower, uh, with, um, with, with, with much smaller arches. The other thing that they've done using local stone, uh, they have left the stone in a somewhat rougher state. It isn't quite as rough perhaps as Claudius is buildings, but left in a fairly rough state, which gives it a real sense as you look at it, of the texture of that stone stone, of the materiality of that stone in a way that makes this particular building extremely attractive and impressive. And you can see here this, this view was also very helpful because you can see people standing below, which gives, it gives you some sense of the very large scale, uh, of this particular aqueduct. Here's another view. This is one of my favorite views of the aqueduct at Segovia.

Speaker 1:          00:43:09       Uh, because I think here you can really get a sense of the coloration of the stone, of the texture of this slightly rough stone and of the way, even in the architecture of aqueducts, again, mainly an aqueduct is built mainly for practical purpose to bring water from one part of, of, of, uh, one place to another place. Uh, and to provide an amenity as we've talked about it at a significant and important day to day amenity. Uh, but even with that, even with, even though it essentially a practical building, aesthetics are never far from the Romans minds. And when this particular aqueduct is, was designed, not only did the designer have in mind the texture of the stone and the way in which the light of Spain, this particular part of Spain hits that stone at any given time of day. But the whole concept of Vistagen when you, when you wander along this particular aqueduct is it goes on for quite a while.

Speaker 1:          00:44:05       Uh, you can do that and you're not on top of a body of water as well. So you can walk along it down below and see what you see as you, as you meander through it. And it is amazing aesthetically, again, how they have set up a series of views and vistas from one part of this aqueduct to another. As you stand here and, and you look at it, look at it making its way, almost marching. It's way, in fact, I, I like to think it's Trey Janick because it's almost like Trojans army marching through the city of Segovia off too. You know, some military exploit in the far reaches, uh, because the way it marches through the city as you can see here. But all of these wonderful views and vistas in Panoramas, uh, that one can see depending upon where one stands in the city, where one stands beneath the arches themselves is really spectacular and clearly was very much in the minds of the architect who designed this.

Speaker 1:          00:44:59       Here's another very good view where if you stand below the aqueduct and look up, this is the sort of view that you see with the rough stones even in the Balts of the arches themselves. Uh, and, and incredible work. And again, the fact that it is well PR as well preserved as it is, is really, uh, something to be grateful for. Here's a very interesting view because it also shows you what happens with aqueduct design. Uh, when the terrain changes. So in the center of the city, then the views that we looked at just before they were able to build the ground level was low enough that they were able to build the aqueduct and two stories with that. Very high for a story. And then the lower second story. But what happens when the terrain shifts when you go? Because again, they're taking advantage of a source that is located higher up with the hope that gravity will do the work for them and allow that water to, uh, to flow from that source down into the city.

Speaker 1:          00:45:58       And that is exactly what they did here. The source is farther away and it's high. So the, so the water has to be piped into this structure and make its way down from the hillside to the city. So you see the ground, uh, rising here to go up that hill. Uh, and what happens is that they have to adjust the aqueduct according to the changing terrain. So if you look at this particular section, you will see that the bottom story is just an arch. There, arch rests on the ground, uh, so that they, because it has to be much shorter at this juncture than anywhere else. And you see the same eye. Well, you see it changing somewhat here as it makes its way, but you see it rounding the corner and the way they have had to make these adjustments and made them so well and without losing the, the, uh, the, the impressive aesthetic quality of this particular structure.

Speaker 1:          00:46:53       Once again, a tribute to the fact that these Roman architects, we're not only great engineers, but also without any question, uh, world class architects. There's an interesting monument that is located. You can see the aqueduct of Segovia in the back left there. There's an interesting monument that was put up to celebrate the by millennium of the aqueduct in Segovia. And it's interesting to see what, what they put at the top, the, she will suckling Romulus and Remus to underscore the close connections between, um, uh, ancient Romans Segovia and a wrong, another very interesting building in, uh, France is the one that I show you now, uh, which was a fountain, a these aqueducts, you know, these aqueducts brought not only water for daily use, but fed fountains. And I want to show you one fountain, uh, from the, uh, from, uh, Roman gall from France. What is France today?

Speaker 1:          00:47:56       Uh, the so called Temple of Diana wasn't a temple. It was a founder. And as I mentioned that it was built during the Hadrian manic period between 100 and 130 what makes this fountain particularly interesting is if we just looked at this, if I asked you if I put this up and send you, what do you think this was? A, you would be unlikely to say a fountain because you can see that this structure is in the form of a basilica. It's a barrel vault and central chamber with side aisles that are also barrel vaulted. You can see the barrel vault of this side aisle over here. You can see a barrel vault of the central space here. You can see that there are columns on told basis. You can make out over here that a triangular pediment on top of a niche. There were a series of niches along the wall with alternating triangular and segmental pediments.

Speaker 1:          00:48:44       But most interesting of all is the central, uh, central space, the central barrel vaulted space with these barrel vaulted side Oz, which is exactly the scheme of a typical basilica. Uh, and it, it's another example of something I've shown you throughout the semester that I've called the interchangeability of form. The way in which certain building types, in this case a basilica built initially as a civic structure for the trying of law cases, uh, becomes a, a plan that is used in other contexts, whether it's in residential architecture as we've already seen a and in this case in, in the form of a fountain. So that's particularly interesting. Also interesting is the fact that although this is a barrel vaulted structure, it is made entirely out of local stone. No concrete whatsoever in this particular part of France, no concrete stone construction. It's a masterwork when you consider that this was all done out of stone and done extremely well.

Speaker 1:          00:49:43       Look how smooth, uh, the stones are. And look, the architect, the designers have even been a talented enough to create ribs with stone in that stone barrel vault for this amazing structure. And you should be reminded when I talk about the interchangeability of form, uh, of the underground basilica that we looked at way back when and the time of Claudius, which was built underground, made out of concrete, uh, faced with Stucco as you'll recall, but used for a secret sect. Uh, and in this case, the use of this Basilican structure for a fountain in Roman France. Up to this point, we have looked at monuments that were made possible by Rome's subjugation of this particular part of the world. Uh, the subjugation we know of at least a 44 Alpine tribes. Uh, and so while all of these buildings that I've shown you come because of that subjugation and subsequent Roman [inaudible] of the area, there is one monument spectacularly cited that actually celebrates honors, that very subjugation.

Speaker 1:          00:50:50       And it's to that, that I now want to turn, uh, it is, as I mentioned, spectacular spectacularly cited along the French Riviera, not far from niece, not far from Monte Carlo. Uh, you see it here. It is the a trophy of Augustus. The trope, pay him. I'll gousty is, you'll see on your monument list that is located in a, in a town called lock tour B. And you can see it rising up in the midst of modern law tour. Be here. It dates we believe to seven to eight, two, seven, two, six B, c a and thus in the age of Augustus and celebrates quite specifically Augustus. And the inscription tells us this Augustus is subjugation of 44 Alpine tribes. Uh, in this particular part of the world, a monument put up to honor that victory of Augustus. So essentially a trophy monument. You can see that it is only partially preserved.

Speaker 1:          00:51:47       Uh, and I show you here a view of, uh, it down the street of the, the modern street as it looks today, uh, where you can see it rising up over that street. And if you look very carefully, you will see that the stone that the structure is made out of, it's very similar, in fact, exactly the same as the stone used for the local houses. Now, this is very interesting because what the monument, uh, did not look, even though it's only partially preserve today, even less of it was preserved, uh, earlier on. And it was in the 1930s that an American, a patron decided that he wanted to reconstruct the as best that could be done, the trophy monument at La Torre B because there was recognition that the monument at La Torre be, had served as a quarry essentially for the local inhabitants. And the over the years they had been taking the stone from the victory monument of Augustus and using it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:49       That's why it's the same stone using it in their houses. Uh, and this American wanted to rectify it. So he gay, he, he, he donated the funds, uh, that enabled them to take, to tear down, to demolish 32 houses, uh, and come up with 3000 fragments from the Victory Monument, the trophy at lock to our B, and reconstruct it as best as they could from those fragments. And that's what you see there. Now, here's a view of it as it looks today, uh, as well as a model. And what you can see from both of these is not only the inscription and the trophy in relief on this side that mentions the 44 Alpine tribes, but the monument itself and this model makes it very clear what the general form was, a round structure with columns and circling it on a base. And then the whole thing placed on a very large and tall pedestal with a pyramidal element at the top and a crowning statue at the very apex.

Speaker 1:          00:53:47       This scheme of placing a rotunda on top of a tall base is something that we have seen as characteristic of funerary architecture from the age of Augustus. Think of the Tomb of Cecilia Patella for example. Uh, and it is that scheme that is used here. So another example of this interchangeability of form that a form that was used for a mausoleum architecture now used a for a trophy monument of the same time, uh, but in a different part of the world. The model also shows you that there were niches around the, uh, central, uh, circular structure. Uh, those were, those had in them portraits of Augustus, his lieutenants who have, who helped him, uh, placate this particular part of the world. And then at the top of the step pyramidal structure, a portrait, a bronze statue of the emperor Augustus himself. Here's a detail of a law of law.

Speaker 1:          00:54:48       The victory monument at La Torre be with all of those stones, uh, from the, from those 32 demolished houses. Reused here to reconstruct it. We do, there is concrete used here, but it's a Gallo Roman form of concrete. You'll see in ward Perkins that he refers to this work as putty at the high p e t I t a p p a r e I l putty at Belle vie, which is a essentially a gala Roman version of concrete construction with, with a stone facing that little little work, you know, little pieces of stone that are very similar to opus and cared them but different enough, uh, and, and distinctively French, enough to be called the putty at Belle vie the victories. Augustus is victories and pacification of this part of the world also led to the construction of arches. And I want to turn to a couple of those now.

Speaker 1:          00:55:44       Uh, the arch at Sephora, me also in the south of France, you see it here. Uh, it dates to around 20 BC. Uh, and it probably served as both an arch in honor of these victories that Augustus celebrated here, but also as a gateway into the city. It's very simple. It looks very much like we've come to know Augustan arches are with a single RQ weighted bay in the center, uh, columns in this case on two separate bases, fluted columns there. The capitals are not preserved so that we don't know if they were Corinthian, but they were probably Corinthian, a very elaborate Archibold as you can see here with the coffee [inaudible] extremely preserved. And then if you look very closely at the decoration, you see a couple of figures standing on either side. These are actually, they're headless now, but they're actually figures of captives, of captives, of local captives.

Speaker 1:          00:56:35       To make reference again to the fact that this was military, a military operation, uh, that allowed Augustus to take over these to subjugate these 44 Alpine tribes. Uh, and, and others in this particular area, uh, and that, that subjugation is referred to here, uh, by the representation of those captured barbarians. A much more important and more interesting arch is this one a, it's an arch that is located in um, oh longish back to a home also in the south of France. The date of this monument is very controversial and I think by looking at the general view and also a detail, you can see why it is a triple bade arch with a large central arch, two smaller ones on either side with columns on tall basis, Corinthian columns in between them. You can see that the central element with its pediment projects into the viewer space.

Speaker 1:          00:57:30       You can also see that the, uh, every inch of space is completely covered with decoration, figural decoration, piles of arms and armor from the enemy. Uh, so much show that it tends to dematerialize the arch. These are all characteristics of later Roman architecture. Think the arches Septum you severity, which I'll show you again in a moment, which has led some scholars to date this as late as a d 200 or 82 oh three, two oh four at the same time as the arch of Septimius severities. And it was long thought to be that also because no one could conceive that this idea of the triple bait arch could turn up in let's say Augustan or Tiberian, uh, France goal, uh, at before it turned up in Rome. So getting back to that issue of race on several occasions about center and periphery, does everything flow from the center or are sometimes or forms, sometimes developed in the periphery and then make their way back into the center is a, an age old and very interesting question to ask.

Speaker 1:          00:58:32       But I think you can see the reasons why a scholars, some scholars have dated this to the seven period. Uh, here's the view and I'll say more about that in a moment. Have you here with a another view showing an engraving, giving you a sense of the kind of sculptural decoration that would have been, uh, placed at the top, the omnipresent, a figure in a chariot, a four horse or warm in this case, four horse, I think in this case, chariot. Uh, and then, uh, figures of captured, captured Indivi captured barbarians, uh, as well as trophies on the apex. Here's our comparison with the arch of CEP. Timmy is severities and the Roman forum. And I think you can see the close, the close association between the two, the triple bay, the profusion of Decoration, uh, that we see in the arch on the lefthand side as well.

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       Here's a detail of the attic, uh, which shows you an interesting battle scene where the figures are very heavily outlined as you can see here, which is unusual. Uh, scholars have suggested, and I think correctly, that the reason for that is that these, these artists and this part of a goal, we're probably working from copy books or his copy scrolls, I guess I should say, a drawings, drawings, uh, of battle scenes, typical Greco Roman battle scenes, uh, that they could use Hellenistic battle scenes, perhaps early Roman battle scenes that Wa that they copied and they, these were drawings and consequently they copied them quite, quite, quite exactly. Uh, by showing the outlines, uh, around the figures. It's one, it's a speculation, but I think it's interesting speculation in this very frenzied battle scene from the upper most part with regard to the date of this monument, though the plot thickens, uh, one other detail.

Speaker 1:          01:00:21       If you look at the side of the art, you see a, an RQ weighted element inside. You can barely see the triangular pediment, but there's an occupation inside a, an unbroken, a complete triangular pediment. So that scheme of placing the occupation and also tends to be a late feature. However, scholars who have spent a lot of time looking at the sculptural decoration of this monument, of the piles of arms and armor, uh, that when finds there, uh, which by the way includes piles of arms and armor from a naval victory, which is interesting as well as piles of armor arms and armor from victories on land, which has made some scholars speculate that this refers to a kind of generic victory to victory on land and sea, uh, by whoever this honored but very interesting is the fact that there is a, a, a, um, some, some, uh, there is one armament, uh, that is inscribed with the name sock grow.

Speaker 1:          01:01:18       We're sac R o. V. I R. SOC grow. We're a soccer. We are, we know was someone who is living and active, uh, in the time of Tiberius. He led a revolt in this part of a gall in Aidy 21 against the local Roman governor and his excessive taxes. Uh, and uh, it has been speculated that that Sacro we're who is mentioned here is that very same soccer. We're, uh, and that it is very conceivable conceivable, therefore, that this arch was put up in the time of tybee areas. I've given you a date of Aidy 25. I believe that myself, although it does defy, you know, define imagination to a certain extent to think of an arch with all of these features that I've described today as early in the south of France as a d 25. But it's something for you to think about in terms of our whole question of the relationship between a periphery and, um, center and periphery.

Speaker 1:          01:02:17       I want to show you the last group relatively quickly. Uh, just to dip into a Istria is I said I would to the upper most part of, uh, of what is today Croatia to look at one more arch, uh, in a different part of the Roman world. But during the same period, the end of the first century BC and arch at Polo, I show you the location here of a polo or pula at the very upper, most part of Croatia. Very close. Exactly at the Emmy's. Just when I went there. Once you're literally, you go all across the border and there you are, uh, the Italian border, you're in Pola and you see the rest of Croatia here with the other great, uh, site of Split, which we'll look at next time. Uh, and of course the famous city of Dubrovnik at the base, you see the arch extremely well preserved.

Speaker 1:          01:03:07       Uh, another typical Augustan arch, single Bayed, uh, two columns, Corinthian order on a shared base. Uh, if you look at the attic, the attic is interesting. Local stone. Once again, look at the attic, you'll see bases that are inscribed at the top. And those bases are very helpful in terms of telling us something quite extraordinary. And that is that this arch was put up by a woman we know her name. Salave'A Postuma, Salvia Postuma, s a l V. I, a p. O. S t, u, m, a Salvia Postuma who put this monument up to three male members of her family who were involved in military operations at this particular time, uh, died. Uh, and then we're honored by this monument. I show you a reconstruction of what the upper most part probably looked like when there were statues of those three male members of the family, possibly in their military costumes.

Speaker 1:          01:04:01       Although we don't know for sure at the apex of the structure. Here's a detail of it. Also over here where you see victories in the spandrels, you see the Corinthian capitals, you see cupid's carrying garlands, all the kinds of decoration you see some a Qantas leaves very much like those in the our pockets, all the kinds of decoration that have been transported from Rome to be used, uh, in, uh, in this case in the north of former Yugoslavia. Uh, for this arch we see the Corinthian capitals. Here we see the victories. Here we see the cupids with the garlands over there, we see a chariot scene here. Cherry had seen as interesting reference to the race of life. Uh, it referenced a victory and Athletic Competition as well as victory, uh, over, oh, you see the Ukrainian, they are also clearly another touch of, uh, roam of the RF pockets.

Speaker 1:          01:04:55       But this, this interesting, we've seen this throughout the semester. The close correlation in the minds of the Romans between victory in battle, victory in athletic competition, uh, victory in the hunt, uh, and also victory over death. And all of that comes together well in the our cheer. If you look up into the vault, it's very well preserved. And the center, uh, a, a representation of an eagle with a serpent holding a serpent, a, this is probably a reference to death and rebirth. And remember this is Augustan and date, so it predates the vault of the arch of Titus in Rome. But this whole idea of placing the vault, a scene of death and rebirth leads, ultimately I think to that divinization scene of Titus, I want to take you very quickly, uh, to show you a, an important tower tomb in the city of San High.

Speaker 1:          01:05:48       Me. We're back in the south of France. Samurai me, the ancient glom them g, L A,N , u m ancient Glonass, which was a very highly developed town, uh, also in the Greek period. So here we see some overlay. We have local, local, local, Celtic, custom, uh, the Greeks were, were infiltrated here. Then the Romans, all of that piled one on top of another to make a very distinctive city. You can also see from the remains that were extensive remains at them more than most of these ancient, uh, French towns where you can see Babs and temples and at parts of houses and Paris styles and so on, quite well preserved. I show you here for example, some honorific basis as an altars and overhear a hypo cost from one of the baths, uh, looking very much like a hyper cost we would see in Pompei of like date.

Speaker 1:          01:06:40       I also want to mention in case any of you are making your way to the south of France anytime soon. It is located in the city of Glonass, located very close to the wonderful town of Lebo. In fact, blonde is in the shadow of Lebo that lies in the mountains on the top, fabulous place to just wanted nothing to do with Roman antiquity, but just a great place to wander. As you can see here in every one of the caves. And there are a lot of them have a places for wine tasting. So it's a fun place to go. Here are the two monuments we saw the arch already. This is the tower tomb. These are referred to by the locals as liaison, teak liaison teak, the arch, the antiquities, the arch, and the tower tomb. And the fact that they are in close proximity.

Speaker 1:          01:07:20       I mentioned the arch may have well been a city gate. The Romans always buried their dead outside the city gate, city gate cemetery, right outside extremely WellPreserved tower tomb tower to him because it's taller than it is wide. This area of of France is particularly famous because of Vincent Van Gogh. Once again, then go spend his last years in an insane asylum. As many of you may know in satisfy me, this insane asylum, which you can see, this is a van Gogh painting of that asylum in which he spent those last days is located exactly across the street from liaison teak. So if you make the pilgrimage, they are, I hope you'll make the pilgrimage not only to see van Gogh, but I hope that your aficionados, and now I'm in fact, I hope that you go to see liaison teak and then also go to see, uh, the asylum of Van Gogh.

Speaker 1:          01:08:09       Here's the monument of the Giulia Julie attack a tower tomb that was put up in a Samurai meet in 30 to 20 BC. Uh, so, uh, a sort of the cusp, the, this late says area and into the Augustine period and we think the Julie represented here are in fact veterans of Julius Caesar's Army who have taken his name, Julius Caesar. All of his battle, you know, is, is great. Uh, military exploits in goal, uh, referred to here by his veterans, uh, who, uh, have taken his name and have settled here on land that they were given in a, in reward for their good work. Again, it's a tower tomb, a taller than it is wide. A stepped base, a Sokal with sculptural figural freeze a quadra fronds up here, Corinthian columns, and then at the very apex [inaudible] loss, uh, that has a two statues inside that Bolus.

Speaker 1:          01:09:05       This is pretty much the best preserved Rome and tomb that we have. Everything is intact here. We believe, remember I mentioned way at the beginning that we think that a lot of these Roman ideas came, uh, to the south of France via north Italy and we think this was indeed the case. North Italy in north Italy. We know they put up a lot of these tower tombs and we think it's likely that this sort of thing imitates some of those tower tombs in the north of Italy. I show you a detail of two of the figural freezes from the Sokal of the monument, which you can see represent battle scenes and you can also see those deep outlines just as we saw at the orange arch, which once again suggest to us that these artists are looking at drawings of this kind of thing that come from the Greco Roman world and they are copying what they see.

Speaker 1:          01:09:53       I don't have time to go into it here. But if you look with care at some of these, when you're studying this monument, you will see the, you will see that there are some figures, well, for the most part, it makes sense. There are some figures in this crowded seen, uh, that don't work. For example, here's a figure, uh, on the ground with his shield above his head, trying to protect himself obviously from a combatant, but there is no combatant there. And that seems to underscore again that they are using copybooks books, that they're looking at these things that they're copying what they like. They're copying the scene for the most part, throwing in some other figures that they like that don't sometimes don't even make any sense. The detail up here of the thaw loss with the two statues. I spent about six weeks at this monument at one point, uh, and in that area at south by me and a little, um, little place near, near, near the liaison teak.

Speaker 1:          01:10:44       And I remember when I was there that there was this wonderful, um, uh, headline in the local newspaper that said it was a huge storm with lightening and so on. And the next morning there was a headline that said, has Gaius lost his head, uh, because the locals want to believe that this is a monument, not have local army veterans, but of the Augusta and family. And that the two figures that the upper most part were Gaius and Lucia sees, well, they were not Gaius and Lucius Caesar, uh, they were local veterans, but, uh, nonetheless less the myth has continued on. And I want to show you lastly for just a minute or so that remains to try to underscore that point that the north of Italy may have been a source for this kind of tower two that we see at sal by me, uh, just by showing you one example, it's by no means exactly the same, but it's the best that I can do, uh, because most of these tower tombs no longer survive.

Speaker 1:          01:11:38       But it is a thorough loss tomb, uh, from, uh, Aquileia and the north of Italy. The dates to the early Augustan period. Uh, and you can see that it has a large base with a figural sculptural decoration here. This isles of the blessed kind of imagery with a full loss at the top, uh, that includes a statue and then a pyramidal roof, uh, with a decorative element at the upper most part. Uh, and then as you can see, some lions statues, uh, out in front to guard. That too, it's not by no means the same thing as what I've shown you, but it gives you is an idea that these kinds of throw loss tombs on decorated basis, uh, were popular in the north of Italy. And the idea may have made its way to the south of France via these north Italian examples. And lastly, uh, just one last monument because we've tended to be looking at tombs in isolation, individual tumors rather than tune complex complexes because it's the individual tombs and not the complexes themselves that are well preserved.

Speaker 1:          01:12:43       But I want to show you one excellent example from the north of Italy. Again from this wonderful town called upper layer and early Augustan, uh, set of, of alter tombs that are still preserved in the actual original burial plots, which gives you a very good idea of what one of these plots would have looked like. These are of course not monumental tombs, but small, uh, two markers in the shapes of altars. Uh, and then other smaller, uh, smaller items as you can see very well here, but it shows you the way in which the Romans had the justice one has today a these burial plots for the family, these family burial plots that have individual markers of different family members in them and then has a kind of a stone fence that in circles and protects their plot. And you can see that stone fence down here, a stone fence that should immediately remind you of some of the stone fences that we saw in second style Roman wall painting, for example, that were omnipresent and second style Roman wall painting. And the last point I'll make today is just to underscore once again, I think there were lots of examples of it today, the [inaudible], for example, to throw loss, uh, and these fences as well as the theatrical architecture. We saw it all wrong. That underscore, once again, the closest association between architecture and painting, uh, from the republic, uh, all the way up to the Augustan age and still beyond. Thank you all.
