Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Good morning. All the title of today's lecture is the Roman way of life and death at Ostia, the port of Rome. On Tuesday, we spoke about architecture under the emperor Hadrian, the extraordinary Emperor Hadrian. Uh, we talked about the buildings that he commissioned and some of which he also had a hand in designing since, as we mentioned, he was an amateur architect himself. Uh, we spoke about that Greek import, the temple of Venus in Roma, and also about the two major commissions during his principles, the Pantheon in Rome and Hadrian's villa at Tivoli, the main takeaway point, visa vi both of these buildings and you see them once again now on the screen at left and right, uh, is that Hadrian followed the lead of Trajan before him. Uh, what Trajan had done and Apollo Doris of Damascus had done in the forum of Trajan and in the markets of Trajan.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       And that is to combine in one building complex, uh, both the traditional and the innovative strands of Roman architecture. Uh, the traditional that goes back to Greek and a trust can architecture and is marked by the traditional elements that traditional vocabulary of architecture, namely columns and walls and the roofs that they support. And then more innovative Roman architecture, which is predicated on concrete construction, uh, faced with a variety of materials from stone to what we'll see today is the ascendance of brick, uh, as a facing, which began, as you'll recall after the fire in [inaudible] 64 in Rome. Again, looking at these two buildings as examples of what Hadrian, uh, he and his architects, uh, tried to do, uh, the Pantheon you'll recall on the left has a traditional porch, the porch that looks very much like a typical Greek trust skin or Roman temple, but then at a revolutionary body when you walk inside the building, a revolutionary, a cylindrical drum and hemispherical dome.

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       And then with regard to the, uh, Hadrian's villa at Tivoli, I show you a view of the Chronopolis and you'll recall that the CANopen makes use of columnar architecture. There are columns that border, uh, one end of the pool, although they are columns with a twist because you can see they support a straight and an RQ weighted lintel, which we saw in second style Roman wall painting in painting. Uh, and then eventually it begins to infiltrate. Built architecture comes to the fore under Hadrian. So that's a playing around with those lintels in a way you wouldn't have seen in Greek and a trust can architecture, but still realize in the main on the traditional vocabulary of architecture. But then you'll recall on the other end of the pool, uh, a building that was meant to conjure up the, uh, the Sarah p m in the temple of is in, uh, CANopen in Egypt, but that was made out of concrete construction.

Speaker 1:          00:03:08       Uh, and that had a segment, a dome, a kind of Pumpkin dome that we believe that Hadrian designed himself. So this extraordinary combination of traditional and innovative Roman architecture that we see the hallmark of Hadrian Anik architecture, uh, and a gift that he gave to the future evolution of architecture. The other major contribution of the Hadrian panic period that Hadrian himself had less to do with because it was already bubbling up after the fire and had 64 a is this is the move that we're going to see today toward multistory housing. We saw that begin already at the last gasp of Pompeii and Herculaneum you'll remember after the earthquake of 62 and before the, uh, the eruption of Vesuvius, the Pompei ions and the those who lived in Herculaneum began to build to, began to add additional stories to their residential structures usually. And that meant for the most part, a second story being added to their residential structures, but they never went beyond that.

Speaker 1:          00:04:15       What we see beginning to happen, especially under Hadrian is the ae an increased tastes for multistory buildings, a multistory domiciles, but multistory residences, uh, that had more than two stories, even up to as many as five stories essentially apartment houses. And our best example for such apartment houses are in the city of Ostia, the port city of Rome. And it's therefore to the city of Australia that we are going to turn to today. And in fact, we will spend the entire lecture on the city of Ostia because like Pompei and Herculaneum before it, uh, especially like palm pay, uh, we have, uh, an extraordinary array of not only private domiciles but also public architecture from the city of Osteo that gives us an outstanding sense of what the city looked like in antiquity. I show you a plan of Ostia in its heyday. You'll remember that the city was actually founded very early on, uh, at the very beginning of the semester.

Speaker 1:          00:05:19       We looked at the town plan of Ostia, which data to the mid fourth century BC, around 350 BC. And you'll recall, and I'll remind you of this plan in a moment. Uh, you'll recall that it was founded as it was actually Rome's first colony. Uh, although it was a colony in Italy, obviously night, not outside the main land, but it's first colony in Italy or anywhere for that matter. Uh, and uh, it was founded as so many of these first colonies were as a military camp. It was laid out as a costume, as you'll recall. And that costs from a one can see in the very center. I'm going to show you a better view of this from Ward Perkins in a moment, uh, but you can see that that colonel, uh, of the, uh, the costume plan or right here in the center of this plan, but what this plan shows you is the way in which the city grew over time.

Speaker 1:          00:06:11       Again, it began in the republic. It continued to be developed during the republic. It was under Augustus that some new buildings, some public buildings were added to the locale, uh, including the theater. And we're going to look at the theater today. Uh, and then, uh, ports were added as you'll remember. And I'll review that momentarily. Ports were added at Portas, uh, by Claudius and also by Trajan. And, uh, it was after the port of Trajan that the city really began to take off in terms of its commercial activity and much of the building that we see in the city as well as it looks still today, a belongs to the Adriatic period and into the time of the successors of Hadrian, the so called and to nine emperors whom will also be, who's architecture will also be studying this semester a while this plan is on the screen.

Speaker 1:          00:07:04       Let me just point out the location of Rome. The Arrow points this way. The so called via osteon say the root the street that leads from Rome to Ostia, the via osteon say, and actually the city road becomes the town, the, uh, the, uh, country road. The country thoroughfare becomes the city street, the main city street, the a deck humanness of the city of Ostia. Uh, you can also see in this, in this plan, uh, the location of a place called Easel, a Socra up there, which we will see was the main cemetery for Osteo. Yes, there are tombs outside the city walls, uh, also elsewhere in the city. But our most best preserve tombs are from this area called Easel a Sabra. And I'll show that to you also today. And here you can see the Tiber river, the Tevere of the Tiber River wending its way from Rome to osteon.

Speaker 1:          00:08:01       It is of course along the Tiber that we'll see warehouses were located and where the ships I went back and forth to export or import material pro products from Rome to Ostia. And back again. We talked about again, we talked about the building of ports at Ostia. We talked especially about the port, the Claudius commissioned at Portas. Uh, and I remind you of it on the back of a neurone, one coin, a coin of Nero adverse with neuros portrait, reverse representing that Claudia and port. And we see it there. You'll remember it had curved break waters, which you can see in that coin depiction, uh, and uh, a river God at the bottom, boats in the center as well as the lighthouse. We see all of that on the coin. And you'll remember that the breakwaters we're made up of columns that partook of that rustication masonry, that Claudius so favored down here.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       I painting that I've shown you before, that now is on, that is on the walls of the Vatican in Rome, the Vatican museums in Rome where you can see Claudia says port this cr, it's curved breakwaters and it's light house over here. Uh, and then the port that was added by Trajan during his reign, a multi-sided, uh, additional port right here. And it was again, the construction of that particular port. Uh, that really brought commerce even more. I mean, it had been used, this area had been used since the mid fourth century BC, but it begins to really take off. There's a real efflorescence during this period. And, uh, it is therefore not surprising that with commerce booming, there was more need for residential, residential architecture for those who live there, for the traders and so on and so forth who lived there. Uh, and we see this, um, this, uh, the building of not only civic buildings but especially of private domiciles begins to move very rapidly.

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       A pace of the city becomes more crowded and there becomes this need to build up vertically as well as horizontally. And we'll see that development today, uh, tourists who go to Rome really missed the boat by not going out to Ostia in more, in larger numbers because at most tourists don't tend to take the trip out to Ostia, but it's well worth it and it's very easy to get to. It only takes about 25 minutes to a half an hour on a suburban train to get from Rome to Ostia. So, uh, it's, it's a not to be missed, uh, experience. And I show you one of these trains in the upper left that takes you very easily, uh, from Rome to the site of Ostia. Uh, there are a number of stations in Ostia. One of them is Ostia change row, the downtown of Ostia, which you see in that view in the upper left.

Speaker 1:          00:10:44       And the other is Lido di Ostia, which means the beach. And I show you a view of Lido di Ostia down here. Now looking at that nice view of the ocean. I know we've all been, you're back from spring break, but still it's, it's, it's nice to reminisce about what some of you may have been doing during spring break and see this wonderful view of the scene and it looks very enticing. But I can tell you that it's not, once you get there, I mean, it's very polluted. This is not one of the great beaches of the world. Uh, so don't be, don't be seduced by Lido di Di Ostia. Stay on the train and make your way to the site called Scobie Diasio Ostia, which is the excavations of Osteo, the archeological excavations where you can see as you saw as one season Pompei and ancient Roman city, extremely well preserved. Uh, and you see, uh, a, a glimpse of it over here.

Speaker 1:          00:11:34       And you can tell even just from this glimpse a, that we are dealing here with a city that is not unlike Pompei. It has streets and sidewalks and it has buildings along the side of either of those. But there is one main difference between this and what we saw at palm pay. And you can see it very well in this image and that is that these build, these, these houses are that are along the street look different than those did in palm pay in that they are made out of concrete, faced with brick, a very different kind of appearance, uh, and one that is quintessentially Osteon, uh, and makes this city well worthwhile, well worth a visit. In fact, if we think of palm pay as the quintessential first century a d Roman city, we should think of the city of Ostia as the quintessential second century A.

Speaker 1:          00:12:24       Dot. D City. The best example that we have of what a second century a Hadria Anik and [inaudible] city would have looked like. And that is what makes it so important to us here. I remind you again of the original plan that we looked at the plan from the mid fourth century BC, 350 BC from Ward Perkins. That shows you the original costume of the first colony, uh, this rectangular space, very regular with its own wall. Uh, surrounding the city with the Carto, these north South Street and the deck, your Montas, the east West Street intersecting exactly at the center of that city. And then at that intersection, as was Roman practice, the placement of the forum of the city, a great open rectangular space with the temple pushed up against the back wall in this case at Temple of Jupiter, a capital Eum, uh, dominating the space in front of it. And then other buildings around it.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       As you can see, although there's a striking difference between this forum and the forum that we saw at palm pay, because you'll remember at palm pay, the various major buildings, the basilica, the temple of Apollo, and so on, uh, uh, sort of radiating out from the central core of the forum. We don't see that here. We see the buildings, uh, sort of placed separately from that main forum space, but in every other respect, very similar to the general plan of these early Roman cities. What's also useful about this particular plan is the fact that it shows you the way, though, as time went by and as the city grew, it shows you the way in which the carto and the deck your Montas were extended. And then the other buildings of the city were added a here and there, a number of baths, lots of private residences.

Speaker 1:          00:14:16       This is a particularly important building here at 15 and 16, which we'll look at today. The 15 is the theater and 16 is the so called a Piatsa of the corporations, the pee out solid daily corporates Yoni, uh, which is very significant and we'll look at that soon. If you go and visit the city of Ostia today, uh, and enter at the ticket booth. Uh, what you see almost immediately is again, a polygonal, uh, masonry, uh, street looking very much like pom pay. But once again, there are no stepping stones in Ostia unlike Pompei, which is which a, the plot thickens there in terms of why we see those in Pompei and don't seem to see them anywhere else. You walk along that polygonal Masonry Street pavement, uh, and you see both the remains up here in the upper left of the original Republican city wall.

Speaker 1:          00:15:14       And it should bring back memories of opus contract them or Ashleigh masonry that we saw at the beginning of the semester. You can see it's consistent with the age in which it was built in the republic. Uh, but then over here, as you make your way along, one of them, one of the main streets, uh, you see what is characteristic of Ostia as a whole. And that is concrete construction, brick face, concrete construction, both for the residences and also for the public buildings and also for the religious structures, namely the temples, uh, in this city. The reason for this, of course, it takes us back to the neurone and period, the fact, the great fire of 64 when it was realized, you'll remember the Sabura, uh, which was located back beyond the precinct walls of the forum of Augustus. The area where the working poor of Rome lived primarily in Rickety, uh, apartment houses that were made out of wood, multistory to houses.

Speaker 1:          00:16:09       Those were actually multistory, but they were always going up in flames. And there was a recognition after the great destruction of the fire of 64 that the Romans needed to fireproof their buildings. And so they big and they recognize the fact that brick is better at, at protecting the structure from fire than stone is a, and they stoned Ken burn. Uh, and they actually began to, as we know we talked about this before, they began to build their houses and many of their civic structures out of concrete faced, uh, with brick. Uh, and we see that development especially well here in Ostia and Osteo is extremely important for us also because many of many comparable buildings that were put up in the city of Rome itself no longer survive the same apartment houses that we're going to see it. Ostia did exist in Rome. We have some remains of them.

Speaker 1:          00:16:59       There's a very prominent one at the base of the Capitol on hill to the left of the hill as you, as you climb up that hill. But we have very little evidence for this in Rome. And so we have to rely on Ostia to give us the best picture of apartment building in Rome, in Roman architecture in the second century. A D here is a spectacular view of Ostia as it looks today from the air. And we are obviously looking down on the forum on the great open rectangular space as the forum with columns around it. We are looking also at the Capitol, Liam at the Temple of Jupiter, which is a very large structure. As you can see here. It made out of concrete, faced with brick. It is a typical Roman temple, unlike Hadrian's Temple of Venus in Roma, because we can see that it has a facade orientation. It has a single staircase, it has a deep porch, freestanding columns in that porch.

Speaker 1:          00:17:59       So a typical Roman, uh, structure, uh, and uh, and it's typical Roman temple. And then you can also see its vast scale. There are a couple of people standing here who look minuscule in relationship to this building. And, uh, only part of the building. In fact, full height of the building is not even preserved here. So it was even larger still than what you see. Uh, the reason for its size is two fold. One, because we have already seen that this, uh, this taste for larger and larger buildings has really taken off. Uh, we saw it in Hadrian's forum in Rome. We saw it in demolitions palace on the Palatine Hill. We saw it in Hadrian's villa at Tivoli and in the Pantheon, the largest span, the largest dome, uh, ever built. So this taste for four largeness, grandiosity and architecture has really taken off. So it's not surprising to see this capital IOM, which was built in the Adriatic periods, specifically one 20 a d also being large in scale, but there's a second and perhaps even more important reason.

Speaker 1:          00:19:01       And that is in a city in which all of the most of the houses are what are called Insoo lie, I n s u l a and the singular AIE in the plural into lie. A multistory apartment buildings often have as many as five stories. If you want your capital, Liam, to stand out in that city and be seen up above those apartment houses, you've got to build it very high. And that is undoubtedly the reason that they are one of the two reasons, the more important reason that they have built this temple so large and especially so tall so that you could see the temple of Jupiter from everywhere in the city of Ostia. Here's the view of the temple as it looks today in isolation, again, only part of its hype preserved but enough for us to get a very good sense of it's concrete construction brick facing here.

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       Uh, and as I've already described, the single staircase, the columns, uh, in the porch and so on. I mentioned already that it was under Augustus that uh, a theater and an entertainment district was added to the city of Ostia. And, uh, it, it, that building, you see the remains of it here a along one of the major streets of the city of Ostia. It was renovated in around 200 a d that is in the early part of the third century, a d. So considerably later it was expanded to be able to hold 200, 2,500 spectators at that particular point. And uh, much of the concrete and brick faced construction belongs to that renovation. One can't imagine a building quite like this in the age of Augustus. So what you're seeing here is PR primarily the restored, uh, view, the restored version of this building. But what you can see that does, uh, at least link it back to the Augusta and period is the fact that the design of the facade is very similar to the design of the theater of Marcellus in Rome with the art, with the arches and the, in this case pilasters between them.

Speaker 1:          00:21:11       That same general scheme that we saw for theater and for amphitheater architecture use tier. The main difference of course is the fact that we have concrete construction with brick facing, uh, rather than concrete construction with stone facing travertine. In the case of the theater of Marcellus, I haven't yet shown you a Roman latrine, but today is the day for the Roman latrine. Uh, we and, but you have to imagine of course, that in any major public building like a theater where you're going to have a lot of people, they are the same time. You have to provide a public latrine. And when I say a public latrine, I really mean a public lottery and there was no privacy as you can see in this latrine, a whatsoever. Uh, what it, what it is, what it is composed of as you can see is a bench that lines the walls with a series of holes in it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:05       And then just one single drain, uh, that in circles, uh, the building. So this gives you an idea of where you have to go. If you needed to go, uh, during intermission, if you were attending, uh, the theater at the theater in Ostia, one of the most important buildings at osteon is, is, uh, connected to this theater I'm showing you now the plan of the theater, which corresponds a two theaters that we've looked at throughout this semester of typical Roman plan. It has a semicircular orchestra. It has a stage building or scan I frons here. Uh, it has a semicircular Kavya the street, they seats, which are, um, which are, which are placed on top of, of course, in this case, a concrete foundation. Uh, this like other Roman Roman theaters is an urban phenomenon. There was no hill to build this on. So the Romans had to build the osteons, had to build their own hill out of concrete and then support the caveat on top of that.

Speaker 1:          00:23:11       But the coffee is made of stone seats. They used stone for the seats, as is traditional in Roman theater architecture. Uh, and then, uh, but we see that this theater is appended to a portico us. Now we've seen a porticas with these, uh, with these theaters before it was in fact characteristic of theater design. And if you think back to the theater in palm pay, for example, you'll remember that that port it goes, which had a little cool little shops all around it or small cubicles all around it, uh, was used as a place where you could go during intermission to relax, to walk around, to buy a playbill to pick up a souvenir tee shirt or what the equivalent was in those days, uh, a souvenir of your experience that evening at the theater. Um, and so we see that same general scheme here, this whole idea of this open rectangular space with some columns.

Speaker 1:          00:24:10       Uh, and then with these little cubicles all along. But in this case, uh, it was not meant to be a place for souvenirs or a place to store props, but instead what we see is something quite fascinating giving the, given the fact that the city of Osteo was primarily a commercial city, a place where, uh, items were, were exported and imported because it was a major port or harbor city. What this was used for instead, uh, at hence its name, the P. Dot. Salay daily corporates. Yoni is a series of businesses that were spent the import export business essentially a is what these spaces were used for. Uh, and I'll show you, we, there are actually, some of them are quite well preserved and I can show you indeed what they look like then in the center or something. We also don't see in the palm pay theater a small temple in the center, a temple that corresponds to a Roman temples that we've looked at thus far.

Speaker 1:          00:25:10       It's rectangular shape, uh, it's flat side and back walls. Uh, it's some columns in the deep porch, a single staircase facade emphasis as you can see here, relatively small and scale as these kinds of things go. And it has been speculated by the main excavator of this site that uh, it was used as a it, that it was dedicated to some God whose name we don't know. We don't know which God or goddess this was dedicated to. But the excavator has speculated that it was probably some God that had something to do with commerce. And the blessing of commerce and that probably some trade guild, one of the trade guilds that had its business is set up here, may have been the commissioners may have paid for indeed commission this particular temple. And I think that's uh, you know, as good a theory is any and may well be the case.

Speaker 1:          00:26:05       This is a view we're standing at the top of the caveat. Looking down over that coffee, we can see the COO nay or wedge shaped sections of, of seats. We can see the stone stone that has been used, uh, for those seats. We can see the semicircular orchestra, the scalloped, uh, the scallop face of the, uh, of the or of the stage. Uh, and then one can imagine the skein I frons with its forest of columns behind that part is not well preserved. Uh, and there also would have been, I'll show you a restored view it a little bit later where you'll see that there was a much higher wall in between this and the p. Dot. Salie that lay beyond the wall is no longer there. So we can see very well through these columns. The small temple that was debt put up by that trade guild to some God of commerce.

Speaker 1:          00:26:56       And then we can also see these cubicles all along the way that were used, uh, as these import and export, uh, Emporia. This is a view of the temple as it looks today. We can see that single staircase, fairly narrow staircase here, the facade orientation, a couple of the columns including a Corinthian column that are still preserved from that small structure. And then here are very useful view showing us again, uh, these, these interesting spaces, rectangular spaces along here, a fronted in each case by columns. We'll see that those columns are made out of cement, faced with bricks. So it's shades of the sanctuary of Hercules at Tivoli. We haven't seen this before. I've been since then and that was a very unusual use here. We're seeing something that actually becomes more common in the second century, uh, making concrete columns and then facing them with brick.

Speaker 1:          00:27:56       I'd like to show you a few views of these, uh, of these, uh, of these import export businesses is, I've called them, uh, one of them here. Uh, where we can see that the architecture itself, the walls and the columns are only partially preserved. Uh, you have to imagine that an antiquity, they went up higher than this. Uh, but what is well preserved are the mosaics on the floor, uh, of each of these are many of these spaces. And you can see they're all done in black and white mosaic. Just the two colors. You can see the interest that the osteons had, uh, in geometric shapes. Uh, they, uh, have inside these very abstract inside the shop here, these abstract patterns. Uh, although they, they've made an attempt to vary them. Uh, but then in the front, uh, something very interesting that we see throughout, uh, is the use of see imagery because again, they were in the import and export business.

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       They were busy, uh, you know, sending ships, uh, back and forth for Middle East to other parts of the Roman world by sea. Uh, and so it's almost all see imagery here. We see two Geraldo Dolphins. Dolphins are particularly popular in these scenes, uh, facing one another as a kind of advertisement or shops on a, for this particular enterprise. Here's another one, a where you can see I like this dolphin in particular, he's nicely preserved and he has a wonderful serpentine tail with a lot of flourish at the end here. As you can see, I, and then inside a an image of a boat, you can see it, it's partially preserved. What's wonderful about this example is it shows us that although these are fairly simple in design and are meant essentially as advertisements for the shop, the artist and the patron have taken real care to think about what you're going to see when you're standing where so that they have oriented these so that when you're facing the shop and deciding whether you're going to pick this one, there's 61 of these by the way, around the perimeter of the structure.

Speaker 1:          00:29:58       So you had a lot of choice in terms of which enterprise you were going to. Uh, you know, you were where you were going to go to if you wanted to ship something from Ostia somewhere else or receive a delivery, you had a lot of choices, although I don't doubt some of them specialize in different parts of the world, you know, and shipping to Egypt or shipping to Asia Minor. Uh, but you can see here the dolphin when you standing deciding whether you want to go in the dolphin, you face the dolphin. Once you're inside a and standing and talking to the owner. If you, if you turn around and look back or you're going to see the ship, the boat head on. So they've really, they've orchestrated this and such. They paid real attention. It's not done willy nilly. They paid attention to what you're going to see where, uh, when you are entering and inside of these spaces.

Speaker 1:          00:30:45       Here's another one. Not only dolphins, dolphins, dolphins, you know, more dolphins and more dolphins. Uh, but you also see in this case, a light house which could either be a representation of their local lighthouse or some light house, uh, somewhere else, uh, that this particular place ships too. And then the last one, which is the one on your monument list, uh, with two boats. Uh, so again, how does one ship things from a Ostia elsewhere by boat? And so they tend to represent boats. And you've see, you've kind of seen it all. Dolphins, boats and light houses tend to be, uh, the items that are chosen for these so called advertisements. But this one is very useful too because you can see the, uh, the shapes and the colors of the tests or I that are used here. And although these are very effective, you can see that this is not the Alexander mosaic a, these are not done with that kind of skill.

Speaker 1:          00:31:38       Uh, they, they use only black and white, the simplest possible scheme, no colors. Uh, and you don't get the sense as you do with something like the Alexander Mosaic. When you step back from it, it could almost be a painting. It's done that well with the cast shadows and the, and the crumpling figures. So well presented, uh, here at something quite different, more abstract. Uh, and the stones are not as fine. You can see they haven't paid as much attention to getting them perfectly shaped. Uh, but nonetheless it's very effective. Uh, and it really does. It does what it intended to do. One of the sad things, I mean, it's great to see and if you go out to osteon make a special point of seeing these and taking pictures because I've been looking at these for many years and uh, every time I'm there, it seems that there are fewer tests awry ride there then that these are the originals are there are fewer tests arrived than there were before.

Speaker 1:          00:32:27       I'm not saying that people take them, although I think people do take them. Uh, but, but just that over time by a, by tourists walking on them extensively, they get on, they got, they get loose and they get spread around the site and they haven't done as good a job as I think they should have at all as they should at osteon keeping these mosaics together. Here's a restored view of the whole complex where I think you can see that although the theater and the [inaudible] are connected to one another and are part of the same scheme and are a development, a further development and evolution, uh, that is particularly appropriate for this commercial city of Ostia that comes out of the orbit of that earlier, uh, uh, theater and porticas complex at Pompei, we can see that although they're part of that same complex, they are distinct from one another.

Speaker 1:          00:33:17       Uh, if you look at the theater and the copy up above with the original wall of the skein high frons preserve, we're looking at it from the back or you can see that that was very high. Uh, so only if you were way up at the top of the copy of what you really get a sense of what lay beyond on that once you got into the p. Dot. Saul, I over here with its temple, uh, and with its various shops. Uh, you were in another world, the commercial world also interesting is the fact that although they're open to the sky today in antiquity, there was a covered call, an aid as you can see here that would have covered, uh, those shops. Uh, and you would have had to go in between the columns and back along the passageway in order to check out what the options were.

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       The city of Ostia, uh, like all Roman cities that we've talked about, Rome, Pompeii, Herculaneum, so on all obviously had a, a selection of bath establishment. Osteo was no exception. There are a number of bows preserved from the Roman city of Osteo, uh, this being one of them, the so called bads of Neptune, the dates to 139, a d the boughs of Neptune, so called because of a spectacular mosaic black and white mosaic of Neptune on the, on the floor. I'll show it to you in a moment, but go into it in more detail a bit later in the lecture. If we look at the plan of the bads of Neptune in Australia. I wondered if any of you can tell me whether this is a plan that corresponds to the earlier bath buildings at palm pay, the Stop and Basil, the foreign bas, or conforms more closely to the imperial bath type that we saw in Rome from the time of Titus, let's say the boughs of Titus and Trajan. Any thoughts? Brooke's new grimaced but maybe I'll ask you, do you have a pick on you earlier, the earlier one? Absolutely. And why, why do you say that?

Speaker 2:          00:35:18       Because, um, the series of bathrooms are coming here.

Speaker 1:          00:35:26       Excellent. Excellent. That's exactly right. We see the Palestra on one side with the natal CTO or the PC. Now that was usually usually accompanied it over here. And then on other side, all aligned in a row. Uh, the typical bath, the bathing block, uh, including the Apo d Terry on the, uh, the caldarium, the tip of Dory, the tip of diarrhea in the call Dorian and the frigate Dari and mold of the frigging Dharm is not a round alcove structure at all. So in that sense, perhaps influenced by some of what came in between, uh, those early bands at palm pay and the imperial Baz in Rome. But [inaudible] and of course also a note here, the shops that line the front of it, which is also characteristic of this dobby and baths and the foreign bas at palm pay. Uh, so they could have chosen the other, but obviously felt that this was much more appropriate, uh, to this, uh, commercial town to use the smaller, more intimate bath type, uh, here.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       Uh, then the imperial bas that had been developed in Rome from, uh, the first century, a date on a just a glimpse of the black and white mosaic that gives this bath. It's name of the bads of Neptune. You see Neptune here. Uh, but you can also see the way in which every room in the bath, uh, which was made out of concrete, faced with brick. As you can also tell from this view, uh, every room was covered with these black and white mosaics. Ostia is the land of the black and white mosaic. A return to that in a moment. Perhaps most importantly, anything that I show you today are the apartment houses of osteopath. And it's to those that I'd like now to turn, uh, what you're looking at on the screen is a model of what one of these apartment houses would have looked like.

Speaker 1:          00:37:12       This one is the so called Insula, I, N S U l, a Ciraphorus, the insula of [inaudible]. Uh, and we're looking at it in a model that is in that Museum of casts that I've referred to a number of times this semester at a place at a part of Rome called Ar, e, u r, a that, uh, fashion, that area that was built up in the fascist period by miscellany in the 1930s. It's, it, this model is in that museum, uh, and it gives us as good an idea as anything I could show you of what one of these apartment houses looked like in its hay day in the time of Hadrian. The word Insula, I should mention, uh, it can be used in two ways. And insula either refers to an apartment, a multistory apartment house, or it refers to a block of houses. In a city like Ostia, it's used for whatever reason, it was used interchangeably to refer to either block or to an individual house.

Speaker 1:          00:38:11       Uh, so pay attention to that when you read about an insula or ensue lie. Again, this one dates to the second century had the, uh, the, uh, insula of Syrup is, and it, it basically was like a modern condominium and often more than one of these Insulite of where next w were clearly next to one another, but more than one sometimes shared a common bath. So they would sometimes build a bathing bill, a bath building, uh, that would be used by those who lived in those two apartment houses. Now, what's characteristic of this, and especially as we think about it, think about it in relationship to early Domus architecture that we saw at palm pay, those single family dwellings is the need in this teaming commercial city, uh, to accommodate a very large, a population and a small amount of space. Uh, people on the whole who could not afford single family dwellings, uh, who needed to be housed in these apartment buildings.

Speaker 1:          00:39:13       They build up vertically. Uh, and as you can see, they go up to as many as five stories. And we see that the insula of Syrup is, was indeed a five storied structure. It is made out of concrete. It is faced with brick. I and what is particularly interesting about the brick facing here, and this is going to be our first example of this, that Australia is the fact that some point the Romans realize that brick was really attractive in its own right. Uh, and that didn't need to be stuck out over anymore. If you think back to the dome is our area, even in the Dome is our area. The building was made out of the palace, was made out of concrete, faced with brick, but the facade was gilded. And inside you'll remember fabulous was commissioned to cover the entire, uh, stock, the entire interior of the structure with stucco and then paint it.

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       So you would have had no sense, uh, when you were standing in the palace of Nero and Nero's day that it, that it was a brick face, concrete structure. Uh, but somewhere along the way, and it comes to the fore. And the second century Aidy, they realize, hey, this brick is actually pretty attractive in its own right. Uh, it has texture. We can vary the color. We can use a reddish brick. We can use a slightly yellowish brick. We can add some stucco to make some decorative effects. This looks awesome. Uh, and we think, uh, well, you know, we, we, uh, some, some, uh, uh, innovative architects got the idea in innovative designers to let's leave it, let's not stuck with it over. Let's let, let it speak for itself. Uh, and that was a very wise decision because as you'll see today, these are the buildings that we have remaining from Osteo that were unadulterated brick exteriors without stucco are absolutely magnificent.

Speaker 1:          00:41:01       Uh, and, and they, and they became the art. The designer's became real experts at rendering it in an extraordinary way. I think you can get a sense of that even in this model. So exposed, exposed brick work here. Uh, you see these arches a made of bricks that are, uh, kind of wedge shaped and, and, um, look like the sort of thing we saw earlier in stone. Those wedge shape, uh, sections of stone that we saw. For example, in the Fillery, Novi a gate. We see that sort of thing here. It may have been used just as it was in the Pantheon. You'll remember how they use them during the building, a process to keep the concrete from settling before it dried. Uh, but they realized afterwards that these could be positioned in a way that made them very attractive in their own right. Ultimately, we can also see that they have added moldings, usually with Stucco added moldings, uh, that have, that make the building more attractive.

Speaker 1:          00:41:56       Sometimes even little pediments as you can see over some of the windows over here. So they come up with strategies to make this brick look even more attractive than it was on its own note. Also, the shops in the first story. Uh, some of these are shops, some of these are actually staircases that lead you to the upper most stories. And once again, uh, it's clear that the Romans have become so adept at using it and using concrete that they are able to open up these walls. The, the openings are larger than they had been even before. Uh, and so they're there. They become very good at, at, at, at, at, at, at d materializing the wall, uh, in a way that, um, becomes increasingly sophisticated over time. The most famous house at Ostia is in a sense mine because it's called the Casa de Deana, the house of Diana, uh, at, uh, [inaudible] and, uh, we see a view of it here as it looks today.

Speaker 1:          00:42:55       It was a multistory apartment building, a multistory insula. Only two of those stories are preserved. Now I'll show you a restored view of what the original looked like momentarily. Uh, but we see it here as it looks today, concrete, uh, faced with brick exposed brick, brick and joy in its own right, very large openings that lead into their either entrance ways into the structure, uh, or uh, or, or lead to stare Wa two staircases or open up onto shops. We can see here in actuality the same sort of thing we saw in the model from AOR. And that is the use, not only have exposed brick but also have moldings that are added either in brick sometimes or also sometimes in Stucco of the Nice uh, overhangs that they have created above the second story windows up there. We also see a lot of Italian schoolchildren osteon po on Pompei also, but particularly osteon because of its proximity to Rome and all the schools that they have in the city of Rome.

Speaker 1:          00:43:57       Lots of kids always out in groups and they always were, they always seem to have t shirts of the same color. So you'll see one red school and one yellow school. And when blue school, it's a lot of fun and every one of them has their set. It's so funny to me, they have their cell phones and they're all clicking, clicking, clicking as they walk through these buildings. I'm not sure they're looking at anything, but they're definitely clicking to record the fact that they were at Osteo. Perhaps that's for student papers, I don't know. But here I detail of the insula of Diana looking through one of these entrance ways into the rest of the structure. And I bet yours and struck, I am in looking at this, that with regard to vista, the interest in Panorama and vista, it doesn't matter whether you're building out of rubble or stone or opus and carrot them or concrete or faced with brick.

Speaker 1:          00:44:43       Uh, there, there is that aesthetic, that Roman aesthetic of, of building things in such a way that wherever you're standing in that structure, you're going to be looking from one part of the building to another and you're going to be struck by the wonderful scenes that you see, uh, from, uh, you know, within and from within that building. And from that building. Outside of that structure, here's the restored view of the insula of Diana, uh, where you can see that originally it was a four story structure. It's a cutaway in an accident metric view for story structure. And this particular, uh, v, this particular restored view is also extremely helpful because it shows us that these houses did not have, uh, the peristyle courts or the Hortus, uh, that we know from the Dome Missy Tahlequah or the Hellenized Domus. There was no space for that. Uh, in this commercial [inaudible] city, uh, there is no emphasis on the greenery and the, um, the wonderful, uh, fountains and, and statuary that we saw in Palm Bay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:45       And keep in mind of course, it Pompei in Campania was essentially a resort town, a very different kind of feel then Ostia this team in commercial center. So what they replaced those with here in order to get more light into the structure is a kind of a lightwell. And you see that light lightwell up here, uh, where there are also windows on multiple stories. And in fact, I would imagine that those were the choices, uh, apartments to have, uh, because they would have been less noisy. Uh, then what you can imagine a apartment along the street must have been a, with all the activity going in and out of the therma polio, the other shops down below, um, and the cart traffic and so on. So again, I imagine the light, well apartment would have been highly desirable. Speaking of Thermo Polio, we have them at Ostia as we have them at palm pay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:35       Quite a number of them. And I show you the best preserve which happens to be in Diana's house. Uh, and I show it to you here, the Thermop Oleum of the Casa de Deanna at a Ostia. Uh, you can see that right at the entrance way, they have put a black and white mosaic. You see inside just what we saw at, uh, just exactly the same thing that we saw at palm pay, one of these counters that would've had recesses in it. Uh, so you have to imagine just the same as we saw there, a kind of fast food emporium where you would take a peek at what was, uh, what looked good for the day. Make your choice. If you go inside the Thermop Oleum of Diana, uh, you see hanging on the wall, a painting, which it seems likely may have served as a kind of shop sign. It might've been a hung outside the building to advertise what you could get in this particular Polian.

Speaker 1:          00:47:29       And if we look at what's depicted here, uh, it's a still life of objects and we see what seems to be a pomegranate on the right hanging on a nail on the wall in the center. I don't know if you can see it from where you sit, but in the center of block that supports a, what looks like a drinking cup that has little round things floating in it, lentils or chickpeas or something like that. And then at the far left, there's a plate that also is on a block, a plate that has a carrot and some other vegetables. So this may have been a vegetarian, I guess this was a vegetarian restaurant in palm pay, one of that, one of the healthier places one could go if one wanted a snack, uh, in, in, in, in osteon. Excuse me. Uh, for a very long, if, if, if you go to Osteo, by the way, you really do want to set aside a day to do that because the time you take the half an hour ride out there, uh, get there.

Speaker 1:          00:48:23       There's a lot to see. Uh, and it used to be, if you'd go there for a day, which I've done many, many times, uh, there was absolutely nowhere to eat. So you had to remember to bring your band nowhere to get a bottle of water. So you would have to remember to bring your bottle of water and maybe a snack a, but they have rectified that in most in recent years. The last few years, they finally put up the cafe cafe therea daily Scobie, which loosely translated as the, the excavation cafe, uh, the cafeteria of the excavations at Ostia. And it's actually a wonderful place. I have to say. It's very modern. It has a wonderful deck with, uh, tables and the ubiquitous Italian white umbrella where one and the food is actually, you know, for a cafeteria. Ain't bad, but Italian pasta is always hard to make bad, so he's good.

Speaker 1:          00:49:09       Uh, and then inside, I thought you'd be amused to see when they decided on the decor for the interior of the cafeteria with its, with its simple tables and chairs, uh, they put brick on the wall and they then hung up these wonderful versions, uh, of the, uh, of the P. Dot. Saul laid daily Corporates, Yoni, a black and white mosaic. So again, very attuned and Italians are really, I mean, they do build Ferrari's after all. They are very good, uh, at, uh, at design and aesthetic and pay a great deal of attention to that and consequently always make one surroundings. Pleasant warehouses. This was up, this was a commercial port. We've talked about the fact that in commercial ports, one needs warehouses. We talked, we, it, we began the semester with a warehouse. In fact, the Porticos Amelia, uh, in Rome, along the banks of the Tiber.

Speaker 1:          00:49:59       And I remind you of that here. Here's the Tiber, a model of the Tiber with the porticos. Amelia, you'll remember that was made out of concrete. It was one of the earliest examples of concrete construction in the Republican Rome. Uh, a series of barrel vaults linked to one another on three tiers, as you'll recall with axial and lateral, a spatial relations inside that structure, uh, Po osteon needed its own warehouses as well. It had them in the republic already. Uh, but it began to add to them in the second century a d. And it's fascinating to see what happens when you build a warehouse out of concrete. Faced with brick, you get an extraordinary structure that looks very much like an insula. I mean, if I had put this up and said, what is this? And you said it's an Insula, uh, you would, you would, you would be sort of be on the mark because it looks exactly like an insula.

Speaker 1:          00:50:48       Uh, but it is a warehouse and this is the most famous warehouse in Ostia, this so called Auria because the word Auria, h o, r, r, e a, his warehouse in Latin, the Orencia epic Athena, which you have on your monument list, which dates to one 45 to 150. And this is the entrance to the Ra at the got the, uh, it is again made out of concrete faced with brick exposed, brick work, brick work enjoyed in its own right for its own aesthetic here. Uh, we can see that, that it is like the, um, like the apartment houses in that it is multistory, uh, with the large entrance ways or entrance ways into the structure down below. And then the smaller windows up above, they have monumental ISED the entrance, the main entrance to the structure by giving it a columns supporting a pediment very grand in fact.

Speaker 1:          00:51:43       And we haven't, we, it's interesting to see that even with this brick face concrete architecture, the Romans have not lost their interest in Helen Ising works of art and using touches of ancient Greece to monumental lies and to make more, more, um, you know, more, more cultured in a sense, uh, the entrance way into this structure. So we see these columns engaged columns supporting a pediment above capitals on those columns. As you can see here, all of this done in concrete, faced with brick. And you can see here, this is an outstanding example of the way in which they have used brick, uh, to their advantage. They have recognized that you can vary the color, you can have a reddish brick, you can have a yellow, which brick. So here they've used red brick to face the column shaft and then a yellow brick to, for the capital.

Speaker 1:          00:52:37       So there's a distinction between the shaft and the capital. And they have even used the most expensive material, a marble for the inscription plaque where they identify this building as the Ra, epic God, Brianna, uh, and then the pediment above. And you can see if you look at the pediment decoration and if you look at the volume of the capitals, you will see they have used a small amount of stucco to enable them to ha, to create, uh, the vault, the spirals of the volumes, for example. And some of the more delicate decorative work in the pediment above another subtlety, a very another nice subtlety. It just shows you the amount of effort and time and money that went into this commission. Also this very nice pilaster that is placed right next to the column, which makes a wonderful, a wonderful transition from the column, the roundness of the column to the squareness of the Pilaster, to the shape of the doorway, the aesthetics, a very much on the mind of this particular designer as well as the list is again, this idea of looking through one space, seeing another opening, and wondering where that opening is going.

Speaker 1:          00:53:48       All of that very, very carefully designed by the architect. Here's another view head on of this elaborate doorway leading into the Ra epic, the Yana announcing with the inscription, uh, exactly where you are and what this building was used for in antiquity. A detail of the pediment, uh, where we can see the inscription. We can also see the capital's the use of Stucco work here on the very elaborate, uh, work that they have done to decorate the pediment above. Uh, just a few more details of the columns where you can see even better, uh, this capital and the way in which they have used brick. They have used brick for the, even for the, uh, campus leaves. You can see that there are a campus leaves here. This is actually an example, one of the few we've seen of the composite capital with the canvas leaves of the Corinthian and the volumes of the ionic.

Speaker 1:          00:54:40       We saw it on the arch of Titus and Rome. Uh, but here we see that they've used brick and then only at the upper, most part with the leaf has to curve over a do they add the stucco so tremendous. And this is just a warehouse and yet a tremendous amount of effort has gone into making it an extraordinarily beautiful building. And it shows again that they are absolutely going over the top in terms of their, uh, of being a Namor of what they can do with brick facing that they are now able to expose once they can expose it, they're much more willing to put the effort into it to make it really attractive. And if you go into the courtyard of the Ra, epic, Athena, and by the way, behind within these areas here we have a annual or vaulting. You can see these niches that have been placed here.

Speaker 1:          00:55:25       I mean they don't really need these niches in this courtyard of this warehouse of what did they use these niches for? Well, perhaps they put a little statuettes of, of, of God's, uh, that the, the, those who worked here favored and protected their, their daily, uh, their, their daily toil, uh, here in the [inaudible] got the Ana. But look at the attention that they have paid to these niches that have no other purpose than to be attractive and possibly again to hold these statuettes. Uh, but you can see here again with this combination of Stucco work for the pilasters and the capitals and brick work, brick work creating these interestingly shaped lozenges and triangles, uh, to create, uh, shows an interest again in geometric form and the contrast of one geometric form to another justice we saw in black and white mosaic, uh, capitalized on by these designers.

Speaker 1:          00:56:19       Now, I don't want to leave you with the impression that because brick is now exposed at four and enjoyed in its own right, uh, that there are no walls that were stuck out and painted in Ostia. That would be a mis misconception because there are still painted walls in Australia on the insides of some of these buildings. They still opted to stucco over the wall and to paint in. And I want to show you just one glorious example. The insula of the painted vaults and which dates to one 50 to 200 is one that has one of our best preserved ceilings, walls and ceilings anywhere in a Roman house. You can see how well preserved it is here. And it is what we call the spoked wheel effect, uh, because what the ceiling decoration does look like a spoked wheel. Uh, we can also see this division.

Speaker 1:          00:57:11       In fact, as you look at it, I, I think you'll be as struck as I am by the fact that as we look at this boat spoked wheel, we really get the sense that we're looking at one of Hadrian's pumpkin domes and paint because you can see, uh, the segmented dome effect here, uh, and, and also the octagonal ice in a sense, the octagonal effect. That one also gets from this structure as well as the effect of the ribs. Of a groin vault, uh, as you can see, well here, but it's a painted version of a pumpkin dome and it's not surprising to see that Hadrian's, uh, pumpkin domes took off in this way. I also just want to mention to you that while there is a fair amount of post what we call postpone pay and painting, Roman painting after a d 79, almost all of it is, uh, an exploitation of the fourth style of Roman painting as we know it from palm pay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:02       There's actually not as much invention as one would expect it after 79 in Roman painting. I want to show you very briefly the insula of the muses, the insula of the muses in Ostia, which dates to around 81 30. Uh, because this is one of the few, uh, single family dwellings that we see in the second century in Ostia. Uh, you can see if you look at the plan that it is a range, not around an atrium but around a Paris style court here, although there aren't a columns, there are these, uh, these, uh, peers as you can see also in plan. But just as we saw in the late Roman house, the late, how's the late first century Aidy houses in Herculaneum from between the, the, the, uh, earthquake and the eruption of Vesuvius, uh, the try Klinean has become the most important room in the house.

Speaker 1:          00:58:59       You enter into it here. Uh, you have a vestibule, you have this court, and then you'll have on access the try Clinique of the house. But what makes this particular house most distinctive is the fact that every single, every single floor is covered with mosaic. So as I said to you before, uh, the black and white mosaic reign supreme in the city of Osteon, it's clear that everyone who could afford it, a decorated there every room of their house with mosaic. And although this doesn't come from this particular house, has, comes from the house of Apple layups in osteous, not on your monument list down to remember it, but I just wanted to show it to you, uh, because it's a marvelous example of what can be done. I wish it were a little more in focus, but it's a marvelous example of what could be done.

Speaker 1:          00:59:43       And was done using black and white mosaic in Ostia only black and white test to ride with a Medusa head in the center. And then if you, this is one of these examples, uh, illusionistic examples that as you look at it and focus on it, it's hard to tell exactly what's, you know, what's in the foreground, what's in the background. It's got that [inaudible] op art effect that those of you who know our op art of the 1960s. And I, and I show you an example of it, a, uh, a painting from the blaze series by the AAP artists, Bridget Riley of the 1960s. I've, I've mentioned so many times in the course of this semester that there isn't the anything that the Romans didn't do, uh, before anybody else. And this is, uh, an op art is an example of that. So we do see op art in Ostia, uh, and um, we see it obviously also much later in, in more contemporary painting, another bath structure in Ostia.

Speaker 1:          01:00:38       This one, the bads of the seven wise men or the seven sages dates to a d one 30. I show it to you only to show you this one circular room and not because it's a bad building, but rather because it has a wonderful mosaic on the floor. I get a circular structure with a circular mosaic once again, done in black and white. And if you look at this, you can see that what we have represented here, I'll show you a detail in a moment, is a flowering a can't. This plant that has intertwined within its leaves, hunters and the hunted hunted animals and they're hunters in combat as you can see here. Uh, and here's the detail where you can see once again done entirely in black and white mosaic, the hunters, the animals, very carefully depicted interspersed among these, uh, these, uh, flowering a canvas plants.

Speaker 1:          01:01:28       Very effectively done. This is another view of the bads of Neptune in Ostia, which we looked at before dates to 139 a d. And this is a good view because it shows you not only they, uh, uh, brick face, concrete construction of these structures, but also, uh, the mosaics themselves. Uh, and how every single room of this bath was covered with black and white mosaic. The PSD raise the stalks. The finest mosaic in the complex is this one, and it's the one from which the bath gets its name, the bads of Neptune. Because we see Neptune himself in the center of the scene. It's not surprising that the, uh, that the god of the sea was chosen as an appropriate subject for a bath building. We see him here with his trident. That's how we know it's him being, uh, being, uh, carried along by four horses.

Speaker 1:          01:02:19       He's holding the reins of those horses. His mantle is billowing up behind him. One expects to see a cherry at here. One thinks of this is Neptune in a cherry, but it's not Neptune in a chariot. Uh, you can see that these horses, by the way, aren't fully horses, but are the front part is a horse and the rest is a sea creature. And you can see that the legs of a of Neptune, our interests are interwoven, uh, with the, with the tail of the sea creature. He's in fact using the tales of those sea creatures, almost like, um, uh, you know, I'll miss like skates or, uh, as he, as he makes his way along this or waterskiis I guess is a better way of putting it waterskiis as he makes his way from right to left across the white background. Uh, one of the interesting things about this mosaic is you see the tension, uh, in the, in the minds and, and, and, uh, you know, and work of, of this, of this artist, uh, in, in, out in one hand, making these very abstract black shapes against a white background, but at the same time paying a lot of attention to the actual musculature, to what the chest of the God, uh, uh, beside and would have looked like.

Speaker 1:          01:03:28       As you look at [inaudible], there's, you know, very pronounced musculature that's carefully done here by the artists. Here are our friends. The dolphins frolicking a dolphins with cupid's on their back, uh, some fairly, uh, other floating figures, a female figure on the back of another sea creature. All of this going on, on the floor of the Bas of Neptune. But what's particularly interesting, I think is the same sort of thing that we saw on the [inaudible] daily corporates Yoni. And that is that the artist has designed this in such a way that it doesn't matter which part of the room you're standing in, wherever you are standing, you can look onto the floor from where you were standing and see at least some of the figures head on, whether you're standing here, whether you're standing here, whether you're standing up there or to the right. You are always seeing some, not all, but some of the figures head on.

Speaker 1:          01:04:19       So again, this is not, this is done with great care, uh, and orchestrated to fit the space in which it was located here at detail of the mosaic that we just looked at showing Neptune and his horses and sea creatures. The most important development that happens at Ostia, uh, with regard to residential architecture later in its history is we do begin to see the reemergence of the Domus already in the second century. And then even more so in the third and fourth centuries. A d. And I want to show you quickly two examples of that because they tell us a good deal about late residential architecture in Australia and also by association in Rome. This is the Domus of tuna on an Aria and acts and a metric view of that house. It dates to the late second century Aidy but was remodeled significantly in the fourth century, A.

Speaker 1:          01:05:14       Dot. D and I think we really need to think of it as more a fourth century house then as a, um, as a second century house. And by the way, pump Osteo was still thriving in the third century by the 400. By the year 480, it was abandoned, but in the third century, still a thriving and early fourth century is still a thriving city. Uh, we see this house here. It's a, an accident metric view from Ward Perkins. The most important features besides the fact that it's a single story dwelling, single family dwelling, is the fact that it has an open court here with a pool, that it has a, the [inaudible] idiom as the most important room of the house. So that continues on in residential architecture, but there's a particular taste for apses in these late Roman buildings. You can see that this one has an apps not so unlike the apps that we saw in demolitions palatine palace on the Palatine Hill.

Speaker 1:          01:06:05       It is finally starting to catch on among others. Uh, we see that you go into that, uh, that, uh, that room through a and three arches on columns a and this idea of supporting a triple arch on columns is also a very popular motif in domestic architecture in later antiquity. And look also at the fact that on the left hand side of the track Klinean there is a fountain. So the incorporation of a fountain, a fountain, a pool court here, uh, a fountain there and Apps try Clint Iom and then views through triple a triple arch is supported by columns, all characteristic features of late Roman domestic architecture. This a view obviously through the columns supporting that triple arch toward the fountain on the left and toward the apps in the center of the structure. Uh, and you can see the remains of marble revetment real marble revetment.

Speaker 1:          01:07:03       Uh, that was used both on the floor for the pavement and also on the walls. The other house I want to show you briefly is the dullness of cupid and psyche. The more famous of the, to this dates without any question to late antiquity to around a d 300, uh, the house of cupid and psyche. We see at first and plan a, and you can see it's very simple and entranceway here, a long Carter, a series of cubic ula on either on one side of that card or there may have been a second story on a small part of the house. You can see the stairway there. As you walk along the card, you eventually end up in the very large try. Klinean so again, from the time of the house and the mosaic Atrium and Herculaneum to hear the try Klinean, uh, gaining in importance as you walk along that Carter and you look through a series of columns supporting arches as we'll see customary of buildings of this time.

Speaker 1:          01:07:57       And then look at this wall, which is scallops, uh, for a fountain. So another one of these fountain courts that seems to be popular during this period. Here's a view into the room with the lovers, the famous statue of cupid and psyche. The young Cuban debate, little young cupid's cupid and psyche are embracing one another. That's from that statute that the house gets its name, one of the best preserved marble reverted rooms in the history. And the, and the history of Roman architecture is this room here, the probably the TriClare diem in the house of cupid and psyche. You can see that even marble from the walls is preserved as well as on the pavement and on the steps and on the side of the base of the walls as well. Brick face, concrete construction faced with real marble. What makes this particular house, uh, especially appealing besides that wonderful statue is the fact that although there's the usual touches of Maroon and green that we tend to see in many of these Roman pavements.

Speaker 1:          01:09:00       Uh, most of the color is a pastel and it makes it look particularly attractive. Uh, and it goes particularly nicely with the red and yellow of the brick construction. And I show you a detail here, uh, of that marble revetment, which gives you as good an idea as anything I have shown you this semester of what the original Hellenistic palaces of the Kings, the palaces of Nero and Domitian would have looked like in their heyday and a detail of the statue of cupid and psyche and the room in which that found itself, uh, it can still be seen. They are today, uh, and the marble revetment once again, done in pastel colors of the floor and of the walls, uh, giving us again, an excellent sense, not only a fourth century domestic architecture decor, but also what so many of the buildings that are no longer preserved, well, who's revetment is no longer as well preserved as one would wish.

Speaker 1:          01:09:55       What they would've looked like in antiquity, a view through the Carter, through the columns, in this case, gray granite columns that probably would have supported an arcade a, but then without question, the fountain on the side of the wall, that is scallop, uh, both down here on the wall itself. And then the columns there do support arches. So this whole concept of columns supporting arches, very much a part of late Roman Haus design, uh, in very few minutes that remain. I just want to say a few words about, uh, we've talked about the life of this port city I want to talk about since I said that lecture was about life and death. I want to just end with saying a few words about the tombs in which the people who lived here were buried. Uh, people all up and down the social pyramid lived in this commercial center.

Speaker 1:          01:10:48       The simplest tombs, and by the way I mentioned to you already that there are tombs both outside the city of palm pay on the major roads and then a little bit further away at this place called Easel, a soccer or the sacred island where one can see particularly WellPreserved tombs from those who lived in Ostia of the second century. Those who the, the working poor, we're buried in very simple tombs of two. The upper part of clay am for is just the upper part. They were broken and then the upper part was stuck with stuck into the ground. The remains of the person we're placed below the ground. And then the spout could be used to pour wine libations into, uh, the other simple type was tiles that were part of the body was placed below and then tiles were ranged around it looking almost like a, uh, a kind of a house, uh, that helped to protect this idea of the houses of the living in the houses, the dead that were meant to protect the body.

Speaker 1:          01:11:45       But most of the tombs are what we call the house type. We looked at the house type on the VOP and the age of Augustus in Rome, a tomb that resembles a house from the front with a doorway and a couple of windows, and then an inscription plaque and note the use of the travertine jams and lintel around it just as we saw on the markets of Trajan in Rome. But if you look at these in this very good view from the side, you will see that almost all of these are barrel vaulted tombs, which is characteristic of second century to market texture at Ostia. Add easily Socra these barrel vaulted structures with facades that make them look like houses. Here's a detail of one of them. One of these house tombs with again the travertine jams down below with the touch of a pediment up above and they haven't lost their interest in Hellenization to a certain extent.

Speaker 1:          01:12:35       Windows here slipped windows here and inscription along inscription plaque that tells us who was buried there. And then very often in these wonderful tombs for this commercial center, these panels that are done in terracotta that tell us something about the profession of those who are buried here. Here's probably a shipper. I was buried here, someone who made his money in the import and export business. And over here you can maybe barely make out a representation of a mill just as those that we would have saw. I saw on palm payer, we saw on the tomb of the baker, you Rissa keys, a mill with a uh, a worker and a mule that is helping to rotate the mill of the bakery. So perhaps a baker also from this particular family. I've, I've super imposed a couple of other terracotta plaques, making them a little larger here to show you that these two belong to uh, people who made their profession by sharpening knives, knife sharpeners and they not only sharpen knives and you can see them both doing this in this scene, but they also sold them.

Speaker 1:          01:13:34       And I love the way in this still life. They've a raid every possible knife that you can sharpen here or buy a from these individuals. And what do you think the profession's where of these two? This one clearly has shopped someone selling things in a shop. It looks like vegetables once again, asparagus and maybe Broccoli or some such over there. But what about this one? What was the profession of this one? Midwife. Midwife. And I love this because here we have this woman about to give birth. She's got another woman I holding her and giving her support and hear the midwife instead of looking at what she's doing, she's reaching in, but she's not. She's, she's, instead of looking at what she's supposed to be concentrating on, she's looking out at the spectator just to make sure that we don't forget her features. Uh, for posterity on this tomb relief from her tomb in Ostia, uh, we saw columbaria these underground columbaria with these niches where they placed the cremated remains of the deceased and had inscriptions.

Speaker 1:          01:14:33       We see the same sort of thing in the interiors of tombs that Ostia but they are on, they are above ground rather than subterranean at Ostia. And we also see, and basically the last point I want to make today is we also see in the interiors of these tombs that osteon not only those niches for the cremated remains, but it's in the second century ID, the time of Hadrian on that information, burial becomes the norm, uh, largely on, under the influence of the spread of Christianity. The idea, the of the stole soul needs to ascend to heaven. And so you have to maintain the bodily remains. And so we begin to see in these interiors what we call Arca Soliah, arc, Arco, AARC, O, s, O, l, I, a Arco Soliah, which are these much larger niches where bodies are placed, bodies are buried, and then they are covered over with a marble slab that might have the inscription naming the deceased or, uh, a figural scene.

Speaker 1:          01:15:29       And just in closing, to show you one last tomb that we're going to look at next time, the tomb of the [inaudible] II and the Vatican cemetery in Rome. I to show you that these concrete brick faced build as tombs with windows and with very elaborate interiors also begin to be put up in Rome in the second century ID. We'll look at those. We'll look at the title of next time's lecture is bigger, is better. We're really going to culminate our move toward larger and more grandiose buildings then. And then on Thursday we will finally move out to the provinces by studying, uh, Roman architecture in Roman North Africa. Thank you.
