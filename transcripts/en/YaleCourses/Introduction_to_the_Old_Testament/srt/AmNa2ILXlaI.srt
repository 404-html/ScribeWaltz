1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,260
We were talking last time about the
establishment of the monarchy or kingship,

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,550
um,
in Israel.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,060
And I want to say a little bit about some
of the features of Israelite kingship.

4
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:13,890
And today I'll be coming back frequently
to the Israelite notions of kingship

5
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:16,780
and, and royal ideology.
But to start off, uh,

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,310
one of the most important things to
realize is that the king in Israel was not

7
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:24,630
divine, uh, as he was in
Egypt or even semi divine.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,580
Occasionally he offered sacrifice, but he
didn't play a regular role in the cult.

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:35,070
Israelite Royal Ideology was heavily
indebted to Canaanite Royal Ideology.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,510
You have similar language that's
applied to the kings of Israel.

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,850
The king is said to be appointed by the,

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,440
by the deity or deities to end
wickedness to enlighten the land.

13
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:50,010
He's the channel of press, prosperity
and divine blessing for the nation.

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,940
All of this is true of Canaanite
kings as well. And the king,

15
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:58,350
as we've seen is spoken of as God's son.
That doesn't imply divinity.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,660
It's a metaphor.
The metaphor of son ship.

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,090
It was used for the
Canaanite gods as well.

18
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:07,320
And it expressed the special relationship
between the king and the deity.

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,480
It was the same relationship as was found
between that of as Susan and a vassal

20
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:17,040
Lennar suzerainty treaties. Also the
vessel is the son of, of the Susan.

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,170
It's a kind of adoption and
what it means is that the,

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,990
the one who is metaphorically
the sun is to serve, uh,

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,420
the father loyally faithfully,

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,080
but is also susceptible
to chastisement from him.

25
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:35,010
And that's what we saw in Nathan's
statement or pronouncement of prophecy to

26
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:35,940
David last time.

27
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,810
Michael Coogan points out that the
notion of the sun ship of the king was

28
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,283
revolutionary.

29
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,360
It was a deliberate effort to replace
an earlier understanding according to

30
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:50,640
which the entire nation
of Israel was God's son.

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,320
You'll be remembered during the plagues
in Egypt and God refers to Pharaoh as

32
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:59,880
having a pressed his son
Israel, his first born as, yeah,

33
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:00,870
for his son.

34
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,070
The king now is standing between
God and the people as a whole.

35
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:09,210
And we're going to be turned to a moment
in a moment to this new royal ideology

36
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:12,540
and, and what's really going to be a very
tense juxtaposition with the Covenant

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,650
Theology.

38
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,250
But first I want to say a little bit
more about the characters of David and

39
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:20,720
Solomon before going into
the way royal ideology was,

40
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:23,580
was later developed in the Bible.

41
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:28,320
David is second only in importance
and in textual space to Moses write,

42
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:32,640
the amount of space is devoted to
him. Um, it's second only to Moses.

43
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,310
There are three characteristics of David,
which stand out.

44
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:39,060
And the first is that he's described
as being quite proficient in music and

45
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:43,650
poetry. And so we'll see that later.
Tradition is going to attribute to him,

46
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,290
uh, not only the invention
of various instruments,

47
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,180
but also the composition
of the book of Psalms.

48
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:51,270
It seems to make sense that he would be
the composer of the Book of Psalms if he

49
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,880
has a reputation for,
for poetry and music.

50
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,600
He's also credited with great military
and tactical skill and confidence.

51
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,550
He deploys his army on behalf of Israel,
but he also once he is king,

52
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:07,870
deploys a his army within
Israel against his rivals.

53
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,310
Third,

54
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,310
he's depicted as a very shrewd politician
and it was David who created permanent

55
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,500
symbols of God's election of Israel.
God's election of David himself,

56
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,820
God's election of David's house or
line or dynasty to rule over Israel in

57
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:29,530
perpetuity. It has said that he
conceived the idea of a royal capital.

58
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:33,040
He captured the city of Jay Boosie
gay boosts. It was a border town,

59
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:37,060
so it's free of any tribal association,
right? It's sort of like a Washington DC.

60
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,440
It's not located really within any one
tribe and he captured this and built it

61
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:42,820
up as the city of David.

62
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,390
The city was going to be renamed Jerusalem
and it would become understood as the

63
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:52,930
chosen city, the place where God caused
his name to dwell. As Deuteronomy said,

64
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:56,680
there would be a place where God would
choose to cause his name to dwell,

65
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,460
and so Jerusalem becomes a
symbol of God's presence.

66
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:03,700
It becomes a symbol of Israel's kingdom,
a monarchy.

67
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,550
It becomes a symbol of
the dynasty of David.

68
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:11,380
It is referred to as the city of David.
David transfers the arc to this city.

69
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,560
And so he makes it the home to the
ancient witness of the Covenant,

70
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,940
the Sinai Covenant.

71
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,540
The added implication is that the Davidic
dynasty has inherited the blessings of

72
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:25,990
the covenant is Somehow Fulfilling
The promise to the Patriarchs, which,

73
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,560
which is also associated with
the nation of Israel. At Sinai,

74
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,200
he planned a temple that would become
the permanent resting place for the arc

75
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:37,510
and a cultic center for all Israel.

76
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,070
But the building of this
temple was left to Solomon.

77
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,330
So we'll discuss it and it's
symbolism when we get to Solomon.

78
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,460
But according to the biblical record,

79
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:49,720
it was still David who made the
Choson Dynasty, the chosen city,

80
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,460
what would eventually be the temple
into permanent and deeply interconnected

81
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,650
symbols of the religion of Israel.

82
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,250
And it's really with David that the
history of Jerusalem as the holy city, uh,

83
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,500
begins.
Now.

84
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:07,530
The Biblical assessment of David is
initially a relatively positive and this

85
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:10,540
changes, uh, shortly after
his ascension to the throne,

86
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,710
beginning in Second Samuel from
about chapter nine through 20.

87
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:17,050
And then on into the first
couple of chapters of kings,

88
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,800
you have a stretch of texts,

89
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:23,410
which is often referred to as the court
history or the succession narrative of

90
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:24,244
David.

91
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,690
The critical question that drives this
particular historical fiction is the

92
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:32,260
question of fixed session. Who will
succeed? David, he has many children,

93
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,570
but one by one his sons are um,

94
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,280
killed or this they're displaced or
disqualified in one way or another.

95
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:44,020
Until finally there is Solomon.
There are lots of wonderful,

96
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:49,120
major and minor characters in this drama.
It's a very complex drama,

97
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:50,860
lots of intrigue and passion.

98
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,170
But the passages of the material in this
section also presents a rather unusual

99
00:05:56,171 --> 00:06:00,200
portrait of David. He's
weak, he's indecisive,

100
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,290
he's something of an Antihero.
He stays home and the palace,

101
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:08,000
while other people are off leading
battles and, and then fighting the wars.

102
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,840
He enters into a knee,
illicit relationship with a married woman,

103
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,390
but Shev or Bathsheba,
uh,

104
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:18,650
he sees to it that her husband is
killed in battle to cover up his affair.

105
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:19,550
Um,

106
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,410
it's this combined act of adultery
and murder that earns him,

107
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,130
um, of sounds scolding from
Nathan the Prophet Nathan. We'll,

108
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:32,810
we'll come to that when we
talk about profits next week.
But God punishes him, uh,

109
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,220
with the death of his son.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,090
And it's really from this point
on in the story that we see David,

111
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,770
I'm losing control over events around him.

112
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,740
His control declines. Um, he is,

113
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,690
he's indecisive on the whole question of
succession and that leads to all kinds

114
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:54,470
of resentment and conflict
as well as result revolts.

115
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,120
There's one revolt which is a revolt
in support of his son Absalom.

116
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,620
That's a revolt that the Deuteronomistic
historian also indicates was a

117
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:06,500
punishment for his affair with date
for David's affair with Bathsheba.

118
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,090
But during this revolt, uh,
David flees from his enemies.

119
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:14,520
He stripped of his
crown, he's degraded, um,

120
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,610
when Absalom is killed,

121
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,030
David weeps for his son uncontrollably.

122
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:22,490
And this only angers
his own supporters who,

123
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,550
who fought so earnestly against
Absalom and his defense.

124
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,810
It's very pointed moment, but by
the end of the story, David is, um,

125
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,910
almost completely impotent and,

126
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,970
and senile even the Prophet Nathan.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,520
And Best Sheba plot to have,
um,

128
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,630
Bashiva's son Solomon a
named the successor of David.

129
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,520
And there really is no point at which
there's any divine indication that Solomon

130
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:47,930
has has one divine approval,

131
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:51,620
no divine indication that he is the
one it happens through palace intrigue,

132
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:56,470
particularly with Bathsheba and
Nathan, but the northern tribes. Um,

133
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,840
there are signs throughout the story of
the hostility of the northern tribes.

134
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:03,290
And that's a warning sign.
That's a warning sign of future disunity.

135
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:09,020
This whole court history is just a
wonderful, masterful work of prose.

136
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,420
You're going to be reading, um, uh,

137
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,910
something from a book by a
Fella named Mayor Sternberg,

138
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,100
which is I think just a wonderful
study of the bus Shiva story. Um,

139
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:23,010
some speak about all of this unit
as being authored by the net, by,

140
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,630
by the j source.
Um,

141
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,850
you need to know that source theory
has undergone so many permutations.

142
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,100
There really isn't any standard view,

143
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:35,110
but I think the idea that the sources
jep and d extend beyond the pentitude

144
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,210
cause now generally
not no longer accepted.

145
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:42,260
So you will sometimes see people talking
about the j source is going all the way

146
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:46,370
through the end of second kings and being,
in fact the J is the author of the,

147
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,720
of the court history.

148
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:51,320
But for the most part I think most people
think of the source theory is applying

149
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:52,190
to the Pentateuch.

150
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:57,240
And beyond that we talk about the
Deuteronomistic historian redacting older

151
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:58,021
earlier sources.

152
00:08:58,021 --> 00:09:01,050
We'll talk a little bit more about some
of those sources as we move through the

153
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:04,290
later books. The books of the
form of profits, the whore,

154
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,540
the court history has an array of
very richly drawn characters. Um,

155
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,480
they act out all sorts of scenes
of, of um, power and lust and,

156
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:18,090
and courage and struggle. There's,
there's crime, there's tender love.

157
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:22,520
It's a very realistic sort of,
of psychological drama. Um,

158
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,440
it's also striking for its
uncompromising honesty.

159
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,600
We don't see anything like that really in
the work of any contemporary historian.

160
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,140
David is depicted in very,
very human terms.

161
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,200
The flattery and the white washing that
you find in other ancient near Eastern,

162
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,720
um,
dynastic histories is lacking here.

163
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,470
The flattery and white washing that
we get. For example, in in chronicles,

164
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,520
I write the books of chronicles are really
just a retelling of the material here

165
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:53,600
in the form of profits. And they clean
up the picture of David that you know,

166
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,200
there's no mention of Bathsheba in there.

167
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,410
So you do have that kind of whitewashing
as part of the historiography of the

168
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:03,750
book of chronicles. But it's
lacking here. All of the flaws,

169
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:06,720
all of the weaknesses of
David a national hero,

170
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,810
they're all laid bare implicitly.

171
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,300
Perhaps that is a critique of kingship.

172
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:16,500
It's perhaps a critique of the claim
of kings to rule by divine right.

173
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,850
The author here seems to be stressing that
David, and as we shall see, Solomon, um,

174
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,780
he's quite human, Solomon's quite
human. They're not at all divine.

175
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:28,500
They're subject to the errors and
flaws that characterize all humans.

176
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,120
As we move out of Samuel now
and into first and second kings,

177
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,980
we see that these books,

178
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,100
kings contained the history of Israel
from the death of King David until the

179
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:45,030
fall of Judah in five 80 75
86 and the exile to Babylonia.

180
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,930
These books also appeared to
be based on older sources.

181
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,280
Some of them are explicitly identify,
they will refer sometimes to these works,

182
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:55,320
which evidently were subsequently lost,

183
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:59,550
but they'll say they'll refer to the book
of the acts of Solomon or the book of

184
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:02,880
the annals of the kings of Israel or
the book of the annals of the kings of

185
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:03,714
Judah.

186
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,590
Animals and chronicles were regularly
maintained in royal courts throughout the

187
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:08,371
ancient Near East.

188
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:12,510
There's no reason to think that this
wasn't also done in a royal setting in

189
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,870
Israel.
These animals generally listed events,

190
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:17,910
important events in the
reign of a given king.

191
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,980
They tended not to have
much narrative to them.

192
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:24,570
And the beginning of the first 16 chapters
of first kings has that kind of feel,

193
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:26,940
not a lot of narrative and
really reportage of events.

194
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,930
Beginning in first king 1717 through 22,

195
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,330
the first nine chapters of seven kings,

196
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,540
there's a departure from
that analyst analytic,

197
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,660
not an analytic ana Anil
style animals genre, um,

198
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,740
the reporting of events,
uh, in the reign of a king.

199
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,800
And you have more developed
narratives in those sources.

200
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,770
And these narratives
generally feature profits.

201
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,370
So it's going to lead very nicely into
our study of profits beginning on Monday.

202
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,830
Some of the narratives evidently would
have circulated independently. Um,

203
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,290
particularly the stories
probably about Elijah and Elisha.

204
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,130
These zealous Yahweh only profits.

205
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,140
They were probably local heroes and
these stories circulate it independently,

206
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:12,640
but they've come to be embedded in a
framework that conforms those sources to

207
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,990
um, the ideology and religious perspective
of the Deuteronomistic historian.

208
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,320
Uh, first kings chapter two is, is
the death scene. Um, it has, um,

209
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,970
David's death bed instructions to his
son Solomon and he tells Solomon to kill

210
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:31,240
all of his rivals and opponents.
And in verse 12,

211
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:34,720
we read and Solomon sat upon
the throne of his father David.

212
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,550
And his rule was firmly established
and it seems that at this point,

213
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,690
the three crises that we noted in the
book of Samuel at the opening of first

214
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:48,390
Samuel, the three crises we noted are
resolved. The crisis in succession is,

215
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,010
is resolved.
David is succeeded by his son,

216
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,540
Solomon and all of the kings of Judah
for the next 400 years. In fact,

217
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,480
until the destruction in five 86,
um,

218
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,630
all of these kings will
be of the Line of David.

219
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,190
The military crises seem for
now to have been resolved.

220
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:10,270
We've had lots of military and diplomatic
successes and Israel seems to be

221
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:14,680
secure. And also the religious
crisis that we mentioned is resolved.

222
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:19,000
The Ark was taken from the Philistines.
It's been brought to Jerusalem,

223
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:23,390
it's been installed in Jerusalem, and
now a magnificent temple is planned, um,

224
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,820
that will, how's the arc and be a site
for the central worship of all Israel.

225
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,720
But the resolution of these crises came
at a cost and they produced fundamental

226
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:39,421
changes in Israelite Society from
a loose confederation of tribes.

227
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:41,410
However idealistic that picture was.

228
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,950
But from a loose confederation of
tribes are United by a covenant.

229
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,120
We've now got a nation with a
strong central administration.

230
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:50,320
It's headed by a king.

231
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:55,321
And that king seems to enjoy a special
covenant with God rather than charismatic

232
00:13:55,421 --> 00:14:00,040
leaders who rise as the need, um,
itself arises and then fade away.

233
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,040
We now have permanent kings from a single
family and preserved in the biblical

234
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:07,240
sources is attention,

235
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,830
attention between the old ideas
of the Covenant Confederation,

236
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:16,420
What We Might Call Covenant Theology,
and the new ideology of the monarchy.

237
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,750
This new royal ideology combines loyalty
to God and loyalty to the throne so

238
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:28,951
that treason or rebellion against
God's anointed is also apostasy.

239
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:33,640
It's also rebellion against God himself,
the to become conflated.

240
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,340
A as a scholar named Jon Levenson,

241
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:40,000
I've talked about him before and
connection with the Covenant at Sinai,

242
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:42,580
but in this wonderful
book called Sinai in Zion,

243
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,470
he really juxtaposes these two ideologies
and he points to this deep tension

244
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:52,070
between the Covenant Theology and the
Royal Ideology in Covenant Theology.

245
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,750
Yahweh,
he alone is the king.

246
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:57,710
He's got a direct suzerain vassal
relationship with the people.

247
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,700
So Israel is the subject
of Covenant Theology. Um,

248
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,210
the Covenant Theology therefore implies,

249
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,780
implies almost automatically as
somewhat negative view of the monarchy.

250
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,730
And that's what we've
seen here and there in a,

251
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:14,720
in the book of judges and in
Samuel monarchy is at best,

252
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:18,230
unnecessary,
and at worst it's a rejection of God.

253
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,270
Nevertheless, despite that
resistance or that critique monarchy,

254
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,250
kingship is established in Israel,

255
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:30,490
and 11 cents sees the royal ideology that
developed to support this institution

256
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,400
as a major revolution in the
structure of the religion of Israel,

257
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:39,830
where the Synetic covenant was
contracted between God and the nation.

258
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,990
The davidic covenant is contracted between
God and a single individual. The king,

259
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,030
the Covenant with David. Um,
another scholar, Moshe Weinfeld,

260
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,100
who I've mentioned before as well.
Um,

261
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,170
he describes the Covenant With
David as a covenant of grant.

262
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,680
This is a form that we find
in the ancient near eastern,

263
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,210
in the ancient near east. Also, it's a,

264
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,170
it's a grant of a reward
for loyal service and deeds.

265
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,910
And so God rewards David with
the gift of an unending dynasty.

266
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,900
It's a covenant of grantee grants him
this unending dynasty in exchange for his

267
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:12,734
loyalty.

268
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,630
And the contrast with the Covenant
at Sinai is very clear where Israel's

269
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:19,970
covenant with God at Sinai
had been conditional.

270
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:23,870
It's premised on the observance of
God's Torah. If there's violation,

271
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:28,460
then God will uproot the Israelites and
throw them out of the land. All right.

272
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:29,570
The covenant with David.

273
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:34,571
By contrast with his dynastic house and
by implication with David City and and,

274
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:36,620
and the Temple of Top Mountain Zion,

275
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,950
that covenant will be
maintained under all conditions.

276
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:43,340
Remember the passage that we read,
if Nathan's prophecy last time?

277
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,210
So the royal ideology fostered
a belief in some quarters,

278
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,440
and we'll see this in the next few weeks,
a belief in the inviolability,

279
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:55,880
the impregnable nature
of David's house dynasty,

280
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,930
the city itself, the chosen city,
the sacred mountain, the temple.

281
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:02,570
We'll return to this
idea in later lectures.

282
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,910
So you have this deep tension lining
up Israel's covenant at Mount Sinai,

283
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:12,410
which is conditional on the one
hand with God's covenant with David,

284
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:16,820
which is centered on the temple and
Palace Complex at Mount Zion and which is

285
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,110
unconditional and permanent.

286
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Scholars have tried to account for these
two strands of tradition in biblical

287
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,720
literature in different ways.

288
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,400
The Covenant Theology with its emphasis
on the conditional covenant with Moses,

289
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:32,600
I'm contracted at Sinai,

290
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:36,470
the royal ideology and its emphasis on
the unconditional covenant with David

291
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:39,770
focused on Mount Sinai on one
explanation is chronological.

292
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:44,210
That early traditions were centered
around the Sinai Event and the Covenant

293
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:47,690
Theology. They emphasize that
aspect of the relationship with God.

294
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:51,510
And later traditions under the
monarchy emphasize royal ideology.

295
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,130
Another explanation is geographical.
The northern kingdom,

296
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,310
which if you'll recall,
and we'll talk about in a moment,

297
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,040
the northern kingdom is going to
break away from the southern kingdom.

298
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,260
David [inaudible] will not
rule in the northern kingdom.

299
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,870
So the assumption is that
the northern kingdom,

300
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:11,220
which rejected the house of
David, they de emphasize, um,

301
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,940
royal ideology that end, it's focused
on Zion and the house of David.

302
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,350
And they emphasize cut the Old Covenant
Theology and the Sinai Theology by

303
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:23,470
contrast, the southern kingdom, uh, in
which a member of the House of David, uh,

304
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,680
you know, range, right?
Until the destruction.

305
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:30,870
The Southern Kingdom emphasized Zion
and its attendant royal ideology. Well,

306
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,210
Levenson rejects both
of these explanations.

307
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:36,390
He says the difference isn't that
one is early in, one is late.

308
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:40,020
It isn't that one is northern
and one is southern. We find, um,

309
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,560
the Sinai and the Xi'an Traditions
in early texts and late texts.

310
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:47,010
We find them in northern tech sentence.
Southern texts in the south.

311
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,740
David's house was
criticized just as roundly.

312
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:54,240
It was as it was criticized in the north
and emphasis was placed on the Sinai

313
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,900
Covenant over against the Royal Ideology
in the south as well as in the north.

314
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,870
So the two traditions he
said coexisted side by side.

315
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:04,740
They stood in a dialectic tension with
one another in Israel and eventually they

316
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:07,260
would come to be coordinated
and work together.

317
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,360
We'll see that more towards
the end of the lecture,

318
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,720
but he says the Xeon ideology will take
on some of the aspects of the legacy of

319
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:17,244
Sinai.

320
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,170
Mount Zion will soon be associated with
the site of God's [inaudible] or self

321
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:26,370
revelation. It will become a kind of
Sinai now permanently in Jerusalem.

322
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,280
It would become the site
of Covenant Renewal.

323
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,250
It will be seen as the place
where Torah goes forth.

324
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,830
And that's an idea of course,
originally associated with Sinai.

325
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:37,530
That's where it God's
instruction or Torah went first.

326
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,610
But all of these features will be
collapsed or telescoped are brought into a

327
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,680
Mount Zion and the temple complex.

328
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:49,140
But eventually he says it's not simply
that the Sinai Covenant Theology was

329
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:54,141
absorbed into Royal Ideology and Mount
Zion because the entitlement of the house

330
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:59,631
of David will eventually
be made contingent on the
observant on the observance

331
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:00,690
of God's Torah.

332
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,790
The king himself we will see is not
exempt from the Covenant Conditions Set at

333
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:10,791
Sinai and even though he would never
be completely deposed for violating the

334
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:14,370
Synetic covenant,
he will be punished for his violations.

335
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,130
The two will work in tandem.
It's an idea that will return to,

336
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:20,400
we'll see it more clearly
as we get towards the end of
this lecture, but for now,

337
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:23,280
keep in mind that the two are going to
be held intention and work together to

338
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:25,320
check one another.
Now,

339
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:30,321
David's son Solomon is given mixed
reviews by the Deuteronomistic historian.

340
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,700
He ascends to the throne through entry
cause I said there's really no indication

341
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:39,900
of a divine choice or approval,
but he said to reign over a golden age.

342
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,230
His kingdom is said to stretch
from Egypt to the Euphrates.

343
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:47,440
He made political alliances and economical
economic alliances throughout the

344
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:50,110
region. He would seal these
alliances with marriages.

345
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:51,460
He married the daughter of Pharaoh.

346
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:54,700
He married the daughter of the king
of tire and Phoenicia and so on.

347
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,810
The text claims that he built a
daunting military establishment.

348
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,300
He put a wall around Jerusalem. They
were fortified cities. Um, Hud sore,

349
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,030
McGee doe guesser. These were
basis for his professional army.

350
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,120
It's said that the army featured a
very expensive chariot force. Um,

351
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,970
he also had accomplishments in
the realms of industry and trade.

352
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,680
He exploited Israel's natural position,
straddling the north south, uh,

353
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:25,720
trade routes and, uh, was able to bring
great wealth to the state in that way.

354
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,880
The daily supplies that were needed to
maintain Solomon's very lavish court are

355
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:32,620
detailed in first kings.

356
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,100
So it seems to have been an
extraordinarily elaborate court.

357
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,290
He developed a merchant fleet.

358
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:42,320
He seemed to work closely
with the Phoenicians and the
Phoenician King Hiram and

359
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,870
developing a merchant fleet and exploited
trade routes through the Red Sea.

360
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,000
All sorts of exotic products are listed
as coming in to Jerusalem from Arabia

361
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:53,380
and the African coast.

362
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,680
We have the famous story of the
visit of the Queen of Sheba.

363
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,630
This could possibly be a
subbie and territory and
South Arabia and there may be

364
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:02,860
some basis,
in fact,

365
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,800
given these trade routes and how
well traveled they were at this time.

366
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,930
And of course he's known for his
magnificent building operations. Um,

367
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,310
many scholars assume that given
this tremendous wealth, um,

368
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,430
this would have been a time for the
flowering, a flowering of the arts.

369
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:23,080
And so it's often been maintained that
this would have been the time for the

370
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:24,820
early traditions,
biblical traditions,

371
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,920
early traditions of the
nation to be recorded.

372
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:30,970
Perhaps the J source people date it to
the 10th century, the time of Solomon.

373
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,790
But we should be a little skeptical of
this grand picture because archeologists

374
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:41,050
have found that Jerusalem was a
small town. It was a very small town,

375
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:43,420
really until the end
of the eighth century.

376
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,260
Suddenly it absorbed many refugees
from the fall of the northern kingdom.

377
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,530
Remember, Israel is going to
be, uh, destroyed and seven 22.

378
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:54,580
So refugees fleeing southward
will greatly expand your Islam.

379
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,320
We have our archeological
evidence of that,

380
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,810
but there are very few material remains
that a tests to a fabulous empire on the

381
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:06,400
scale that's suggested by the biblical
text had sore Mojito and guest.

382
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:10,120
They're the three places that are
mentioned as fortified military basis.

383
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,770
These have been excavated.

384
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:16,600
They do show some great gateways and
some large chambers, even some stables,

385
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:21,910
but archeologists differ radically
over the d the dating of um,

386
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,800
of these layers. Some date them to the
time of Solomon. Some see it as later. Um,

387
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:32,430
most concur that Israel was probably at
this time the most important power in

388
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:34,204
its region,

389
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,160
but still it would have been small and
relatively insignificant compared to the

390
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:40,390
Egypt or Mesopotamia.

391
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:43,540
Some of the great civilizations at
either end of the Fertile Crescent,

392
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,060
but it would have been the most important
state in that area and probably was

393
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:50,630
able to have some dominance over
some neighboring areas as well.

394
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:55,790
I just want to mention three things about
Solomon thinks that he's noted for, uh,

395
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:59,000
one is that he's praised for
his wisdom and because again,

396
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:00,980
the digital texts praises
him for his wisdom.

397
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,210
Later tradition will find it convenient
to attribute the book of proverbs to him

398
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,650
as well as the book of
Ecclesiastes. These, uh,

399
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:11,120
these are two works that belonged to
the genre of wisdom literature we'll be

400
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:14,000
talking about later in the semester.
Second,

401
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:16,250
in addition to being
praised for his wisdom,

402
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,620
he's praised for constructing the temple.
And in fact, the primary focus of,

403
00:24:20,621 --> 00:24:24,410
of all of the biblical material with
the Biblical story of Solomon is the

404
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:29,411
building of the temple of the dedication
of this temple for the Ark of the

405
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,690
Covenant in Jerusalem. He continued
the close association of, of um,

406
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,420
of the cult and the monarchy,

407
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:42,410
the religious and political leadership
by constructing this magnificent new

408
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:45,580
Tampa within the palace,
the palace complex. Um,

409
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,810
and he himself appointed to high priest.

410
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:52,670
So the juxtaposition of the house of
the king and the house of the Deity on

411
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,910
Mount Scion was quite deliberate.
And this hill,

412
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,610
even though geographically
it's very small,

413
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,640
becomes in the mythic
imagination of Israel.

414
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:05,410
This towering and Impregnable Mountain,
uh,

415
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,290
11 sin again,
um,

416
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,400
argues that Xi'an came eventually to take
on the features of the cosmic mountain

417
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:18,260
on the cosmic mountain is a mythic symbol
that we find in the ancient near east.

418
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,120
Um,
the cosmic mountain has these,

419
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:25,121
these powers are potencies
that are universal and
infinite and we find it in the

420
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:30,500
religion of Israel as well. Specifically
in connection with Mount Zion.

421
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,180
The cosmic mountain in ancient tradition
was understood to be the meeting place

422
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:38,720
of the gods, like a Mount Olympus,
for example, as a cosmic mountain.

423
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,870
But it was also understood
to be the axis Mundi.

424
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:46,871
That is to say the juncture or the point
of junction between heaven and earth,

425
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:49,610
the meeting place of heaven and earth,
right.

426
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:54,560
The access around which these worlds
met or were conjoined in Canaan, um,

427
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:59,300
in Canaanite religion, the mountain of
bow, which is known as Mount soft phone,

428
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,730
was conceived precisely in this manner.

429
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,650
And Levinson points out tremendous
commonalities of language and concept,

430
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,910
um, in, um, in connection
with the mountain of bowel,

431
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,650
the mountain of El and the
mountain of yogic way. In fact,

432
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,160
the word soft phone mounts,

433
00:26:14,161 --> 00:26:18,200
a phone is used to describe God's
mountain in the Bible in one particular,

434
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,820
in one particular passage.

435
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:24,590
So the temple on Mount Zion came
to be understood as sacred space,

436
00:26:24,591 --> 00:26:26,750
much like the cosmic
mountains of other traditions.

437
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,770
It's described as a kind of paradise,
sometimes almost a garden of Eden.

438
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,460
It's described as the place from
which the entire world was created.

439
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:38,060
It's also viewed as a kind
of epitome of the world,

440
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:41,960
a kind of microcosm entirely an
entire microcosm of the world.

441
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,710
It's also seen as the earthly
manifestation of a heavenly temple.

442
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,270
The temple came to represent
an ideal and sacred realm,

443
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,750
and we also see it as the
object of intense longing.

444
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:57,600
Many of the psalms will
express intense longing.

445
00:26:57,601 --> 00:27:02,040
If I could just sit in the temple, if
I could just be in that, that space,

446
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,030
that sacred space.

447
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:08,031
We see it in the psalms in
a passage describing the
dedication of the temples is

448
00:27:08,301 --> 00:27:13,301
in first kings eight Salomon explains
that the temple is a place where people

449
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:18,570
have access to God. They can petition to
him and they can atone for their sins.

450
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,850
It is a house of prayer he says,

451
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:25,620
and it remained the central focal point
of Israelite worship per centuries.

452
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,290
So his great wisdom, his great
virtue in constructing the temple,

453
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,270
not withstanding Solomon,
is very sharply criticized for,

454
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,310
among other things, his
foreign worship. Um,

455
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:44,330
his new palace complex had a tremendous
amount of room for his Harem,

456
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,760
which is said to have included 700 wives.

457
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,620
Many of them were foreign princesses.

458
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:53,880
Many of them would have been acquired
to seel political alliances or business

459
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,980
alliances, noble, noble women,

460
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:01,530
700 wives and 300 concubines,
as well as various officials and servants.

461
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,960
Now of course these numbers
are likely exaggerated,

462
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:08,990
but Solomon's diplomatic alliances
likely necessitated unions that would of

463
00:28:09,841 --> 00:28:13,020
course have been condemned by
the Deuteronomistic historian.

464
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:16,530
He is said to have loved
women from foreign women,

465
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:18,330
from the nations that God had forbid,

466
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,750
and he succumb to the worship
of their gods and goddesses,

467
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:26,130
which is really the key point. I mean the
whole fear of, of uh, foreign spouses,

468
00:28:26,131 --> 00:28:29,820
that one will be led to or we'll
support the worship of foreign deities.

469
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:34,740
And so Solomon is said to
have built temples for Moabite
gods and ammonite gods.

470
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,030
Um,

471
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:41,030
this all may point to a general tolerance
for different cults in Jerusalem in

472
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:43,350
the 10th century.
And in the ninth century.

473
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,670
This may not have been an issue in
Jerusalem in the 10th and ninth century,

474
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,000
but it's an issue for the
later Deuteronomistic editor.

475
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,400
They have no tolerance before this.

476
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:58,560
So Solomon's primary flaw in the
Deuteronomistic historian's view is his

477
00:28:58,561 --> 00:28:59,394
syncretism,

478
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,390
which is prompted by his marriages to
these foreign women who brought their

479
00:29:03,391 --> 00:29:08,070
native cults to Jerusalem.
His religious infidelity is,

480
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:09,150
is um,

481
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,870
the cause is said to be the cause of
the severe problems and ultimately the

482
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:17,871
division of the kingdom that will follow
upon his death in order to support this

483
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:20,820
tremendous court. Um, and,

484
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:24,480
and Harem as well as the
army and the bureaucracy.

485
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,680
Solomon did introduced heavy taxation
as well as the core VA, which is, uh,

486
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,790
forced labor or required
labor on state projects.

487
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,690
So you have this developing
urban structure complex,

488
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:41,340
developing bureaucratic urban structure
that's now being super imposed,

489
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,480
the agricultural life.
Um,

490
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,010
and that leads to all sorts of class
distinctions and class divisions between

491
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,280
officials, bureaucrats, um, merchants,

492
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,650
large scale land owners
who were prospering,

493
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:58,000
perhaps smaller farmers and shepherds
who are living at more of a subsistence

494
00:29:58,001 --> 00:30:02,200
level. So you have divisions between
town and country, between rich and poor.

495
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,320
And this is a great change from the
ideals of the tribal democracy. Uh,

496
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,210
some of the ideals that some of you
looked at when we were talking about legal

497
00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:14,200
texts where there seem to be these
economic blueprints for bringing about

498
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,070
economic, um, equivalents
through sabbatical,

499
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:21,880
years and jubilee years and so on.
In short,

500
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,940
the list of social and economic ills
that were enumerated by Samuel in first

501
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:28,990
Samuel Chapter Eight,

502
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:31,930
when he was trying to persuade the
people from establishing a monarchy,

503
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,280
that list of ills, you'll have a
standing army, military, a standing army,

504
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:38,560
you'll have to support,
you'll have to do labor for this date.

505
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,680
You're going to have all kinds
of taxes and special levies.

506
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,490
You're going to be virtually and slaved.

507
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,010
Many of these things seem
to have been realized.

508
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,580
The Deuteronomistic historian would like
us to believe in the reign of Solomon.

509
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,410
Moreover, as we've already seen, um,

510
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:57,040
the very institution of monarchy itself
didn't sit well in some quarters because

511
00:30:57,041 --> 00:31:00,610
centralized leadership under a human
king seem to go against the older

512
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:04,420
traditions of Hebrew Tribal Society,
United by Covenant with God,

513
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:09,310
guided by priests, profits, a occasional
judges inspired charismatically.

514
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:14,040
So already before Solomon's death,
the northern tribes were, uh,

515
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,390
feeling some alienation
from the house of David.

516
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,990
They're resenting what they
perceive to be Salomons tyranny.

517
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,010
So let me give you a brief timeline of
what happens from the death of Solomon

518
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,460
down to the destruction. And I'm one
of the earlier handouts I gave you.

519
00:31:27,461 --> 00:31:29,830
There is a list of the
king's north and south.

520
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,560
This is not something you need to memorize
and I'm certainly not going to stress

521
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:35,140
it, but if you kind of
want to keep score, that's,

522
00:31:35,141 --> 00:31:37,060
that's a list that you can refer to.

523
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,510
So when Solomon died in nine 22,

524
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,950
the structure that had been erected by
David and Solomon fell into these two

525
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:48,070
rival states, and neither of them, of
course, it's going to be very strong.

526
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:52,420
You have the northern Kingdom of Israel
and the southern kingdom referred to as

527
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:56,290
Judah, each with its own king,
right? Jeroboam in the north,

528
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,130
Rehoboam in the south. Sometimes they're
going to be at war with one another,

529
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:03,370
sometimes they're going to work
in alliance with one another. Um,

530
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:08,350
but 200 years later, right from nine 22
down to seven, 20 to 200 years later,

531
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,830
the northern kingdom of Israel
will fall to the Assyrian Empire.

532
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,920
The Assyrians come down to the border of
the southern kingdom to Judah and Judah

533
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:21,070
remains viable,
but it is reduced to a vassal status.

534
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,310
It is tributary to this new world power.
Finally,

535
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:27,760
Judah will be destroyed about 150 years
later. Okay, about five [inaudible] seven,

536
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:31,930
five 86 the Babylonians, right?
The Neo Babylonian Empire,

537
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:36,220
they have conquered the Assyrians and
they assume control over the ancient near

538
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:40,490
east and take the southern kingdom.
Now, the story of the northern kingdom,

539
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Israel that's presented in kings is
colored by a Judy and perspective,

540
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:48,140
and it is highly negative
and highly polemical.

541
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,740
So Solomon was succeeded
by his son Rehoboam,

542
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,930
but the 10 tribes of
the north, um, revolted.

543
00:32:56,931 --> 00:33:00,200
When he refused to
relieve their tax burden,

544
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:03,020
they came to him and asked if they could
have some relief and he answered them

545
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:04,940
very harshly.
So they revolted.

546
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,780
And a separate kingdom was set up under
the rule of the Israelite Jeroboam

547
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,510
towards it just till the
end of the 10th century.

548
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:15,620
So divided now into these two kingdoms,
they began to lose power,

549
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:19,130
probably losing any control they may
have had over outlying territories.

550
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,940
So let's focus first on the
northern kingdom of Israel.

551
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:28,280
The area was more divided by tribal
rivalries and religious traditions.

552
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:30,350
Then Judah,
you have 10 tribes in that region.

553
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,890
Gera bomb didn't seem to be able
to establish a very stable rule.

554
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:39,280
First Kings 12 tells us of Jeroboam
effort to break the connection with the

555
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:43,670
traditional religious center
of Jerusalem in the south.

556
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,030
He establishes his own
government at chef come.

557
00:33:47,031 --> 00:33:50,300
And that was a place that was
already revered in Hebrew tradition.

558
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:53,150
This is where we have the Covenant
Renewal Ceremony by Joshua.

559
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:54,830
So it's already a somewhat sacred site.

560
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,230
So he establishes his
capital and check them.

561
00:33:57,231 --> 00:34:00,530
And then he establishes Royal Shrines,
one in the southern part of,

562
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:04,640
of Israel and one in the northern part
of Israel, right on each of the borders,

563
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:08,120
north and south of the
kingdom in Dan and Bethel,

564
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:09,770
Bethel on the south and Dan and the north,

565
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,850
a golden calf is placed in each
shrine according to the text.

566
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:18,890
And this is viewed by the Deuteronomistic
historian as a terrible sin. Indeed,

567
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:22,940
the story is written in a manner that
deliberately echoes the story of the

568
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:26,480
golden calf that was made
by Aaron and Exodus 32.

569
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,430
There are linguistic echoes, um, uh,

570
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,230
that make it very clear that we
are supposed to view this as a sin,

571
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:34,880
as great as the sin of Aaron.

572
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,290
It may well be that if
Jeroboam did in fact do this,

573
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:43,280
that he was a good ya'll list and was
just trying to establish alternate

574
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:47,090
sanctuaries for Galloway Way,
um, that would rival Jerusalem's.

575
00:34:47,091 --> 00:34:51,680
But the Deuteronomistic historian
wants to see this, um, in as,

576
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:53,330
as another instance of,

577
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,860
of idolatry and therefore deliberately
echoes the primordial cultic sin of the

578
00:34:57,861 --> 00:35:01,070
golden calves when talking
about Jarrow bombs activity.

579
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,090
It brands his cultic center
as illegitimate idolatry.

580
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,740
Jeroboam is represented by the biblical
writer as having made unacceptable

581
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:12,410
concessions to Canaanite
practices of worship.

582
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:17,330
And so he is criticized for
this despite his best efforts,

583
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:20,810
his kingship is a fairly
unstable and in fact,

584
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,440
in the 200 year history of the kingdom,
the northern Kingdom of Israel,

585
00:35:24,441 --> 00:35:27,530
we will have seven different
dynasties occupying the throne.

586
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,870
There was great miss material,
prosperity in the northern kingdom. Um,

587
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,210
I've just picked out a
few kings to highlight.

588
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:37,710
So these are not to be understood
to be necessarily in order.

589
00:35:37,711 --> 00:35:40,580
I've just picked out a few highlights,
but I'm,

590
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:45,590
the rule of armory was a time of some
much material prosperity and his son Ahab

591
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,970
Ahab was sort of the first
part of the ninth century.

592
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,710
Amari is an interesting person because
he's the first king from either kingdom

593
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:56,810
to be mentioned in sources
outside the Bible. We have, um,

594
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,270
a large stone referred to as the
Moabite stone and this stone,

595
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:04,800
which boasts of a military defeat,
um, there's the boast that, um,

596
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,810
uh,
Omri of Israel was defeated.

597
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:12,720
Omri bought and fortified Samarria as
the capital of the northern Kingdom of

598
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,651
Israel.

599
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:17,550
And archeology does reveal that this
was in fact quite a magnificent city at

600
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:22,110
this time. But again, the Deuteronomistic
editors are going to judge him as evil.

601
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:26,580
He's disobeyed God.
His son Ahab also comes in for bad press.

602
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,800
Ahab is also mentioned outside the Bible.

603
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:32,650
We have an inscription of an
Assyrian king who describes, um,

604
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:37,560
a coalition of Israelites and Aramaeans
who fought against the Assyrians.

605
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,960
And Ahab is mentioned in that inscription.

606
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,880
Omri and Ahab were clearly very
powerful and influential and the region,

607
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:46,800
they're even mentioned outside the Bible.

608
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:51,690
Ahab and his Phoenician wife Jezza
bell seem to have established a very

609
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:55,770
extravagant court life in the
capital of area. And for this,

610
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:58,920
they're also going to be condemned
by the Deuteronomistic editors.

611
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,020
Jessebelle what's Phoenician?

612
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:06,260
And when Jezza bail tried to establish
the worship of her Phoenecian Baal as the

613
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:09,870
official cult of Israel and
she built a temple to buy.

614
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,510
I'll in some area the prophets,

615
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:16,980
Elijah and Elisha preach a kind
of holy war against the monarchy.

616
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,700
And we're going to come back to these
very zealous Yahweh only profits of the

617
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:24,960
north. When we talk about
prophecy next time, um,

618
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:29,310
it had been Jessebelle meet a very tragic
end and there will be a military coup,

619
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,380
military coup led by an army
general Jay who in about eight 42.

620
00:37:34,381 --> 00:37:36,840
These are all kind of
approximate year as you know,

621
00:37:36,841 --> 00:37:39,930
that you'll different books we'll give
them, they'll defer by five years,

622
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:40,561
one way or the other.

623
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:44,520
But it's our best effort at reconstructing
things based on some of these outside

624
00:37:44,521 --> 00:37:48,270
extra biblical references that give us
a firm date and then we can kind of work

625
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:50,670
around those.
So the army general Jay,

626
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:54,090
who in about eight 42 led a military coup.

627
00:37:54,091 --> 00:37:56,560
He was anointed king
by the Prophet Elijah,

628
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,880
and he had a very bloody
revenge on decibel decibel.

629
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,780
And the priests of Baal were
all slaughtered. The text says,

630
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,320
as was as well as every
worshiper of bowel in some area,

631
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:10,950
they were all slaughtered
by the eighth century.

632
00:38:10,951 --> 00:38:15,060
You have the newest Syrian
empire on the rise. And in seven,

633
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:20,061
22 of the Assyrian King Sargon reduced
Israel to the status of a province.

634
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,880
And we have an inscription by Sargon that
confirms the Biblical report that this

635
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:29,460
defeat. And in this
inscription, Sargon says,

636
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:35,150
I besieged and conquered Sumeria led
away as booty 27,290 inhabitance of it.

637
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,420
The town I rebuilt better than it was
before and settled there in people from

638
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:44,710
countries which I myself had conquered.
So population trends transplanting,

639
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,760
I placed an officer of mine, has
governor over them and imposed upon them.

640
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:51,580
Tribute as is customary
for a Syrian citizens.

641
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:56,320
So there's a basic agreement between
this and the biblical account. Uh,

642
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,570
many of the governing class,
the wealthy merchants,

643
00:38:58,571 --> 00:39:03,250
many tens of thousands in all were carried
off to northern Mesopotamia and they

644
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:06,370
were lost to history.
These are the 10 lost tribes of Israel.

645
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,840
There would have remained behind
some Hebrew farmers and shepherds.

646
00:39:10,841 --> 00:39:12,460
They would have continued their old ways,

647
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,410
but as was consistent with their policy,
the in Syria,

648
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:20,350
the Assyrians imported new peoples to
repopulate this area and to break up any

649
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:22,470
local resistance to their rule.
Um,

650
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,060
and this would then become
the province of Symeria.

651
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:30,340
And this ethnically mixed group would
practice a form of Israelite religion,

652
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,820
but the Deuteronomistic editor
does not view it as legitimate.

653
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:39,150
And ultimately these Samaritans were
going to be despised by the Jews of the

654
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,870
southern kingdom,
the Jews of Judah.

655
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,390
They were seen as foreign
corruptors of the faith.

656
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,080
They were always ready to assist
Judah's enemies against Judah.

657
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:48,820
So they felt very little kinship.
And,

658
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:52,000
and very often the Samaritans would
join against those attacking Judah.

659
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:57,040
So there was tremendous rivalry between
the Jews of Judah and, um, the Samaritans,

660
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,390
hence the New Testament story. Makes
Sense, right? This is a hated person.

661
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:02,290
This good Samaritan.

662
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,990
So if we turn our attention now
to the southern Kingdom of Judah,

663
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:13,470
Judah comprised the two was comprised
of the two remaining tribes of Judah and

664
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:18,040
Benjamin. And it enjoyed internal
stability. For the most part,

665
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:21,820
it remained loyal to the house
of David ruling in Jerusalem.

666
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:26,710
Shortly after Israel fail fell
and seven 22 to the Assyrians,

667
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:31,330
the Judah Heights, who's king at
that time was king, has a Kia, right?

668
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:35,200
So the king king has a Kia,
had to agree to terms with a Syria.

669
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,040
They became sort of subject allies or,
or vassals of Assyria.

670
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:41,920
But Hezekiah began to
prepare for rebellion,

671
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,410
began to make alliances with neighbors.

672
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,940
And this prompted the Assyrians to
march in and lay siege to Jerusalem.

673
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:51,400
This would have happened about 701.

674
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,630
And this siege is described
in a Syrian sources.

675
00:40:55,631 --> 00:41:00,220
So we have independent, um, uh,
records of this from a Syrian sources.

676
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:04,240
We read there as to Hezekiah,
the Jew of you,

677
00:41:04,241 --> 00:41:07,120
of you who'd write the Jew.
He did not submit to my yoke.

678
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:11,770
I laid siege to 46 of his strong
cities, walled forts, et cetera.

679
00:41:11,771 --> 00:41:15,550
I drove out 200,150 people himself.

680
00:41:15,551 --> 00:41:20,170
I made prisoner in Jerusalem, his
royal residence, like a bird in a cage,

681
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,780
but eventually these Syrians
actually withdrew the siege.

682
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,010
Judah was able to withstand the
siege to preserve their own kingship.

683
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:32,200
The Assyrian Empire is going to fall in
six 12 this is the fall of Nineveh you

684
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:36,140
may have heard of at some point, and
they will fall to the rising Babylonians,

685
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:37,640
the neo Babylonian Empire.

686
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:42,860
It's the neo Babylonian Empire that will
succeed in felling Judah under new book

687
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:47,861
had Red Sir of Babylon in five 87 or
five 86 the walls of Jerusalem are

688
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:50,900
dismantled.
Many members of the governing classes,

689
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,620
wealthier classes are going to be
carried off into exile in Babylonia,

690
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:00,050
and that the Hebrews didn't fade into
oblivion after the loss of political

691
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:05,051
independence and their geographical
base is due in large part to the

692
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:09,500
interpretation of events provided
by the Deuteronomistic school.

693
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,670
So we need to talk a little bit about
that ideology and why it had historical

694
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:17,030
effect that it had.
As I mentioned before,

695
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,990
Deuteronomy isn't just the capstone of
the pentose doot Pentatonix narrative.

696
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:24,020
It's also the first part of
a longer literary history.

697
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,740
Martin note was a German scholar
who first argued for this,

698
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:32,120
argued that the composition and
authorship of Deuteronomy has great,

699
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:37,100
um, has more in common with what follows
in some sense then what precedes it.

700
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,610
Uh, and he argued that we should
understand this to be a unit,

701
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,580
the product of a particular school.
Um,

702
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:48,940
since this Deuteronomistic
school is looking back at
the history of Israel up to

703
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:55,361
and including the defeat and exile of
the Israelites and five 87 or five 86,

704
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,740
the final form of the work
of the Deuteronomistic
school, the final form must,

705
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:05,210
must be posting silly post five
86. Um, but there are of course,

706
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:09,290
various layers within that larger work
that we can't really date with precision.

707
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:15,310
I just want to say something about the
scholarly methodology that led to the

708
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:18,830
conclusion that there is such a
thing as the Deuteronomistic school.

709
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,920
And that method is redaction criticism.

710
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:26,210
And we've already discussed the goals
and the methods of other types of

711
00:43:26,211 --> 00:43:29,270
criticism,
source criticism or historical criticism.

712
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,990
We've talked a little bit about form
criticism and tradition criticism,

713
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:38,590
but redaction criticism grew out of a
kind of weariness with some of these other

714
00:43:38,751 --> 00:43:40,430
forms of biblical criticism.

715
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:45,580
And they're constant fragmentation of
the biblical text into older sources or

716
00:43:45,651 --> 00:43:48,710
into older genres or into
older units of tradition.

717
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,050
In order to map out a history
of Israelite religion.

718
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:59,410
And these other methods seem to pay
very little attention to the text in its

719
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:03,140
final form and the process by which
the texts reached its final form.

720
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:08,560
So redaction criticism rejects the
idea that the person or the persons who

721
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:11,920
compiled the texts from earlier sources,
um,

722
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:17,360
did a somewhat mechanical scissors and
paste job didn't really think too much

723
00:44:17,361 --> 00:44:20,270
about the effect. Um, they were
creating by putting things together,

724
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,310
redaction criticism assumes
and focuses on identifying, um,

725
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,630
the purpose and the plan behind the
final form of the assembled sources.

726
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,010
They want to uncover.

727
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,590
It's a method that wants to uncover the
intention of the person or the persons

728
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:38,310
who produced the biblical texts in
roughly the shape that we have at and what

729
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:41,820
was intended by they're producing
it in the shape that we have.

730
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,850
So redaction criticism
proceeds along these lines.

731
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:48,750
And this is how at first developed
first you can usually identify linking

732
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:49,531
passages.

733
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:54,360
That is to say passages that kind of join
narrative to narrative or unit to unit

734
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:59,310
in an attempt to make the text read more
smoothly or just to ease the transition

735
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:00,450
from one source to another.

736
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:06,000
And these linking passages are assigned
to our for redactor, right? Um,

737
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:11,060
also assigned to our are any interpretive
passages that means passages that

738
00:45:11,401 --> 00:45:15,270
stand back to comment on the text
or interpret the text in Sunway.

739
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,480
Any place where the narrator
turns to direct the,

740
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,870
to directly address the audience.
So for example,

741
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:26,850
when you have a burst in which the
narrator turns and says that was when the

742
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:28,380
Canaanites were still in the land,

743
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,100
that would seem to be from the hand of
a redactor putting the sources together.

744
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,450
When you have an ed illogical comment
that is to say a comment of the type that,

745
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,340
and that is why the Israelites do such
and such a ritual observance to this day,

746
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:41,850
right?

747
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:46,530
That also seems to be written from the
perspective of a compiler of sources.

748
00:45:46,531 --> 00:45:48,510
Someone who's putting the text together.

749
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,960
There are also some passages that indicate
or justify or otherwise comment on

750
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:59,610
what's about to occur or passages that
summarize and offer an interpretation or

751
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:04,440
justification of what has just happened.
We'll see that in second kings 17.

752
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,510
We also saw that in the book of judges,

753
00:46:06,511 --> 00:46:09,720
we had this perspective summary
saying this is what's going to happen.

754
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:12,540
There's going to be sin. They're going
to cry out. There'll be, you know,

755
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:13,920
God will raise up someone,

756
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:16,080
they'll deliver them and then they're
going to fall back into sin again.

757
00:46:16,081 --> 00:46:18,390
So these are comments that are um,

758
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,760
looking forward to tell us
what it is we're about to read.

759
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:26,030
And if you join all of all such passages
together and assign them to are,

760
00:46:26,311 --> 00:46:30,300
you very often find that there are
tremendous stylistic similarities in these

761
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:30,960
passages.

762
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,110
They use the same rhetoric over and over
again or you'll see the same point of

763
00:46:34,111 --> 00:46:35,140
view.
Um,

764
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:39,030
and it's very often a point of view
that isn't in the source materials that

765
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:40,440
they're,
that they're linking together.

766
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,670
And this is how one arrives
at some understanding of
the role of the redactor in

767
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:46,110
the final production of the text,

768
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:49,650
how the redactor has framed
our understanding of the
source materials that he

769
00:46:49,651 --> 00:46:54,360
has gathered and the Deuteronomistic
historian who's responsible for the

770
00:46:54,361 --> 00:46:56,760
reduction of Deuteronomy,
Joshua judges.

771
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,960
And so first and second Samuel First
and second kings provides not just a

772
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:04,470
history in the sense of
documenting events as they occur,

773
00:47:04,471 --> 00:47:07,020
as if there's ever documentation
without interpretation,

774
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,620
but provides a strong interpretation
of history, of philosophy,

775
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:14,730
of history is trying to ascertain
the meaning of events, the largest,

776
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:18,420
the larger purpose and design something
we've called a historiography.

777
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:22,500
And we find the Deuteronomistic
interpretation of Israel's history in the

778
00:47:22,501 --> 00:47:24,000
preface to the book of Deuteronomy.

779
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,770
We find it in editorial comments that
are sort of peppered throughout Joshua

780
00:47:28,771 --> 00:47:29,604
through kings.

781
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:34,720
And we especially find it in the summary
of the entire unit that is contained in

782
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:38,710
second kings 17 before
we read that passage,

783
00:47:38,711 --> 00:47:42,430
we need to think about what it was that
prompted the deuteronomist to adopt a

784
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:45,580
particular interpretation of
Israel's historical record.

785
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:51,220
The Deuteronomistic historian was
attempting to respond to the first major

786
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:55,900
historical challenge to confront the
Israelite people and the Hebrew religion.

787
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,990
And that was the complete
collapse of the Israelite nation,

788
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:04,020
the destruction of God's sanctuary and
the defeat and exile of the people of the

789
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:05,440
Lord and God in history.

790
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:11,430
The calamitous events of seven 22 but
especially five 87 raised a critical

791
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:12,880
theological dilemma.

792
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:17,440
God had promised the Patriarchs and
their descendants that they would live in

793
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:20,530
his land. He had promised that the
house of David would stand forever,

794
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:22,510
but here at the monarchy had collapsed.

795
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,760
The people were defeated
and they were in exile.

796
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,600
So the challenge presented by this
twist of history was really twofold.

797
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,370
Is God the God of history? Is he
omnipotent? Is He capable of all?

798
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,260
Can he in fact impose an effect his will?
And if so, then what about his covenant?

799
00:48:38,261 --> 00:48:42,670
With the Patriarchs and his covenant with
David. Had He facelessly abandoned it.

800
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,670
Well,
that was unthinkable then.

801
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:49,420
If he hadn't facelessly abandoned his
covenant with his people and with David,

802
00:48:49,421 --> 00:48:54,280
he must not be the god of history,
the universal Lord of all.

803
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,080
He wasn't able to save his people.

804
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,850
Neither of these ideas was acceptable
to the Deuteronomistic school.

805
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:05,920
It was a fundamental tenant of Israelite
monotheism that God is at once the god

806
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:09,490
of history,
capable of all whose will is absolute,

807
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:10,960
whose promises are true,

808
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:15,670
and at the same time a god of faithfulness
who does not abandon his people.

809
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,710
He is both good and powerful.

810
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:22,930
So how could the disasters of seven
22 and five 86 be reconciled with the

811
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:27,070
conviction that God controlled history
and that he had an Eternal Covenant with

812
00:49:27,071 --> 00:49:30,450
the Patriarchs and with David?
The histories,

813
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:35,050
the history ossify of the Deuteronomistic
school is the response of one segment

814
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,670
of the Israelite community.

815
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,890
We'll see another response
when we turn to the profits.

816
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:43,990
But the basic idea of the Deuteronomistic
school is that God's unconditional and

817
00:49:43,991 --> 00:49:48,490
eternal covenants with the Patriarchs
and with David do not preclude the

818
00:49:48,491 --> 00:49:53,470
possibility of punishment or
chastisement for sin as specified in the

819
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:55,450
conditional mosaic covenant.

820
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:58,930
So you see how both ideas are going
to be important to hold and dialectic

821
00:49:58,931 --> 00:50:00,460
tension,
both theologies,

822
00:50:00,461 --> 00:50:03,250
the Covenant Theology as well as
the patriarchal and royal theology.

823
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:07,300
So this is because although God is
omnipotent, humans do have free will,

824
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:11,050
they can corrupt the divine plan.
So in the Deuteronomistic history,

825
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:15,720
the leaders of Israel are depicted as
having the choice of accepting God's way

826
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,650
or rejecting it.
God tries to help them.

827
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:21,850
He's constantly sending them profits who
yell at the kings and tell them what it

828
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:25,540
is God wants of them, but they continue
to make the wrong choice. They sin.

829
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:29,390
And ultimately that brings about fall
first of Israel and then of Judah.

830
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:34,640
And it's the idolatrous sins of the kings
that does it with the deposition and

831
00:50:34,641 --> 00:50:38,030
the execution of the last
Davidic King Zedekiah,

832
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:43,070
the Deuteronomistic school reinterpreted
the Davidic Covenant in conditional

833
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,860
terms on the model of the Sinai Covenant,

834
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:50,150
the Mosaic Covenant according to
which God's favor toward the king,

835
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,480
depends on the king's loyalty to God.
And in this way,

836
00:50:53,481 --> 00:50:58,040
the fall of the house of David could
be seen as justifiable punishment for

837
00:50:58,041 --> 00:51:01,460
disobedient kings and rulers like
Monash Shay. We'll come back to him.

838
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,590
Remember the Davidic covenant that Nathan,
uh, proclaimed in second Samuel seven,

839
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,070
explicitly said that God would
punish and chastises anointed.

840
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:13,910
That's what it means to be a son,
to receive correction, discipline,

841
00:51:13,911 --> 00:51:17,320
and punishment. I have to finish
this, these thoughts on, um,

842
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:21,740
on Monday and see if specifically how
they interpret it and understand the

843
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:24,710
history of what happened in a way
that enabled certain segments of the

844
00:51:24,711 --> 00:51:26,390
population to see this as in fact,

845
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:30,990
proof of God's strength
and faith faithfulness. Um,

846
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,570
and then we'll turn to prophesy on Monday.
