1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,100
You don't need me to tell you that
human civilization is very, very old.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,830
Nevertheless, our knowledge of the
earliest stages of human civilization,

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,140
we're quite limited for many centuries.

4
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:18,030
That is until the great
archeological discoveries of
the 19th and 20th centuries,

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,890
which unearthed for us the
great civilizations of the
ancient near east of which

6
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:27,610
I have drawn and remarkably lifelike
map here on the board, Mediterranean,

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,560
we start with the Mediterranean
Ocean, the Nile river, the Tigris,

8
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:35,940
and the Euphrates. So the
great civilizations of
ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia,

9
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:39,630
and the area we refer to as the fertile
crescent of which a little part here

10
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:42,630
about the size of Rhode Island is Canaan.
Canaan,

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,660
Canaan and archeologists in the 19th and
20th centuries were stunned to find the

12
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:52,460
ruins and the records of remarkable
peoples and cultures. Um,

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,930
massive complex empires in some cases,

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,350
but some of which had completely
disappeared from human memory. Uh,

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,440
they're newly uncovered. Uh, languages
had been long forgotten. They're rich.

16
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:08,760
Literary and legal texts were now
undecipherable that that soon changed.

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,250
But because of those discoveries,

18
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:15,360
we are now in a position to appreciate
the monumental achievements of these

19
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:18,570
early civilizations.
These earliest civilizations.

20
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,850
And so many scholars and many people
have remarked that it's not a small irony

21
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,170
that the ancient near eastern
people with one of the,

22
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:33,171
or perhaps the most lasting legacy was
not a people that built and inhabited,

23
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:38,160
um, one of the great centers of
ancient near eastern civilization.

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,810
It can be argued that the ancient near
eastern people with the most lasting

25
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,570
legacy is a people that had an idea.

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,310
It was a new idea that broke
with the ideas of its neighbors.

27
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,350
And those people were the Israelites.

28
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,450
And scholars had come to the realization
that despite the Bible's pretensions to

29
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,330
the contrary,
the Israelites were a small,

30
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,810
and I've actually overrepresented it here.
I'm sure it should be much smaller,

31
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,610
a small and relatively insignificant
group. For much of their history,

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,350
they did manage to establish a kingdom
and the land that was known in antiquity

33
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:16,740
as Canaan, um, around the year 1000, um,

34
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,030
they probably succeeded in subduing some
of their neighbors collecting tribute.

35
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:24,360
There's some controversy about that.
But in about nine 22,

36
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:27,960
this kingdom divided into two smaller
and lesser kingdoms that fell in

37
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,780
importance. Um, the northern kingdom,

38
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:33,180
which consisted of 10 of the 12,

39
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,200
is relight tribes and known confusingly
as Israel was destroyed in seven 22 by

40
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:41,430
the Assyrians,
the southern kingdom,

41
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:46,020
which consisted of two of the 12 tribes
and known as Judah managed to survive

42
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:51,021
until the year five 86 when
the Babylonians came in
and conquered and sent the

43
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:52,680
people into exile.

44
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,810
Capital Jerusalem fell conquest and exile
were events that normally with spell

45
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:04,711
the end of a particular ethnic national
group particularly and antiquity

46
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,390
conquered peoples would trade.

47
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,350
They're defeated God for the
victorious God of their conquerors.

48
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:15,370
And eventually there would be a
cultural and religious assimilation

49
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:19,400
intermarriage that people would disappear
as a distinctive entity and effect.

50
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,420
That is what happened to the 10
tribes of the northern kingdom.

51
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,490
To a large degree.
They were lost to history.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,360
This did not happen to those members of
the nation of Israel who lived in the

53
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:29,650
southern kingdom.
Judah,

54
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,280
despite the demise of their
national political base in five 86,

55
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,290
the Israelites alone really among
the many peoples who have, uh,

56
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,320
figured in ancient near eastern
history, the Sumerians, the Acadians,

57
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:48,010
the Babylonians, the Hittites, the
Phoenicians, the horigans, the Canaanites,

58
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,610
they emerged after the death of their
state producing a community and a culture

59
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:59,550
that can be traced through various twists
and turns and vicissitudes of history

60
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,810
right down into the modern period.
That's a pretty unique claim.

61
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,790
And they carried with them the idea and
the traditions that laid the foundation

62
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:14,650
for the major religions of the Western
world, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

63
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,490
So what is this radical new idea that
shaped a culture and enabled it survival

64
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:21,910
into,
uh,

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,840
into later antiquity and really right
into the present day in some form?

66
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:27,820
Well,

67
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,500
the conception of the universe that was
widespread among ancient peoples is one

68
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:37,200
that you're probably familiar with.
People regarded the various natural, um,

69
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:42,040
forces as imbued with divine power,
as in some sense divinities themselves.

70
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,910
The Earth was a divinity. The Sky was
a divinity. The water was a divinity,

71
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,680
had divine power.
In other words,

72
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:51,430
the gods were identical with or
imminent in the forces of nature.

73
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,360
There were many gods, no one single
God was therefore all powerful.

74
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,160
There is very,

75
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:02,161
very good evidence to suggest that ancient
Israelites by and large shared this

76
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,273
worldview.

77
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,290
They participated at the very earliest
stages in the wider religious and Celtic

78
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:13,090
culture of the ancient Near East.
However, over the course of time,

79
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,460
some ancient Israelites,

80
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,490
not all at once and not unanimously
broke with this view and articulated a

81
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:25,180
different view that there was
one divine power, one God,

82
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,330
but much more important than number was
the fact that this God was outside of

83
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:34,480
and above nature.
This God was not identified with nature.

84
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,660
He transcended nature and he wasn't known
through nature or natural phenomena.

85
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,330
He was known through history events
and a particular relationship with

86
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,130
humankind.
And that idea,

87
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,250
which seems simple at first
and not so very revolutionary,

88
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:56,251
we will see that's an idea that affected
every aspect of Israelite culture and

89
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,410
in ways that will become clear as we
move through the course and learn more

90
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:05,040
about biblical religion and
Biblical views of history. Um,

91
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,460
it was an idea that ensured the survival
of the ancient Israelites as an entity,

92
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,290
as an ethnic religious entity
in various complicated ways.

93
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,560
The view of an utterly transcendent God
with absolute control over history made

94
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:26,291
it possible for some Israelites to
interpret even the most tragic and

95
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:31,040
catastrophic events such
as the destruction of their
capital on the exile of

96
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,120
their remaining peoples,

97
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,920
not as a defeat of Israel's God
or even God's rejection of them,

98
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,200
but as necessary, unnecessary part of
God's larger purpose or plan for Israel.

99
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,560
These Israelites left for us the
record of their religious and cultural

100
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:52,130
revolution in the writings that are
known as the Hebrew Bible collectively.

101
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,420
And this course is an introduction to
the Hebrew Bible as an expression of the

102
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:59,570
religious life and
thought of ancient Israel.

103
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:03,860
And as a foundational document of
Western civilization, of course,

104
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:05,930
has several goals.
First and foremost,

105
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:09,640
we want to familiarize you with the
contents of the Hebrew Bible. Um,

106
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,050
we're not going to read every
bit of it word for word. Um,

107
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,990
we will read certain chunks of it quite
carefully and others we will work,

108
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,670
we will choose selections.

109
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:20,420
But you will get a very good sense and
a good sampling of the contents of the

110
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:21,254
Bible.

111
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,320
A second goal is to introduce you in a
to a number of approaches to the study of

112
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:31,660
the Bible. Different methodological
approaches that have been advanced, um,

113
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,900
by modern scholars,
but some of which are in fact quite old.

114
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,770
At times we will play the historian,
uh,

115
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,070
at times we will be literary critics.
How does this work as literature? Um,

116
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,780
at times we will be religious
and cultural critics.

117
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,440
What is it the Israelites were saying in
their day and in their time and against

118
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:52,550
who and for what?

119
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,710
A third goal of the course is to
provide some insight into the history of

120
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:01,310
interpretation.
This is a really fun part of the course.

121
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,240
The bibles radically a new
conception of the divine.

122
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,710
It's a revolutionary depiction of
the human being as a moral agent.

123
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,160
It's riveting saga of
the nation of Israel.

124
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:18,161
Their story has drawn
generations of readers to
ponder it's meaning and message.

125
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,390
And as a result,

126
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:25,391
the Bible has become the base of an
enormous edifice of interpretation and

127
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:30,170
commentary and debate both in
traditional settings but also in academic

128
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:33,730
university, secular settings.
And from time to time,

129
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,600
particularly in section discussion,

130
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,920
you will have occasion to consider the
ways in which certain biblical passages

131
00:08:39,921 --> 00:08:43,820
have been interpreted. Sometimes I'm very
contradictory ways over the centuries.

132
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:46,400
That can be an it really fun
and exciting part of the course.

133
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,700
A fourth goal of the course is
to familiarize you with the,

134
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,750
the culture of ancient
Israel as represented in the
Bible against the backdrop

135
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,360
of ancient near eastern.
It's ancient near eastern setting.

136
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,190
It's historical and cultural setting
because the archeological discoveries that

137
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:08,210
are referred to in the ancient near east,
um,

138
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,580
reveal to us the spiritual and cultural
heritage of all of the inhabitants of

139
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,930
the region,
including the Israelites.

140
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,910
And one of the major consequences of
these fines is the light that they have

141
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:24,900
shed on the background and the
origin of the materials in the Bible.

142
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,640
So we now see that the traditions in
the Bible did not come out of a vacuum

143
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,690
there. Early chapters of
Genesis, genesis one through 11,

144
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,370
they're known as the primeval history,

145
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:39,390
which is a very unfortunate name because
these chapters really are not best read

146
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:43,470
or understood as history
in the conventional sense.
But these 11 chapters, oh,

147
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:45,870
a great deal to ancient
near eastern mythology.

148
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:51,320
The creation story in genesis one draws
upon the Babylonian epic, the, um,

149
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,660
known as a Pneuma Aly. She will be
talking about that text in some depth.

150
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,780
The story of the first human
pair in the garden of Eden,

151
00:09:57,781 --> 00:09:59,550
which is in genesis two and three,

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,880
a has clear affinities with the
epic of Gilgamesh. That's, uh,

153
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,590
a Babylonian and Assyrian epic in which
a hero embarks on this exhausting search

154
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:10,590
for immortality.
The story of Noah and the flood,

155
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:15,591
which occurs in genesis six through nine
is simply an Israelite version of an

156
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:19,800
older flood story that we have found
copies of a Mesopotamian story called the

157
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:21,120
epic evoucher Hassis.

158
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,500
I'm a flood story that we also have
incorporated in the epic of Gilgamesh.

159
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Biblical traditions have routes that
stretch deep into earlier times and out

160
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:34,110
into surrounding lands and traditions.

161
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,120
And the parallels between the biblical
stories and ancient near eastern stories

162
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:43,920
that they parallel, uh, has been the
subject of intense study. However,

163
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:48,921
it isn't just the similarity between the
biblical materials and the ancient near

164
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:53,010
eastern sources that is
important to us. Um, in fact,

165
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:58,011
in some ways it's the dissimilarities
that is remarkably important to us.

166
00:10:58,231 --> 00:11:03,231
The biblical transformation of a common
near eastern heritage in light of it's

167
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,720
radically new conceptions of God and
the world and humankind will be dealing

168
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:12,950
with this in some depth. But I'll give you
one quick example for, uh, we have, uh,

169
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:17,670
a Sumerian story from about the
third Millennium Bce, right?

170
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,850
Going back 3000, third
millennium, 3000 BCE.

171
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,010
So story of Zeus Sutra,

172
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,880
and it's very similar to the
genesis flood story of Noah.

173
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,700
In both of these stories,
the Sumerian and the Israelites story,

174
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:34,470
you have a flood that is the result
of a deliberate divine decision.

175
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,560
Um,
one individual has chosen to be rescued.

176
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:41,460
That individual is given very specific
instructions on building a boat.

177
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,310
He's given instructions about
who to bring on board. Um,

178
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,980
the flood comes and
exterminates all living things.

179
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,110
The boat comes to rest on a mountain top.

180
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,770
The hero sends out birds to reconnoiter
the land. When it comes out of the Ark,

181
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:56,630
he offers a sacrifice to the god.
The same narrative elements, um,

182
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,140
are in these two stories.
It's,

183
00:11:58,141 --> 00:12:02,650
it's just wonderful when you
read them side by side. So, um,

184
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:08,190
what is of great significance though is
not simply that the biblical writer is

185
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,890
retelling a story that was
clearly went around, you know,

186
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,710
everywhere in the ancient,
uh, in ancient Mesopotamia,

187
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,040
they were transforming the story so that
it became a vehicle for the expression

188
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,140
of their own values and their own
views in the Mesopotamian stories.

189
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:31,240
For example, the God's Act propitiously
the God's act on a whim. In fact,

190
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:33,730
I'm one of the stories that God say, Oh,
people, they're so noisy. I can't sleep.

191
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:36,580
Let's wipe them all out, right?
There's just, that's the rationale.

192
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,190
There is no moral scruples.
They destroy these helpless,

193
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,700
but stoic humans who are chafing under
their tyrannical and unjust and uncaring

194
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:46,000
rule in the biblical story. When the,
when the Israelites told the story,

195
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,350
they modified it.

196
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:52,120
It's God's uncompromising
ethical standards that lead
him to bring the flood in

197
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:53,530
an act of divine justice.

198
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,830
He's punishing the evil corruption of
human beings that he is so lovingly

199
00:12:56,831 --> 00:13:00,140
created and whose degradation he
can't bear to witness. So it's,

200
00:13:00,141 --> 00:13:03,250
it's saying something different. It's,
it's providing a very different message.

201
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,760
So when we compare the Bible with the
literature of the ancient Near East, um,

202
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,400
we'll see not only the incredible
cultural and literary heritage that was

203
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:16,990
obviously common to them, but we'll see
the ideological Gulf that separated them.

204
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:19,320
And we'll see how biblical writers,
uh,

205
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,080
so beautifully and cleverly manipulated
and use these stories, as I said,

206
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:27,340
as a vehicle for the expression of a
radically new idea they drew upon these

207
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:31,180
sources, but they blended and
shape them in a particular way.

208
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:36,510
And that brings us to a critical problem
facing anyone who seeks to reconstruct

209
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,740
ancient Israelite religion or culture
on the basis of the biblical materials.

210
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,083
Um,

211
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,990
that problem is the conflicting
perspective between the
final editors of the

212
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:54,970
texts and some of the older sources
that are incorporated into the Bible.

213
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:59,080
Some of the older sources that they
were obviously drawing on those who were

214
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:03,310
responsible for the final editing,
the final forms of the texts, um,

215
00:14:03,311 --> 00:14:08,080
had a decidedly monotheistic perspective,
ethical, monotheistic perspective.

216
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,310
And they attempted to impose
that perspective on their
older source materials.

217
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,680
And for the most part
they were successful,

218
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,910
but at times the result of their
effort is a deeply conflicted,

219
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,920
deeply ambiguous texts.
And again,

220
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:25,000
that's going to be one of the most fun
things for you as readers of this text.

221
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:25,990
If you alert to it,

222
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:30,280
if you're ready to listen to the cacophony
of voices that are within the text.

223
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,290
In many respects,

224
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:37,291
the Bible represents or expresses a
basic discontent with the larger cultural

225
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,480
milieu in which it was produced.

226
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,230
And that's interesting for us because a
lot of modern people have a tendency to

227
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:47,320
think of the Bible as an
emblem of conservatism, right?

228
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:50,470
We tend to think of this as an old
fuddy duddy document. It's outdated,

229
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,310
has outdated.
Um,

230
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:57,020
and I think the challenge of this course
is that you read the Bible with fresh

231
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:01,250
eyes so that you can
appreciate it for what it was.

232
00:15:01,251 --> 00:15:05,780
I'm in many ways what it continues to
be a revolutionary cultural critique.

233
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:11,960
We can read the Bible with fresh and
appreciate devise only if we first

234
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:15,110
acknowledge and set aside some of
our presuppositions about the Bible.

235
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,520
It's really impossible in fact that you
not have some opinions about this work

236
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:21,530
because it's an intimate
part of our culture.

237
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,770
So even if you've never
opened it or read it yourself,

238
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:28,550
I bet you can cite me align or two
and eye for an eye, tooth for tooth.

239
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,670
And I bet you don't really know what it
means. The poor will always be with you.

240
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,260
I'm sure you don't really
know what that means.

241
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,130
These are things and phrases that we
hear and they create within us a certain

242
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:41,720
impression of the biblical text and how
it functions versus our quoted there

243
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,020
alluded to,
um,

244
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,180
whether to be championed and valorized
or whether to be lampooned and pilloried.

245
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,810
But we can feel that we have
a rough idea of the Bible.

246
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:54,470
And a rough idea of its outlook when
in fact what we really have are popular

247
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:58,580
misconceptions that come from the way in
which the Bible's been used or misused.

248
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:04,040
Most of our cherished presuppositions
about the Bible are based on astonishing

249
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:08,120
claims that others have made on behalf
of the Bible claims that the Bible has

250
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:12,110
not made on behalf of itself.
So before we proceed,

251
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:15,920
I need to ask you to set aside
for the purposes of this course.

252
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,450
Some of the more common myths about the
Bible. I have a little list here for you.

253
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,790
The first is the idea that the
Bible is a book. It's not a book.

254
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,910
We get rid of that one,
okay?

255
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:33,911
The Bible is not a book with all that
that implies that it has a uniform style

256
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:37,040
and a message and a single author of
the sorts of things we think of when we

257
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:41,450
think in a conventional sense of the
word book. It's a library, right?

258
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,400
It's an anthology of writings were books
written and edited over an extensive

259
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:50,840
period of time by people in very
different situations responding to very

260
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:55,640
different issues and
stimuli, some political, some
historical, some philosophical,

261
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,200
some religious,
some moral.

262
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,950
There are many types or genres
of material in the Bible. Um,

263
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,870
there's narratives, wonderful narrative
stories. There's all kinds of law.

264
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:09,980
Their cultic and ritual
texts that prescribe how some
ceremony is supposed to be

265
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:12,800
performed. There are records
of the messages of profits.

266
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:16,640
There's lyric poetry,
there's love poetry. Um,

267
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,960
there are proverbs, there are
psalms of Thanksgiving and lament.

268
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:26,350
So there's a tremendous
variety of material in this
library and it follows from

269
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:31,010
the fact that it's not a book,
but an anthology of diverse works,

270
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,160
that it's not an ideological monolith.

271
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,900
And this is something a lot
of students struggle with.

272
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,530
Each book or Strand of
tradition within a book,

273
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:45,130
within the biblical collection sounds
its own distinctive note in the symphony

274
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,960
of reflection.
That is the Bible.

275
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:53,040
Genesis is concerned to account for the
origin of things and wrestles with the

276
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,150
existence of evil,

277
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,710
the existence of idolatry and suffering
in a world that's created by a good God.

278
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:04,470
The priestly texts and Leviticus and
numbers emphasize the sanctity of all life

279
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:09,120
and the ideal of holiness and ethical
and ritual purity there or odes to human

280
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:13,020
reason and learning and endeavor
and the wisdom book of proverbs,

281
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:17,700
Ecclesiastes. These reads like
an existentialist writing, um,

282
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,900
from the 20th century.

283
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:23,370
It scuffs it the vanity of all things
including wisdom and a spouse is a kind of

284
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:24,840
positive existentialism.

285
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,610
The psalms are very individual writings
that focus on individual piety and love

286
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:33,420
and worship of God job possibly
the greatest book of the Bible.

287
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:37,200
I won't give away my, my
preferences, their challenges,

288
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,340
conventional religious piety and arrives
at the bittersweet conclusion that

289
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:43,620
there is no justice in
this world or any other,

290
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,900
but that nonetheless were not excused
from the thankless and perhaps ultimately

291
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:50,580
meaningless task of righteous living.

292
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,840
One of the most wonderful and fortuitous
facts of history is that later Jewish

293
00:18:57,241 --> 00:19:01,350
communities chose to put all this stuff
in this collection we call the Bible.

294
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,050
They chose to include all of
these dissonant voices together.

295
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:08,610
They didn't strive to reconcile the
conflicts, nor did we, nor should wake,

296
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:12,810
excuse me, nor should we. They didn't.
We shouldn't each book, each writer,

297
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:17,811
each voice reflects another thread in
the rich tapestry of human experience,

298
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:22,440
human response to life. And it's puzzles,
human reflection on the sublime and,

299
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,130
and the deprived.
And that leads me to my second point,

300
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,160
which is that Biblical narratives
are not pious parables about saints

301
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,950
not pious tails.

302
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,460
They're psychologically real literature
about very real and realistic people in

303
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:42,060
life situations.

304
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:47,160
They're not stories about pious people
whose actions are always exemplary and

305
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:49,140
whose lives should be models for our own,

306
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:53,490
despite what Sunday school curriculum
will often turn them into. Right.

307
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,410
And despite what they
would have us believe, um,

308
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,860
there is a genre of literature that
details the lives of saints hagiographies

309
00:20:00,861 --> 00:20:04,980
but that came later and is, uh, largely
something we find in the Christian era.

310
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,180
It's not found in the Bible.
The Bible abounds with human,

311
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,920
not super human beings.
And their behavior can be scandalous.

312
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,120
It can be violent, it can be
rebellious, outrageous, lewd,

313
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,030
vicious. But at the same
time, like real people,

314
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:26,060
they can turn around and act in a way
that is loyal and true above and beyond

315
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,790
the call of duty. They
can change, they can grow.

316
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,700
But it's interesting to me that there
are many people who when they opened the

317
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:36,270
Bible for the first time,
they close it and he shock and disgust.

318
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:41,220
Jacob is a deceiver. Joseph
is arrogant, spoiled Brat,

319
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,270
Judah reneges on his obligations to his
daughter in law and goes off and sleeps

320
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:47,980
with a prostitute. Who are these
people? Why they're in the Bible.

321
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,150
And the shot comes from the expectation
that the heroes of the Bible or somehow

322
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,310
being held up as as perfect people.
That's,

323
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:57,940
that's just not a claim that's
made by the Bible itself.

324
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:02,140
So Biblical characters are real people
with real compelling moral conflicts and

325
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:05,890
ambitions and desires. And they can
act shortsightedly and selfishly,

326
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,950
but they can also like real
people learn and grow and change.

327
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:14,190
And if we work too hard and too quickly
to vindicate Biblical characters just

328
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:17,200
because they're in the Bible,
then we miss all the good stuff.

329
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:19,360
We miss all of the moral sophistication,

330
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,100
the deep psychological insights that have
made these stories have such timeless

331
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:24,730
interest.

332
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,210
So read it like you would read any good
book with a really good author who knows

333
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:31,900
how to make some really
interesting characters. Thirdly,

334
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,130
the Bible's not for children. I'm
a 12 year old, eight year old.

335
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:39,070
I won't let him read it.
I won't let it read it.

336
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:42,160
Those Bible stories for children books,
they scare me.

337
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,090
They really scare me.
It's not suitable for children.

338
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:50,620
The subject matter in the Bible is very
adult, particularly the narrative texts.

339
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,250
Um,

340
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,930
there are episodes of treachery and incest
and murder and rape and the Bible is

341
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:57,430
not for naive optimists.

342
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,380
It's hard hitting stuff and it speaks
to those who are courageous enough to

343
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:06,850
acknowledge that life is rife with pain
and conflict just as it's filled with

344
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:10,210
compassion and joy. It's not
for children. And another sense,

345
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,160
like any literary masterpiece,

346
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,990
the Bible is characterized by a
sophistication of a structure.

347
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,650
And Style and an artistry of seam
and Metaphor. And believe me,

348
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:25,420
that's lost on adult readers. Um,
quite often it makes its readers work.

349
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:28,950
The Bible doesn't moralize or rarely,
rarely moralize.

350
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,240
It explores moral issues and situations,

351
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:33,550
puts people in moral
issues and situations.

352
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,980
The conclusions have to
be drawn by the reader.

353
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:40,660
There are also all kinds of paradoxes
and subtle puns and ironies and a in

354
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:42,850
section where you'll be doing a
lot of your close reading work.

355
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,790
Those are some of the things that
will be drawn to your attention.

356
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,460
You'll really begin to
appreciate them in time.

357
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,260
The fourth myth you want to get rid off
the Bible is not a book of theology.

358
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:58,660
It's not a catechism or
book of systematic theology.

359
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,460
It's not a manual of religion.

360
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,760
Despite the fact that
at a much later time,

361
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,440
very complex systems of theology
are going to be spun from particular

362
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,170
interpretations of Biblical passages.
You know,

363
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:15,370
there's nothing in the Bible that
really corresponds to prevailing modern

364
00:23:15,371 --> 00:23:18,420
western notions of religion,
what we call religion. Um,

365
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,180
and indeed there's no word for religion
in the language of biblical Hebrew.

366
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,530
It's just isn't a word. Religion.
With the rise of Christianity,

367
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,490
western religion came to be defined to
a large degree by the confession of or

368
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:38,011
the intellectual ascent to certain
doctrinal points of belief.

369
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:42,010
Religion became defined
primarily as a set of beliefs,

370
00:23:42,011 --> 00:23:45,410
a catechism of beliefs or truth
that required your ascent.

371
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,700
What I think of as the catechism kind
of notion of religion that's entirely

372
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,560
alien to the world of the Bible.

373
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,490
It's clear that in biblical times
and in the ancient near east,

374
00:23:55,491 --> 00:24:00,491
generally religion wasn't
a set of doctrines that you
ascribe to right to become

375
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:04,370
an Israelite later on,
a Jew,

376
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:07,730
the word Jew doesn't isn't something we
can really historically use until about

377
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:08,564
this time.

378
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,720
So most of our period we are going to be
talking about the ancient Israelites to

379
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:15,800
become an Israelite.
You simply joined the Israelite community.

380
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:18,380
You lived in Israelite life,
you died in Israelite death.

381
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:23,360
Do you will Betas or light law and custom.
You revered Israelite Law Lore,

382
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,860
you entered into the historical community
of Israel by accepting that their fate

383
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:29,060
and yours should be the same.

384
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,790
We'll sort of a process of
naturalization what we think of today as

385
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:36,260
naturalization. So the Hebrew Bible,
it just isn't a theological text book.

386
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,520
It contains a lot of narratives and its
narrative materials are an account of

387
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,370
the Odyssey of a people,
the nation of Israel.

388
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,650
They're not an account
of the d of The divine,

389
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:50,540
which is what theology means and
account of the divine. However,

390
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,620
having said this,

391
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,880
I should add that although the Bible
doesn't contain formal statements of

392
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:59,720
religious belief for systematic theology,
it treats issues,

393
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:04,721
many moral issues and some existential
issues that are central to the later

394
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:08,660
discipline of theology. Um, but
it treats them very differently.

395
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,600
It's treatment of these issues
is indirect. It's implicit.

396
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:16,640
It uses the language of story and Song
and poetry and paradox and metaphor.

397
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,020
It uses a language and a style that's
very far from the language and style of,

398
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,600
of later philosophy and abstract theology.

399
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,600
Finally,
on our miscount,

400
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,560
I would point out, well, I don't
really need to cross this out.

401
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:34,730
This is something to discuss.

402
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:40,030
I would point out that the Bible was
formulated and assembled and edited and

403
00:25:40,551 --> 00:25:45,551
modified and censored and transmitted
first orally and then in writing by human

404
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:52,160
beings. The Bible itself doesn't
claim to have been written by God.

405
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,470
That belief is the religious doctrine
of, of a much later age. And even then,

406
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:59,300
one wonders how literally it was meant.

407
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:02,130
It's interesting to go back and
look at at some of the earliest, uh,

408
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,390
claims about the origin of
the biblical text. Similarly,

409
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:09,830
the so called five books
of Moses, Genesis, exodus,
Leviticus, numbers, Deuteronomy,

410
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:13,640
the first five books we called
the Pentateuch of Moses. Um,

411
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,670
nowhere claimed to have been
written in their entirety by Moses.

412
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:20,350
That's not something they say themselves.
Some laws and exodus, you know,

413
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,810
the book of the Covenant. A few things,
yes, it says Moses wrote those down,

414
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:28,820
but not the whole five books that
traditions later we'll ascribe to him.

415
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,240
The Bible clearly had many contributors
over many centuries and the individual

416
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:37,640
styles and concerns of those writers,

417
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:41,810
their political and religious
motivations betray themselves frequently.

418
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,900
I leave aside here the
question of divine inspiration,

419
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,500
which is an article of faith
in many biblical religions.

420
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:53,340
It's no doubt an article of faith
for people in this very room,

421
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:59,510
but there is no basic in compatibility
between the leaving on faith in the

422
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:04,260
divine inspiration of the Bible and
acknowledging the role that human beings

423
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:07,950
have played in the actual formulation
and editing and transmission and

424
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:12,840
preservation of that same Bible. And
since this is a university course and not,

425
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:16,230
you know, perhaps a theological course
or within the theological setting,

426
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:17,850
it's really only the ladder,

427
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,750
the demonstrably human
component that will concern us.

428
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,120
It's very easy for me to assert that
our interest in the Hebrew Bible will be

429
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,680
centered on the culture and the history
and the literature and the religious

430
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:39,270
thought of ancient Israel in all of its
diversity rather than quick questions of

431
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:40,470
faith and theology.

432
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:44,790
But the fact remains that the document
is the basis for the religious faith of

433
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:47,790
many millions of people and
some of them are here now.

434
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,270
It is inevitable that you will bring what
you learn in this course into dialogue

435
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,960
with your own personal religious beliefs.
And for some of you,

436
00:27:57,961 --> 00:28:02,460
I hope all of you that will be
enriching and exciting. For some of you,

437
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:04,290
it may be difficult.
I know that.

438
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:10,310
And I want you to rest assured that no
one in this course wishes to undermine or

439
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:14,490
malign religious faith anymore than
they wish to promote or proselytize for

440
00:28:14,491 --> 00:28:19,350
religious faith. Religious faith
simply isn't the topic of this course,

441
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:24,090
the rich history and literature and
religious thought of ancient Israel as

442
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:29,091
preserved for us over millennia in the
pages of this remarkable volume that is

443
00:28:29,761 --> 00:28:34,260
our topic. And so our approach is
going to be necessarily academic. Um,

444
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,810
and especially given the
diversity of people in this room.

445
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:38,250
That's really all that it can be,

446
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:42,210
so that we have common ground and
common goals for our discussions.

447
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,840
But it has been my experience
that from time to time, um,

448
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:50,841
students will raise a question or
ask a question that is prompted by a

449
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:55,380
commitment,
a prior commitment to an article of faith.

450
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,170
Sometimes they're not even aware
that that's what they're doing.

451
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,920
And I want you to understand
that on those occasions out,

452
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,950
most likely respond by inviting you to
consider the article of faith that lies

453
00:29:08,341 --> 00:29:11,310
behind that question. And it's creating
that particular problem for you.

454
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:15,360
I'm not going to be drawn
into a philosophical or
theological debate over the

455
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:17,490
merits of,
of that belief,

456
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:21,510
but I'll simply point out how or why
that belief might be making it difficult

457
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:26,511
for you to read or accept what the text
is actually and not ideally saying and

458
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,660
leave you to think about that.

459
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,720
And I see those as wonderful
learning opportunities for the class.

460
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,020
Those are in no way a problem for me.
All right,

461
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:39,021
so let's give a few sort of necessary
facts and figures now about the Bible and

462
00:29:40,171 --> 00:29:43,030
then I need to a little bit about
the organization of the course.

463
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,900
So those are the last two
things we really need to do. Um,

464
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,560
an overview of the structure of the Bible.

465
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:51,130
So you have a couple of handouts
that should help you here. Um,

466
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:54,220
so the Bible is this assemblage
of books and writings.

467
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,670
I'm dating from approximately 1000 BCE.

468
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:02,350
We're going to hear very diverse opinions
about how far back this stuff dates

469
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,000
down to the second century.

470
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,650
The last book within the Hebrew Bible
was written in the one sixties BCE.

471
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,100
Some of these stories, some of
these books which we've, you know,

472
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,380
think roughly from a certain date,

473
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:17,830
they will contain narrative snippets
or legal materials or traditions,

474
00:30:17,831 --> 00:30:21,640
oral traditions that may even date back
or stretch back further in time and they

475
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:25,360
were perhaps transmitted orally and then
ended up in these, these written forms.

476
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:30,090
The Bible is written largely in Hebrew,
hence the name Hebrew Bible. Um,

477
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,200
there are a few passages in Aramaic.

478
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,280
So you have a handout that breaks
down the three major components.

479
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:40,480
It's the one that's written
two columns per page, okay.

480
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,960
For the, we're going to talk in a
minute about those three sections.

481
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:48,130
So you want to have that handy.

482
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:55,390
These writings have had a profound and
lasting impact on three world religions,

483
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:59,350
Judaism, Christianity, and
Islam for the Jewish community.

484
00:30:59,351 --> 00:31:02,200
So first compile these writings
in the pre Christian era.

485
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,100
The Bible was perhaps first and foremost
a record of God's eternal covenant with

486
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:12,060
the Jewish people.
So Jews refer to the Bible as the Tenakh.

487
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,730
So the term you see up here,
um,

488
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,960
that should be also on that sheet tena
which is really the letters to me and um,

489
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,200
and they put little A's in there to make
it easy to pronounce because it's hard

490
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:30,100
to pronounce. So 10. Okay.
Um, and this is a, an acronym.

491
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,760
The t stands for Torah,

492
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,840
which is a word that means instruction
or teaching. It's often translated law.

493
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:42,280
I think that's a very poor translation
means instruction way teaching.

494
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,400
Um, and that refers to the first
five books that you see listed here,

495
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,780
genesis through Deuteronomy.

496
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:51,040
The second division of the Bible
is referred to as Nivi Ean,

497
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:53,670
which is a Hebrew word for profits.
The,

498
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,800
the section of the profits is divided
really into two parts because there are

499
00:31:56,801 --> 00:31:59,890
two types of writing in the
prophetic section of the Bible.

500
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:04,750
The first or former prophets continues
the kind of narrative prose account of

501
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:08,920
the history of Israel. Focusing on the
activities of Israel's profits. All right,

502
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,240
so, uh, the, the for the former
prophets are narrative texts.

503
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:17,840
The latter prophets are poetic
and or regular writings, um,

504
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,360
that bear the name of the prophet
to whom the writings are ascribed.

505
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,320
You have the three major prophets,
Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel,

506
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:28,300
and then the 12 minor prophets,

507
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:31,290
which in the Hebrew Bible get counted
together as one book because a lot of

508
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,400
those 12 are very small.
Okay?

509
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,510
The final section of the Bible is
referred to as to Veem in Hebrew,

510
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:38,860
which simply means writings.

511
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:41,720
And that's probably about 50% of the
Hebrew you're going to get in the whole

512
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:43,220
course. So please don't
be scared. You know,

513
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:45,920
I've got two or three other terms that'll
be useful along the way, but, but this,

514
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:47,720
there's really no need to know Hebrew.

515
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:49,950
I just want you to
understand why to NASC is,

516
00:32:49,951 --> 00:32:53,990
is the word that's used to refer to
the Bible. So the two of them are,

517
00:32:53,991 --> 00:32:57,680
the writings are really a miscellany.
They contain works of, of various types.

518
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,610
And the three parts correspond
very roughly to the process of,

519
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,260
of canonization or authoritativeness
for the community, the Torah,

520
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,220
the Torah probably reached a fixed
and authoritative status first.

521
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,880
Then the books are the profits.
And finally the writings.

522
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:17,280
And probably by the end of the
first century, all of this was um,

523
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:21,290
organized in some way. If you look at
the other handout, you'll see, however,

524
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,430
that any course on the Bible is going
to run immediately into the problem of

525
00:33:25,431 --> 00:33:29,990
defining the object of study
because different bible
serve different communities

526
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,520
over the centuries.

527
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,660
One of the earliest translations of
the Hebrew Bible was a translation into

528
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:40,190
Greek known as the step two. Again,
it was written for the benefit.

529
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:43,640
It was translated for the benefit
of Jews who lived in Alexandria,

530
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:45,470
a Greek speaking Jews
who lived in Alexandria,

531
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:49,010
Egypt in the Hellenistic period before,
you know, somewhere around three,

532
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:54,200
the third or second century BCE.
The translation,

533
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,233
um,

534
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,480
has some divergences with the traditional
Hebrew text of the Bible as we now

535
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:01,520
have it,
including the order of the books.

536
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:03,890
And some of these things are charted
for you on the chart that I've,

537
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:06,200
I've handed out, um, the step two again,

538
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,000
the set two against rationale for
ordering the books is temporal. Um,

539
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,520
they've clustered books
genesis through Esther,

540
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:18,550
which tell if things past the books of
a job through the song of songs or the

541
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,770
Song of Solomon contained wisdom
that applies to the present.

542
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,260
And then the prophetic books
Isaiah to Malakai contained, um,

543
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:30,560
tell or tell a things future. Um,
some copies of the CEP to again,

544
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:33,710
contains some books not included
in the Hebrew Canon, but, uh,

545
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,450
accepted in the early Christian Canon.

546
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,280
The step two against the Greek
translation became by enlarge the Bible of

547
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:45,380
Christianity or more precisely, it became
the old testament of the Hebrew Bible.

548
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:49,940
The tr the church adopted the Hebrew
Bible as a precursor to it's largely

549
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:52,280
Hellenistic Gospels was,
uh,

550
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:56,030
an important association for it
with an old and respected tradition.

551
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,720
Our primary concern is the Bible of the
ancient Israelite and Jewish community.

552
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,040
The 24 books grouped in the Torah
profits and writing on that other sheet,

553
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,810
um, which is common to all bibles, right?
Whether Jewish or Christian, those 24,

554
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:13,130
the baseline common books.

555
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:17,540
So those are the 24 that we're going to
focus on because the term old testament

556
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:19,880
is a theologically loaded term.
Um,

557
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,110
it's sort of a suggest the doctrine that
the new testament has somehow fulfilled

558
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:27,290
or surpassed are antiquated.
The Bible of ancient Israel.

559
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,770
You're going to hear me refer to the
object of our study as the Hebrew Bible.

560
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,550
You may certainly use any other term
and you may certainly use the term old

561
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,020
testament.
As long as it's clear.

562
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:39,000
We're talking about this set of 24 bucks
and that's some of the other things

563
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:42,810
that are in the old testament that
aren't in the traditional Hebrew Bible.

564
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,650
It means you studying less so that
that might be a good thing. Um,

565
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,790
so it's fine with me if you want
to use that, but I will just,

566
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,230
I will prefer the more accurate
term Hebrew Bible. Um, also,

567
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:53,460
while we're on terminology,

568
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:58,461
you'll notice that I use BCE to refer to
the period before zero and CE to refer

569
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:03,920
to the period after zero, the common
era and before the common era. And,

570
00:36:03,921 --> 00:36:05,690
and a lot of your secondary
readings and writings,

571
00:36:05,691 --> 00:36:06,810
they'll be using the same thing.

572
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:12,210
It corresponds to what you know is BC
before Christ and Anno Domini right?

573
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:16,740
Add the year of our Lord. It's just a
non Christian centric way of dating. Um,

574
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,590
and a lot of your secondary readings,
you'll see it. So you should be,

575
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,431
you should get used to it.

576
00:36:20,431 --> 00:36:25,431
BCE and CE before the common era and
the common era from earliest times

577
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:28,890
Christians made use of the Bible
but not always in Greek translation.

578
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,220
And the Christian Old Testament
contains some material,

579
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:35,430
not in the Hebrew Bible as I've mentioned
in some of these works are referred to

580
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:37,590
as the Apocrypha.
So you will have heard that term.

581
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,950
These are writings that were
composed somewhere around here,

582
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:43,290
sort of 200 BCE to 100 CE.

583
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,020
They were widely used
by Jews of the period.

584
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:49,320
They simply weren't considered to be
of the same status of the 24 books.

585
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:54,960
I'm glad they pick up the garbage
at 1110 on Wednesday mornings,

586
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:59,420
but they did become part of the
Canon of Catholic Christianity. Um,

587
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,690
and in the 16th century there,

588
00:37:00,691 --> 00:37:05,280
canonical status was confirmed for the
Catholic Church with the renaissance and

589
00:37:05,281 --> 00:37:06,210
the reformation.

590
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,720
Some Christians became interested
in Hebrew versions of the Bible.

591
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:13,710
They wanted to look at the Hebrew in
and not the Greek translation from the

592
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:15,540
Hebrew, um, Protestant.

593
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:20,360
The Protestant church denied canonical
status to the books of the Apocrypha. Um,

594
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,030
they said they were important for pious
instruction but excluded them from their

595
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:24,864
canon.

596
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,220
There are also some works you may know
of referred to as the PSEUDEPIGRAPHA.

597
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,650
We'll talk about some of these things in
a little more detail later from roughly

598
00:37:31,651 --> 00:37:32,700
the same period,

599
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:36,890
tend to be a little more apocalyptic in
nature and they were never part of the,

600
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:39,300
the Jewish or the Catholic Canon.
Um,

601
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:42,930
but there are some eastern Christian
groups that have accepted them and their

602
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:43,764
cannon.

603
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,090
The point I'm trying to make is that
there are very many sacred cannons out

604
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:52,740
there that are cherished by very many
religious communities and they're all

605
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:55,110
designated bibles. Um, so again,

606
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:59,240
we're focusing on that core set of
24 books that are common to all, uh,

607
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:03,150
bibles everywhere. The 24 books of what
would in fact be the Jewish [inaudible].

608
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Not only has there been variety regarding
the scope of the biblical Canon in

609
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:13,860
different communities, but there's been
some fluidity in the actual text itself.

610
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,060
We don't,
of course,

611
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:20,061
have any original copies
of these materials as they
came off the pen or whoever

612
00:38:21,151 --> 00:38:25,740
it was who was writing them. And in fact,
before the middle of the 20th century,

613
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,630
our oldest manuscripts and fragments
of manuscripts of the Bible data to the

614
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:33,780
year 900,
that's an awful long distance,

615
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:39,370
right from the events they're talking
about. You gotta think about that, right?

616
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,100
You gotta think about that and what it
means and how were they transmitted and

617
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:45,220
preserve without the means of technology,
obviously, that we have today.

618
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,920
And what was so exciting in the middle
of the 20th century was the discovery of

619
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:54,130
the Dead Sea Scrolls. I'm sure
that you've heard of them. Um,

620
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,190
they brought about a dramatic
change in the state of our,

621
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,420
of our knowledge of a Hebrew man
or our Hebrew manuscript evidence.

622
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:06,520
The Dead Sea scrolls were found
in caves in the Judean desert. Um,

623
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,280
we used to think they were a
library of a sectarian community.

624
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:12,160
Now I think they think it was
a pottery factory or something.

625
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:16,950
So maybe they were just shoved there by
people fleeing the Roman conquest and in

626
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,120
70.
So that's up for grabs.

627
00:39:19,121 --> 00:39:22,750
But we have this really great
collection of scrolls. Um,

628
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:28,050
and among them we have found an almost
complete copy of every book of the Bible.

629
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,650
Um,
or sorry,

630
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,590
a almost complete copy of the book of
Isaiah and then partial or copies or

631
00:39:35,591 --> 00:39:39,070
fragments of all of the biblical
biblical books except maybe Esther.

632
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:39,970
Am I wrong about that?

633
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:43,270
I don't think there's an Esther from
camera and think that's the only one and

634
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:46,840
some of them date back.
So the fourth and third century.

635
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,240
So do you understand now why
everybody was so excited?

636
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:54,630
Suddenly we have evidence 13 or 1400 years
earlier that people were reading this

637
00:39:55,451 --> 00:40:00,010
stuff. And you know, by and large, it's a
pretty constant textual tradition. Sure.

638
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:02,110
There are differences.
Sure. There are differences.

639
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:04,840
We see that our manuscripts are
not exactly like those fragments,

640
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,180
but there is a remarkable degree,

641
00:40:07,181 --> 00:40:10,840
a high degree of correspondence so that
we really can speak of a relatively

642
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:14,530
stable textual trip tradition,
but still some fluidity.

643
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,390
And that's going to be interesting
for us to think about. Um,

644
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,150
there are many translations of the Bible,

645
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,600
but I would like you to
purchase for this course, um,

646
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:27,790
the Jewish Study Bible. So let me
turn now to just some of the details,

647
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:31,630
administrative organizational details
of the course, the secondary readings,

648
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,840
and that we'll be using.
Um,

649
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,630
I'm asking you to pick up
the Jewish Study Bible,

650
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,320
not only for the translation of the
Tanakh, which is a very good translation,

651
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:46,090
but because it contains a wonderful
scholarly articles in the back.

652
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:50,080
It used to be we had a course packet
for this course at it's two volumes.

653
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,120
And now with the purchase of this,

654
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,560
I've been able to really consolidate
and conduct to consolidate the readings.

655
00:40:56,561 --> 00:40:57,460
They're really wonderful,

656
00:40:57,461 --> 00:41:00,490
great introductions to the
individual books of the Bible.

657
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,180
And so I think you will find that
this will become like a Bible to you.

658
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:08,260
All right. Um, so you need to pick
that up and set the Yale Bookstore.

659
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,280
I also would like you to pick up this, um,
paperback. It's not terribly expensive.

660
00:41:12,281 --> 00:41:13,960
We're going to be using
it in the first few weeks,

661
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:16,000
especially the ancient near east.

662
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:21,310
The other readings is secondary readings
for the course are all already online.

663
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,563
Um,

664
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:27,820
I will be also making them available at
Alegra for people who would like to just

665
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:30,010
purchase them already printed
out so you don't do it yourself.

666
00:41:30,011 --> 00:41:33,130
But I know some people really
prefer to work online. So,

667
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:36,470
and certainly for the first week of
reading you can get started because it is

668
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:37,070
online.

669
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,310
I don't think things will be available
at allegro is until probably tomorrow

670
00:41:40,311 --> 00:41:44,720
afternoon. Um, the
syllabus, as you can see,

671
00:41:44,721 --> 00:41:45,650
it's pretty fixed syllabus,

672
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:49,910
but it's divided into a schedule of
lectures and then a schedule of readings.

673
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,250
All right, so understand that there
are two distinct things there.

674
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:53,780
It's not just all the scheduled lectures.

675
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:58,490
Last few pages are a schedule of the
actual readings and the assignment that

676
00:41:58,491 --> 00:42:02,910
you'll have for the weekend and for
next week's lectures are the readings by

677
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,530
Kaufman. Really, really need you
to read that before the next class.

678
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:08,770
And I want you to read it critically.
Um,

679
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:13,780
Calvin's ideas are important but they're
also overstated and so they're going to

680
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:14,961
be interesting for us.

681
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:18,500
We're going to wrestle with his claims
quite a bit during the course of the

682
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:19,334
semester.

683
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:24,620
The secondary readings are heavier at
the beginning of the course when we are

684
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:29,621
reading very small segments of Biblical
text that will shift right towards the

685
00:42:29,691 --> 00:42:32,150
end of the course. You're
going to be reading, you know,

686
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:36,150
a couple of books in the Bible and maybe
a 10 page article is secondary reading.

687
00:42:36,151 --> 00:42:38,540
So it's front loaded
with secondary readings.

688
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:41,990
So you'll want to get started on the
Kaufman because for the first few weeks

689
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,220
it's quite a bit of secondary reading,

690
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:46,150
but we're covering just a
few chapters of Bible, uh,

691
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,400
each time and the first
few weeks sections.

692
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:52,970
We're going to be doing this online
registration thing that I've never done

693
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:57,650
before. So I hope it works. We do have
three teaching fellows for this course.

694
00:42:57,651 --> 00:43:01,420
I hope that will be sufficient. Um, uh,

695
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,740
actually if the teaching fellows could
stand up so people could at least

696
00:43:03,741 --> 00:43:07,760
recognize you, that would be wonderful.
Benny else, anyone wants to volunteer?

697
00:43:07,761 --> 00:43:10,400
We could have a fourth. Okay. So we have
two in the back there. We have tutor,

698
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:13,640
a tutor,
Salah raising his hand and Sfi Novik here.

699
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:18,380
They will be running regular
uh, discussion sections and
then Christine Garroway.

700
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,800
Um, we'll be running a
writing requirement section.

701
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:24,320
I don't think that was listed in the
blue book but it should have been listed

702
00:43:24,321 --> 00:43:25,460
online that there is,

703
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:29,390
it is possible to fulfill your writing
skills requirement through this course.

704
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,440
Um, so Christine will be running
that. We will bring on Monday.

705
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,740
So please have your schedules as
well formed as they are on Monday.

706
00:43:36,741 --> 00:43:40,820
We will put up times and we will take
a straw poll to figure out if we can

707
00:43:40,821 --> 00:43:42,620
accommodate everybody within the times.

708
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:46,550
One more extremely important announcement.
It's on your syllabus,

709
00:43:46,551 --> 00:43:50,660
but I want to underline it even more
than it is already underlined and bold

710
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,150
faced.
Uh,

711
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:57,190
I want to underline the importance of
the section discussions in this course.

712
00:43:57,531 --> 00:43:59,540
In fact it's really wrong to
call them section discussions.

713
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:00,374
It sounds like they're,

714
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,920
you're discussing the lectures and the
readings and you're really not that

715
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,790
section. Discussions are a
compliment to the lectures.

716
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:12,680
What I mean is this is an awfully big
thing to spend just one semester studying

717
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,210
and I can't do it all.

718
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:18,350
And in my lectures I'll be trying to set
broad themes and patterns and describe

719
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:19,184
what's going on,

720
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:22,340
but I want you to have the experience of
actually sitting and reading chunks of

721
00:44:22,341 --> 00:44:25,430
texts and struggling with
that and understanding the
history of interpretation

722
00:44:25,431 --> 00:44:29,720
of passages and and how so many of
the important things have happened

723
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:33,960
historically because of people's efforts
to understand this text. So in sections,

724
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:38,970
a large part of the focus in section
will be on specific passages,

725
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:42,270
reading and struggling with the text,
the kind of thing I can't do in lecture.

726
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,890
This is important because your final
paper assignment will be a paper and

727
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:49,260
exercise and exegesis and interpretation.

728
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,540
The skills that you will
need for that paper.

729
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:55,440
I am fairly certain are not things that
you would have acquired in high school.

730
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:57,090
And like we have some upperclassmen,
I don't know,

731
00:44:57,091 --> 00:45:00,630
but maybe not even some upperclassmen
will have acquired here yet. Um,

732
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,440
exegesis is a very particular kind of
skill and the teaching fellows will be

733
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:08,340
introducing you to two
methods of exegesis. Um,

734
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:12,000
so it's really a training ground for
the final paper and we have found that

735
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:15,840
people don't succeed in the course in
the final paper without the training they

736
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:17,010
get in section discussion,

737
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,960
which is why I'm section participation
is worth 10% of your grade.

738
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,930
However,
if there are repeated unexcused absences,

739
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,350
there'll be an adjustment in the grade
calculation and it will be worth 20 to

740
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:33,210
25% of your grade and it will be a
negative grade also. And believe me,

741
00:45:33,211 --> 00:45:36,060
this is a favor to you.
It is definitely a favor to you.

742
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,300
It's sections are critically
important in this course. Okay.

743
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,930
So if you have any questions,
I can hang around for a few minutes,

744
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,030
but thank you for coming.
We'll see you Monday.
