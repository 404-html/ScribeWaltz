1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,380
You may have heard that posts Biblical
tradition hails Moses as anxious.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,820
Israel's a first and greatest law giver,

3
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:13,140
and certainly the Bible depicts Moses as
receiving law from God and conveying it

4
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:14,010
to the Israelites.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,220
But clearly Moses isn't the author or
compiler of the legal traditions contained

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:24,030
in the Bible. Some of the individual laws
we know, um, are found in very, very,

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,640
very ancient near eastern laws.

8
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:28,740
They're part of an ancient
near eastern legal tradition,

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,660
the collections as a whole clearly
date to a much later period of time.

10
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:36,270
And we're going to see that clearly
when we talk about Deuteronomy today.

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,240
And they had been retroed [inaudible]
back to the time of Moses.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,201
But nevertheless,

13
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:44,790
Moses is the central figure in the
biblical narrative from exodus all the way

14
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,890
through numbers and into Deuteronomy.

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,340
And he's going to serve as a paradigm
for Israel's leaders to follow in the

16
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:57,360
biblical view. No one can look
upon the face of God and live.

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,470
And yet Moses who spoke with God,
mouth to mouth the text says,

18
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,200
was an exception to this rule.

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,360
So why wasn't he permitted to see
the fulfillment of his labors?

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,900
Why was he not permitted
to enter the promised land?

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,320
This is a question that
plagued ancient Israel,

22
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:21,321
and the Bible contains the effort of
tradition to explain this great mystery or

23
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:22,794
tragedy.

24
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,370
When Moses asked God if he can enter the
land that's in Deuteronomy three 25 God

25
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:30,330
refuses and he gives his reason.

26
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,160
In Deuteronomy 32 versus 49 to
52 you shall die on the mountain.

27
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:39,210
The two are about to ascend and shall
be gathered to your kin as your brother

28
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:43,350
Aaron died on Mount Hoar and was
gathered to his kin for you, Bro,

29
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,700
for you both broke faith with me among
the Israelite people at the waters of

30
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:50,340
Mary Fatca dish in the Wilderness of sin.

31
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,240
By failing to uphold my sanctity
among the Israelite people,

32
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,520
you may view the land from a distance,

33
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,150
but you shall not enter it the land that
I am giving to the Israelite people.

34
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,190
So what happened at Maryville at
Kadesh that made God so angry? Well,

35
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:08,940
you can read the story. It's in numbers
20 the incident is described there,

36
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,250
but the answer is still
not entirely clear.

37
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:15,090
It's not clear what Moses did that was
so bad as to deserve this punishment.

38
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,180
Perhaps it's Moses.

39
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:20,520
His failure to follow God's instructions
to the letter when he is producing

40
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:25,230
water, uh, for the Israelites
were demanding water. Perhaps
that's what angers got,

41
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,340
but one gets the impression that the
story in numbers 20 and Deuteronomy

42
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,400
subsequent claim that it was something
about that story that earned Moses God's

43
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:36,270
disapproval.

44
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,590
You get the impression that these are an
attempt to explain what was probably a

45
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:45,150
longstanding tradition about a great
leader who died on the east side of the

46
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:47,910
river. For that to have happened,
for that desk to have happened,

47
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:50,610
the writers seem to
surmise he must've sinned.

48
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,830
There must've been some
punishment for some sin.

49
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,350
After a very poignant scene in which
God shows Moses the promised land from a

50
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:01,030
lookout point on the east
side of the Jordan River,

51
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,330
we then read about the death
of Moses in Deuteronomy 34

52
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,610
God spoke to Moses on that same day,
ascend this mount every team,

53
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,610
the peak Nivo in the land
of Moab opposite Jericho.

54
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,150
And look at the land of Canaan,
which I'm giving Israel for a holding.

55
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,990
So Moses went up from the plains of
Moab to mount Nebo to the top of peace,

56
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:24,820
Pisco opposite Jericho. And God showed
him all the land from Gad to done,

57
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,230
which is in the north and all of
Naphtali and the land of a fry,

58
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:33,231
em and Menasha and all of Judah in the
south to the outer Mediterranean Sea and

59
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:36,760
the negative, the southern wilderness
and the plane of the valley of Jericho,

60
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:41,530
the palm city as far as so are the
end of the Dead Sea. And then Moses,

61
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:45,100
the servant of God, died there in
the land of Moab, has God had said,

62
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,480
and he buried him in the valley,
in the land of moth.

63
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,850
But no man knows the place
of his burial to this day.

64
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,260
And the people of Israel wept for Moses
in the plains of Moab for 30 days.

65
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,440
And they're never again a rose in Israel,

66
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,650
such a profit as Moses whom God
knew face to face, none like him,

67
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:06,910
for all the signs and wonders which the
Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt,

68
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:10,270
to Pharaoh, to his household, and
to all his land. None like him.

69
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,500
And respect of all the mighty power and
all the great and terrible deeds which

70
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:16,390
Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.

71
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,680
There's no other human being in
the Bible who earns such a tribute.

72
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,180
This is unusual for the biblical writer,
uh,

73
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,400
to speak in such glowing
terms of a human character.

74
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,200
And I've said that Moses
becomes a paradigmatic leader
in the biblical tradition

75
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,520
and the force of Moses as paradigmatic
leader of Israel is apparent in the very

76
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:39,490
first leader to succeed him.
And that is Joshua.

77
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,770
Deuteronomy closes with a transfer
of authority from Moses to Joshua.

78
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,230
So in Deuteronomy 34,
nine,

79
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:52,231
we read now Joshua son of nun was filled
with the spirit of wisdom because Moses

80
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:56,470
had laid his hands upon him
and the Israelites heated
him doing as the Lord had

81
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:58,990
commanded Moses.
And in several ways,

82
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:02,890
Joshua's going to turn out to be
a kind of carbon copy of Moses.

83
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,130
Moses crosses the Reed Sea.

84
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,900
The waters stand in a heap and the
children of Israel cross over on dry land.

85
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,920
We'll see in connection with Joshua that
he crosses the Jordan river into the

86
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:17,260
promised land.
The water stand in a heap.

87
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,760
The children of Israel Cross on dry land.
That's in Joshua three,

88
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,130
verse 13. After crossing, um,

89
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,270
the Israelites then celebrate the Passover
and that makes us strong link then to

90
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:34,630
the exodus led by Moses.
Also at the time of the first Passover,

91
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,330
Moses had a vision of God at the burning
Bush. She was told to remove his shoes,

92
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:42,100
his sandals,
because he was on holy ground.

93
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,040
Josh was also going to have a theophany.
It's a vision.

94
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:49,060
After he crosses the Jordan, he'll
see a man with a drawn sword, um,

95
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,360
who's the captain of the Lord's host
and he tells him to remove his shoes.

96
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,860
He is on holy ground.

97
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,970
Moses is the one to mediate a covenant
between God and Israel. At Sinai.

98
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,920
Joshua will mediate every new.

99
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:03,140
We'll have the covenant at
a place called chef him.

100
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,350
Moses sent out spies
to scout out the land.

101
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:09,230
Joshua also set out spies
to scout out the land.

102
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,850
Moses holds out a rod during battle
in order that Israel prevail over her

103
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:17,000
enemies. And Joshua will
do the same with a javelin.

104
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,680
So these are all important
literary parallels and they
signal the importance of

105
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:25,610
Moses in Israelite tradition
as the parodic Madec leaders.

106
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:29,030
So other leaders who are praise
will be modeled on Moses.

107
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,950
It said of Joshua after these rights enter
the promise land. It said on that day,

108
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:37,820
the Lord Exalted Joshua in the sight of
all Israel so that they revered him all

109
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:39,830
his days as they had revered Moses.

110
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,420
So no greater praise can be given to an
Israelite leader then to be compared to

111
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:45,254
Moses.

112
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,680
But now we're going to take a close look
at Deuteronomy and we'll pick up with

113
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:50,990
Joshua on, um, on Wednesday.

114
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,750
So Israel's wanderings in the
wilderness end on the plains of Moab,

115
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,030
which is on the east
bank of the Jordan River.

116
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,650
And it's there that the book of
Deuteronomy Opens. They are most,

117
00:07:02,651 --> 00:07:06,500
this is going to deliver
three long speeches prior
to the Israelites entry into

118
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:07,460
the promise land.

119
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,300
And these three speeches constitute
the bulk of the book of Deuteronomy.

120
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:19,450
Deuteronomy differs very much from the
other four books of the pentitude because

121
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:23,810
in those books, you'd have an anonymous
narrator who is describing, um,

122
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,940
describes y'all way as directing his
words to Moses to then be conveyed to

123
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:33,240
Israel. Moses will speak to Israel on
God's behalf, but in Deuteronomy Eight,

124
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,250
Moses is going to speak speaking directly
to the Israelites so that the book is

125
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:42,380
written almost entirely in
the first person, right?

126
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:44,150
Whereas the first four books
of the Pentateuch or not,

127
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:46,430
they're third person
anonymous narrative narration.

128
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,590
Here we have the bulk of the book in
the first person direct speech. Now,

129
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:54,020
Moshe Weinfeld,
I put his name on the board.

130
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:57,230
There's someone who you should associate
always with the book of Deuteronomy,

131
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,960
but motion Weinfeld, he's one of
the leading scholars of Deuteronomy.

132
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,610
And he describes the book as expressing
ideology by means of a programmatic

133
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:09,410
speech put into the
mouth of a great leader.

134
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,010
That's a very common practice and
later Israelite historiography.

135
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,290
And he says it's happening here already.

136
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,250
And I'll be referring quite a
bit to wind fields work. Um,

137
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,610
as we talk about Deuteronomy,

138
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,960
Deuteronomy differs from the other books
of the Pentateuch in other significant

139
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:28,700
ways. So for example, according to the
priestly writer, Israel received its laws,

140
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:32,690
its Torah from God at Mount Sinai.
But in Deuteronomy,

141
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,920
the laws were given here on the
plains of morph 40 years after Sinai,

142
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,580
before the Israelites crossed the Jordan,
I'm at Sinai,

143
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:43,760
the Israelites heard the decalogue, but
the remainder of the laws, it would seem,

144
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:45,650
are delivered on the plains of Moab.

145
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,360
We can look at the basic structure of
Deuteronomy and a couple of ways we can do

146
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:51,590
a kind of literary division,

147
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:55,340
which I have on this side of the
board according to the speeches.

148
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,490
So to begin, we have the first speech,
which is a sort of introductory speech,

149
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:04,491
and the first four chapters going through
four verse 43 there's an introduction

150
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:09,420
that gives us the location where the
Israelites are, and also then Moses,

151
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:13,890
his first sermon, Moses in this
sermon is giving a historical review.

152
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,980
And the purpose of this historical
review is didactic. He wants,

153
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:18,450
he wants the Israelites
to learn something,

154
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:22,770
to infer something from this review of
their history from Sinai to the present

155
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,970
day. And in that review, as
he retells the story, um,

156
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,880
which we've just been reading about
in the previous books, we see his,

157
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:31,350
his selective choice of events.

158
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:36,351
We see how he's describing things in
a way that underscores God's faithful,

159
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,330
loyal fulfillment of
the covenantal promise.

160
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,710
And he's using this to urge the Israelites
to do their part by obeying God's

161
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:44,544
laws.

162
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,680
The second speech extends from four
verses 44 through 28 verse six.

163
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,740
And this also contains a bit
of a historical review, again,

164
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:56,160
retelling some of the narrative of the
earlier books of the Torah. And again,

165
00:09:56,161 --> 00:10:00,570
giving us the insight into this phenomenon
of inner biblical interpretation.

166
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,370
We're parts of the Bible that review
parts elsewhere are already beginning to

167
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,860
interpret and present that
material in a particular light.

168
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,150
But then we have a central section of laws
being presented beginning at about 12,

169
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:14,190
so this is still part of Moses,
his second speech,

170
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,610
but stretching from
Deuteronomy 12 through 26.

171
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,900
We have laws and this is a in many ways
of repetition of much of the revealed

172
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:22,441
legislation.

173
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:27,441
We've already encountered that central
portion of laws 12 through 26 is thought

174
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:29,280
to be the earliest core of the book.

175
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:31,980
We're going to come back and
talk about that in a moment. Now,

176
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:36,720
the Greek title for this book, which is
Deuteronomy Deuteros due to row Namos,

177
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,470
um,

178
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,000
a second law of repetition of the law
and that name derives from the fact that

179
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:45,960
the bulk of the book contains this legal
core of material which reviews the law

180
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,330
in chapters 27.
We have a covenant renewal ceremony.

181
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,760
It takes place at a
mountain near Schechem. Um,

182
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,770
after the Israelites have crossed the
Jordan that describes the ceremony that

183
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:00,060
will take place,
excuse me,

184
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,480
after they have crossed the
Jordan and from ancient Greece,

185
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:08,460
we know that in the ancient world,
settlers who would colonize a place,

186
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:11,550
particularly if they colonized
a place at divine instigation,

187
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,870
they would perform certain ceremonies
that would be accompanied by blessings and

188
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:19,410
accompanied by curses. They would
write the laws on stone pillars.

189
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:21,870
They would erect an altar for sacrifices.

190
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:26,871
They would proclaim blessings and cursing
purses for those who obey and disobey.

191
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,450
Very similar to what
happens in chapter 27.

192
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:35,451
All of these elements appear in Chapter
27 Chapter 28 lists the material rewards

193
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:42,540
that will accrue to Israel
if he is faithful to God's
law and the punishments if

194
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,880
she should disobey in some
of these are very creative,

195
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,660
but the importance of the Deuteronomistic
view of history in which Israel fate

196
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,730
is totally conditioned on her
obedience to the covenant.

197
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,180
This is something that will occupy
us repeatedly at a future date.

198
00:11:58,181 --> 00:12:00,640
I mentioned it here, but it's
something we will need to come back to.

199
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,180
The third speech of Moses
is in chapters 29 and 30.

200
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,110
This speech emphasizes the degree to which
evil fortune is the responsibility of

201
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:11,850
the community.
Um,

202
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:16,480
Moses in enumerates additional misfortunes
and sufferings that will be fall

203
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:21,010
Israel if she sins,
but he emphasizes the choice is Israel's,

204
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,491
you know,

205
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:26,491
God has been clear regarding
what's required and it's
not beyond Israel's reach

206
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,580
to attain life and prosperity.
She needs to only choose,

207
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:35,140
and this is all set out and a speech in
chapter 30 I'll read from verses 11 to

208
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:35,974
20.

209
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,170
Surely this instruction which I enjoy
and upon you this day is not too baffling

210
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:45,700
for you, nor is it beyond reach. It is
not in the heavens that you should say,

211
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:49,210
who among us can go up to heavens and
the heavens and get it for us and impart

212
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:50,590
it to us that we may observe it.

213
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,590
Neither is it beyond the
sea that you should say,

214
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:57,280
who among us can cross to the other side
of the sea and get it for us and impart

215
00:12:57,281 --> 00:13:00,760
it to us that we may observe it
now the thing is very close to you.

216
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,910
It's in your mouth and in
your heart to observe it. See,

217
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:07,600
I set before you this day, life and
prosperity, death and adversity.

218
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,480
For I command you this day,
to love the Lord your God,

219
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:12,820
to walk in his ways and
to keep his commandments,

220
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:16,690
his laws and his rules that you may
thrive and increase and that the Lord your

221
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:19,420
God may bless you in the land that
you are about to enter and possess.

222
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:22,690
Listen to the cadences of of this
kind of language in Deuteronomy,

223
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:24,250
we haven't heard language
like this before,

224
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:27,190
but it's what people often think of when
they think of Biblical language starts

225
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:28,024
here in Deuteronomy.

226
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,200
But if your heart turns away and you give
no heat and are lured into the worship

227
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:33,400
and the service of other gods,

228
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:36,430
I declare to you this day that
you shall certainly perish.

229
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:39,640
You shall not long and do or on the
soil that you are crossing the Jordan to

230
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:43,570
enter and possess. I call heaven and
earth to witness against you this day.

231
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,260
I have put before you life and death,
blessing and curse.

232
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,700
Choose life if you and your offspring
would live by loving the Lord your God,

233
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,040
hating his commandments
and holding fast to him.

234
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,030
For thereby you shall have life and
shall long and your upon the soil that

235
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:01,690
you're, that the Lord your God swore
to your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac,

236
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:05,170
and Jacob to give to them.
So all has been given, right.

237
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:08,320
It's simply Israel
choice to take it or not.

238
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,360
The last section of the book,

239
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:14,440
chapters 31 to 34 is a sort
of miscellany of appendices.

240
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:19,240
Um, there's some ancient poetry
that's found in chapter 32,

241
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:21,070
which is referred to as the song of Moses.

242
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:23,620
Scholars refer to it as a song of Moses.
Um,

243
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:28,621
we have the blessings of Moses recorded
in chapter 33 and then chapter 34 is the

244
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:29,890
story of Moses,
his death.

245
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:34,330
I read part of that to you
now centuries ago already.

246
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,160
Scholars of the Bible noted that
Deuteronomy opens with the verse.

247
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,640
These are the words that Moses addressed
to all Israel on the other side of the

248
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:48,970
Jordan. That is to say the Trans
Jordan on the other side of the Jordan.

249
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:53,510
So that line is obviously written from
the perspective of someone who is inside

250
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:57,590
the land saying Moses said that when he
was over there outside the land on the

251
00:14:57,591 --> 00:15:01,400
other side of the Jordan. So he's
looking eastward. And so that's aligned,

252
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,020
that one would think,

253
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:06,590
could not be written by Moses because
Moses did not ever enter the land.

254
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:10,400
It would not be in a position to talk
about something being on the other side of

255
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:13,840
the Jordan. Likewise, the last
chapter, which describes Moses,

256
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:17,090
his death and burial probably
was not written by him.

257
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,040
So as we shall see these and many other
textual features point to the period of

258
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,510
composition for Deuteronomy,

259
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,590
which was many centuries after the time
that Moses would have been supposed to

260
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:31,070
have lived, um, are if we are to
assume he was a historical character.

261
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,420
And so through careful analysis, you
have scholars like Moesha, widefield,

262
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,100
and Weinfeld.
And many others.

263
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,270
I think Bernard Levinson is the one who
has written about Deuteronomy in your

264
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:43,970
Jewish Study Bible and that's a
wonderful introduction to read there.

265
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:46,370
So I encourage you to please
make sure you look at that.

266
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,820
But analysis of scholars like these have
led them to draw the conclusion that

267
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:57,590
the original core of Deuteronomy
emerged in the eighth century.

268
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:58,480
And this is now where my,

269
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,580
my interesting little mountain shape
diagram is going to come into play.

270
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,670
It was probably known as a scroll of,

271
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,990
it was probably a skull scroll of laws
known as the book or the scroll of the

272
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:10,260
Torah.
Um,

273
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Deuteronomy refers to itself that way and
Deuteronomy 17 verses 19 and 20 and so

274
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:21,050
we think it was probably something roughly
equivalent to chapters 12 to 26 maybe

275
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:23,000
there was a little introduction,
a little conclusion.

276
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,640
And eventually these laws were put into
the framework of a speech by Moses,

277
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:33,770
maybe chapters five through 11 and maybe
28 maybe that would have been in the

278
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:37,310
eighth, seventh century. And
then at some later point,

279
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,910
several things happened and I will
say them in in the following order,

280
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:42,380
but that doesn't mean they
happened in this order.

281
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:45,950
We really aren't sure at some
point several things happen.

282
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:49,010
You have framing chapters,
Deuteronomy one through four,

283
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,000
this sort of introductory
frame and historical review
as well as the appendices

284
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:56,150
at the end.
Chapters 31 and 34 those get added.

285
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,240
You also have laws being updated,

286
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:04,340
passages being expanded to
reflect the experience of exile.

287
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,030
You will remember that as
a five 86 the Israelites,

288
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:11,060
Jerusalem is destroyed and the
Israelites were in exile in Babylonia.

289
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,251
Additionally,

290
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:17,660
at some point Deuteronomy is appended to
the other four books of the Pentateuch.

291
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:21,450
Genesis through numbers is
made to proceed this, um,

292
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:26,060
it's serving therefore as their
conclusion and by being joined to them,

293
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:31,090
it confers it's title as a book of Torah
as a scroll of Torah to that material

294
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:35,180
as well.
They don't use the word Torah in that way.

295
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:37,150
In those books only Deuteronomy,

296
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:40,700
it uses the word Torah to speak of
God's instruction or revelation overall.

297
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,790
So by being upended now to
genesis through numbers,

298
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,000
all of this perhaps comes
to be known as Tara as well.

299
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,030
And then finally during the exile,
or I'm sorry,

300
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,890
probably during the period after
the exile, um, no during the exile,

301
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,630
but down to the end of the sixth century,

302
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:03,060
Deuteronomy was incorporated into a
larger narrative history that runs from

303
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:06,600
Joshua through judges first and
second Samuel First and second kings.

304
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,000
That's all a unit as we'll come
to see in the next lecture.

305
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,950
And so Deuteronomy in a way served as
an introduction to that material looking

306
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:17,730
forward. So I conclusion
to the previous four books,

307
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:21,510
but also an introduction
to a long narrative history
that's going to run through

308
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:22,620
to the end of second kings.

309
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,670
Now there's a lot of debate over the
precise timing of these events in this

310
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:29,250
process by which this material
grew and was expanded.

311
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,140
But in the post exit period,
at some point, the entire unit,

312
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,720
the genesis through numbers
material, Deuteronomy, um,

313
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,940
and then the lengthy historical narrative
all the way through second kings was

314
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:42,780
solidified.

315
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,480
The Deuteronomistic history is sort of
an odd conclusion to the genesis through

316
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:52,770
numbers material because it doesn't
really have the expected narrative climax.

317
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:56,940
You sort of expect the story to end with
the entry of the Israelites into the

318
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:59,790
land and hopefully under Moses,
and that doesn't occur.

319
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,480
Some scholars have suggested
that differing Israel's
possession of the land to

320
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:11,031
the future may have reflected
the historical experience
of exile and experience,

321
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:17,220
which challenged the very idea of the
possession of the land as central to the

322
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:19,380
maintenance of the covenant.
So if you are in an exile,

323
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:23,760
then perhaps the more satisfying ending
is to have Israel not in fact entering

324
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:24,594
the land.

325
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,800
The complex process by which Deuteronomy
was formed underscores the fact that

326
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:37,490
modern notions of authorship cannot
be applied to biblical texts.

327
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,420
We think of an author.

328
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:43,680
We tend to think of an author
as a discrete individual
who composes a text at a

329
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:44,700
specific time,

330
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,150
but this isn't the way that texts
came into being in the ancient world,

331
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:52,050
particularly important communal texts.
As Weinfeld points out,

332
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,310
the biblical authors were
what we would call collectors,

333
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,390
compilers,

334
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,620
revisers editors and interpreters
of ancient tradition,

335
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:07,250
ancient texts for generally the product
of many hands over the stretch of many

336
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,503
long centuries.

337
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,550
And during that time modifications
and recontextualization occurred.

338
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,710
And so we refer to those who transmit
and develop a text in this way as a

339
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:20,281
school.

340
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:24,420
But you need to understand that we are
using that in a relatively informal way.

341
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,860
So when we talk about the Deuterenomic
school or the Deuteronomistic school,

342
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,790
we're really talking about the fact that
we have a set of texts that all seem to

343
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,520
share a certain sort of
ideology or orientation.

344
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,960
And yet we know that parts of them seem
to date from very, very different times.

345
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:42,270
And so we think of that
text is being preserved,

346
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:45,310
transmitted and developed by many hands,
um,

347
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,750
who share certain commonalities, common
ideology. So we call it a school.

348
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,890
It's not that we know of the existence
of the Deuteronomistic school and we say,

349
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:56,800
Oh, well then they must have produced
this text. It's the other way around.

350
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,800
We have a text and it's features suggest
to us a longstanding tradition of

351
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:05,680
scholarship, right, that preserved
and transmitted the texts in that way.

352
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,770
Same with the priestly school.
We're speaking about the priests,

353
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:12,700
the materials which clearly have
evidence of originating from the eighth,

354
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:17,380
seventh, sixth and fifth centuries. And
so there must have been a common, um, uh,

355
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,930
uh,
uh,

356
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,060
stretch of scholarship that would have
preserved and transmitted in a developed

357
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,580
those traditions.
And we call that the priestly school,

358
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,100
the legal corps of Deuteronomy.
So really from five to 26,

359
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:34,180
because five is where some of the legal
material begins, contains first of all,

360
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:36,250
a somewhat expanded version
of the 10 Commandments.

361
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:41,230
You have that in Deuteronomy five and
then other laws really from 12 to 26 that

362
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:44,730
resemble the legal material
that's found in exodus, the,

363
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,380
the collection of material
we've called the Covenant Code.

364
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,370
And they also seem to bear some
relationship to the laws in Leviticus and

365
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:52,204
numbers.

366
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,720
But the question is what
is the relationship between
the different versions of

367
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:56,650
the legal material?

368
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,240
Some of these laws will parallel each
other's each other quite closely and

369
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:04,600
others do not.
So our Deuteronomy is legal traditions,

370
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:09,601
a direct response to or modification of
the laws and exodus and numbers or are

371
00:22:10,361 --> 00:22:11,860
they best understood as um,

372
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,150
just different independent formulations
of a common legal tradition.

373
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:16,990
Um,

374
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:21,940
Weinfeld has argued that Deuteronomy is
dependent on the previous traditions of

375
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:26,800
the pentitude tuk that Deuteronomy
revises and reforms them according to new

376
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:30,640
ideas. It's new notion of a
centralized cultic worship.

377
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,840
And secondly,
it's a humanitarian spirit.

378
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,420
Those are too controlling ideologies.
He says its shape,

379
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:39,940
its revision of preexisting material.

380
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,100
He's specifically argues that
Deuteronomy is dependent on the e source.

381
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,530
The source at some scholars think is
pretty hard to isolate or find in the

382
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:50,800
biblical text, but in East
Sinai's referred to as Horeb and,

383
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:52,930
and Deuteronomy Sinai is also horrible.

384
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,630
So the author of Deuteronomy limits the
revelation at Sinai to the deck log and

385
00:22:58,631 --> 00:23:03,010
seems to assert that the full law was
given to Moses for the Israelites on the

386
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:06,010
plains of Moab and Weinfeld view.

387
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,340
This means that Deuteronomy,
with its revisions,

388
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,970
what have been seen would have been
presented as and would've been seen as an

389
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,700
updated replacement of the old book of
the Covenant rather than its compliment.

390
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,610
It exists side by side in our text now.
But I think in his view,

391
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,900
those who promulgated it,

392
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,620
we're understanding it as the updated
replacement of the laws of the,

393
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:29,230
of the book of the Covenant.
For the most part,

394
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:31,780
Deuteronomy doesn't really contain
much in the way of civil law.

395
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,860
It tends to focus on the moral religious
prescriptions, kind of the APP,

396
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:37,390
addictive law in Israel.

397
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:42,460
And the few civil laws that are there
tend to be reworked in line with

398
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:46,480
Deuteronomy humanity. So for
example, the laws of the ties,

399
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,980
the laws or the seventh
year release of debts,

400
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,270
the rules for the release of slaves,
the rules for the three festivals,

401
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:56,420
these are all ancient laws. They
occur an exodus, but they appear.

402
00:23:56,421 --> 00:23:58,250
And Deuteronomy with modifications,

403
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,970
modifications about things that
concern the Deuteronomistic.

404
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:05,120
And some of you have discussed some of
these in section. So in Deuteronomy,

405
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,260
the Israelite debt slave comes
out of his or her servitude. Um,

406
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,420
with generous gifts from the owner.

407
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,010
This is not something that appears
in exodus or as another example.

408
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,420
Deuteronomy extends the Covenant Codes,

409
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,820
Prohibition Against Afflicting and
resident alien. In Deuteronomy,

410
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,780
there's the insistence at these are lights
must not just refrain from afflicting

411
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:28,490
them but must love the resident alien.

412
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,210
It goes so far as to provide
concrete legal benefits, um,

413
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,280
food and so on for the resident alien.

414
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:40,570
So while the relationship of d to some
of the laws and the Covenant Code is

415
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:43,910
often not always,
but often one of revision,

416
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,800
the relationship between d and the
laws and the priestly source is more

417
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:50,270
difficult to characterize.

418
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,350
The priestly source seems to represent
an equally early set of laws,

419
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:58,490
a legal traditions that just emanated
from a very different circle and had

420
00:24:58,491 --> 00:24:59,600
different concerns.

421
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,080
It tends to deal with sacral topics or
if it's dealing with other topics that

422
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:03,531
we'll deal with.

423
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:08,531
The sacral implications of those topics
like d p often updates and revises laws

424
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:11,390
of the Covenant Code.

425
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,680
We can see that in the fact
that the priestly source
abolishes is relight dates,

426
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:20,570
debt slavery altogether and insists that
slaves must be acquired only from the

427
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:25,190
nations around Israel. And that was where
like Ken and enslave another Israelite.

428
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,810
Nevertheless,

429
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:31,370
Weinfeld argues that on
occasion Deuteronomy contains
laws that are also found

430
00:25:31,371 --> 00:25:36,020
in p but presents them in a more
rational manner is the word he uses or d

431
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:37,460
sacralizing manner.

432
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,300
So Ds treatment and Deuteronomy
is treatment of sacrifice.

433
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,570
We'll see in a moment is going to be
different. For example, from peas,

434
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:47,450
they have different concerns and different
Fokai in their presentation of that

435
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:49,640
material.
In any event,

436
00:25:49,641 --> 00:25:52,970
many scholars through their analysis of
these texts have been led to conclude

437
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,960
that the Deuteronomistic school
updated and revised earlier laws,

438
00:25:56,961 --> 00:25:58,850
particularly laws in the Covenant Code,

439
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:03,650
but sometimes also in the
older legal straight of of p.

440
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,300
And they did so in keeping
with the circumstances of
the eighth to sixth century.

441
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:14,350
So Deuteronomy exemplifies a phenomenon
that occurs at several critical

442
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,570
junctures in Israel's history and we're
going to see this as we move forward

443
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,380
through the biblical text.
And that is the modification.

444
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:26,590
And rewriting of earlier
laws and traditions in the
light of new circumstances

445
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,180
and ideas.
So don't.

446
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:34,210
Deuteronomy is itself and implicit
authorization of the process of

447
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:40,121
interpretation and the notion of Canon
or sacred Canon that's exemplified then

448
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:47,111
by biblical texts is one that allows for
continued unfolding and development of

449
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:49,260
the sacred tradition.

450
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,660
And that's an idea that I think differs
very much from modern intuitions about

451
00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:56,310
the nature of secret cannons.

452
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,730
I think a lot of people have the intuition
that a sacred Canon means that the

453
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:07,320
text is fixed, static and authoritative
because it is fixed and static.

454
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,343
We're unchanging.

455
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,940
That's not the biblical view or ancient
view of sacred Canon texts represents

456
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:18,570
representing sacred
revelation were modified,

457
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,050
they were revised, they were
rephrased, they were updated,

458
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,280
and they were interpreted in the process
of transmission and preservation.

459
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:31,670
It was precisely because
a text or a tradition was
sacred and authoritative that

460
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:36,240
it was important that it adapt
and speak to new circumstances.

461
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:39,000
Otherwise it would
appear to be irrelevant.

462
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,350
So it's a very different notion of what
it means for something to be canonical

463
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:47,130
and sacred from what I think some moderns
have come to understand those terms to

464
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:47,964
mean.

465
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:53,080
So what are the special circumstances
and concerns that guide Deuteronomy is

466
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,470
revisions, uh, of tradition.

467
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,700
One of the primary changes you've probably
heard in section as well by now is

468
00:27:59,701 --> 00:28:04,701
the emphasis on worship at a single
central shrine that's going to represent a

469
00:28:05,761 --> 00:28:10,080
great change in Israel's religious
practice. According to Deuteronomy,

470
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,490
the central sanctuary will be located
in a place that God himself will choose.

471
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,030
It's not named and Deuteronomy or in a
place where he will cause his name to

472
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,740
dwell.
That's the other phrase that's used.

473
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,610
Jerusalem has never explicitly
mentioned as the site in question,

474
00:28:23,611 --> 00:28:27,990
but Jerusalem will later in fact
fulfill this function according to other

475
00:28:27,991 --> 00:28:28,980
biblical texts.

476
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:34,970
Now there are striking
similarities between Deuteronomy
is religious program and

477
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:40,070
the major religious reforms that were
carried out in the eighth century by King

478
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,390
Hezekiah.
But even more so,

479
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:47,650
I'm in the seventh century by the
King Josiah around six 22 king Josiah.

480
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,740
This is a reform that's reported in the
book of Second Kings and second kings

481
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:57,330
22. Um, this reform, um,

482
00:28:57,331 --> 00:29:02,331
has long been noticed and
provides scholars with the
basis for dating the core

483
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:06,660
materials of Deuteronomy,
dating them to the late seventh century.

484
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,440
According to the story in second kings
during temple repairs that were being

485
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:17,340
done in the time of King
Josiah, the scroll of the
Torah. That's how it's phrased.

486
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:21,000
The scroll of the Torah was
found and when it was read,

487
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,420
the king was distressed because its
requirements were not being upheld.

488
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,910
Now this term, the scroll
of the Torah, as I said,

489
00:29:26,911 --> 00:29:28,470
does not occur in genesis through number.

490
00:29:28,471 --> 00:29:32,570
It is a phrase that occurs in
Deuteronomy, Deuteronomy 17. Um,

491
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:36,120
then continuing the content,
the account in second kings,

492
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,840
Josiah said to take action.
He assembles the people.

493
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,550
He publicly reads the scroll,

494
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,710
the people agree to its terms
and then Josiah's reforms begin.

495
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:50,100
We hear that he purges the
temple of vessels that had
been made for bow and ashy

496
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,940
Ra that were in the temple of Yahweh.

497
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,640
He removes all foreign
elements from the cult.

498
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:59,680
He prohibits sacrifice to Yahweh anywhere,
but in the central sanctuary,

499
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,560
he destroys all of the high places.

500
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:06,070
This refers to sort of rural shrines
that were scattered throughout the

501
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:09,910
countryside were local priests and
Levites might offer sacrifices for people,

502
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:14,650
ritual, shrines and pillars being
used in the worship of your way.

503
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,730
These are deemed to be quite
legitimate in theJ and e's sources.

504
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:20,920
The patriarchs are doing this
sort of thing all the time,

505
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:22,900
building altars all around the country,

506
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,940
but it's Deuteronomy that contains
commandments to destroy the worship.

507
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,440
First of all,
the worship of other gods,

508
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:32,950
but I'll should also the worship of
Yahweh in high places or in rural shrines.

509
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:38,040
So this is evidence again that what
Josiah found a basis reforms on was

510
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:39,190
something like the book of Deuteronomy.

511
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:43,270
It's Deuteronomy that contains the
prohibitions of of high places and so on.

512
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,160
After these reforms, it's reported
that the Passover was celebrated.

513
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,850
It was celebrated not as a family
observance in individual homes.

514
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,970
It was celebrated as
a national pilgrimage.

515
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:57,640
Festivals celebrated by
everyone in Jerusalem.

516
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:02,230
That's how its celebration has described
in the book of Deuteronomy is described

517
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:06,010
as a family celebration and an individual
homes and the other books of the Bible.

518
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:06,491
So again,

519
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:10,810
this is another basis for the conclusion
that the scroll of the law found by

520
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:12,400
Josiah and guiding has reforms,

521
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,950
was something like the
legal corps of Deuteronomy.

522
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,180
Scholars now think that that legal
corps of Deuteronomy was produced in the

523
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:21,220
northern kingdom,
the northern kingdom of Israel,

524
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,240
which fell and seven 22 you'll recall
it was probably produced there in the

525
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:26,080
eighth century.

526
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:30,430
And that is supported by the fact that
Deuteronomy has affinities with some

527
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,271
profits,

528
00:31:31,271 --> 00:31:34,900
with the writings of some profits we'll
be looking at later from the northern

529
00:31:34,901 --> 00:31:37,300
Kingdom of the eighth century,
such as the Prophet Hosea.

530
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,150
And we'll see this when we
look at Jose, his writings. Um,

531
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,070
it also has affinities with the source,

532
00:31:42,071 --> 00:31:44,470
which is also connected
with the northern kingdom.

533
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:50,110
In the ninth and eighth
century, the northern kingdom
was the site of a struggle,

534
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,810
a struggle against Baal worship.

535
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,320
It was also home to certain profits such
as Elijah and Elisha who are known for

536
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:01,090
their zealotry. And they're
exclusive. Yeah. Wisdom.

537
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:05,620
So some scholars think that was going
on in the ninth, eighth century,

538
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:10,530
in the north. This sort of Ya'll way
only party. Um, that was, um, uh,

539
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,600
you know, working hard and
struggling against Baal worship.

540
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,890
And they think that those Yahweh only
traditions were brought south after the

541
00:32:17,891 --> 00:32:21,100
fall of the northern Kingdom and seven 22,
yet refugees coming south.

542
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:23,260
They brought these traditions with them.
Um,

543
00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:25,360
some of these written materials
were put into the temple.

544
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,110
And then about a century later during
design as time when the temple is being

545
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:31,490
refurbished, they were found, um,

546
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,270
possibly this material was then
worked into a larger scroll, um,

547
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:40,280
given it's mosaic introductions and so
on. And uh, that all contributed to,

548
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:41,690
um,
Josiah's reform.

549
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:47,380
So the centralization of the cult also
needs to be understood against the larger

550
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:50,300
political backdrop of
the late seventh century.

551
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,390
The Assyrian threat loomed large.

552
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,970
You have to remember that the northern
kingdom has already been completely

553
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:58,290
destroyed. 10 tribes, exile,

554
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:01,640
deported and essentially
lost the southern kingdom,

555
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:06,520
managed to escape destruction, but only
by paying tribute as a vassal to a,

556
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,540
so Judah,

557
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,080
the southern kingdom is a tribute paying
vassal state to the Assyrian overlord.

558
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,710
And of course there's a great deal of a
Syrian cultural influence and religious

559
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:17,810
influence in Judah as a result.

560
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:22,730
So second kings tells us that there
were foreign forms of worship being

561
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:27,260
introduced right into the temple. Josiah's
reforms have been interpreted by some,

562
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:32,261
as an attempt to assert the political and
the cultural and religious autonomy of

563
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,943
Judah.

564
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:39,310
Unregulated worship throughout the land
was no longer going to be an acceptable,

565
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:44,390
the people we're going to be United around
a central standardized, yeah way cult,

566
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:48,390
which would be purged them, any Syrian
influence or foreign influence, um,

567
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,300
and this was deemed as necessary to stand
up against or to survive the Assyrian

568
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:54,134
threat.

569
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:59,140
So it's in that context that we can look
at the very strong parallels that exist

570
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,130
between the book of Deuteronomy and
certain a Syrian treaties from the seventh

571
00:34:04,131 --> 00:34:07,670
century. We already talked about, um,

572
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,700
the Hittite a vassal treaties as a model
for the Israelite Covenant when we were

573
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,080
talking about exodus.

574
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:20,710
But Deuteronomy is clearly dependent on
another model and that is the Assyrian

575
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,230
Vassal Treaty.
The best exemplars of these treaties

576
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:34,750
are the treaties of the Assyrian.
Emperor Esther hadn't,

577
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:39,850
he was a seventh century, um, ruler
of a Syria down to about six 69.

578
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:43,230
These treaties were discovered
about 50 years ago. Um,

579
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,820
and Moshe Weinfeld is one of the people
who has done a tremendous amount of work

580
00:34:45,821 --> 00:34:50,821
with these treaties and he's argued at
great length that Deuteronomy reworks the

581
00:34:51,701 --> 00:34:56,230
second millennium Hittite
model in accordance with
the covenantal patterns that

582
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:59,350
are evident in the first millennium
vassal treaties of Esarhaddon.

583
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:04,750
We see history being used as a
motivational tool and we see laws being

584
00:35:04,751 --> 00:35:06,850
reinforced by curses.
Um,

585
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,920
and it's fascinating if you line up
some of the curses in Esarhaddon,

586
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:14,290
it's treaties with the curses
and Deuteronomy. There's
an amazing correspondence.

587
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,820
Um, Deuteronomy also includes blessings.
The Assyrians didn't do that. Um,

588
00:35:18,821 --> 00:35:23,530
Weinfeld notes that the Assyrian treaties
are really loyalty oaths that are

589
00:35:23,531 --> 00:35:26,680
imposed upon vassals
rather than true covenants.

590
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:30,190
And Deuteronomy is also
something of a low loyalty oath,

591
00:35:30,191 --> 00:35:33,430
except that the people are pledging
their loyalty to a god rather than to a

592
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:37,530
human king. So you have the x rotation
to love the Lord your God. I mean,

593
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:40,710
think back to some of that language that
we heard is I read Deuteronomy 30 the

594
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:45,090
exhortation to love the Lord your
God, to go after God, to fear God,

595
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:46,740
to listen to the voice of God.

596
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:51,780
These are all typical of pledges of
loyalty and they're paralleled in the

597
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,110
Assyrian treaties where the vassal
has to love the crown prince.

598
00:35:55,111 --> 00:36:00,000
He has to listen to the voice of the crown
prince. The same phrasiology are used.

599
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,490
So it is a political literary form,

600
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,800
but it's borrowed and it's referred
to God the Assyrian Gds. Also,

601
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:12,801
we'll warn against profits or ecstatics
or dream interpreters who will try to

602
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:16,560
foment sedition.
If you'll notice in Deuteronomy 13,

603
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:17,880
we have something quite similar,

604
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:21,660
a warning against false prophets
who will try to foment sedition,

605
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:24,240
lead the people to the
worship of other gods.

606
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,190
Some scholars refer to Deuteronomy as
a kind of counter treaty if you will,

607
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,330
right? A subversive document that's trying
to shift the people's loyalty from the

608
00:36:33,331 --> 00:36:36,600
Assyrian overlord,
right to God,

609
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:39,900
the true sovereign right and
it's part of a national movement.

610
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:45,090
Deuteronomy differs in style,
in terminology,

611
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:50,420
in outlook and in theological assumptions
from the other books of the Torah as a

612
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:56,330
series of public speeches. It adopts
a highly rhetorical tone, very,

613
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:00,870
um, sometimes on almost artificial style.
It's the style of a very skilled, um,

614
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,400
preacher almost. Um, he,

615
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,510
it employs direct address you
use sometimes in a singular,

616
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:07,560
sometimes in the plural,

617
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:12,270
but Moses is constantly speaking in
a very personal tone, direct address.

618
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,130
And there are all sorts of hortatory
phrases, phrases that x hort you, um,

619
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,480
to do this with all your heart and soul.

620
00:37:18,481 --> 00:37:20,910
Do this in order that it
may go well with you. I'm,

621
00:37:20,911 --> 00:37:23,760
the land is described as a
land where milk and honey flow.

622
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,880
And if only you will obey the
voice of Yahweh, your God.

623
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,450
And this is the kind of language that's
used here and not so much in the other

624
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:31,284
books.

625
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:36,380
So let's isolate now some of the major
themes of Deuteronomy before we close our

626
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:40,620
study of the pentitude. First
of all, if I, as I've mentioned,

627
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,980
the centralization of the cult, that's
a key theme in the book of Deuteronomy.

628
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,750
And I had very important effects.

629
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:51,150
It brought Judy and religion closer
to monotheism because you have the

630
00:37:51,151 --> 00:37:56,151
insistence of I'm worshiping one God in
his one central sanctuary sacrifice was

631
00:37:58,081 --> 00:38:00,870
offered only on pilgrimage to Jerusalem,

632
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:06,710
which meant that slaughter of animals
for meat in the countryside no longer has

633
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:11,770
a sacred component to it. It's just
ordinary, common profane slaughter. Um,

634
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,780
there's evidence that that wasn't true
before this reform that if you wanted to

635
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:19,740
kill an animal for me, you kind of kind
of a make shift alter out there in the,

636
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:22,840
in the field. Um, and you
would pour out the blood and,

637
00:38:22,841 --> 00:38:26,610
and give it back to God and so on. You
might still pour out the blood obviously,

638
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:29,310
but there was previously a
more sacred element to it.

639
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,390
Now slaughter in the countryside
was simply common profane slaughter.

640
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,570
As a result, you have a lot of
rural Levi's were out of business.

641
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:41,440
Now a lot of people who would
have officiated at local
shrines and they are out

642
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:42,190
of business,

643
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:46,480
that probably explains the
fact that Deuteronomy makes
special provision for the

644
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:51,340
Levi's send includes them in
it's uh, in legislation, um,

645
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:52,810
sort of social welfare legislation.

646
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:56,580
There are provisions that are made for
the Levi's who are not going to be able

647
00:38:56,581 --> 00:38:58,780
to earn their income anymore.
These local shrines.

648
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,620
So many of them would have gone up to
Jerusalem and real tensions going to

649
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:06,980
develop between the Jerusalem
priests and this class of Levi's, um,

650
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,570
who are newcomers and we'll see some of
that tension played out in some other

651
00:39:10,571 --> 00:39:14,800
texts. So centralization of the cult
and that has some social ramifications.

652
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,640
We also have the, a sort of a
greater abstraction of the deity.

653
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,240
Is this something many people pointed
to in the book of Deuteronomy because

654
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:24,070
Deuteronomy and books
that are related to it,

655
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,540
those that are going to
follow consistently refer to
the sanctuary as the place

656
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:31,750
where Yahweh chose to
cause his name to dwell.

657
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:36,580
God isn't said to God himself,
isn't said to dwell in the temple,

658
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,550
nor is the temple described
as a house of God.

659
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:44,560
The temple is always the dwelling of his
name. The house is built for his name.

660
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:49,990
Weinfeld asserts that this is in order
to combat the ancient to popular belief

661
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:52,120
that God actually dwells in the sanctuary.

662
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:57,010
Likewise to eradicate or guard against
the idea which is implicit in earlier

663
00:39:57,011 --> 00:40:00,790
sources that God sits enthroned
on the the, on the crew team,

664
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:03,250
on the chair of beam who guard has arc.

665
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:08,560
Deuteronomy emphasizes that the function
of the arc is exclusively to how's the

666
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:11,770
tablets, the tablets of the covenant.
That's its purpose. They are,

667
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:14,290
cover isn't mentioned.
The Cherubim aren't mentioned.

668
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:18,550
We don't have the image of
this as a throne with the
archis God's footstool. Um,

669
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:22,030
so it seems to be a greater
abstraction of the deity. Um,

670
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:27,280
some abstraction is also apparent in
the shift from visual to oral imagery in

671
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:30,100
describing God's self
manifestations or theophanous.

672
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,550
One hears God but one doesn't
see God in Deuteronomy.

673
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,180
And that's very different from earlier
texts where we're seeing a sort of a

674
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:38,860
cloud in case fire and so on.

675
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:45,390
So the sanctuary is understood to be a
house of worship as much as it is how a a

676
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:50,460
cultic center in which is what lights
and foreigners alike may deliver prayers

677
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:55,120
to God who dwells in heaven. So he is
in heaven. This is a place of worship.

678
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,270
That's not to say that
sacrifices abolished,

679
00:40:58,271 --> 00:41:02,110
it's not to say the sacrifice isn't
important to Deuteronomy very far from it.

680
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:04,870
It's an essential part of
God's service for Deuteronomy.

681
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,400
But Deuteronomy is less interested
in cultic matters. And in any event,

682
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:12,760
it focuses on when it
focuses on sacrifices,

683
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:17,560
it focuses on a different
aspect of those sacrifices.

684
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,940
The sacrifices it talks about consists
primarily of offerings that are consumed

685
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:26,320
by the offer in the sanctuary
or are shared with the
disenfranchised in some way.

686
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,440
The leave Eit, uh, the
alien resident, the orphan,

687
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,150
the widow portions are given to them.

688
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,840
So by emphasizing the obligation
to share the sacrificial meal with

689
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:39,080
disadvantaged members of
society, Deuteronomy, uh,

690
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:43,480
almost gives the impression that the
primary purpose of the sacrifices is

691
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,800
humanitarian or at least personal,

692
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:49,850
the fulfillment of a religious obligation
or the expression of gratitude to God

693
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:50,241
and so on.

694
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,660
These are aspects of the sacrifices
that are emphasized in Deuteronomy.

695
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:59,290
Deuteronomy also emphasizes social
justice and personal ethics and neighborly

696
00:41:59,361 --> 00:42:00,380
responsibility.

697
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,880
God's own righteous behavior
on behalf of the week.

698
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,210
And the oppressed is a model
for Israel's righteous behavior.

699
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,450
God assists the orphan,
the widow and the stranger,

700
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,650
and that's the basis of Israel's
a injunction to assist them. Also,

701
00:42:15,651 --> 00:42:20,000
it's the basis for the humanitarianism
that I mentioned earlier that seems to

702
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:24,900
run through the laws of Deuteronomy
12 through 26. Uh, further theme.

703
00:42:24,901 --> 00:42:29,901
And Deuteronomy is the fact
that the covenant concept
entails the idea that each

704
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:35,381
generation of Israelites understand itself
as having been bound with God in the

705
00:42:35,871 --> 00:42:38,960
original covenant. So in Deuteronomy
five versus two to three,

706
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:42,140
the Lord our God made a
covenant with us at Horeb Sinai.

707
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:46,310
It was not with our fathers that the
Lord made this covenant, but with us,

708
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,380
the living,
every one of us who is here today.

709
00:42:48,381 --> 00:42:50,420
Now this is interesting because
remember this is a generation.

710
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:53,570
The generation has died off that
saw the exodus and Sinai, right?

711
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,120
So these are the children now and
they're saying, no, it was with us.

712
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,010
Every one of us who is here today.

713
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,790
So every generation of Israel is to
view itself as standing at the Sacred

714
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,800
Mountain to conclude a covenant with God.

715
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,860
And that decisive moment
has to be made ever present.

716
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,790
That's a process that's facilitated
by the obligation to study,

717
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:13,970
to study the laws, to recite them
daily, to teach them to your children.

718
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,750
These are instructions that are
contained in Deuteronomy. Moreover,

719
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:22,960
Deuteronomy 31 proclaims
that every seventh year the
Tara is to be read publicly

720
00:43:23,421 --> 00:43:27,380
the entire thing. And
Weinfeld argues that, uh,

721
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:31,790
where many ancient near eastern cultures
direct the king to write the laws for

722
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:34,310
himself to read them.
It's only in Israel.

723
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,940
He's yet to find a parallel is only in
Israel that the law is a manual for both

724
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:41,120
the king and the people is
to be proclaimed and metal
out to the people on a

725
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:42,770
regular basis every seven years.

726
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,580
Further theme of Deuteronomy
is the emphasis on love.

727
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:51,590
Weinfeld points out that the Assyrian
treaties stress the vassals love for the

728
00:43:51,591 --> 00:43:52,424
crown prince,

729
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:57,170
but there's never a reciprocal love
by the crown prince for the vassal and

730
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:58,730
Deuteronomy differs in this respect.

731
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:03,410
Deuteronomy emphasizes God's gracious
and undeserved love of Israel and that's

732
00:44:03,411 --> 00:44:05,930
expressed in his mighty
acts on Israel's behalf.

733
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:10,370
The deuteronomist makes it clear
that God's great love should awaken a

734
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:14,960
reciprocal love on Israel's
part love of God, love of God.

735
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,520
Here it really means a loyalty.

736
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:20,090
The word that is used as a word
that stresses loyalty, love,

737
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:22,610
and loyalty are mere abstractions.
However,

738
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:27,320
without some sort of vehicle for their
expression and the vehicle for the

739
00:44:27,321 --> 00:44:29,390
expression then is God's Torah,

740
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:34,110
the sum total of God's and instructions
and laws and guidelines which are

741
00:44:34,111 --> 00:44:37,530
supposed to ensure long life
and prosperity in the land.

742
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,630
That idea is found in a very
important passage known as the Schema.

743
00:44:42,631 --> 00:44:47,250
This is a passage that's really a
central expression of the love of God in

744
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:48,084
Israel,

745
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:53,700
and it's been singled out as an essential
part of the Jewish liturgy at a very

746
00:44:53,701 --> 00:44:56,340
early,
early stage and continues to this day.

747
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,060
It's a so-called because of
the first word of the passage.

748
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:03,990
It's in Deuteronomy six it begins in
verse four and the first word is here.

749
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,100
Shema, hear, oh, Israel.
Yeah. Hawaii is our God.

750
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,180
Yahweh alone.

751
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,630
You shall love the Lord your God with
all your heart and with all your soul and

752
00:45:12,631 --> 00:45:16,290
with all your might take to heart these
instructions with which I charge you

753
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:18,600
this day.
Impress them upon your children.

754
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,020
Recite them when you stay at home and
when you are away, when you lie down,

755
00:45:22,021 --> 00:45:22,854
and when you get up,

756
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,670
buying them as a sign on your hand
and let them serve as a symbol on your

757
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:30,780
forehead and scribe them on the doorposts
of your house and on your gates.

758
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:34,440
So love and loyalty is to,
God is the foundation of the Tara.

759
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:36,930
But Tara is the fulfillment
of this love and loyalty,

760
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,660
studying it and observing it and
teaching it and transmitting it.

761
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,830
Another key idea that occurs
in Deuteronomy is the idea
of Israel as the chosen

762
00:45:43,831 --> 00:45:47,420
people.
This is what we've,

763
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,070
we find it here for the first time.
Um,

764
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,600
it's an expression of the particularity
of Israel and its unique relationship

765
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:58,920
with God and that uniqueness is expressed
by this term [inaudible] which means

766
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:02,190
to elect or to choose.
This is the first time we encounter this.

767
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:07,620
Yahweh has chosen Israel in an act of
freely bestowed grace and love to be his

768
00:46:08,971 --> 00:46:09,870
special property.

769
00:46:09,871 --> 00:46:14,871
Deuteronomy 10 verse 14 Mark The heavens
to their utter most reaches belong to

770
00:46:15,301 --> 00:46:17,340
the Lord, your God, the earth
and all of that is on it.

771
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,030
Yet it was to your fathers that the Lord
was drawn in his love for them so that

772
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:26,031
he chose you are lineal descendants from
among all peoples as is now the case.

773
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,590
This idea may be rooted in the ancient,

774
00:46:28,591 --> 00:46:32,190
near each in ancient near eastern
political sphere in which sovereigns would

775
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:35,700
single out vassals for the status
of special property. In effect,

776
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:38,010
the word used is a word
we do find an exodus,

777
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:42,530
but Deuteronomy contains
statements of National Pride, um,

778
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,700
national exaltation.

779
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:50,270
And unlike the priestly materials which
portray holiness as a future goal to be

780
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:53,880
attained through the
observance of God's Torah,

781
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:56,940
you shall be holy to me by
doing the following things.

782
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:02,240
Deuteronomy speaks of Israel as holy
now and thus bound to the observance of

783
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:06,060
God's Torah because of their holiness.
You are a holy people to me.

784
00:47:06,061 --> 00:47:08,940
Therefore you should do so to put it,

785
00:47:08,941 --> 00:47:12,840
and this is perhaps to put it too
crudely for p for the priestly source,

786
00:47:12,841 --> 00:47:16,860
holiness is a goal to be attained
through obedience to God's Torah.

787
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:18,480
For Deuteronomy,

788
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:23,070
holiness is a status to be lost
through disobedience to God's Torah.

789
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:24,331
When we come back,

790
00:47:24,331 --> 00:47:27,750
I just want to finish up with one or
two last comments about a couple of key

791
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:28,860
ideas or themes.

792
00:47:28,861 --> 00:47:32,110
And before we move on to the beginning
of the Deuteronomistic history that

793
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:36,050
starts in Joshua, this coming
week you'll be having, um,

794
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:40,720
midterms as part of your section meeting.
And in addition, at 6:00 PM tonight,

795
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:45,520
I'll be making the essay
question available online
and if it gets to six oh one

796
00:47:45,521 --> 00:47:48,730
and there's nothing online,
somebody called me real fast. Okay.

797
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:53,290
All right, good. Thanks. Then good
luck with the, with the exams.
