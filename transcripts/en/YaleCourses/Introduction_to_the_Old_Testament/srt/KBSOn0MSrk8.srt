1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,500
We were talking last time about evidence
of the use of different sources in the

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:07,340
biblical text.
And I mentioned Richard Seaman,

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,350
who was the first to argue that perhaps
Moses wasn't the author of the entire

4
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:11,440
Torah.
Uh,

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,140
in the mid 18th century fella named John
as through first notice the use of the

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:21,000
name Yaffe way in certain stories and
passages and the name Elohim and others.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,930
And on this basis,
uh,

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,850
he came and others came to identify what
I've come to be known as the j and east,

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,320
uh, sources Jay being pronounced.
Yeah. In German, right as a y.

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,580
So we, a Yak way is spelled with a
j. So the j and the east sources.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,780
Now as stroke actually happened to
maintain the idea of mosaic authorship.

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,370
He argued that Moses was drawing
from two separate long documents,

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,400
which he identified as j and d.
Um,

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,890
they use different names for God and he
was drawing on those in his composition

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,530
of the Torah.
But in the next century,

16
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:57,531
his work would be expanded by Germans
who identified other sources that made up

17
00:00:57,811 --> 00:01:00,600
the pentitude, especially the
first five books of the Bible.

18
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:05,601
Especially in an 1878 we have the classic
statement of Biblical source theory,

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,730
uh,
published by Julius vel housing.

20
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,390
He wrote a work called the history of
Israel and he presented what is known as

21
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:14,610
the documentary hypothesis.

22
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:17,070
Now you've read a little bit about
this in your source readings,

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,960
but it's the hypothesis that
the historical or narrative
sections of the Bible,

24
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,110
genesis and and stretching on really
through second kings is comprised of four

25
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,280
identifiable source documents that have
been woven together in some way and he

26
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:37,050
argued that these documents date two
different periods and reflect very

27
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:38,940
different interests and concerns.

28
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,270
These four prior documents he says,

29
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:47,271
were woven together by somebody or
some group of somebodies to form the

30
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:52,491
narrative core of the Bible and Vel
Hausen argued that these sources therefore

31
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:57,801
do not tell us about the
times or situations they
purport to describe so much as

32
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:03,690
they tell us about the beliefs and
practices of Israelites in the period in

33
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:05,340
which they were composed.

34
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:08,250
This is going to be an important
claims is an important predicate of the

35
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:09,750
documentary hypothesis.

36
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,770
So although the sources claim to talk
about events from creation actually

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,440
forward a bell houses says no,

38
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,470
they really can only be used to tell us
about the beliefs and religion of Israel

39
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:26,130
from the 10th century, which is when
he thinks the oldest was written and,

40
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:31,110
and forward. Now his work created
a sensation. It undermined,

41
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,300
of course, traditional claims
about the authorship of God and,

42
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:36,270
and the work of Moses.

43
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,010
It's still disputed by
conservative groups. Um, and
Roman Catholic authorities.

44
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:44,790
Although Roman Catholic scholars,
I'm certainly teach it, um,

45
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,480
and adopted the four sources that
were identified. My vel Hausen are,

46
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:51,180
as I said,
the j source and the source,

47
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:55,380
but also p the priestly source and d,

48
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,560
which is primarily the book of
Deuteronomy. Now, as I said,

49
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:02,920
the first two sources are named because
of the names of God that they employ.

50
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,700
But it goes a little deeper than that.
According to Jay,

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,410
the knowledge of the proper or
personal name, if you will, of God.

52
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:15,560
He halfway begins with the
first human, with the Adem. Um,

53
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,200
so already in genesis four,

54
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:20,230
a damn seems to know this name
and refer to God by this name.

55
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,440
If we look at other sources such
as p and even e, uh, Yaffe ways,

56
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,800
name is not known to humankind until
he chooses to reveal it to Moses.

57
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,630
And this happens in the time
of the exodus. So in exodus
six versus two to three,

58
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,540
which is assigned by source critics to
the piece, or it's the priestly source,

59
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,090
God appears to Moses and he tells them,
tells Moses then that he is Yahweh.

60
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,250
He says, I appeared to Abraham, Isaac,

61
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:52,150
and Jacob the Patriarchs
before you as El Shaddai,

62
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,910
but I did not make myself known
to them by my name. Yeah. Anyway,

63
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,780
so the piece where it has a different
sort of theology, if you will,

64
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:02,650
of God's name or the revelation of God's
name and the same sort of thing happens

65
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:05,860
in exodus three,
verses 13 to 16,

66
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:07,780
and that's assigned to the east source.

67
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,940
So once you've identified rough blocks
of material according to not just the

68
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:13,980
name of the DD,

69
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,440
but also there are assumptions about
when humankind knows the name of the DDT,

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,800
then you could analyze these blocks are
chunks of texts and begin to identify

71
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:26,950
certain characteristic features.
Um, their, their, their style,

72
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:31,390
the terminology they use
and source critics were able
to come up with a list of

73
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:34,930
what they believe were the main
characteristics of the various sources.

74
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,600
So the main characteristics
of the j source,

75
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,480
which begins with the
second creation story.

76
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,470
So the j source picks up in Genesis two
verse four, second half of verse four.

77
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,920
It is that it includes, it
uses a personal name. Yeah,

78
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:51,220
I'll wait for God from the
time of creation and that
will be in your bibles as

79
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:55,150
Lord. It describes God. I'm
very anthropomorphic Lee.

80
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,500
It's the j source that has god shut
the door of the ark after Noah.

81
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,210
It's the j source that has god
smelling the sacrifice after the flood,

82
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:06,040
the sacrifice that Noah offers.

83
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,640
It's in the j source that God eats
with Abraham and bargains with him.

84
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:13,180
It's in the j source that God meets with
Moses in this mysterious passage and

85
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:15,730
tries to kill him one night.
Um,

86
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,840
Jay has a very vivid and
concrete earthy style.

87
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,450
It uses the name Sinai,

88
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,420
Mount Sinai to refer
to the place where the,

89
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,510
where the Israelites with Moses
will conclude the covenant with God.

90
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,240
As for the date,

91
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,340
well source critics felt that a clue
to the dating of the j source could be

92
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:41,341
found in the passage in which God
promises a grant of national land to the

93
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:45,370
Israelites. The boundaries of the land
are given there as the river of Egypt,

94
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,110
the Nile,
and the Euphrates.

95
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,590
And it was argued by some that those
were basically the borders of the Kingdom

96
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:54,910
of Israel under David and Solomon.

97
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,170
What to think of 1000 as
your for David and your,

98
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,740
that's basically when the monarchy begins.
All right,

99
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,500
so the beginning of the 10th century,

100
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,100
the argument is that under David
and Solomon, the empire reached the,

101
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,060
that boundary.

102
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:12,680
And so clearly this is a writer from the
10th century who's seeking to justify,

103
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,430
um, Israel's possession of its
kingdom from the river of Egypt.

104
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,460
To the Euphrates and it's presenting that
kingdom as a fulfillment of a promise

105
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:25,370
of land that God made to Israel's
ancient ancestors. And for that reason,

106
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:26,420
source critics thought,
Aha,

107
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,320
Jay must date to about the 10th century
under the time of perhaps King Solomon.

108
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,970
It also seems to reflect the
interests of the south member.

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,570
We talked about the fact briefly that
at a certain point in Israel's history,

110
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:42,440
there's a division, uh, upon the death
of Solomon and the late 10th century,

111
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,310
the kingdom,

112
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,330
the kingdom divides into a northern
kingdom now called Israel and a southern

113
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:48,740
smaller kingdom called Judah.

114
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,670
And the southern interests seem
to be reflected in the j document.

115
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,480
So source critics decided this is a
Judean document from the 10th century.

116
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,320
The source,

117
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,430
which source critics say begins
around Genesis 15 is really the most

118
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:05,360
fragmentary.

119
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:09,090
It seems to have been used to supplement
the j source rather than to be used in,

120
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:12,050
in any hole, in, in a, in a larger forum.

121
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,070
So sometimes it seems very difficult to
isolate and there's a lot of debate over

122
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:20,720
this, but the east sources characteristics
are that it uses Elohim. Again,

123
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:23,780
it's a plural form of
the word God or gods.

124
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:27,050
But when it's used with a singular verb,
it refers to the god of Israel.

125
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,890
It has a much less
anthropomorphic view of God.

126
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,900
God is more remote.

127
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:37,730
There aren't the direct face to
face revelations in the east source.

128
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,040
Most communications from the divine
are indirect. There'll be, uh,

129
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,060
through messengers or dreams,

130
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,810
and there's also an emphasis
on profits and prophecy.

131
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,580
In the East source, Miriam Moses,
they're both, uh, referred to as profits.

132
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:56,600
In the East source,
the style is more abstract,

133
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,370
little less picturesque,

134
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,420
and the source uses a different name
for the mountain where the Covenant was

135
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:06,300
concluded. It uses the name
Horeb. All right, you'll see,

136
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:07,820
you will sometimes see as
you're reading the texts,

137
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,160
they refer to Horeb
instead of Mount Sinai.

138
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,150
Or you'll see the two names
used interchangeably. And it's,

139
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,280
it's been the theory of scholars that
that's because it comes from a different

140
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:20,710
source. The source seems to be
concerned primarily with, um,

141
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,110
the northern tribes.
Then therefore the northern kingdom.

142
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:28,730
And so source theorists decided that it
was most likely composed in the northern

143
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:32,600
kingdoms. About the ninth century.
And then according to this hypothesis,

144
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:36,890
theJ and e sources were combined primarily
Jay with he being used to supplement

145
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:41,090
it probably somewhere in the eighth
century, late 18th century. Um,

146
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:44,540
and that was the backbone of
the pentitude Tukul narrative.

147
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,790
It covers the early history of humankind,

148
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,720
Israel's early ancestors known
as the Patriarchs and matriarchs.

149
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,430
Their stories are told in genesis.

150
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,640
It contained the story of Moses and the
exodus from Egypt in the book of Exodus

151
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,380
and the stories of the wandering in the
wilderness that are found in the book of

152
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:04,860
numbers and the anonymous
scribe or editor who, uh,

153
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,940
combine these sources didn't care
to remove any redundant material or

154
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:13,560
contradictory material. Um,
as we've already seen. Now,

155
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:16,680
there are two other sources
according to classical source theory,

156
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,710
and these are d and p d,

157
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,220
which is the dude or anomic source is
essentially the book of Deuteronomy.

158
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,980
And the book of Deuteronomy
differs from the narrative sources.

159
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:33,780
This is a book of speeches on the book
purports to be three speeches delivered

160
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:38,781
by Moses as the Israelites are poised
on the east side of the Jordan River.

161
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:40,980
I'm not good with directions.

162
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:44,640
I had to stop and think the east side
of the Jordan River about to enter the

163
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:48,150
promise land. Um, but according
to this source theorists,

164
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:52,170
it clearly reflects the interests
of settled agrarian life.

165
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,870
It doesn't reflect the interest of
people who've been wandering around and

166
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:58,140
automatically it has laws that
deal with settled agrarian life.

167
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,590
The main characteristic of d,
however,

168
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,950
which assisted source theorists in
fixing it's date is the following.

169
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,890
Do you use the one source in the Bible
that clearly insists that one central

170
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:16,530
sanctuary only is acceptable to gateway?

171
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,850
God cannot be worshiped
at makeshift alters.

172
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,160
God cannot be worshipped through
sacrifices at some local sanctuary.

173
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,640
All sacrifices must be offered in the
one central sanctuary where he will cause

174
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:35,370
his name to dwell.
It doesn't actually ever say Jerusalem,

175
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,240
which is why Samaritans think that it's
out meant resume and that they have the

176
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:42,510
correct temple and they are authorized
to offer sacrifices. All right?

177
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,490
They got it wrong when they
thought it was Jerusalem.

178
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,850
Samaritans think that that's where
God caused his name to dwell.

179
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,750
So Jerusalem is not actually mentioned
in Deuteronomy. That's a later reading,

180
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,230
but the place where God will cause his
name to dwell and only there at the

181
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:57,210
temple there can there be sacrifices.

182
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,150
This is a very different perspective
from other biblical books.

183
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,931
So you're going to see in the,

184
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:03,600
in the stories of the Patriarchs that
they're wandering all around the land and

185
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:06,420
they're offering sacrifices. And there
are other books too where it's clear.

186
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:08,640
There are local shrines,
local sanctuaries,

187
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,970
local priests who are offering sacrifices
for people throughout the land.

188
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,480
But Deuteronomy insist
one central sanctuary,

189
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,740
all of the outlying altars and
sacred places must be destroyed. Now,

190
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:24,741
central centralization of the cult was a
key part of the religious reform of the

191
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,600
King of Judah in six 22. I've marked a
couple of dates on the timeline up here.

192
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,920
So seven 22 is the fall of
the northern kingdom. Six 22,

193
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,160
I reform my King Josiah in Judea.

194
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,860
We read about this in one of the
historical, um, narratives, um, where,

195
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,300
uh,
the temple's being refurbished.

196
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,720
A book has found that says one
central sanctuary King Josiah says,

197
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:49,650
what have we been doing?

198
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,440
Get rid of the outline alters
everything has to be centralized here.

199
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,010
So that reform, the Josiah's reform, um,

200
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:03,150
has caused many scholars to associate
Deuteronomy the centralizing book or

201
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,610
source,
um,

202
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,650
with the late seventh century
around this time in Judah.

203
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,270
The trouble is d seems to reflect
it out of northern traditions.

204
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:16,900
The interests of tribes who were in
the north on the northern kingdom was

205
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:20,410
destroyed. And seven 22. So
this is the theory source.

206
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:22,360
Critics conclude the DS and old source.

207
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:26,980
It was originally composed in the north
and the 18th century when the northern

208
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:27,761
kingdom fell,

209
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:32,650
when the Assyrians conquered and many
Israelites would have fled to the southern

210
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:37,210
kingdom, Deuteronomy or this, the
DEA source was brought to Jerusalem,

211
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:41,350
stored in the temple where a hundred
years later it was discovered and it's

212
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,310
centralization, was put
into force by King. Josiah

213
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:51,100
p is the priestly source and that is
found mostly in the books of Leviticus and

214
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:54,730
the non narrative portions of numbers.
Now,

215
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:59,731
the major characteristics of p the
priestly source are a great concern with

216
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,520
religious institutions,
with the sacrificial system,

217
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,830
with the Sabbath, with holidays,
with rituals like circumcision.

218
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,260
The Passover dietary restrictions,
the laws of cash route,

219
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,280
the system of ritual purity and impurity,
um,

220
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,470
and also holiness, ethical holiness
and cultic or ritual holiness.

221
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,580
P does have some narrative and
you've read some of it. Genesis one,

222
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:31,450
the first creation account is
attributed to pee. It's orderly,

223
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,650
it's systematized.

224
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,010
The God is extraordinarily abstract
because in the piece source,

225
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:40,870
another characteristic is that God is
transcendent and even perhaps remote much

226
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:45,760
more so than in j for example.
Um, generally in the piece source,

227
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,690
God is concealed and
revealed only in his covered.

228
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,980
This is a word that's often
translated as glory. Um,

229
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:05,210
but what it refers to actually
is a light filled cloud. Um,

230
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,480
God seems to be the burning fire
inside this light field cloud.

231
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,430
He travels before the
Israelites in that form,

232
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,610
leading them through the wilderness and
so on. That seems to be in the piece.

233
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:17,360
Source.
P is also interested in covenants,

234
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,410
in censuses, in genealogies,
all of those sections,

235
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:25,580
very often that link stories, um,
are attributed to the piece source.

236
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,320
And because p elements often serve that
kind of function as a bridge between

237
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:34,880
stories or very often piece sources
seem to introduce a story or conclude a

238
00:14:34,881 --> 00:14:38,570
story. I'm the source. Critics
felt that priestly writers,

239
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:41,840
we're probably responsible for
the final editing of the Bible,

240
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:47,140
bringing together j and d and d and
adding their materials and finally editing

241
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:52,310
the work. Now, bell housing data,
the priestly source to a period,

242
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,300
the exit like period to the period after
the fall of the southern kingdom and

243
00:14:56,301 --> 00:15:01,301
five 86 when the Babylonians have
taken many of the Judeans into exile in

244
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:06,410
Babylon.
So p j and the narrative parts,

245
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,440
the narrative parts of P J
and e are continuous parallel
accounts of the history

246
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:16,880
of the world, if you will, from creation
until the death of Moses. Source.

247
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:20,930
Critics believe that they have a
uniform style, uniform vocabulary,

248
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:24,740
uniform set of themes,
and a chronological framework.

249
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,730
So according to Vail Housing and I've
sort of scheme Matteis to chronologically

250
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:29,750
for you up here,

251
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,830
the priestly school drew together
all of this older material,

252
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,940
added some of its own editorial
material, bridges, introductions,

253
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:42,941
conclusions inserted the large priestly
documents of Leviticus and numbers and

254
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:49,001
so the Torah and they did this sitting
in exile in Babylon and so the Torah is

255
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:54,251
really the result of five centuries of
religious and literary activity and this

256
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:55,851
of course is a very,

257
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:59,450
very different portrait from traditional
claims about the authorship of the

258
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:04,400
Pentateuch by one man Moses in
approximately the 14th century BCE.

259
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,680
There are different terms that we use
to describe the modern critical study of

260
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:14,060
the Bible in the late 19th century as
I've just described it a one term is

261
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:18,740
literary criticism because it proceeds
by closely analyzing the literary

262
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:22,490
features of the text, the
terminology, the style, the motifs,

263
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:28,060
but because the goal of this literary
critical school was to identify specific

264
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:33,260
sources, isolate sources, we also
refer to it as source criticism.

265
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,430
You'll see those terms used
interchangeably in your literature today.

266
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,120
Literary criticism has a
slightly different connotation
from what it was in the

267
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:44,690
19th century. So people prefer
the term source criticism,

268
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:48,380
but you should know both
are used because however,

269
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:53,030
the purpose of identifying and isolating
these sources was not just to say,

270
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:54,740
look at that.
There are these different sources.

271
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,920
The purpose was to ascertain as far as
possible they're relative dates to one

272
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:05,141
another and to therefore enable the work
of historical reconstruction to proceed

273
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:11,710
primarily a reconstruction of the
history of the religion of Israel and the

274
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,080
historical situation of the
authors of the different sources.

275
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:19,610
And therefore literary criticism is
not only called source criticism,

276
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:24,611
it's also called historical criticism
because it's ultimate goal and purpose was

277
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,940
not just to isolate the sources
but to rearrange them all right.

278
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,230
According to relative dates as
far as they might be ascertained.

279
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,910
And then to chart changes
in Israel, uh, uh, religion.

280
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,840
Um, you have a very readable
introduction to some of this in,

281
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:42,770
in Norman hobbles a little work,

282
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,240
another excellent work which is
not on your syllabus. That is also,

283
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:52,241
I'm critical of vel and some of the biases
in his work is found in a little work

284
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,950
called who wrote the Bible,
um, by Richard Friedman,

285
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,460
which has a great cover cause it says
who wrote the Bible? Richard Friedman.

286
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:03,740
So always, I love that.
So to sum up the dock,

287
00:18:03,741 --> 00:18:07,350
your documentary hypothesis is an effort.
It's an effort,

288
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:10,530
I hypothesis an effort to
explain the contradictions,

289
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:15,531
the doublets anachronisms and so on in
the Bible by means of hypothetical source

290
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:21,210
documents. So the theory posits
hypothetical sources, traditions,

291
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:24,990
and documents to explain the current
shape of the tour of the way we have it to

292
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:28,830
account for some of these phenomena
that we find as a next step.

293
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,570
The sources are assigned relative dates,
not absolute dates, relative dates.

294
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,680
And then they're analyzed to reveal the
different stages of Israel's religious

295
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:42,681
history and sole source criticism is also
known as historical criticism because

296
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:46,170
it's a tool for getting at the
history, not just that, the texts,

297
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:49,950
but ultimately history of Israelite
religion. That is how it has been used.

298
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,360
Now Ville House's work is
subtle and it's quite brilliant,

299
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,380
but it's certainly reflects,
um,

300
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,190
biases of 19th century German scholarship,

301
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,640
which believed strongly in the superiority
of Christianity or Judaism in his

302
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:11,460
writings about housing has some things
to say about Judaism that are none too

303
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,600
flattering.

304
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,770
He describes Judaism at the end of
the biblical period as a dead tree,

305
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,510
twisted and perverted.

306
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,650
He especially harbored
a distaste for things.

307
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:24,210
Cultic priests,

308
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,240
cult ritual in keeping with what
was going on in Germany at the time.

309
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,210
Um, and, and, and the
Protestant movement and so on.

310
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,420
And these sorts of biases
are very apparent in his
work and very apparent in his

311
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:43,551
dating of the sources and in his
description of the evolutionary stages of

312
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:45,660
Israel's religion.
So for example,

313
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,100
source critics before vel Hausen
all thought that p the priests,

314
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:52,740
the material with some of the
oldest material in the Bible,

315
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:56,400
that it was an early source, but
Bellsa they'll house and said, no,

316
00:19:56,401 --> 00:20:01,290
it must be a late source because
priestly cultic ritual material,

317
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,260
that's clearly a degenerate,
uh, stage of religion, um,

318
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,050
that that shows a sort of guilt ridden.
Um,

319
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,400
behaviorism that's not
true spiritual religion.

320
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:14,100
So clearly that's the latest,
um,

321
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:18,350
stage of Israelite religion
when it had died, uh,

322
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:23,280
and was waiting to be reborn in new
form with the arrival of someone in the

323
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:25,880
first century. Uh, so clearly a,

324
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,000
his dating of p owes a great deal to um,
his,

325
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:33,940
his biases and religious ideology.
So he saw the priests.

326
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:38,310
The material is having to come
from the like age post five 86,

327
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,600
and this is one of our houses,

328
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:42,930
most controversial points that
still hotly debated today.

329
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,320
And we're going to be turned to this
debate when we actually take a look at

330
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:49,420
Leviticus and numbers.
Um, and when we, uh,

331
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:52,810
at that time we'll be able to see what's
at stake in the whole question of the

332
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:54,130
dating of the priestly material.

333
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,240
The historical critical method and the
documentary hypothesis in particular are

334
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:03,820
not inherently biased.
I want to make that point very strongly.

335
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,240
They are simply analytical tools,
right?

336
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:11,290
Look at the text and its features and
draw some conclusions based on what you're

337
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:16,000
finding. They are simply analytical
tools. They're not inherently biased.

338
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:20,170
They can be applied fairly to the text
and they're extraordinarily useful.

339
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,130
It's just that some of the earlier
practitioners of these methods, uh,

340
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:28,120
did have ideological axes to grind
and we need to be aware of that. Um,

341
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:33,040
the documentary hypothesis works fairly
well when you have on parallel accounts

342
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:38,170
and works a little bit less well when
the accounts are interwoven because

343
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:43,030
sometimes picking apart the sources can
become dry and mechanical sometimes to

344
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:44,860
the point of absurdity.
Um,

345
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:47,740
some of the people who have
carried this method to its extreme,

346
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,730
we'll go through and almost word
for word, this is Jay. This is he,

347
00:21:51,731 --> 00:21:53,090
the next word is p.
Um,

348
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,290
it's quite remarkable how certain they
feel that they can break things down

349
00:21:56,291 --> 00:22:01,000
almost on a word toward basis as if an
editor sat there with scissors and paste

350
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:03,610
and we're cutting out word for
word and putting them together.

351
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,960
It's sometimes can reach heights of
absurdity and it can really destroy the

352
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:10,030
power of a,
of a magnificent story.

353
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,900
Sometimes when you carve it up into
pieces that on their own don't really make

354
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:14,734
all that much sense.

355
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,660
It needs to be remembered that
the documentary hypothesis
is only a hypothesis,

356
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:23,830
an important one in a useful one and
I certainly have used it myself. Um,

357
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:29,050
but none of the sources posited by
critical scholars has been found

358
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:32,830
independently. We have no copy
of Jay, we have no copy of ea,

359
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:36,010
we have no copy of p by
itself or d by itself.

360
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,270
So these reconstructions are based on
guesses. Some of them are excellent,

361
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:44,260
excellent guests is very well supported
by evidence, but some of them are not.

362
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,870
Some of the criteria
invoked for separating.

363
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:51,520
The sources are truly arbitrary
and extraordinarily subjective. Um,

364
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:55,120
they are sometimes based on all sorts
of unfounded assumptions about the way

365
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:57,220
texts were composed in antiquity.

366
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,430
And the more that we learn about how
texts in antiquity were composed,

367
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,510
we realize that it's perhaps not unusual
for a text to use two different terms

368
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:09,511
for the same thing within one story since
we find texts in the 16th 17th century

369
00:23:09,851 --> 00:23:13,090
BCE on one tablet using two sources,

370
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,230
two different terms for a story for two
different terms to which kind of the

371
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:19,130
same thing. So, um,

372
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:24,330
the criteria that are invoked
for separating sources
often ignore the literary

373
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:27,310
conventions of antiquity.
And the more that we learn about that,

374
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:31,540
the better able we are to understand
the way the biblical text was composed.

375
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,690
Repetition isn't always
a sign of dual sources.

376
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,910
It often serves a rhetorical function.

377
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,600
Variant terms aren't always
assign of dual sources.

378
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,240
They may have a literary
or aesthetic function.

379
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,660
So while most scholars today do accept
some version of bell houses theory,

380
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:51,620
yes, we feel the Bible is
composed of different sources.

381
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,060
We don't always have tremendous confidence
though in some of the finer details

382
00:23:56,061 --> 00:24:00,830
and conclusions of his work and the work
of other scholars who followed after

383
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:01,490
him.

384
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:06,490
Some doubt the existence of e altogether
it is so fragmentary and so isolated.

385
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,100
Others defend the antiquity of
p we'll be coming back to that.

386
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,570
Others argue that everything's
posted Zelig everything's
after the fifth century.

387
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:17,300
It was written in the fourth,
third century and the Persian period,

388
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:20,630
none of it comes from an older period.
Scandinavian scholars,

389
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,420
they're not enthusiastic
about source criticism at all.

390
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:26,270
The whole Copenhagen School
of Bible Scholarship, uh,

391
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,310
prefers many of them prefer to see.

392
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:31,850
The Bible is basically an oral narrative
that just grew through creation over

393
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:33,650
time. So, uh,

394
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:37,570
I did assign readings in the documentary
hypothesis is extraordinarily important

395
00:24:37,571 --> 00:24:40,250
that you do need to understand
that it is one hypothesis,

396
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:44,630
a major and controlling hypothesis out
there, but it's not without criticism.

397
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,513
Moreover,

398
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:51,260
while it's a very important and worthwhile
project to analyze the components,

399
00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:54,590
sources and examine their specific
concerns and contribution,

400
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:58,000
and you'll see that I'm a very
great fan of a fan of p, uh,

401
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,990
we must remember that whatever
sources were woven together, um,

402
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:07,310
they were woven together with great
skill and care by a final redactor or

403
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:11,660
redactors who wanted them to be read as
a unity and s and surely that must mean

404
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:15,530
something. It must mean they can
be read as a unity and, and that,

405
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:17,240
that's a challenge
that's been issued to us.

406
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,740
So the Bible can be read both
analytically and synthetically.

407
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,430
We need to combine an
awareness of origins, right?

408
00:25:25,431 --> 00:25:28,970
Not Gloss over the problems and the,
and the contradictions and say, well,

409
00:25:28,971 --> 00:25:32,330
we can resolve it by coming up with some
strange scenario that makes both things

410
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:34,100
work.
Be aware that there are problems,

411
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:36,320
contradictions these derived
from different sources,

412
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:41,240
but also be sensitive to the artistry
of the final composition. All right,

413
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:44,570
and what does it mean that both of these
elements have been retained here side

414
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:46,790
by side? What is, uh, you know, the,

415
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,090
the sum is greater than
what does the phrase,

416
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,040
the whole is greater than
the sum of the parts, right?

417
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:57,320
So keep that awareness and in the last
20 years or so, um, source criticism,

418
00:25:57,321 --> 00:25:58,250
actually 30 years or so,

419
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,730
source criticism in the conventional
sense of the analysis of,

420
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,260
of documentary sources has been
supplemented by other new and exciting

421
00:26:06,261 --> 00:26:09,380
methodologies in the study of the Bible.
And we'll, we'll see some of those.

422
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,870
I've also included as
optional reading for you.

423
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:15,590
Sometimes I'm a couple of articles
that have analyzed biblical stories are

424
00:26:15,591 --> 00:26:19,790
written by someone who thinks the
documentary hypothesis just doesn't really

425
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:20,720
help us out much at all.

426
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:25,370
And she gives some wonderful coherent
readings of stories that argue this,

427
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,700
this scene here or this contradiction
here isn't a sign of a different source.

428
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,220
It serves this literary purpose,
that literary purpose.

429
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:34,400
And I sort of put those in subversively
for you to have a look at, uh,

430
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:35,750
in your own time.
I'm there.

431
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:39,650
They're brilliantly written and they
give you insight into the various ways in

432
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:42,140
which we can read the text.
Um,

433
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:46,110
but many of the alternative methodologies
for studying the text do assume

434
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:50,820
sources even in some broad sense, if not
all the details of val houses theory.

435
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,450
So it's clear that a great deal
of Biblical scholarship owes,

436
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,110
owes its accomplishments and its
theories to the work that was done by the

437
00:26:58,111 --> 00:26:59,700
source critics of the 19th century.

438
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,130
I want to flip back to text for a moment
before I returned to talk about a whole

439
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:07,830
sort of contradictory or
a set of methodologies,

440
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,470
methodologies or methodologies
that pool in another direction.

441
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,340
But first I want to get us up to
the Patriarchs and matriarchs were,

442
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:18,000
we're going to be starting off on
Monday. We just have had a flood. Um,

443
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:23,040
and then we move into genesis 10 and
genesis 10 contains a geological table of

444
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:27,750
nations. Uh, in this
table, uh, people's, uh,

445
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:32,580
various lands are portrayed as having
descended from a common source of common

446
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:35,400
ancestor Noah through his three sons,

447
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:39,090
Yaphet and ham and Shim
a Shim Sham nights.

448
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,950
Semites Shiites are said to
descend from Noah's son Shem.

449
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:49,200
And the biblical text at this point
is understanding humanity as basically

450
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:53,580
sharing a common route,
United by a common language.

451
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:59,210
And the story that follows in genesis
11 can be understood then as an EDL

452
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:00,480
logical tale.

453
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:04,290
I had a tail that comes to
explain something in this
tail is coming to explain

454
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:06,780
the diversification of language.
When we look around,

455
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:10,530
we see that in fact people don't seem to
be that United in our infect divided by

456
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:11,640
their languages and so on.

457
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:15,000
So how are we to account for the
diversification of languages,

458
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,610
the spread of different,
um,

459
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,470
ethnic linguistic groups
throughout the lands of the earth?

460
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:23,670
If we all come from one
common creative moment,

461
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,080
one common ancestor.
So genesis 11 explains that.

462
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:33,081
And so the story is there for going to
act as a bridge between the first section

463
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:38,490
of Genesis, which is a, has a
universal scale, universal scope. And,

464
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,880
uh, what happens in Genesis
beginning in chapter 12,

465
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:46,410
where we're going to focus in on one
ethnic linguistic group and one land.

466
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,960
And this story serves as the bridge,
first of all,

467
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,620
explaining how it is that a United
humanity speaking a common language even

468
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:55,920
becomes diversified
linguistically and ethnically.

469
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:01,040
To then focus in on one
group and one land, um,

470
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,900
babble babble,
pronounce Bovell in Hebrew is Babylon.

471
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,750
The Tower in the story of the Tower
of Babel is identified by scholars,

472
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,790
is a very famous tower,
a Ziggurat,

473
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,430
a Ziggurat to Marduk in Babylon.
Um,

474
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:23,490
the bibles, hostility
to Babylon. After all,

475
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:27,300
it's going to be the Babylonians who
are going to destroy them in five 86.

476
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,600
But the Bible's hostility to Babylon
and it's imperialism is clear.

477
00:29:33,331 --> 00:29:36,240
This story has a sort of satirical tone.

478
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,860
The word babbled Bovell means gate of the,

479
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,760
but it's, um, the basis for
a wonderful pun in Hebrew,

480
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:48,800
which also actually happens
to work in English and babble.

481
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:53,150
I'm nonsensical speaking. All
right. Confusion of language. Uh,

482
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,460
and I think there's obviously
some automotive pick quality
to babble that makes

483
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:59,320
it have that kind of a meaning both in,

484
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:02,800
in the English and a
similar word and the Hebrew.

485
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,080
So this,
uh,

486
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:10,110
this word can also with a little bit
of punning main confusion or confused

487
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:11,740
language.
Um,

488
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:15,820
so this mighty tower that was obviously
the pride of Babylon in the ancient

489
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:20,620
world as represented by the Biblical
story writer as the occasion for the

490
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:22,330
confusion of human language.

491
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,360
The construction of Mark's Ziggurat
is represented as displeasing to God.

492
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,860
Why are very many possible
interpretations and uh,

493
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:37,640
our commentaries are full of
them. Um, some interpreters, uh,

494
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:42,670
view the tower builders as I'm seeking
to elevate themselves to storm heaven by

495
00:30:42,831 --> 00:30:45,560
building a tower with its top in the sky.

496
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:50,330
Others see the builders as defying
God's direct order. Remember God said,

497
00:30:50,331 --> 00:30:54,320
be fruitful and multiply and fill the
earth to spread out and fill the earth.

498
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,470
But the, these people are
said to come together, right?

499
00:30:57,471 --> 00:31:00,740
They congregate in one place and
instead of spreading out there,

500
00:31:00,741 --> 00:31:03,320
trying to rise high. Um, so, um,

501
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,320
there seems to be a real defiance
of God's design for humanity.

502
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:11,470
And so God frustrates their plan for a
self monumentalizing and he scatters them

503
00:31:12,111 --> 00:31:13,280
over the face of the earth.

504
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:18,430
He makes it more difficult for them to
do this again by confusing their tongues.

505
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,530
So once again, there's a very steep
learning curve for this God, right?

506
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:24,070
He has to keep adjusting things,
um,

507
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,090
depending on what it is
that humans are doing.

508
00:31:26,091 --> 00:31:29,060
So now he's got a confused
their languages. Um,

509
00:31:29,061 --> 00:31:34,061
some interpreters see this
story as representing a
rejection of civilization or

510
00:31:34,611 --> 00:31:38,930
certain aspects of civilization,
monumental architecture, empire building.

511
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:42,650
These are always things that are
looked upon with suspicion, uh, for,

512
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,200
for most of the biblical
sources and biblical writers,

513
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,900
those sorts of ambitions
are viewed negatively.

514
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:50,540
They lead to human self-aggrandizement.

515
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,100
They are indicative of an arrogant sort
of self reliance that the profits will

516
00:31:55,101 --> 00:31:59,180
certainly rail against. And in
some sense, a forgetting of God.

517
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:02,960
So this is a time in
which humans spread out,

518
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,460
lose their unity.

519
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,880
And this is also a time really where
they turn to the worship of other gods.

520
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,080
The first 11 chapters of genesis then
have given us a cosmic universal setting

521
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,810
for the history of Israel.

522
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,560
Those first chapters cover 2,500 years.

523
00:32:22,561 --> 00:32:26,400
If you go through and add up the
chronologies, the rest of Genesis,

524
00:32:26,401 --> 00:32:30,630
genesis 12 through 50,
we'll cover just for generations,

525
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,440
the generations of the
Patriarchs and the matriarchs.

526
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:38,790
They will be Abraham and Sarah.
They're son Isaac,

527
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:43,370
his wife Rebecca, their son Jacob
has two wives, Rachel and Leah.

528
00:32:43,371 --> 00:32:46,430
I am leaving out other, um, wives,

529
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,790
but finally their children,
12 sons and one daughter.

530
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,970
So God's focus has shifted dramatically.

531
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,840
The texts focus has shifted
dramatically. Um, why

532
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,740
when you get to the end of genesis 11,

533
00:33:00,741 --> 00:33:04,070
you feel that God has
been rather shut out.

534
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,340
A things aren't going well.

535
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:11,390
Although God created the Earth as
an intrinsically good paradise,

536
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:14,420
he created humans in his image.
He provided for them.

537
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:19,550
Humans to this point have put their
moral freedom pretty much to pour use.

538
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,730
Um, many scholars, Kaufman,

539
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:26,990
Sarna and others say that one of the
differences then between these myths of

540
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:31,070
Israel and mythologies of their
neighbors is that in ancient near eastern

541
00:33:31,071 --> 00:33:31,904
mythologies,

542
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:37,090
you have the struggle of good and evil
cosmic powers in the myths of the Bible.

543
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:42,640
This is replaced by a struggle between
the will of God and rebellious humans.

544
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,700
So these myths are telling also of a
struggle, but it's on a different plane.

545
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:50,360
Adam and Eve Cain,
the generation of the flood,

546
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,730
the builders of the Tower of Babel,

547
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:57,710
God has been continually spurned
or thwarted by these characters.

548
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,641
Um,

549
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:03,641
so he's withdrawing his focus and his
going to choose to reveal himself to one

550
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,050
small group, as if to say, okay,
you can't reach everybody then me.

551
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:10,340
See if I can just find one person, one
party, and start from there and build out.

552
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,020
And so in genesis 12,

553
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,230
which begins the second stage of the
Bible's historical narrative, um,

554
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,280
we read that God calls to Abraham to leave
the land of his father's and traveled

555
00:34:21,551 --> 00:34:26,510
to a land which God will
show him beginning a whole
new stage of the biblical

556
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:27,890
narrative. And we'll, we'll,

557
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,650
we'll sense that there's a very different
feeling when we get to genesis 12.

558
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,960
When you read that material, you'll,
it will feel different to you.

559
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,890
And because of that, we need to
talk a little bit more about, um,

560
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,790
ways to read the biblical text methods of,
of criticism and so on.

561
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:46,880
Um, in preparation for looking at the
biblical narrative material that deals

562
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,970
specifically with the Israelites,

563
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,810
we need to think of some or learn about
some of the other critical methodologies

564
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:55,640
that are used in biblical scholarship.

565
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,570
And for a moment we're going to adopt the
role of historian and I'm going to ask

566
00:34:59,571 --> 00:35:02,390
you to think like historians,
whatever that might mean. And now,

567
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,420
and as we move into next week,
and look at genesis 12 through 50,

568
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,440
the source critical method we talked
about today focuses on the hypothetical

569
00:35:11,571 --> 00:35:16,571
period of the compilation of the text
compilation of the four sources into the

570
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:20,930
Torah. But later, scholars
began to ask, well,

571
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:25,910
what about the prehistory of those
sources? What were the sources,

572
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:29,390
sources,
why should that be important?

573
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Remember that the source critics claimed
and concluded that Jep and d were

574
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:40,020
written from the 10th to
the sixth centuries and the
implication is actually not

575
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:40,711
just the implication.

576
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:44,190
The strong assertion of many of them of
them was that despite the fact that they

577
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:48,450
purport to tell of events
prior to 1000 um, in fact,

578
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,400
they're just not at all
reliable for those periods.

579
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:52,260
They were written
centuries after the fact.

580
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,610
We really can't know anything
about Israel, Israel's
religion, Israel's history,

581
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:58,500
religious history before the 10th century.

582
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:03,560
That was a very dissatisfying conclusion
to many people because the writers of

583
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:07,110
Jee p and d probably didn't sit down
at typewriters and just invent their

584
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:08,490
documents out of whole cloth.

585
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:14,400
It doesn't seem that that's the way
these materials would have been composed.

586
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,240
They didn't invent probably all of
these cultic rules and ritual practices.

587
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,530
All of a sudden it seems likely that
they were drawing on older traditions

588
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:30,420
themselves, older stories, older
customs, older laws, ritual practices,

589
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:34,290
and so scholars in the next wave of
biblical scholarship began to ask a

590
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,400
different set of questions.

591
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,660
They became interested in asking what
materials did the compiler or the

592
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:44,661
compilers of j or e or p draw on in
the composition of those sources.

593
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,570
Did they use more ancient
materials and if so,

594
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,680
can we figure out what they were and do
they contain reliable traditions from

595
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,500
for an earlier stage?
And if so,

596
00:36:55,501 --> 00:37:00,501
then maybe we do have access after
all to information regarding Israelite

597
00:37:00,931 --> 00:37:05,931
history prior to the year 1000 and so
suddenly you see an analytical approach to

598
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:09,630
the Bible that's going to pull and
the exact opposite direction from the

599
00:37:09,631 --> 00:37:11,310
classical source theory.

600
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,210
And one of the leading scholars to take
up this question was her mom go uncle

601
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,580
whose name is at the
top over there go cool.

602
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:21,300
Had a great knowledge of
the oral literature of other
cultures, other nations.

603
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:25,620
And that led him to ask can we perhaps
analyze these for literary source

604
00:37:25,621 --> 00:37:30,000
documents and figure out the pre
literary stages of their development,

605
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,000
what went into their
compilation and composition?

606
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,810
And he found support for this
idea within the Bible itself.

607
00:37:36,811 --> 00:37:41,400
Because at times the Bible seems to
name earlier sources quite explicitly.

608
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,640
We don't have records of
those sources anymore,

609
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:48,450
but they seem to be named in
the Bible in numbers 2114.

610
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,600
There's a little poetic excerpt that
gives the boundaries between Moab and the

611
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:58,590
Amorites and it's quoted and it's quoted
and it says it's from the book of the

612
00:37:58,591 --> 00:37:59,430
wars of the Lord.

613
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,090
And it's quoted as if this is a source
of the person who's drawing on and using

614
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,710
in the composition of his texts.
And it's,

615
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,790
it's quoted in a way that makes it sound
as if the source should be familiar to

616
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:09,970
the reader.
Um,

617
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:13,380
we also have mention of something called
the book of Your Shar and Joshua that's

618
00:38:13,381 --> 00:38:18,240
also quoted Joshua 10 13 or
sent in second Samuel One,

619
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,630
uh, 18. We have David
lamenting very beautiful,

620
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:24,870
the meant over the death of
Saul and his beloved Jonathan.

621
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,730
And it seems to actually be an epic song
that recounts acts of Israel's heroes

622
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:33,990
and he's reciting that now as he
laments over the death of these two.

623
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:34,800
Um,

624
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,130
and so it seems to be an earlier source
that's been put into the story of David

625
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:43,600
and his lament. So it seems reasonable in
light of the practices of other people,

626
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:47,020
other ancient cultures and literatures
as well as some contemporary literatures.

627
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,520
And it seems reasonable in light of
the explicit citation of sources in the

628
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:56,521
biblical text to suppose that in fact
the four primary documents are themselves

629
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,600
compilations from other source materials
or drawing on written or oral material

630
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:03,100
from an even earlier period.

631
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:07,000
So Gunckel began to focus on
these on small little units.

632
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:11,440
He was interested in small units
within the, the four primary documents.

633
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:15,610
And he identified genres or forms,
what he called forms,

634
00:39:15,611 --> 00:39:18,730
the German word is it got to him,
got to lung forms,

635
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:23,170
he would identify these small units
and that gave rise to the name of this

636
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:25,300
approach,
which is form criticism.

637
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:30,510
He believed that what he was doing was
identifying older pre literary forms that

638
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:35,641
had been taken up and incorporated by
the literary sources by j d p And d.

639
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,410
Examples of the kinds of
forms that got to him, um,

640
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:43,540
that he would identify where
things like a, him a proverb.

641
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:47,510
We often have biblical texts, quoting
proverbs that seemed to be focusing, um,

642
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,730
laws, rituals, folk stories
of a particular type,

643
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:57,040
poems, legends, um, songs,
fragments of mythology.

644
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,120
So for example,

645
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:02,350
he says of Genesis six verses one
through four passage that you've read.

646
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,860
When men began to increase on earth
and daughters were born to them,

647
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:09,940
the divine beings saw how beautiful the
daughters of men were and took wives

648
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:12,460
from among them that pleased them.
The Lord said,

649
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:15,670
my breath shall not abide in man
forever since he to his flesh,

650
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:20,410
let the days allowed to him be 120 years.
It was then and later too,

651
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:24,580
that the Nuffield Aleem these giants
of some kind appeared on earth when the

652
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:28,480
divine beings cohabited with the daughters
of men who bore them offspring. These,

653
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:32,740
these giants, He's and affiliate and they
were the heroes of old men of renown.

654
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:36,460
And it's this just stuck
in there in genesis six one
through four, he says this,

655
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:37,510
this is an older,

656
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,620
a fragment of a mythology or a
legend which has put into place here.

657
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:46,620
It's explaining the origin of
heroes and great men of renown.

658
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,350
And the old days. He also says that
there are ed illogical stories.

659
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:53,890
We've talked about those legends that
give the origin of a name or a ritual or

660
00:40:53,891 --> 00:40:57,910
an institution. There are different
types of EDL, illogical stories.

661
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,080
He says there are ethnological legends
that will give you the story accounting

662
00:41:02,081 --> 00:41:05,590
for the origin of a particular
people. So the Moabites, for example,

663
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:07,630
in the ammonites,
not a flattering story at all.

664
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,300
I'm following the destruction
of Sodom and Gomorrah.

665
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,060
Obviously the Israelites didn't care for
those people very much and gave them a

666
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:17,290
pretty nasty, uh, origin.
Um, we also have, um,

667
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,550
etymological legends because they're
explaining the name of something.

668
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:25,030
It's given this particular name because
of an etymological connection with some

669
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:27,010
event, um, earlier.

670
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,930
So all of these things he argues are
probably older existing traditions that

671
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:36,050
have been taken up and adapted by the
biblical writer and they may preserve some

672
00:41:36,051 --> 00:41:39,920
historical reminiscence.
More importantly,

673
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:44,950
more important than the actual events
that they might be reporting is the fact

674
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:49,340
that behind each of these
is some sort of function.

675
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:51,860
Each one of these did some
sort of cultural work.

676
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:54,380
It had some function or setting in life.

677
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,800
And that's what we can discover
when we isolate these forms,

678
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,270
this setting in life.

679
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:03,920
And that helps us learn something about
ancient Israelite society or culture way

680
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,920
before the 10th century.
That's Google's claim.

681
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:12,190
So form criticism wasn't content with
just identifying these various types of

682
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:17,750
material, these various genres.
It asked what was their function,

683
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,710
what was there sits in lave and
what was their situation in life,

684
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,690
their cultural context.

685
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:27,110
What does it tell us that we have
a large number of liturgical texts?

686
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:30,500
What does it tell us that we have a large
number of texts that seem to point to

687
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:32,330
some sort of judicial context?

688
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,600
What does it tell us that we have a
great deal of proverbs or sort of wisdom

689
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:38,870
material in certain parts of the Bible
that we might date to a certain time?

690
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:44,000
What does this tell us about society and
what people were doing growing out of

691
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:48,480
form? Criticism is tradition,
criticism. And, uh, this is, uh,

692
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:53,500
a type of criticism that focuses on the
transmission of traditional material

693
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:55,970
through various stages,

694
00:42:55,971 --> 00:43:00,971
oral stages and literary stages until
it reaches its present form in the text.

695
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:05,930
Now, you can imagine as a story
is told and then it's retold,

696
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:09,020
it is obviously changed and adapted.
Um,

697
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:10,940
tradition criticism looks at that.

698
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,790
Looking at ancient near eastern
parallels are very helpful.

699
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,360
You can see how some of those motifs
and themes were changed right in the,

700
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:21,070
in the process of being transmitted
within Israelite Culture and society. Uh,

701
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,410
and again to serve some sort of
cultural function or purpose.

702
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,760
So the present texts of the
pentitude obviously rests on a very,

703
00:43:28,761 --> 00:43:33,470
very long period of transmission, both
oral, oral recitation and transmission.

704
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:38,210
Very much like the Greek classics,
Homer's classics, the Odyssey, the Iliad.

705
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:41,900
They also had a long history of oral
recitation and transmission and were

706
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:44,510
transformed along the way.
And tradition.

707
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:48,050
Criticism likes to look at the way
people receive traditional material,

708
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:50,420
a rework it and creative ways,

709
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:54,020
and then adapt it to their own
purposes and context and transmit it.

710
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:59,370
Sometimes that process is
reflected in the Bible itself. Um,

711
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,200
traditions in one part of the Bible
will be picked up in a later part of the

712
00:44:03,201 --> 00:44:06,830
Bible and written rather differently
with a different point of view.

713
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,780
So Deuteronomy for example,

714
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:12,110
recounts events that we've
also read about an exodus.

715
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,570
And sometimes the
differences are startling.

716
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:19,520
Sometimes there are completely
new emphases and the story
can come out and to be

717
00:44:19,521 --> 00:44:21,140
a very,
very different story.

718
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:25,700
A first and second chronicles are a
retelling and a reworking of much of the

719
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:29,660
material from genesis through
second kings. And it tells that a,

720
00:44:29,661 --> 00:44:34,560
it cleans up a lot of the
embarrassing moments. Um, it
presses its own themes. Um,

721
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:39,540
and, and retelling those stories early
laws are subject to re-interpretation.

722
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,590
Ezekiel comes along and does some
interesting things with some of the legal

723
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:47,880
material that we find in Leviticus. This
is all the kind of thing that tradition,

724
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:49,200
criticism looks at.

725
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:54,201
Tradition criticism wants to uncover the
changes that occur in the transmission

726
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:58,290
of traditional material. It's already
happening. We can see it within the Bible.

727
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,370
And the assumption therefore,

728
00:44:59,371 --> 00:45:02,550
is that it's happened before the
material even gets into the Bible.

729
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,500
Perhaps we can figure some of that out.

730
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,250
And it's a process that also aids
in historical reconstruction.

731
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:12,810
So you can see after classic source
criticism which came along and sort of you

732
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:16,380
know, leveled people's interest in
anything before the 10th century and said,

733
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:20,070
all we have are these written accounts
that reflect the biases of the people at

734
00:45:20,071 --> 00:45:20,940
the time who wrote them.

735
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:26,120
You then have a rise of of of types of
scholarship that say we're not satisfied

736
00:45:26,371 --> 00:45:29,010
with that.
That's not really how literature works.

737
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,740
People don't sit down and vent
things out of whole cloth,

738
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:35,390
particularly material of this type.
It clearly has a history there.

739
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,240
Clearly drawing on sources and maybe we
can use analytical tools to figure out

740
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:42,780
something about the period that you
might think would be lost to history.

741
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:48,650
So these types of criticism
are emphasizing the real
life historical setting of

742
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:51,840
the materials that are
in the biblical sources,

743
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:54,330
their relationship to the wider culture.

744
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:58,530
That's something that earlier source
criticism didn't care too much about.

745
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:03,090
All of these analytical modes of
studying the Bible. By analytical,

746
00:46:03,091 --> 00:46:05,500
I mean sitting down and
analyzing the features,

747
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:08,250
the literary features of the text
and drawing conclusions from them.

748
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:10,770
All of these modes of examining the Bible,

749
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:15,771
most of them developed by German
scholars can be contrasted with a North

750
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:19,310
American tradition of
scholarship, which emphasized, um,

751
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:22,470
the correlation of Biblical
and archeological data.

752
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,620
I've written the name Albright.

753
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,860
William F Albright was a leading scholar
at the American School of Biblical

754
00:46:28,861 --> 00:46:33,560
studies and he was an expert in the fields
of Palestinian archeology and a Siri

755
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:34,290
ology.

756
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:39,060
He focused on illustrating the Bible with
the ancient near eastern sources that

757
00:46:39,061 --> 00:46:42,210
at that time where were newly coming
to light archeological findings.

758
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,530
And his argument was,

759
00:46:43,531 --> 00:46:46,230
and it's an argument that's to a
large degree not accepted anymore,

760
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:49,860
but his argument at the time was
that archaeology supported the basic

761
00:46:49,861 --> 00:46:52,440
historicity of biblical tradition.

762
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,020
And there are some definite
problems, however, with
viewing the Bible as history.

763
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,360
Um, there are certainly
problems with chronology.

764
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,640
It's hard to pin down
dates on a lot of things.

765
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:06,570
Many of the events were given more
than one date. A lot of the numbers,

766
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,550
the Bible tends to use ideal numbers.

767
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:13,140
It tends to use fives and multiples of
fives are multiples of five plus seven.

768
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:15,690
You have 10 generations from Adam to Noah.

769
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:17,730
You have 10 generations
from Noah to Abraham.

770
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:22,560
These things begin to raise suspicions.
We have suspicious repetitions of events,

771
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,740
things that happen to two or
more of the Patriarchs twice.

772
00:47:25,741 --> 00:47:30,070
Abraham goes into foreign territory and
tries to pass his wife off as his sister.

773
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,810
Isaac does the same thing.

774
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,550
Are these three versions of one basic
tradition that got assigned to different

775
00:47:36,551 --> 00:47:37,384
patriarchs?

776
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,260
Are we supposed to think of these as
representing three separate historical

777
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:44,260
incidents? What's the likelihood
of these things happening?

778
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,880
Is that historically reasonable?

779
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:50,290
So there are lots of reasons to feel
that biblical chronologies of the

780
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:54,580
patriarchal period are not accurate.
Historical records,

781
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:58,390
I used that phrase with uh,
some timidity,

782
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,700
but in the 20th century,

783
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:04,540
scholars of all bright school argued that
many of the traditions and the book of

784
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:08,890
Genesis contained authentic reflections
of the historical period they claimed to

785
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:11,500
deal with and they cited a
number of considerations.

786
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,660
So we'll take those up on Monday.
But I would like you,

787
00:48:13,661 --> 00:48:17,800
as you read genesis 12 and forward
and think about that material,

788
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:22,300
I'd like you to ask yourself,
is this historical writing?

789
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:25,450
Why? What criteria do I
judge historical writing?

790
00:48:25,451 --> 00:48:29,560
What do I think historical writing is?
What makes some writing historical?

791
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:32,890
What makes other writing fictional?
Where do we get these genres from?

792
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:35,590
Why is it so important to us
to figure out what this is?

793
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:37,090
Think about some of those issues,

794
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:40,420
and we'll talk a little bit more about
that as we turned to the text in genesis

795
00:48:40,421 --> 00:48:40,900
12.
