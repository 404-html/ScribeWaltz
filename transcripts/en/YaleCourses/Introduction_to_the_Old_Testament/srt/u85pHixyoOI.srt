1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,020
I'm going to go ahead now and get
started with some sixth century material,

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:09,021
which really a prophetic literature which
confronts the issues that were raised

3
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:12,870
by the destruction that's the
final destruction of Jerusalem.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,860
What was the meaning of this event and
how could it be reconciled with the

5
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:20,100
concept of Israel as God's elect?

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,970
How could such tremendous evil and
suffering be reconciled with the nature of

7
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:24,691
God himself?

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,440
This is going to be a a question that
will return in the next lecture on when we

9
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:32,580
look at the wisdom literature and the
book of job and some other texts as well

10
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:36,300
as we proceed through the rest of
the course. In classical terms,

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,000
if God is God,
then he's not good.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,510
If all these terrible things
happened and if God is good,

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,750
then he mustn't be all powerful
because he failed to prevent this evil.

14
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:49,680
So that tends to be the dilemma.
The way it's phrased now,

15
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:53,740
a Zico was a priest and he was
deported in the first deportation.

16
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:56,730
You already remember there was a
deportation of exiles and five 97.

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,930
And then the final siege
and destruction and exile,

18
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,800
deportation of exiles and five 87 is
Nico was among the deportees of five 97.

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,440
He was therefore in exile in Babylon
during the final destruction and the fall

20
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:12,120
of Jerusalem in five 87.

21
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,840
But his priestly background
in his priestly interests
are clearly reflected in

22
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:16,531
his prophecies.

23
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:20,850
He accuses the Israelites of
failing to observe cultic laws,

24
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:25,830
ritual laws, uh, and his promises for the
future. In his vision of a restoration,

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,420
we'll see center around a new temple
and a restored a Jerusalem and temple

26
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:35,040
complex. There's a striking
correspondence between his ego and,

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,240
um, and the priestly sources
in terms of language and theme,

28
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,630
particularly h the holiness code.
Now,

29
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:47,220
the prophecies in Ezekiel conveniently
and unlike many of the other prophetic

30
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:50,040
books actually follow a
fairly chronological order.

31
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,990
So the First Section of the book consists
of prophecies that were before the

32
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:59,880
final destruction between five 97,
five 87. And then beginning in 33.

33
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:03,500
It seems that we have
prophecies that followed the
destruction. We here, you know,

34
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,470
he, he gets the report of the destruction
and then we see how his tone and his

35
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:08,790
message changes.

36
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,350
So in those first 24 chapters where you
have prophecies that are delivered in

37
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:15,000
Babylon before the destruction,

38
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,360
we have three chapters that are
devoted to his call and his commission.

39
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:20,970
As a prophet,
we see his inaugural vision.

40
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:24,510
I'll come back and talk about that in a
minute as well as many other visions and

41
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,344
symbols.

42
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,940
Then you have from chapters four to 24
oracles that are condemning Judah and

43
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,870
Israel. There's some interesting
elements within this. We have, um,

44
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,340
the depiction of the coveted, which
represents God. I'm departing,

45
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:42,180
we'll talk about that text in a minute.
We also have in chapter 18,

46
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,710
a very interesting,
uh,

47
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,210
emphasis on individual responsibility
for sin will come back and touch on that

48
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:49,044
as well.

49
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,120
Chapters 25 to 32 contain Oracle's
against foreign nations just as we have in

50
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:57,090
Jeremiah and Isaiah. Um, throughout, uh,

51
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,070
is eco refers to these
nations as the uncircumcised.

52
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,250
The tone here is vengeful and,
and very gloating.

53
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,240
And these oracles have exerted a very
strong influence. On the New Testament,

54
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:09,070
particularly the book of revelation

55
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,120
after five 87 um,

56
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,650
Ezekiel prophesied and those prophecies
are contained in the latter part of his

57
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:20,170
book from chapter 33 to 48.

58
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,000
So in 33 we hear of the fall of
Jerusalem and then after that Oracle's of

59
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,100
promise and hope for the future.

60
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,410
The last chapters from chapter 40 to
48 our visions is equals visions of the

61
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:36,250
restoration, his vision of a rebuilt
temple and to rebuilt Jerusalem.

62
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,860
So the book opens with a narrative account
of a z keels call and about five 93

63
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:45,430
or so in a Jewish community
that's on the river Tebar,

64
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,480
which is a large irrigation canal
off of the Euphrates in Babylon.

65
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,100
And this is the first time that we hear
of a call of a profit outside the land

66
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,920
of Israel.
It's a remarkable vision,

67
00:03:56,921 --> 00:04:00,310
like many of the visions and the book of
Ezekiel, it has a sort of see realistic,

68
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:02,800
almost hallucinatory quality.

69
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,540
The vision itself is very reminiscent
of descriptions of by all the Canaanites

70
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:12,310
Storm God. So there's a stormy wind
and a huge cloud and a flashing fire.

71
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,890
God is writing on a kind of throne,
chariot.

72
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,400
He's enthroned above four
magnificent creatures.

73
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,430
Each of these has a human body and then
four faces the face of a human in the

74
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:26,950
face of Elian, the face of an
ox and the face of an eagle.

75
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,820
There are four huge wheels
under this throne chariot.

76
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:35,821
And they are said to gleam like barrel
beneath a vast and awe inspiring expanse

77
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:38,440
or dome which gleams like crystal.

78
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,580
Above that is the semblance of
a throne that is like Sapphire.

79
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,850
And on the throne was the semblance of a
human form or a gleaming like amber and

80
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:52,500
its fire in cased in a,
um,

81
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,130
a frame which is radiant all about.
So this Cavo,

82
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:02,131
this cloud that contains or hides
the fire that is Yahweh's presence.

83
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:06,070
That is also the term that's used in
the Torah in exodus and the priestly

84
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:08,890
sources to describe the presence
of God among his people.

85
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:13,360
This fire that's encased in a cloud,
the cuff vote in exodus 24,

86
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,680
we read that this coveted had settled on
Mount Sinai representing God's presence

87
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:21,490
in exodus 40.
This cloud covers the tent of meeting.

88
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,880
It fills the tabernacle.
So many [inaudible] sees it now.

89
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:29,881
He says that it was the appearance of the
semblance of the presence of the Lord.

90
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,480
When I be held it,

91
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:36,481
I flung myself down on my face and I
heard the voice of someone speaking.

92
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,750
Notice this language.

93
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:41,950
It was the assemblance of the appearance
of the presence is CQO wants to

94
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:45,050
emphasize the transcendent
nature of the deity. Uh,

95
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,730
he's having a vision of something which
cannot in fact be seen or perceived, uh,

96
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,370
which is a kind of paradox of
all of his visions. The profits,

97
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,210
humanity is emphasized in contrast
to this transcendent divinity, right?

98
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:01,220
And that's something that
happens throughout his ego.

99
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,190
He emphasizes his
humanity with this phrase,

100
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,250
son of man been a dumb son of man.

101
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,390
It's simply as the Hebrew term for a
mortal being as opposed to a divine being.

102
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,560
Son of man's simply means a
human, a mortal Benedum dumb
one who was like a dumb.

103
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,640
Now the call of his Cqo is reminiscent
of the call of Jeremiah and Isaiah.

104
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,640
He is sent to a nation of rebels,
rebels who will not be listening to him.

105
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,770
And his commission is symbolized by
a scroll that's handed to him. Um,

106
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,680
and we hear on the end,

107
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,630
at the end of chapter two that inscribed
on this scroll are limitations and

108
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:40,160
Durgin is and woes and he's commanded to
eat of this scroll and then go to speak

109
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:41,270
to the house of Israel.

110
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,200
So he swallows his scroll and
all of it's dreadful contents.

111
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:47,330
It tastes to him as sweet as honey.

112
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,110
And then his task is spelled
out in chapter three.

113
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,320
He is to be a watchmen one who gives
warning of danger and people will either

114
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:57,500
hate him or not,

115
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:02,501
but each one of them is ultimately
responsible for his or her own fate in a

116
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:07,931
vision in chapter eight
and Angel transports is EQL
to Jerusalem and into the

117
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:10,160
temple courts.

118
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,990
And there he sees and gives a very
vivid description of the shocking

119
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,500
abominations.
Um,

120
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,550
these are represented as justifying or
explaining the destruction of the city

121
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,640
and these, um, this do,

122
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:30,050
these descriptions are characterized by
more than the usual amount of prophetic

123
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,000
hyperbole as he watches the slaughter
and the destruction that's going on there

124
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,180
is Zeke sees the cover vode that is
the presence of Yat way arise from the

125
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:43,940
temple and move to the east chapter 10.

126
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:46,070
Then verses 18 and 19,

127
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,570
the presence of the Lord left the platform
of the house and stopped above the

128
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:51,350
cherubs.

129
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,400
And I saw the cherubs lift their wings
and rise from the earth with the wheels

130
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:56,810
beside them as they departed.

131
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,320
And they stopped at the entrance of the
eastern gate of the House of the Lord

132
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,280
with the presence of the god of Israel
above them. And then Chapter 11,

133
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:08,480
verses 23 to 25 then the presence of
the Lord ascended from the midst of the

134
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:10,670
city and stood on the
hill east of the city.

135
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,470
A spirit carried me away and brought me
in a vision by the spirit of God to the

136
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:18,680
exile community in cal Dhea.
So now he's back to Babylon.

137
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,270
And then the vision that I had seen left
me and I told the exiles all the things

138
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,680
that the Lord had shown me.

139
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:30,060
So this image draws on ancient
near eastern traditions
of God's abandoning their,

140
00:08:30,061 --> 00:08:33,740
their cities and anger, leaving
them to destruction by another God.

141
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,510
The primary difference here is that God
rather than another God is himself also

142
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:41,120
bringing the destruction.
Moreover,

143
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,860
God doesn't retire to the heavens.
He doesn't abandon his people.

144
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,250
He doesn't remain behind
with those left in Judah,

145
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,650
but he moves into exile in the book of
Ezekiel. Those left behind are guilty.

146
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:58,590
God does stay with them.
God moves east with the righteous exiles.

147
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,700
Then at the end of the book of Ezekiel,
um,

148
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,700
we're going to see a vision
of a restored temple.

149
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,960
This happens in Ezekiel 43
and here is [inaudible].

150
00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:13,860
We'll see the coveted returning from
the east and back to the temple and they

151
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:17,010
are coming from the east with a roar
like the roar of mighty waters was the

152
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:20,550
presence of the god of Israel.
And the earth was lit up by his presence.

153
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,720
The presence of the Lord entered the
temple by the gate that faced eastward and

154
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:28,830
low. The presence of the Lord filled the
temple. It was 43 verses one through six.

155
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,960
So just as the presence of divine
presence went eastward with the exile,

156
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,550
so the exiles,

157
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,320
so it will return with the
reestablishment of Israel in her home.

158
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,540
What is significant here is the idea
that God is not linked to a particular

159
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,820
place,
but to a particular people.

160
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,330
And the implication then is that God is
with his people even when they are in

161
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,164
exile.

162
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,030
So Ezekiel preached a message of
doom and judgment like his prophetic

163
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:58,830
predecessors and his contemporaries,

164
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,970
but his condemnations tend to emphasize
the people's idolatry and their moral

165
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:06,540
impurity. And this of course, makes
sense of his priestly heritage.

166
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,990
His denunciations of Jerusalem are among
the most lurid and violent that you'll

167
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:14,790
find in the Bible.
Again,

168
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:18,000
these prophecies were likely delivered
between the two deportations,

169
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:21,120
between five 97 and then the
final destruction and deportation,

170
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:26,121
and five 87 five 86 and his ego
warns that Jerusalem will fall,

171
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,230
deservedly. He says that rebellion against
Babylon would be treason against God.

172
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:36,710
He employs all kinds of very vivid
metaphors to describe Israel situation.

173
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:41,340
Jerusalem, he says is [inaudible]
sister, except even more vile.

174
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,060
Jerusalem is a vine,
but a wild one or I burned one.

175
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,690
She produces nothing of
use. Purity language, uh,

176
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,400
is employed metaphorically
throughout Ezekiel.

177
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,900
Jerusalem has been utterly defiled
and there are all sorts of images that

178
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:57,720
inspire revulsion in these chapters.

179
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,630
So destruction is the
only possible remedy.

180
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,350
There are metaphors of sexual
promiscuity throughout the book.

181
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,180
Gods destruction of Israel is figured
as the abuse doled out by an insanely

182
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:14,070
jealous husband who is violent. And the
images are disturbing. They're haunting,

183
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:18,540
they're quite nightmarish. Ezekiel
also engages in various, um,

184
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,860
dramatic, um, signs, prophetic signs
or actions to convey his message.

185
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:25,170
It's something that we've seen
in some of the other profits,

186
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,260
but his are so bizarre and
so extreme sometimes, uh,

187
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:30,270
that he was accused of insanity.

188
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,660
He cooks his food over a fire of human
excrement as a symbol of the fact that

189
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:40,590
those besieged by Nobel book nets,
Netzer will be forced to eat unclean food.

190
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,671
He doesn't.
More.

191
00:11:41,671 --> 00:11:44,820
And when his wife dies in order
to illustrate the fact that yeah,

192
00:11:44,821 --> 00:11:49,410
we will not mourn the loss of his temple,
he binds himself in ropes.

193
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,000
He lies on his left side,

194
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:55,450
390 days to symbolize the hundred
90 years of exile of Israel.

195
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,680
And then he lies on his right side for
40 days to symbolize the length of Judas

196
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:02,020
captivity,
which he says will be 40 years.

197
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,500
Neither of these terms of
captivity turn out to be correct,

198
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:10,210
but finally he shaves his beard and
his hair and he burns a third of it.

199
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,510
He strikes a third of it with his sword
and he scatters a third of it to the

200
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:17,470
winds. He just keeps a few
hairs bound up in his robe.

201
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,520
And this is to symbolize the destruction
of a third of the people by pestilence

202
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:22,354
and famine,

203
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,620
a third of the people by violence
and the exile of a third to Babylon.

204
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,340
A only a few will God allow to escape.

205
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,650
And CQO makes it clear that those
who ignore the warnings are doomed.

206
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,450
Those who he'd will be spared.
And in this,

207
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:45,070
he sounds the theme of
individual responsibility
that is so characteristic of

208
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:45,963
Ezekiel.

209
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,740
Want you to listen to the following
passage and compare it to our think about

210
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,030
other verses or terms in the Torah that
you've studied that may relate to the

211
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:57,730
same topic. How is he, uh,

212
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,350
modifying those earlier ideas?
This is all from chapter 18,

213
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:05,950
various versus throughout.
The word of the Lord came to me.

214
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,730
What do you mean by quoting this
proverb upon the soil of Israel,

215
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,710
the parents eat sour grapes and their
children's teeth are blunted as I live,

216
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:15,700
declares the Lord God.

217
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,610
This proverb shall no longer
be current among you in Israel.

218
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,070
Consider all lives are mine.

219
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,950
The life of the parent and the
life of the child are both mine.

220
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,680
The person who sins only he shall die.

221
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,620
A child shall not share the
burden of a parent's guilt,

222
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,620
nor shall a parent share the
burden of a child's guilt.

223
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,680
The righteousness of the righteous
shall be accounted to him alone,

224
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,220
and the wickedness of the wicked shall
be accounted to him alone. Moreover,

225
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,180
if the wicked one repents of all the
sins that he committed and keeps all my

226
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:46,750
laws and does what is Justin Wright,
he shall live. I shall not die.

227
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,070
Is it my desire that a wicked
person shall die, says the Lord God?

228
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,930
It is rather that he shall turn back from
his ways and live so to if a righteous

229
00:13:55,931 --> 00:13:59,710
person turns away from his righteousness
and does wrong practicing the very

230
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:02,800
abominations that the wicked
person practice shall he live.

231
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,760
None of the righteous deeds that he
did shall be remembered because of his

232
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:10,960
treachery he has practiced and the
sins he has committed because of these,

233
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,050
he shall die.
Be assured o house of Israel.

234
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,220
I will judge each one of you according
to his ways, declares the Lord God.

235
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,310
Repent and turn back from
all your transgressions.

236
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,980
Let them not be a stumbling
block of guilt for you.

237
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,910
Cast away all the transgressions by which
you have offended and get yourselves a

238
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:30,310
new heart and a new spirit
that you may not die.

239
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:34,180
O House of Israel for it is not
my desire that anyone shall die,

240
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,690
declares the Lord God.
Repent. Therefore and live,

241
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:43,090
it's an important Torah idea that is
EQL is rejecting or contradicting here.

242
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,020
And that's the Torah principle of
collective or even intergenerational

243
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,560
punishment. It's found most
famously in the second commandment,

244
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,530
the declaration that God
punish his children for the
sins of their fathers under

245
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:55,700
the fourth generation.

246
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,110
Now we need to note that we're talking
about divine justice here and not human

247
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:00,800
justice.

248
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,800
As we saw in our study of Biblical law
in the sphere of human justice only the

249
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:10,740
guilty or punished in Israelite
law, um, you don't have, um, uh,

250
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,850
you know, literal punishment.
Someone kills someone's son,

251
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,480
then their son is put to death.
That idea is rejected in biblical law,

252
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:20,780
but God operates according
to a different principal,

253
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:23,210
a principal of collective responsibility.

254
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,930
And that principle is understood in
the early sources quite positively,

255
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,090
that the sins of the fathers are visited,

256
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,870
visited upon the children is
an expression of God's mercy.

257
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:38,170
Exodus 34 verses six and seven
describes God as merciful and Gracious,

258
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:43,580
slow to anger and abounding in steadfast
love and faithfulness and that and thus

259
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:47,540
tolerating sin, though not completely
clearing the guilty as a mercy.

260
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:51,680
He spreads out the punishment over
three or four generations. Right?

261
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,100
So this notion is tied up with
the aspect of God's mercy.

262
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,580
But evidently there are
some who found this idea,

263
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:03,530
unjust and other biblical passages try
to bring a different sense of justice to

264
00:16:03,531 --> 00:16:04,364
this picture.

265
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,420
And they emphasize that the third and
fourth generations themselves must be

266
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:12,290
wicked. Um, that seems to be the
case in exodus 20 verse five,

267
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,240
the Book of chronicles, which is a
rewrite of the historical material,

268
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:19,220
the historical narrative
in the book of Kings,

269
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,700
rewrites that material in a manner that
never explains a catastrophe on the

270
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,940
basis of guilt incurred by someone
other than the one experiencing the

271
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:30,500
catastrophe.
In other words,

272
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:35,501
it rejects the Deuteronomistic
historians device of delayed punishment,

273
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,920
which you already remember,
we discussed.

274
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,900
It changes the narrative account so that
no one suffers for a crime committed by

275
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:42,501
someone else.

276
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:47,060
It isn't the sin of an earlier generation
that's finally visited upon, you know,

277
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,310
a grandson or a king
of a later generation.

278
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,420
So it seems that after five 86 or
certainly in [inaudible] case, uh,

279
00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:00,430
some accepted the idea that the nation
was suffering because of the accumulated

280
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:04,640
guilt of previous generations,
notably the deuteronomist,

281
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:09,641
but for others like is [inaudible]
the idea of accumulated guilt and

282
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:14,570
intergenerational punishment seemed
to lose some of its explanatory power

283
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,740
perhaps because the,

284
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:20,180
the destruction and the exile seem to
devastating least severe punishments that

285
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:22,700
didn't fit the individual crimes.

286
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:27,650
So as [inaudible] is one who rejects the
doctrine of collective responsibility

287
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,880
in the operation of divine
justice in chapter 18,

288
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,530
he responds to the idea of suffering
for the sins of one's ancestors by

289
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:39,260
declaring that God isn't going
to work that way anymore,

290
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:41,780
God will no longer punish people.
Collectively,

291
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:46,700
each one will be judged individually
only this center will be punished and

292
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:51,630
that's a major departure from exodus
34 and even from the contemporaneous

293
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,070
Deuteronomistic view.

294
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,100
And at this point I think we would do
well to remind ourselves of the nature of

295
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:01,260
the biblical text.
And they,

296
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:05,160
in the opening lecture I asked you to
set aside certain presuppositions about

297
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:06,030
the biblical text.

298
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:10,680
One of them is that it is a uniform or
unified text with a single doctrine or

299
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:15,390
theology. I asked you to remember that
the Bible isn't a book, it's a library.

300
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:19,770
It's a library of works that originate
in vastly different historical periods,

301
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:24,270
vastly different historical situations
and responds to a variety of shifting

302
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:29,271
needs and events and reflects a range of
perceptions about God and his relation

303
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,140
to creation and to Israel.

304
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,200
It isn't a book of theology that is to
say rational argumentation in supportive

305
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,890
certain doctrines about God.

306
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,400
And it most certainly doesn't speak with
a single voice on points of theology or

307
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,760
matters that are of traditional
concern to the discipline of theology.

308
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,430
Doctrine isn't it's concern,

309
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,170
understanding and making sense of
the historical odyssey of the nation,

310
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:58,560
of Israel in covenant with God.
That is its concern.

311
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:03,210
And so we're going to find many different
interpretations of the meaning of that

312
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:06,930
history and the nature of that God
and the meaning of that covenant.

313
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,900
And certainly there are some
basic points of agreement,

314
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,430
but even some of the most basic points
of agreement do not pass without some

315
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:16,920
contest station. So, for example,

316
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,950
the basic point that humans
are free moral agents.

317
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:24,030
This seems to be clearly
assumed throughout most of
the books of this little

318
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,864
library,

319
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,770
but there are some isolated episodes
that would appear to contradict even that

320
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:33,030
most basic assumption. God Hardens
Pharaoh's heart, God's seals,

321
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:36,270
the people's ears sometimes so that
they will not hear the message of the

322
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:39,030
profits or will not understand
them until a later day.

323
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,570
To be sure there are only a few
of these contradictory passages,

324
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:43,860
but they do exist.

325
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:49,070
And so here we find also a major shift
in the exotic period away from the

326
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:54,270
tendency to see divine justice working
through collective or intergenerational

327
00:19:54,271 --> 00:19:58,080
punishment to the idea of the individual,

328
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,590
the individual's culpability before God.
I shouldn't say a shift away.

329
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:05,160
We see a rising a dialectic, right?
This isn't a linear progression.

330
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:08,970
These are different ideas coming out at
different times and receiving emphasis

331
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:09,870
at different times.

332
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:15,140
But this kind of polyphony then didn't
impinge upon the authority of the Hebrew

333
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:21,231
Bible for the nation of Israel because
the Bible's authority doesn't arrive from

334
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:26,370
some suppose it consistency or universal
quality. That's a modern notion.

335
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,400
And it's based on Hellenistic ideals
of truth as singular western culture

336
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,970
influenced by Greek philosophical
traditions defines truth,

337
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,240
truth in monistic terms only that which
contains no contradiction is true.

338
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:43,800
And only that which is
true is authoritative.

339
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:49,370
Those notions are somewhat alien to
the ancient non hellenized world.

340
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,440
The Bible doesn't strive to
present philosophical truth.

341
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:58,590
It presents the best efforts of sages and
profits and scribes and visionaries to

342
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:04,921
respond to and to explain the crises of
the nation over a period of centuries.

343
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,920
And it's authority derives from the
explanatory power of its insights into and

344
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:16,360
understanding of God's governance of
the world and his plans for Israel.

345
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,160
So those insights and those
understandings may shift and even stand in

346
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:22,540
contradiction with one another,

347
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:26,680
but they're not mutually exclusive and
they're contradictions don't affect their

348
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:28,780
authority,
their ability to explain,

349
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:32,320
to console their ability to
nourish the faith of a people,

350
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,570
convinced that God
would never desert them,

351
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,410
no matter how difficult it may be to
understand his interactions with them

352
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,240
back to a Zico. Now. And in chapter 33,

353
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:48,270
we learned that a fugitive from Jerusalem
brings news of the fall of Jerusalem.

354
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,520
So it's a about five 80,
75,

355
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:55,450
86 and when he hears this
is the Keel exchanges,

356
00:21:55,451 --> 00:22:00,451
his message of doom for a message
of hope before the fall of the city,

357
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:03,790
his task had been to shatter
the people's illusions.

358
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,880
You wanted to shake them
out of their complacency,

359
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:12,070
but now reduced to
despair. Um, and remorse.

360
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,960
The people are reduced
to despair and remorse.

361
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:18,961
And his task is to offer reassurance
and hope God is going to initiate a new

362
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:24,220
beginning.
Though Israel's punishment was deserved.

363
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,800
It was not according
to his own [inaudible],

364
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,210
a sign of the end of the relationship
between you halfway and his people.

365
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,230
And a new Israel would rise from
the remnant of Judah and Israel.

366
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,240
And he expresses this restoration by
means of many metaphors and visions.

367
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,660
So chapter 34 condemns the shepherds.

368
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:46,780
This is a very common ancient near
eastern metaphor for the leadership of the

369
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:48,790
people at King is always
a shepherd and so on.

370
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,090
So chapter 34 condemns the shepherds
of the people and promise this,

371
00:22:53,091 --> 00:22:55,270
this promises to set up in the future,

372
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,900
one shepherd of the house of David
to be prince among the people.

373
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,060
Chapter 36 uses metaphors
of purity and cleansing.

374
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,180
Israel will be cleansed from
the impurities of the past.

375
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,880
She'll be given a new
covenant of the heart.

376
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:14,910
This is verses 24 and 25 and chapter 36
I will take you from among the nations

377
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,170
and gather you from all the countries and
I will bring you back to your own land

378
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,750
and I will sprinkle clean water upon you,

379
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,630
right pure water upon you
and you shall be clean, pure.

380
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,740
I will cleanse you from all
your uncleanness and from
all your fetishes and I

381
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,350
will give you a new heart and
put a new spirit into you.

382
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,640
I will remove the heart of stone from
your body and give you a heart of flesh

383
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,500
and I will put my spirit into you.

384
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,360
Thus I will cause you to follow my laws
and faithfully to observe my rules.

385
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,530
Those echoes here of Jeremiah also.

386
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,490
And then you shall dwell in the land
which I gave to your fathers and you shall

387
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:53,120
be my people and I will be your God.
So we have again,

388
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:57,770
this almost utopian, a redesign of
human nature that we heard in Jeremiah.

389
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,240
One in which the problems that are
associated with the exercise of free will

390
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,680
maybe obviated.

391
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,760
Another metaphor that's used for the
restoration of a new Israel out of the

392
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:14,540
remnant of the old, um, is the
metaphor of revival from death.

393
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:17,900
And this is found in chapter 37 very,

394
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:21,470
very famous passage is equals
vision of the valley of dry bones.

395
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,570
The hand of the Lord came upon me.

396
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,440
He took me out by the spirit of the Lord
and set me down in the valley and it

397
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:30,170
was full of bones.
He led me all around them.

398
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:33,320
There were very many of them spread
over the valley and they were very dry.

399
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,940
And he said to me, Oh, mortal, can these
bones live again? Have you applied?

400
00:24:37,941 --> 00:24:41,840
Oh Lord God only, you know, very
diplomatic answer. And he said to me,

401
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:45,110
prophesy over these bones and
say to them, oh, dry bones.

402
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:48,500
Hear the word of the Lord and thus said,
the Lord God to these bones,

403
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,470
I will cause breath to enter
you and you shall live again.

404
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,760
I will lay sinews upon you and cover you
with flesh and formed skin over you and

405
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:59,510
I will put breath into you and you shall
live again and you shall know that I am

406
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:04,100
the Lord. I prophesied as I had been
commanded. And while I was prophesying,

407
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,520
suddenly there was a sound of
rattling and the bones came together,

408
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,930
bone to matching bone.

409
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,560
I looked and there were sinews on them
and flesh had grown and skin and formed

410
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:13,280
over them.

411
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,400
The breath entered them and they came
to life and stood up on their feet,

412
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,550
a vast multitude. And he
said to me, oh, mortal,

413
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:24,320
these bones are the whole house of
Israel. They say, our bones are dried up,

414
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:28,490
our house is gone. We are doomed.
Prophesied therefore, and say to them,

415
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,900
thus said the Lord God,

416
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,320
I am going to open your graves and lift
you out of the graves of my people and

417
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:37,040
bring you to the land of Israel. You
shall know my people, that I am the Lord.

418
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:39,500
When I have opened your graves
and lifted you out of your graves,

419
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,370
I will put my breath into you and you
shall live again and I will set you upon

420
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:47,480
your own soil. Then you shall know that
I, the Lord have spoken and have acted,

421
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,160
declares the Lord. So in the
interpretation that follows the vision,

422
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,210
we're told that the bones symbolize
Israel. Now in this state, in exile,

423
00:25:56,211 --> 00:25:59,510
in their despair, they're crying,
our bones are dried up, were dead,

424
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,710
our hope is lost and God promises
to raise Israel from the grave,

425
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:08,600
which is the metaphor for exile and
restore her to her own land as one people

426
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,630
north and south with one
prince to rule over her.

427
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:15,580
This text is often been
decontextualized and cited as a,

428
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,880
as a old testament or Hebrew Bible
source for the doctrine of literal

429
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:22,970
resurrection after death as if it's
speaking about literal resurrection.

430
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,350
But I think in its context it's,

431
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,940
it's quite clear that it is one of many
metaphors that is equal uses throughout

432
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:33,080
this section for the redemption of
the egg of the community from exile,

433
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:38,081
the restoration of the people back in
their own land at the center of the

434
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:40,880
restored community that is Eko.

435
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:45,910
Envisions is a new Jerusalem at at its
center is a rebuilt temple and it's

436
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:51,501
described in great detail in the last
nine chapters of the book is he kills

437
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:54,180
Utopian Vision.
The land is equally allotted.

438
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:58,050
It's divided up in equally a lot of among
all 12 tribes now who will be brought

439
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:02,610
back and Jerusalem lies in the
center with 12 get great gates,

440
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:07,170
one for each tribe surrounding
it. Um, it's the, uh,

441
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,460
this temple is the source of a never
ending river that gushes forth from it.

442
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:16,380
A river that will make the Dead Sea flow
with freshwater again, uh, is the Keel,

443
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:19,170
sees Satta kite priests
presiding in the temple.

444
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:23,040
They are assisted by [inaudible] who
are just meals or sort of demoted in his

445
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:27,000
vision and he insists no
foreigners will be permitted entry.

446
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,450
And we're going to see that that's a
view that wasn't shared by others in the

447
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:31,620
post destruction era.

448
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,760
While [inaudible] believed that God would
restore a purified Israel to its land

449
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,220
under a Davidic monarchy and
he prophesied to this effect,

450
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,520
he like Jeremiah also maintained that
our relationship with God was possible.

451
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,640
In the meantime,

452
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,530
a relationship outside the chosen
land and the Jewish diaspora,

453
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,790
right diaspora refers to a community
living outside of its home land.

454
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:04,740
The Jewish diaspora was a new thing.
It was a religious,

455
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:08,760
national body of a type that
had not been seen before.

456
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:13,850
You had a people remaining loyal to their
god while in exile from their own land

457
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:19,920
and what was believed to be that God's
land without worshiping him cultic Lee or

458
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:21,780
by means of sacrifice.
Remember,

459
00:28:21,781 --> 00:28:26,781
the only legitimate site for an alter
or for sacrifice to God is Jerusalem and

460
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:31,830
in time slowly a new worship will
be fashioned one without sacrifice.

461
00:28:31,831 --> 00:28:36,820
One that consists of prayer and confession
and fasts and other kinds of ritual

462
00:28:36,821 --> 00:28:37,740
observances.

463
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:42,330
Three times a day Jews will
pray and they'll pray in
the direction of Jerusalem.

464
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,630
Worship in synagogues
eventually will come into being.

465
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,740
And the importance of the Sabbath will
grow the sabbath as a memorial of the

466
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:52,500
covenant and a symbol of Jewish faith.

467
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:57,960
And so you also find beginning shortly
after this period for the first time,

468
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,350
non Jews are joining themselves too.
Yeah,

469
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:05,820
way adopting this religion of
Israel out of religious conviction.

470
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,570
Not simply because they may be residing
in the land and have to follow the God's

471
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:11,400
laws.
This is outside the land.

472
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,790
You have people choosing to opt
into this community. So again,

473
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:18,780
we see that as the history of the
nation of Israel came to an end,

474
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:22,050
the history of Judaism and religion,
Judaism begins.

475
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,390
So in a Cqo we've seen um,

476
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,860
one response to the national
disaster and the exile.

477
00:29:28,861 --> 00:29:32,760
The idea that while suffering and
punishment are fully deserved,

478
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,590
a relationship with God remains possible.
God is with his people. Even in exile.

479
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,240
A second response to the destruction
and exile can be found in the anonymous

480
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:47,470
writings that are appended to the book
of Isaiah mentioned these writings

481
00:29:47,471 --> 00:29:51,280
briefly. We'll be able to look now at
what's been called second. Does Isaiah.

482
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:55,210
So there are two discrete units of
material that are appended to Isaiah.

483
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,010
Chapters 40 to 55 or referred
to a second Isaiah. And, uh,

484
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,760
chapters 56 to 66 are referred to us.
Third Isaiah.

485
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,380
And these chapters differ from Isaiah
proper in the eighth century prophet. Uh,

486
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,700
in several ways, it's clear
first of all that, um,

487
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:15,980
these parts of Isaiah were
written after the, um,

488
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:19,600
after the exile to a large
parts of Isaiah. Third,

489
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:21,970
Isaiah were written after the exile.
All of Second Isaiah

490
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:28,060
and Isaiah proper was clearly
written in the eighth century on,

491
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:32,890
into the early seventh century. Um,
Jerusalem is referred to as destroyed.

492
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,900
The audience that's addressed is living
in exile. Babylon is the oppressor,

493
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:41,080
not Assyria. Assyria was the oppressor
and the time of Isaiah proper.

494
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,900
So the upended materials,
uh,

495
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:47,080
even seem to know of the
overthrow of the Babylonians.

496
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:51,690
That's going to happen in about five 39
when Cyrus of Persia will destroy a will,

497
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,830
will conquer the Babylonians.
Um,

498
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,350
we have passages that express
some euphoria over this. Um,

499
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,520
because Cyrus of course authorized the
Jews to return from Babylon to Jerusalem

500
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,970
to rebuild the temple.

501
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:08,170
There are also all kinds of
stylistic differences between first,

502
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:12,760
Isaiah and second and third Isaiah. Um,
second and third. Isaiah for example,

503
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:16,120
I have no biographical data and
first Isaiah has quite a bit,

504
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,980
these materials also have a
different theology of history,

505
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,940
different understanding of history at
different attitude towards foreign nations

506
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,390
and a very strong and renewed
emphasis on monotheism.

507
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,050
And these also market as
different, um, in the,

508
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:36,610
among the scrolls that were found in the
caves of Qumran near the Dead Sea. Uh,

509
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,160
we have a very large and
very famous Isaiah Scroll,

510
00:31:39,161 --> 00:31:41,740
which is now in a museum in Jerusalem.

511
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:47,460
And on the scroll there's a gap after
Isaiah 39 and a new column starts with

512
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:52,360
Isaiah 40. So it seems to signal some sort
of implicit recognition that there's a

513
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:55,090
difference between these two sections.
They are not the same.

514
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,280
They're not the same units,
not the same author perhaps.

515
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,780
So we're going to talk right now about
second Isaiah because this is a holy post

516
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:06,240
destruction work. The opening or
inaugural oracle that happens in,

517
00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:09,550
in that occurs in chapter 40
is an oracle of constellation.

518
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:14,380
It's an oracle of comfort and the
profits sees a straight and level highway

519
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,580
prepared in the wilderness for a
dramatic procession of Yak way.

520
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,690
The shepherd who will lead his people
back to Jerusalem, very, very famous,

521
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,670
made very famous by
Handel's Messiah actually.

522
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:29,980
So chapter 40 taking from various
verses in this chapter, Comfort, Oh,

523
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,990
comfort my people,
says your God,

524
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:37,030
speak tenderly to Jerusalem and declare
to her that her term of services over

525
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:41,510
that her iniquity is expiated for she
has received at the hand of the Lord

526
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:46,460
double for all her sins of voice
rings out clear in the desert,

527
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:50,210
a road for the Lord level in the
wilderness, a highway for our God.

528
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,630
Let every valley be raised.
Every hill and mount made low.

529
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,320
Let the rugged ground become level
and the ridges become a plane.

530
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,550
The presence of the Lord shall appear
and all flesh as one shall behold,

531
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,470
for the Lord himself has spoken. A
voice rings out, proclaim another asks,

532
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:09,530
what shall I proclaim?
All flesh is grass,

533
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,600
all its goodness like
flowers of the field.

534
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,160
But the word of our God is always
fulfilled. Behold the Lord God comes in,

535
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,710
might like a shepherd.
He pastors his flock,

536
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:23,000
he gathers the lambs in his arms and
carries them in his bosom gently.

537
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,530
He drives the mother sheep.

538
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:28,550
So this highway will appear leading
the exiles straight to Jerusalem.

539
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:33,080
All of the topography will be flattened
and God will lead them as a shepherd

540
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,250
leads the lamb. Why? Because the
word of the Lord is always fulfilled.

541
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,750
So what this voice is proclaiming
is a literal return from exile.

542
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:42,860
God's opening a highway.

543
00:33:42,861 --> 00:33:46,100
He's leading his flock home
like a shepherd in a new exodus.

544
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,330
And this is an idea that's so important
that it recurs at the end of the unit as

545
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:53,600
well.
In chapter 55 the idea of a new exodus,

546
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:59,150
a second key theme that sounded at the
beginning and end of the unit again.

547
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:04,150
So it happens in chapter 40 and again
in chapter 55 is this idea that the word

548
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,180
of our God is always fulfilled
or in some translations,

549
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:10,040
the word of our God stands forever.

550
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
This idea is the essence of the Israelites
hope during the period of captivity

551
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,550
and exile and it appears
in the first oracle.

552
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:24,590
It's beautifully restated in the last
Oracle and chapter 55 verses 10 through 12

553
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:30,250
for as the rain or snow drops from heaven
and returns not there but soaks the

554
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:32,840
earth and makes it bring forth vegetation,

555
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,480
yielding seed for sowing
and bred for eating.

556
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,120
So is the word that issues from my mouth,

557
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:43,450
it doesn't come back to me unfulfilled
but performs what I propose achieves what

558
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:44,480
I sent it to do.

559
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:49,930
The AAU shall leave and joy and be led
home secure before you mount and Hill

560
00:34:50,181 --> 00:34:54,470
shall shout aloud and all the trees
of the field shall clap their hands.

561
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,240
So the everlasting word of the Lord,

562
00:34:56,241 --> 00:35:00,620
it's guaranteed fulfillment specifically
to bring his people home in a new

563
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:04,490
exodus. These are ideas, they
form an envelope or an inclusio,

564
00:35:04,491 --> 00:35:07,340
that kind of literary structure where
something has mentioned at the beginning

565
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,590
and again at the end to form an inclusio
or an envelope around the entire unit

566
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,450
of Second Isaiah.

567
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:20,150
We see awesome in second
Isaiah and extreme monotheism.

568
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,590
The monotheism is explicit of course
in Isaiah, implicit, I'm sorry,

569
00:35:24,591 --> 00:35:29,290
implicit in Isaiah, but it becomes
quite explicit. And Second Isaiah, um,

570
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,740
as we've seen,
uh,

571
00:35:30,741 --> 00:35:35,741
to come to terms with the destruction
of five 87 entails the acceptance of the

572
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,640
idea that Israel is punishment was
deserved and that, yeah, he controls,

573
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,780
um, and you always control of history
means he controls not only Israel,

574
00:35:45,781 --> 00:35:49,440
but all other nations as well
and can use them for his purpose,

575
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,310
including punishing Israel.
There's no power other than Yaffe way.

576
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,270
So referring then to the
rise and fall of nations, um,

577
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:02,160
Isaiah 41 verse four states who
has wrought and achieved this,

578
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,710
he who announced the
generations from the start.

579
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,430
I The Lord who was first and
we'll be with the last as well.

580
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,120
The first and the last, which is a way of
saying everything right, all inclusive.

581
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,240
There is nothing but me and Isaiah 44
satirizes those nations who make and

582
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:23,211
worship idols and ridicules the folly
and stupidity of ascribing divinity to

583
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,950
that which one has created
with one's own hands.

584
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,680
And Isaiah 41 God's states,

585
00:36:28,681 --> 00:36:31,920
his case against these
vane and useless idols.

586
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,380
He summons them to answer for themselves,

587
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,580
show that they are gods by
announcing something that will occur,

588
00:36:38,581 --> 00:36:40,740
announcing what will occur
and seeing if it comes true.

589
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:46,010
Chapter 41 2124 let them approach
and tell us what will happen.

590
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,860
Tell us what has occurred and we will
take note of it or announced to us what

591
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:54,240
will occur and we may know the outcome
foretell what is yet to happen that we

592
00:36:54,241 --> 00:36:55,740
may know that you are gods.

593
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:00,860
Do anything good or bad that we need
maybe odd and see why you are less than

594
00:37:00,961 --> 00:37:01,650
nothing.

595
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:06,630
Your effect is less than t one
who chooses you is an abomination.

596
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,720
But this is only half the picture because
not only are the gods of the nations,

597
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,860
no gods, but yeah, white is the true
God of all of these other nations.

598
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,840
So who raised Cyrus of Persia from the
north to sweep through the ancient near

599
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:24,810
east and conquer the Babylonians?
No one but yeah way.

600
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:29,990
Isaiah 41 I have roused him from the
north and he has come and he has trampled

601
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:33,150
rulers like mud,
like a potter treading clay.

602
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,170
The things once predicted to Zion behold,
here they are.

603
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,750
So in these passages,

604
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:44,310
the author of second Isaiah is drawing
a the logical conclusion perhaps towards

605
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:49,311
which Israelite religion has tended
from its inception Yaffe way once the

606
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:51,210
Canaanites Deity,
then the God of Israel's Patriarchs,

607
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:55,140
then the national God of Israel is here,
the Lord of universal history,

608
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:59,610
the only real God, second Isaiah
is claiming is the god of Israel.

609
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Second Isaiah is also a quite well known
for the servant songs that it contains

610
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:09,540
the famous servant songs.
These occur, I'm scattered.

611
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:14,541
And in chapter 42 chapter 49 chapter 50
and then most extensively 52 13 to 53 12

612
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:22,900
so much of 52 and 53 the
identity of this sermon,

613
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,200
I'll read some of these passages in a
minute, but it refers to this servant God,

614
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:26,941
God's servant,

615
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:31,110
and the identity of the servant has been
a puzzle to biblical interpreters for

616
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:34,540
centuries. Sometimes the servant is
referred to as a collective figure.

617
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:37,540
Sometimes servant is referred
to as an individual figure.

618
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:42,870
And Chapter 49 the servant is referred
to or described as a prophet with a

619
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:47,650
universal message rather than a
message for the Israelites alone.

620
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,780
But then there's some ambiguity here.

621
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:54,670
The Servant is first
identified or the profit,

622
00:38:54,671 --> 00:38:57,940
the servant or profit is first
identified as Israel, herself.

623
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,240
So in chapter 49 verses one to three
the Lord appointed me before I was born.

624
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,430
He named me while I was
in my mother's womb.

625
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,160
He made my mouth like a sharpened blade.

626
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,840
He hit me in the shadow of his hand
and he made me like a polished arrow.

627
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,900
He concealed me in his
quiver and he said to me,

628
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,230
you are my servant Israel in whom I glory,

629
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:26,340
and yet in verse five it would seem that
this profit servant has a mission to

630
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:31,900
Israel to bring her back to Yahweh and
that would imply that the servant or

631
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:33,070
profit is not Israel.

632
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,480
Verse Five and now the Lord has resolved
he who formed me in the womb to be his

633
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:41,590
servant, to bring back Jacob to himself,
that Israel may be restored to him.

634
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:47,230
Right then the mission has expanded a
little bit in verse six for he has said it

635
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:49,600
is too little that you
should be my servant.

636
00:39:49,601 --> 00:39:53,590
In that I raise up the tribes of Jacob
and restore the survivors of Israel.

637
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:58,600
I will also make you a light unto the
nations that my salvation may reach the

638
00:39:58,601 --> 00:39:59,710
ends of the earth.

639
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:05,910
Chapter 50 quite famously refers to the
servant as rebellious and as persecuted.

640
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:12,180
Verse six I offered my
back to the floggers and my
cheeks to those who tore out

641
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:16,120
my hair. I did not hide my
face from insult and spittle,

642
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,960
but it's the famous and difficult
passage in Isaiah 53 that most movingly

643
00:40:22,391 --> 00:40:25,570
describes the suffering and
sorrow of God's servant.

644
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:29,980
53 verses three to 11 he was despised.
We held him,

645
00:40:29,981 --> 00:40:30,940
have no account,

646
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:35,830
yet it was our sickness that he was
bearing our suffering that he endured.

647
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,880
We accounted him, played,
smitten and afflicted by God,

648
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:44,290
but he was wounded because of our sins
crushed because of our iniquities.

649
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,500
He bore the chastisement that made us
whole and by his bruises we are healed.

650
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,140
We all went astray like sheep,
each going his own way,

651
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:58,120
and the Lord visited upon him the
guilt of all of us. He was maltreated,

652
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,410
yet he was submissive.

653
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:04,590
He did not open his mouth like a sheep
being led to slaughter like a you dumb

654
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:06,250
before those who she or her,

655
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:10,960
he did not open his mouth and his grave
was said among the wicked and with the

656
00:41:10,961 --> 00:41:12,100
rich.
In his death,

657
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:16,040
though he had done no injustice
and had spoken no false hood,

658
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,850
but the Lord chose to
crush him by disease.

659
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,400
That if he made himself
an offering for guilt,

660
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:25,960
he might see offspring and have long
life and that through him the Lord's

661
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:27,250
purpose might prosper.

662
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,710
There've been many attempts to equate
this man of sorrows with all kinds of

663
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,570
figures.
Early on,

664
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:40,100
Jesus's followers saw Jesus as a
suffering servant of God. In Isaiah,

665
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,450
the new testament writers specifically
borrowed passages from Isaiah,

666
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,800
particularly this chapter,

667
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:49,310
chapter 33 when constructing
their narratives of Jesus,

668
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:52,610
taking those verses and using
them in describing his story.

669
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,690
So he is depicted as the innocent and
righteous servant who suffered for the

670
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:59,810
sins of others. In the
teachings of Paul. However,

671
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:04,160
you have a different use of these versus
Christians generally are identified as

672
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:06,740
a servant who suffers with and for Jesus.

673
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,250
Despite these later
theological interpretations,

674
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:15,280
the anonymous writer of Second Isaiah
wasn't writing about a remote and as Urbi

675
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:19,700
and teacher and charismatic healer who
would live more than five centuries later

676
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,700
examined in its original context,

677
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,610
it appears most likely
that the servant is Israel.

678
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:30,611
Herself described metaphorically as an
individual who's present suffering and

679
00:42:31,071 --> 00:42:34,160
humiliation is due to the
sins of other nations,

680
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:39,490
but whose future restoration
and exaltation will cause
astonishment among those

681
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:42,680
nations who will then
be humbled to halfway.

682
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:46,760
But there are problems with even this
interpretation and you should be aware of

683
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:49,550
that this has never been
solved satisfactorily.

684
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:53,310
The main problem with interpreting
Israel as the servant, uh,

685
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,170
is the verse that describes the
servant as having a mission to Israel.

686
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:01,070
It seems a little odd to say that
Israel Bayer is a mission to Israel,

687
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:06,730
but this problem can be solved if we
remember that Israel was often divided and

688
00:43:07,091 --> 00:43:11,990
prophetic rhetoric. So perhaps the
writer envisions emission of one part,

689
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:16,370
the right shit, the righteous part to
the other, the part that has gone astray.

690
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,740
Leaving aside this difficulty,

691
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:23,770
the more prominent Motif in the servant
Song of Isaiah is that the servant has a

692
00:43:23,991 --> 00:43:24,950
mission to the world.

693
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,670
That's the more prominent motif and that
is a role that would suit Israel quite

694
00:43:28,671 --> 00:43:32,180
well for the, furthermore,
you have the phrase Israel,

695
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:35,930
my servant appearing in Second
Isaiah about eight times.

696
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,940
So the idea of Israel as God's servant
to the nations is clearly a part of

697
00:43:40,941 --> 00:43:42,680
Isaiah's conceptual world.

698
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:47,480
And since we're dealing with poetry
rather than a rigorously consistent

699
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:49,090
metaphysical treatise,
uh,

700
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:52,550
it shouldn't be too surprising
that sometimes a servant
is spoken of as a group

701
00:43:52,551 --> 00:43:54,710
collectively,
sometimes as an individual.

702
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,620
The same holds true of Israel in general,
by the way,

703
00:43:57,621 --> 00:43:58,970
throughout much of the literature,

704
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,510
sometimes Israel is spoken of in
plural terms and sometimes as a single

705
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:05,360
individual.
So in its original context,

706
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:08,180
it's likely that the servant
refers to Israel herself.

707
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,820
If the servant is Israel,

708
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:16,070
then we can see how second Isaiah is
another response to the events of five 87

709
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:20,120
and it's ultimately a positive
interpretation of positive response.

710
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:24,950
The punishment that Israel
suffered even if excessive.

711
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:29,270
Remember Isaiah 40 claims that Israel
has suffered double for her sins, right?

712
00:44:29,271 --> 00:44:33,540
So it's been an excessive punishment,
but that punishment isn't meaningless.

713
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:38,250
It will lead to redemption.
Israel will be healed by her wounds.

714
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,270
God's Word Will Not Return unfulfilled.
And in addition,

715
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:46,410
suffering leads to a new role for
Israel among the nations. Second,

716
00:44:46,411 --> 00:44:51,411
Isaiah expresses a new self awareness
that is taking hold in the exile Israel

717
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,740
saw itself as the faithful servant of
Yahweh way a servant whose loyalty to God

718
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:02,880
in this dark time would serve to broadcast
the knowledge of God throughout the

719
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:03,714
nations.

720
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:08,130
So Israel was chosen from the womb
to serve God's universal purpose.

721
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:11,430
Israel suffered unobserved by others,

722
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:16,440
but eventually this would make possible
the recognition of God by those others.

723
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,640
When once God,

724
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:22,230
where once God covenanted with
David to lead his people Israel,

725
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,450
he now covenants with Israel to lead
the nations of the world in God's way.

726
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,550
It's an expansion of God's purpose.

727
00:45:29,551 --> 00:45:34,551
And this is an idea that appears in Isaiah
55 verses three to five incline your

728
00:45:36,391 --> 00:45:38,610
ear and come to me Harkin,

729
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,750
and you shall be revived and I will
make with you an everlasting covenant.

730
00:45:42,751 --> 00:45:46,500
The undoing loyalty promise to David
at the Covenant and loyalty that was

731
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:51,360
promised to David. I'm now transferring
to you as I made him a leader of peoples,

732
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,430
a prince and commander of peoples.

733
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:58,170
So you shall summon a nation who you did
not know and a nation that did not know

734
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:01,680
you shall come running to you for
the sake of the Lord, your God,

735
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,050
the holy one of Israel
who has glorified you.

736
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:09,770
So God makes an eternal covenant with
Israel like that he wants concluded with

737
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:15,021
David and the function of the institutions
of the old order are transferred to

738
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:17,670
the nation as a whole.

739
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,660
What kings and priests and
prophets did for Israel,

740
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,840
Israel will now do for the whole world
as the mediator between the only God and

741
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,670
the nations of the world.

742
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:34,710
She is a light unto them and all will
ascend to her because from her we'll come

743
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:37,590
Torah instruction in the
divine will and salvation.

744
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:41,580
This is the idea of universal mission
that comes out of Second Isaiah.

745
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,830
When we come back on Wednesday,

746
00:46:43,831 --> 00:46:47,190
we're going to take a look at what I
think is probably the single most profound

747
00:46:47,191 --> 00:46:50,490
book in the Hebrew Bible,
the book of Job, and again,

748
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:55,440
I'll remind you that final
paper information will be
available on the classes

749
00:46:55,441 --> 00:46:56,274
server tonight.

750
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:00,600
I want you to have it in time to be able
to ask questions of your TF for myself

751
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:04,410
about the assignment. It's
pretty detailed, so sit and
read through it carefully.

752
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,640
Be there later tonight.
