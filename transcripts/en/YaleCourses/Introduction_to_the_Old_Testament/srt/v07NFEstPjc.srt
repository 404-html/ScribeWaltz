1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,130
I was talking last time about the
concept of election or choice,

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,400
God's choice of Israel,
Israel as the chosen one,

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,900
which occurs for the first time in the
book of Deuteronomy and I was talking

4
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:16,200
about the fact that four Deuteronomy,
the election of Israel,

5
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:20,370
God's election of Israel means or entails
the idea that Israel is a holy people

6
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:24,240
holy in the sense of separated to God,
right. That root meaning of holiness,

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,560
switched means to be separated
from the common or the ordinary.

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,730
So that separation entails separation
from alien peoples and practices that are

9
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:38,850
inconsistent with the worship of God.
So for this reason,

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,990
intermarriage with the Canaanites is
prohibited in Deuteronomy and in fact they

11
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:44,520
are to be utterly destroyed.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,260
All alien practices are to be removed
from the covenant community. Now,

13
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:51,990
given that there were
probably no Canaanites, uh,

14
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:56,310
at the time of Deuteronomy is composition.
According to some scholars,

15
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,200
these texts may be understood as a
kind of internal polemic against those

16
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:05,260
elements of Israelite society whose
practices didn't conform to Deuteronomy.

17
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:08,940
He's a y'all way only policy
or Yahweh only the ideals.

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,090
This is an idea we'll come back to in a
minute. I just want to throw it out here.

19
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,280
Um, separation entails also
separation to God's service.

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,200
That means, of course, the observance of
his laws, especially the laws of purity,

21
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,250
the rejection of pagan
practices and so on.

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,090
So the privilege of having
been chosen or singled out, uh,

23
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,100
of being a holy people to God entails
obligations and responsibility at the same

24
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:32,791
time.

25
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:36,120
It's interesting that Deuteronomy seems
to be aware of some of the dangers in

26
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:41,070
this idea, the danger
of, um, of a superiority,

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,450
sort of a superiority complex, a moral
danger involved in the notion of election.

28
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,030
So Deuteronomy Warren's repeatedly,

29
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,890
it is by no special virtue or merit
that Israel was the one chosen and Moses

30
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:57,180
admonishes the Israelites not to suppose
that their inheritance of the land of

31
00:01:57,181 --> 00:01:59,280
Canaan is due to their own powers,

32
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:03,210
are on account of any righteousness
or virtue that they possess. In fact,

33
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:04,290
he says far from it,

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Israel was chosen by Calloway as an act
in an act of spontaneous love does not

35
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:14,460
imply her perfection and act of
spontaneous love for the Patriarchs.

36
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,560
And the election was entirely God's
initiative and is no cause for Israel to

37
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:20,100
boast.

38
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,660
So in Deuteronomy chapter seven verses
six to eight read for you are a people

39
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:29,250
consecrated, made holy to the Lord
your God of all the peoples on Earth,

40
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,830
the Lord your God chose you
to be his treasured people.

41
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,340
It's not because you are the most
numerous of peoples that the Lord set his

42
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:39,000
heart on you and chose you.
Indeed you are the smallest of peoples,

43
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,750
but it was because the Lord favored
you and kept the oath he made to your

44
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:45,960
fathers that the Lord freed you with
a mighty hand and rescued you from the

45
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:48,870
house of bondage from the power
of Pharaoh, King of Egypt.

46
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,840
So don't be tempted Moses later,
Warren's the Israelites.

47
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,610
Don't be tempted to say to yourselves,

48
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:58,110
this isn't Deuteronomy eight to 17 my
own power and the might of my own hand

49
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,910
have one this wealth me or again to say,

50
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:04,480
and Deuteronomy nine verse four the
Lord has enabled us to possess this land

51
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:06,820
because of our virtues.
On the contrary,

52
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:10,240
he emphasizes it's only because of the
wickedness of the Canaanites is so great

53
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,750
that the Lord has to drive them from his
land. And now he's giving you a chance.

54
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,660
But it's conditional for
you just as it was for them.

55
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,380
Don't fail him or he will drive you out.
Just as he drove out the Canaanites.

56
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,731
That's a theme.

57
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:24,550
And Deuteronomy we're going to see in a
moment how important that is or in a few

58
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:25,150
lectures,

59
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,480
how important that idea is for the
Deuteronomistic historian in general.

60
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,373
But we'll get there.

61
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,070
And another theme in the book of
Deuteronomy is the theme of providential

62
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:35,830
concern.
And that appears in Deuteronomy eight.

63
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,220
God's providential love and care for
Israel is expressed through various

64
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:45,730
metaphors in the Bible and the Prophet
Hosea who seems to have very strong

65
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:47,260
connections with the book of Deuteronomy,

66
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,690
the Prophet Hosea will develop further
this image of parent and child. Um,

67
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,550
that occurs in Deuteronomy eight.
So in a way,

68
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,520
the language we were just referring to
was really the language of husband and

69
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:00,460
wife. You know, someone who
is simply loves someone,
not because they're perfect,

70
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:02,140
but that's their choice.
They favored them,

71
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:05,020
they love the person and
they make a bond with them.

72
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,940
It doesn't imply anything
about other people's,

73
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:09,460
it's simply that's the person who has
been the focus that we have a lot of sort

74
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:13,600
of love and marriage imagery, husband and
wife, imagery used for God and Israel.

75
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,310
But we also have this parent and child
imagery that appears in Deuteronomy 32

76
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:23,110
verse 10. The image is that of an eagle
that bears its young on its wings.

77
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,880
He found him in a desert region
in an empty howling waste.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,650
He and girded him watched over him,
guarded him as the pupil of his eye,

79
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,090
like an eagle who rouses is
nestlings gliding down to his young.

80
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,260
So did he spread his wings and take him,
bear him along on his pinions.

81
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,420
The Lord alone did guide him and almost
seems to play on the idea that when, um,

82
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,870
when teaching its young to fly,
the Eagle will push them out of the nest,

83
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:54,160
swoop under them, bear them
up for a while, over and
over until they get the idea.

84
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,210
So God is repeatedly
testing and correcting the
Israelites until they're ready

85
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,200
for the promised land.
So Deuteronomy is content,

86
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,440
which are these farewell speeches and
the death and the burial of Moses are a

87
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:12,160
fitting capstone to the pen to Tukul
narrative. But at the same time,

88
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,180
Deuteronomy really doesn't bring closure
to this narrative because at the end of

89
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:18,730
Deuteronomy,
the promises still are not fulfilled.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,280
The people are still outside the land.

91
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,220
Some have suggested that
this is quite purposeful.

92
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:28,150
It points to an exact date for
the works final composition.

93
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:30,920
That is to say when it was
finally a redacted, the,

94
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,350
the redactors were in exile writing
for a people living in exile.

95
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,450
And the deuteronomist wants to make it
clear that it's fidelity to the Torah, uh,

96
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,900
rather than residents in the land. That
is critically important. But in any event,

97
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,930
Deuteronomy is not simply the concluding
book of the Pentateuch or the story

98
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:50,290
that began in Genesis.

99
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:54,310
It's also the first part of a
much larger longer literary work.

100
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:55,340
As I mentioned last time,

101
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:59,140
a work that runs from Deuteronomy
through to the end of second kings. Um,

102
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:03,380
and we're going to consider a today the
program and the work of this so called

103
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:07,010
Deuteronomistic school.
Um, but before we do that,

104
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,120
I wanted to just make a few
concluding remarks about um,

105
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,350
source theory and the pentitude.

106
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,010
We've talked about the documentary
heights thought hypothesis,

107
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:19,160
we've talked about the different sources
that scholars believe they've been able

108
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:23,840
to identify as comprising. Um, the,
the five books of the Pentateuch. Um,

109
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,960
and one of the things I mentioned a couple
of times are some of the debates that

110
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:29,000
occur on the question of dating.

111
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,230
There's a great deal of
ideological baggage that's
involved in the dating of the

112
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:34,064
sources.

113
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,880
One of the issues that I think is a real
problem is the fact that the priestly

114
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:41,450
source p is so often
misjudged and maligned.

115
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,200
I hope that the little bit of time that
we spent on the proxy materials gave you

116
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:50,201
some appreciation of its transformation
of older Israelite rituals and

117
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:55,220
traditions into symbolic practices that
would communicate basic convictions

118
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:58,430
about morality, convictions,
about holiness. Um,

119
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,810
I'd hope it gave you a sense
of its communal ethic, um,

120
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,440
as opposed to an individual morality.

121
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:06,650
The idea that the actions of every
individual have an impact on society as a

122
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:07,484
whole,

123
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,790
but the anti priest anti cult sentiment
of European Protestantism is apparent in

124
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:16,940
the history of Biblical scholarship
in the last few centuries.

125
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,620
And it's a apparent in that scholarships
negative assessment of the priestly

126
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:26,060
source of the Bible. So for
warehousing, the priestly source,

127
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:29,240
which emphasizes cult and ritual,
logically,

128
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:33,530
it had to represent a late degenerate
stage in the evolution of Israelite

129
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:37,820
religion because priestly
ritualistic cultic practices,

130
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:42,180
these are degenerations,
these are movements away from true,

131
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,530
a spirit filled religion in,
in his view.

132
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,820
So according to that housing,

133
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,120
the early period of ancient Israel
must have been characterized by a free,

134
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:56,840
more natural form of religion,
intimate relationship with God,

135
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,560
an unencumbered or unsullied
by the legalist stick.

136
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,710
Cultic obsessions of priests and cult.

137
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,040
He argued that in five 86 with
the destruction of Jerusalem and,

138
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:11,580
and the people were, were taken
into exile in Babylon. Um,

139
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,900
that was when in Babylon the priests
were able to assume control and they were

140
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:22,271
able to play on the exiles overwhelming
feelings of guilt and failure.

141
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,010
And the priests were able to construct a
new identity and religion that stressed

142
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:29,750
the sinfulness of the people
and the need for ritual,

143
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:33,440
purity and ritual observance and
legalism as the road back to God.

144
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:36,830
And they were able to write themselves
back into the narratives and stories of

145
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:41,690
Israel's past. And this, according to
val housing, was a degeneration. Well,

146
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:45,970
this reconstruction of the
evolution of Israelite history, uh,

147
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,930
is Israelite religion,
excuse me,

148
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,160
has really driven more by theological
prejudice than it is by historical

149
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:52,994
evidence.

150
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,060
And it stems from an obvious projection
of the Protestant Catholic tension onto

151
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,550
Israelite history.

152
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,940
It also is driven very much by a
succession as account of Judaism as being

153
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,900
something that was more abundant at the
time of Jesus. Jesus came and revived.

154
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,250
This was a spirit filled religion,

155
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,700
again when it had decayed and withered
and degenerated like a dead tree as well.

156
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:16,230
Housing refers to it.

157
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,810
This isn't to say that all scholars
who date p to the post exit period,

158
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,230
um, are motivated by the
same problematic assumptions.

159
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,700
That's certainly not the case.

160
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:31,170
There are scholars of all stripes and
allegiances who view p as late and there

161
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:36,150
is some very good objective evidence for
dating parts of p to the postings Zelig

162
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:36,631
period,

163
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:39,720
just as there's good objective evidence
for dating parts of d and the other

164
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:42,450
sources to the post exhilarate period.

165
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,880
So when it comes to dating the sources,

166
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,240
certainly I would say all scholars agree
that the priestly materials reached

167
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:55,380
their final form in the exile or post
Zelig period. So that's the sixth century,

168
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:58,920
right? You're going to find
out we're going to return
from exile and the five 30.

169
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:01,710
So, okay. So when we talk about
the post exhibit a period,

170
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:05,070
we're talking about the period after
the return. So the period of the exiles,

171
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:09,390
the sixth century, the bulk of the
middle of the sixth century. So, um,

172
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,180
it certainly reached its
final form in that period,

173
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:16,860
as did Deuteronomy and the pedagogue
probably generally. Nevertheless,

174
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:21,240
there are many data that suggest that
the priestly sources retain very early

175
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:26,241
strata just as d contains preexist or
early material p espouses a communal

176
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:28,860
ethic,
uh,

177
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:32,160
and post exhilarate priests are going
to turn increasingly to an individual

178
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:36,990
ethic. Many sections of p do not
seem to assume as central sanctuary.

179
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:40,380
You remember that there's the idea of
the central sanctuary really took hold in

180
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:43,020
six 22 with Josiah and Josiah is reform.

181
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,050
So it becomes a real watershed
for us in dating texts.

182
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:49,350
Texts that are happy with the existence
of shrines throughout the land of Israel

183
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:52,140
are probably pre Josiah.
Pre six 22.

184
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:57,120
Preexist like texts that insist on a
central sanctuary are probably Josiah's

185
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:59,100
time or later.
Um,

186
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:02,370
and there are many sections of p that
don't seem to assume essential sanctuary.

187
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,050
There are sections of p that do seem
to assume a central sanctuary more

188
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:11,220
significantly. I think p contains
no universal ban on intermarriage.

189
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,400
It doesn't employ its purity laws or
language to mark and inseparable boundary

190
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,070
between classes within Israel or
between Israelites and gentile.

191
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,740
Others they use of purity and purity.

192
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:27,150
Language to inscribe boundaries between
Israel and other nations is very

193
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:29,100
characteristic of the
post exhilarate period.

194
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:30,960
We're going to see that when we get there.

195
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,370
So it's very hard to understand
[inaudible] silence in
this regard if it stems

196
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:38,280
entirely from the post
[inaudible] priestly circles.

197
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,930
So I think that instead of charting an
evolution or a degeneration as I have

198
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:47,370
over on the side of the board and
evolution or degeneration from Je,

199
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,340
the pure spirit field, religion
to d, the humanitarian,

200
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:54,090
ethical religion to p cultic
obsessiveness, guilt ridden, uh,

201
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,690
legalism as has done or implied
in some classical source theory,

202
00:11:58,691 --> 00:11:59,800
some not all,

203
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,120
it may be better to see these three as
really representing three distinct and

204
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:08,320
roughly contemporaneous strands of
ancient Israelite tradition and experience

205
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:09,910
told from their own perspectives.

206
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,090
These materials were transmitted and
developed by different circles within

207
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:19,010
Israelite society over centuries and they
crystallized at different times. Jay,

208
00:12:19,011 --> 00:12:21,130
he has fragments that are quite old,

209
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:24,880
but it probably reached its final
form before the centralization of the

210
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:28,040
sanctuary. It's still comfortable
with the existence of many, um,

211
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,510
sacred places throughout the land.
So probably before six 22,

212
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,650
Deuteronomy contains northern traditions
from before the fall of Israel,

213
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,670
which was in seven 22 but it was
clearly finalized in the exile.

214
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,390
There are many passages that make it
clear that it's written from an exit

215
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,720
perspective and the priestly
source likewise contains many,

216
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:48,010
many older traditions,

217
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,060
but reached it's full and final form in
the exilic or post exhilarate period.

218
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,920
So each of these complex, multilayered
sources, each one of them,

219
00:12:56,921 --> 00:13:01,600
you can find different layers.
Each one possesses its own emphases,

220
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:06,310
its own agenda, it's own perspectives.
Sometimes they compliment one another,

221
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,800
sometimes they challenge
and contradict one another,

222
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:13,360
but they are not best seen as linear
as telling a neat linear story about

223
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:14,141
Israelite religion.

224
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:19,141
Flowering and feeding their diversity
has not been flattened or homogenized by

225
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:20,830
the final editor of the text.

226
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:24,910
It's been preserved in a manner that
stimulates reflection and debate.

227
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,610
So with those concluding remarks,

228
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:30,670
we're going to move on now to the
second major section of the Bible.

229
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:34,060
We've been discussing the Torah or pen
to Tuk and now we're moving on to the

230
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:36,520
section of the Bible that's
referred to as the profits.

231
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,070
This section of the Bible is,

232
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:43,060
is divided into two parts we refer to as
the former profits and then the latter

233
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:43,780
prophets.

234
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,080
The form of profits will concern us for
the next few lectures and the form of

235
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:51,670
profits include the books of Joshua
judges first and second Samuel First and

236
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:55,300
second kings.
They read as a historical narrative.

237
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,380
This material is a theologically oriented
account of Israel's history from the

238
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:06,820
conquest of Canaan or what's represented
as the conquest of Canaan to the

239
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:11,821
destruction of the state by the
Babylonians in five 87 five 86 BCE.

240
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,410
This material is therefore crucial
background to reading the latter prophets.

241
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:19,960
Now the latter profits
is a collection of books.

242
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,790
Each of which bears the name of the
individual who's prophecies it purports to

243
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,670
contain.
These prophecies were,

244
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,290
these profits delivered their oracles at
critical junctures in Israel's history,

245
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,250
in the nation's history.

246
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,060
So their words are only going to make
sense to us if we first understand the

247
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:39,880
particular historical crises
that they are addressing.

248
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:44,170
And that the historical narrative that
runs from Joshua through second kings

249
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,970
provides that information.

250
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:49,810
It tells us of the critical junctures in
the nation's history and that will help

251
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:51,440
us send slot the different in.

252
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,090
So the former prophets or the historical
books like the books of the Bible that

253
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:57,650
we've already studied,
um,

254
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:01,790
contained various older sources that
have been put together by a later hand.

255
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,230
You have an editor or a group of editors
who reworked these older sources.

256
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:07,370
They were oral traditions.

257
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:10,850
Some of them were probably records
from royal royal archives and so on.

258
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,940
And they wove them together
into the form that we have now.

259
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:19,090
And that's a process that's referred to
as redaction or editing the anonymous

260
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:24,230
person or group or a school that's
responsible for the final composition.

261
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,940
The final redaction of these
books inserted would put
the materials together by

262
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:33,941
inserting versus and speeches that would
frame the older sources and link them

263
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,590
together, give them some sort
of common uniting thread.

264
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:42,250
The redactors linking and framing
passages and their revisions of the older

265
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:45,410
sources exhibit certain common features.

266
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,720
They harp on the same
themes over and over again.

267
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:50,390
They use some of the same language
over and over again. They have,

268
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,340
they share certain assumptions and those
features and assumptions have a lot in

269
00:15:55,341 --> 00:15:56,750
common with the book of Deuteronomy,

270
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,500
a lot in common with the book of
Deuteronomy and that's what led the German

271
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,670
scholar Martin note

272
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,040
to surmise that Deuteronomy and these
historical books really form a unit so

273
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:12,200
that Deuteronomy not only looks back
and finishes off the pentacle narrative,

274
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:15,980
it looks forward as the beginning of of
really the historical account that's to

275
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:20,750
follow j e and p really
seem to come to an end here.

276
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,940
There's some debate about this,

277
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:28,270
but because the interpretive history
that runs from Joshua to second kings is

278
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:33,710
based on ideals that are set
out in the book of Deuteronomy,

279
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,120
we refer to the person or the persons
who redacted this whole unit as the

280
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:41,510
Deuteronomistic historian or
the Deuteronomistic school.

281
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,430
The whole unit as a whole was
redacted after six 22 that's clear.

282
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:49,700
It assumes and insist upon the
centralization of the cult.

283
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,750
The last dated event that's
mentioned in second kings is uh,

284
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,690
something that occurred in five 62.

285
00:16:56,691 --> 00:17:01,691
That was when [inaudible] was released
from prison in Babylon in five 62.

286
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,200
So the work was probably
concluded shortly after that date.

287
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,050
So in exile or towards the
end of the exhibit period,

288
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,990
Martin note assumed that
there was one editor.

289
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:15,350
Other scholars have assumed that
there were two or even more success of

290
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:19,550
additions of this history because there
are multiple perspectives that seem to

291
00:17:19,551 --> 00:17:23,480
be represented. But the last
seems to be an exit perspective,

292
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:26,780
the perspective of someone sitting in
exile and will be returning to that in a

293
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:30,920
future lecture. Some of the books
within this very large unit,

294
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:35,540
or at least the traditions within this
very large unit are less influenced by

295
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:40,520
Deuteronomy and its themes and
its concerns. Some are clearly,

296
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,270
um,

297
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,050
some contained clearly pre Deuteronomistic
elements and materials if you will.

298
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,350
But I encourage you to read the
excellent introduction to the profits,

299
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:50,700
the section of the Bible,
the prophets,

300
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,370
which was written by Mark Breton
there and you're Jewish Study Bible.

301
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:56,190
I think it's an excellent introduction
to the complexity of this material.

302
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,200
The most salient feature of
the Deuteronomistic school
is the conviction that

303
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:06,000
Israel's residents in the land is a
function of it's obedience or disobedience

304
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,860
to the covenant with Yahweh Way.

305
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,490
And that conviction is going
to color it's presentation,

306
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,490
it's evaluation and it's interpretation
of Israel's history and her kings. Um,

307
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,990
right from Joshua,
right through to second kings,

308
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,880
it has called Koufman uses
the term historiography,
which I've written up here,

309
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:28,881
historiography to describe this material
where a historian might simply record

310
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:31,680
events as if that's such
a simple thing to do.

311
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:36,420
But let's go with that for a moment. I'm
a historian, might simply record events,

312
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:36,841
however,

313
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:40,590
selectively or partially you might
try to indicate cause and effect where

314
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:45,420
possible. But a historiography is a
more conscious philosophy of history.

315
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,390
It's seeking to ascertain
the meaning of events,

316
00:18:48,391 --> 00:18:51,750
to draw larger philosophical,

317
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:56,751
ideological conclusions from the events
of history and to point to the larger

318
00:18:56,791 --> 00:19:00,450
purpose or design of history. Not to
just say, not to say just what happened,

319
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:04,770
but to say why it happened and what it
means for us today that it did happen.

320
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,970
So the Deuteronomistic history is not
simply a history of Israel until the

321
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:12,510
destruction of Jerusalem.
It's a historiography. It's,

322
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,430
it's making an argument and it's,
um,

323
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,980
attempting to communicate the meaning and
the significance of the events of that

324
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:23,460
time. And it does. So through
a pattern, a literary pattern,

325
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:25,650
we will see a reward and punishment.

326
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,100
This is an important point and as
we begin to go through the material,

327
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,580
we'll be coming back to this
will be turned to this idea. Um,

328
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:37,500
there are certain key
features of Deuteronomistic
thought that are evident from

329
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:39,240
Joshua through second kings.

330
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,510
One is the belief in the
divine election of Jerusalem.

331
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:47,340
Jerusalem is the city that is referred
to a Deuteronomy when it says God will

332
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,030
choose a place to cause his name to
dwell in the Deuteronomistic books.

333
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:52,830
That place is going to be Jerusalem.

334
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:58,230
There's also a belief in the divine
election of David David as the king of

335
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,910
Israel and his dynasty.

336
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,360
Now it's interesting because the other
four books of the Pentateuch never

337
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:06,930
mentioned a king and never talk about
genesis through numbers. There's no,

338
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:09,960
none of the legal materials say,
you know, when you have a king,

339
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:13,900
this is what he shall do. It's only the
book of Deuteronomy that assumes or, uh,

340
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,630
prepares for a monarchy and contains
legislation for a king and the things that

341
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:19,464
he should do.

342
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,980
So this again underscores the connection
between Deuteronomy and the following

343
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:24,720
books.
Deuteronomy assumes a king.

344
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,690
It's being written in redacted at a
time when there is a king in Israel.

345
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:31,740
There have been kings in Israel and it's
providing laws for the, for the, um,

346
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,300
construction of an ideal monarchy.
So David,

347
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,480
the theme of,
of David as the elected King of God,

348
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:44,160
David also as the ideal king,
um, is something else that's
a theme of these books.

349
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:49,350
Um, another theme that we see in
these books or um, feature of the,

350
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:52,110
the Deuteronomistic school
is the emphasis on, um,

351
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,300
what we call the yard waste
profits. Yeah. Was prophets,

352
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:57,580
prophets like Elijah and Elisha,

353
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,560
these profits are held up as heroes
and champions of religious purity.

354
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,700
They are completely against any kind
of mixture of Yahweh worship with other

355
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,500
elements, any kind of
syncretism. The other thing,

356
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,150
the other thing we see in
the Deuteronomistic material
is a preference for Judah,

357
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:20,620
the southern kingdom as compared with
a very negative presentation of the

358
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:22,420
northern kingdom, Israel,
the northern kingdom.

359
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:25,250
Israel is going to come in
for very, very bad press, um,

360
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,920
at the hands of the
Deuteronomistic writers,

361
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:31,300
which shows that they are probably
a favor or come from Judah.

362
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,410
So the northern kings are going
to be uniformly denigrated.

363
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,440
They're going to be denigrated because
they maintain cults that rival the

364
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,280
central sanctuary Jerusalem.
And this is going to be what does them in.

365
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,550
The other theme that we see throughout
the Deuteronomistic material is the

366
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:48,010
negative presentation of the Canaanites,

367
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,910
but we'll talk more about
who these Canaanites were
and how complicated. In fact,

368
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:56,911
that presentation is now the books
of Joshua and judges that open the

369
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,120
Deuteronomistic history.

370
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:02,980
These books recount or relate the story
of the conquest of the land of Canaan by

371
00:22:02,981 --> 00:22:07,030
the Israelite tribes and the
early years of the settlement.

372
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:11,380
And that's in judges to gain
an understanding of some
of the issues involved and

373
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:13,690
the emergence of a tribal
structure in the land.

374
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,750
It's helpful to know something
about the geography of Israel,

375
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,930
which is why I've handed out for
you, um, a couple of different maps,

376
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:22,930
but one that gives you physical
features and that's, that's on the top.

377
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:29,440
It has often been pointed out
that in the past 4,000 years,

378
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:35,070
more wars have been fought
for the possession of the
tiny strip of land known as

379
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:37,480
Canaan or the land of Israel or Palestine.

380
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,730
Then had been fought for almost any other
area in the world and in the ancient

381
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:46,570
world. The reason for this was
that this very small rectangle,

382
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,580
it's about 150 miles long and 70 miles
wide. It's about the size of Rhode Island.

383
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,841
It's very small.

384
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:57,841
Rectangle lies on the way to anywhere
worth going in the ancient near east.

385
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,320
You've got Egypt over here,
you've got Asia mine up here,

386
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,330
and you've got Mesopotamia over here.

387
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,180
Not a tremendous amount of inherit
value in this strip of land,

388
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:10,480
but it's important for where you
could go by traveling through it.

389
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,690
So you have three main trade
routes that cross the country.

390
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,200
And they were used by trading caravans
that would carry gold and green and

391
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:21,370
spices and textiles and other goods
between Egypt and the rest of the fertile

392
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:22,960
crescent up into Asia Minor.

393
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:27,190
So control of these international highways
brought a great deal of wealth to the

394
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:28,000
area.

395
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
But the central location was a double
edged sword because in times of peace it

396
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,940
would bring per stair at prosperity.
But of course, uh, in times of war,

397
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:41,260
the land was perpetually invaded as
armies would crisscross the land going off

398
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:44,260
to do battle with the great powers.
Um,

399
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:48,860
so on their way to conquest in Egypt or
Asia minor or Mesopotamia armies would

400
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:54,250
tramp through the land and that explains
the succession of rulers that have held

401
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:58,700
the region, the Egyptians, the
Amorites, the Israelites, the Assyrians,

402
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:02,930
the Babylonians, the Persians, the Greeks,
the Greek Ptolemies, the solutions,

403
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:03,764
the Romans.

404
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:07,850
And the list continues as we go on into
the medieval and the modern periods.

405
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,410
Now, despite the fact that this
is a very small piece of land,

406
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:15,020
it boasts great geographical diversity.

407
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,930
So there are three main
geographical subdivisions.

408
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:21,770
You can see them on your map and they
really run in strips from north to south.

409
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,950
If you look at your map, you'll
see first on the, on the west side,

410
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:28,040
you've got a low coastal plains,
about 20 or 30 miles wide.

411
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,950
It's the coastal plain
and that provides the,

412
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,280
or that is the main highway
out of Egypt or down to Egypt.

413
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:39,910
That area was controlled by Egypt at
the purported time of the exodus running

414
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,720
north to south.

415
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:45,740
Next to that coastal plain
is a region of low mountains.

416
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,080
These low mountains are cut by some
valleys that sort of run east west.

417
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,680
You'll see one there. The Valley
of Jezreel in particular, um,

418
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:56,270
that was a particularly fertile valley.

419
00:24:56,271 --> 00:25:00,290
So the valleys that cut through the
mountains are extremely fertile. Um,

420
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,830
the plaintiff Maketto also joins with
the valley of Jezreel. That's, uh,

421
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,360
the most fertile part of the country,

422
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:09,560
but it was also the site of many of the
most bloody battles in Israel's history.

423
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,710
Then next to that,
north South Central Hill country,

424
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,920
you've got also running north to south,

425
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:20,360
what we call the great Jordan Rift Valley
goes the entire length of the country

426
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,940
and the Jordan River
runs through this valley.

427
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,720
It rises in the Sea of Galilee
or the confederate in the north,

428
00:25:26,721 --> 00:25:28,970
and then it flows about 65 miles,
I believe,

429
00:25:28,971 --> 00:25:33,971
down to the Dead Sea at the
northern extreme of this rift,

430
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,360
the Rift Valley is Mount Hermone,
which is the highest point.

431
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:42,290
It's a snow covered mountain Hermone
and that's the highest point in Israel.

432
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:45,980
It rises about 10,000
feet above sea level,

433
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,140
the central mountain area,

434
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,500
those are between 4,000 and
10,000 feet above sea level.

435
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,830
As you move from the central
area over to Jerusalem,

436
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:58,550
Jerusalem is about 2,500
feet above sea level.

437
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,640
But then as you continue moving
east towards the Rift Valley, um,

438
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:07,690
that area is dramatically lower and you
feel it as you travel the road there

439
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:11,780
just to how quickly it drops so that by
the time you get to the Sea of Galilee,

440
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:16,930
you're 700 feet below sea level and the
Dead Sea is nearly 1300 feet below sea

441
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,750
level. That is the lowest point
on the earth's land surface.

442
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:25,750
So it's dramatic drop and just a very
short geographical area up in the north.

443
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,810
The river surrounded by very
lush vegetation on both sides,

444
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:34,070
but there's no life 65 miles
south down by the Dead Sea.

445
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,000
And this is because the water
is 25% salts and minerals,

446
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,700
although I hear they found some
sort of bacteria or something there.

447
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:42,860
So I guess I shouldn't say
any more that there's no life,

448
00:26:42,861 --> 00:26:46,140
but essentially there's no life.
We would care about in the Dead Sea area.

449
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:51,120
So it's a very desolate area and tradition
identifies this as a site of Sodom

450
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,850
and Gomorrah. The area around
the sea is basically semi-desert.

451
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,410
We call this the Wilderness,
the Wilderness of Judea, um,

452
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,710
between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea,
the Wilderness of Judah, Judea.

453
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,320
So within this relatively tiny area,
there are radically diverse,

454
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,340
uh, regions and this fact held important
implications for Israel's history.

455
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,350
Unity was difficult
being somewhat isolated.

456
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,190
The inhabitants of each region developed
a distinctive economic and cultural

457
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:24,810
character. Uh, you have the small
settled farmer in the more fertile areas.

458
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:27,750
You have semi nomadic shepherds,
you have city dwellers,

459
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,590
you have merchants and traders who are
handling the commerce on the trade routes

460
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:33,960
and enjoying broader cultural context.

461
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:38,160
So that's the geographical setting for
what we're about to read in the book of

462
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:41,850
Joshua. The structure of Joshua
is really somewhat simple.

463
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,250
We can really divided
into two major parts.

464
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:49,251
The first 12 chapters form a unit
that convey the invasion and conquest.

465
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,280
There are certain important
elements. In chapter two, we have,

466
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:57,390
Josh was sending out spies to scout
out the land. And chapter three,

467
00:27:57,391 --> 00:28:01,230
we have the account of crossing
the Jordan River. In chapter six,

468
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:04,830
we have the battle of Jericho. Um, the
story of the battle of Jericho is really,

469
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:09,180
um, a composite of two accounts that
have been a woven together into a single

470
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:10,680
narrative.
So when one of them,

471
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:15,681
Josh was warriors seem to March silently
around the city seven times in another,

472
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:20,120
the priests carry the Ark around
the city 13 times. So the scholar,

473
00:28:20,121 --> 00:28:22,170
since there are two different
accounts here woven together,

474
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:25,440
chapter eight describes the victory
at a place called [inaudible],

475
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:27,910
which is near Jericho.
Um,

476
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:33,170
chapter nine tells the story of the Ghibli
Knights who join the Israelites they

477
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:36,990
are and a local group
that seemed to join them.

478
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:41,580
And then 10 and 11 give us to
further military campaigns.

479
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,790
11 towards the end of 11,

480
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:48,900
we have summary statements in Joshua 10,

481
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,300
verse 40, uh, we read.

482
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,120
So Joshua defeated the whole land,
the hill country and the negative.

483
00:28:57,121 --> 00:29:00,360
That's the desert here to
the south and the low land.

484
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,960
So you have the hill country, the lowland
and the slopes and all their kings.

485
00:29:03,961 --> 00:29:07,410
He left, no one remaining but
utterly destroyed all that breathed.

486
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,340
And chapter 11 goes on distress at Joshua
completed the task that had been begun

487
00:29:11,341 --> 00:29:15,540
by Moses in verse 15 just as the
Lord had commanded his servant Moses.

488
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,660
So Moses had charged Joshua.
And so Joshua did,

489
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:23,070
he left nothing undone of all that the
Lord had commanded Moses. And again,

490
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:27,570
in verse 23 the insistence just thus
Joshua conquered the whole country,

491
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,040
just as the Lord had promised,

492
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:33,000
Moses and Joshua assigned it to Israel
to share according to their tribal

493
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:35,610
divisions.
And the land had rest from war.

494
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,290
So chapters 13 and 21 go on to describe
the division of the land among the

495
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:41,124
tribes.

496
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,470
And then we have some sort of tidying up
at the end were the remaining chapters

497
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:46,000
are, um, upenn disease.

498
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:50,910
23 is a farewell address and 24 is
a renewal of the covenant at Chapin,

499
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,500
which brings everything
to a nice conclusion.

500
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,650
So the narrative and the
first part of Joshua.

501
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,800
Joshua two to 12 describes the invading
Israelites as an organized Confederation

502
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:06,811
of 12 tribes whose conquest
is accomplished in a few
decisive battles under the

503
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:12,010
military leadership of Joshua and the
disunited Canaanites put up little or no

504
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:15,220
resistance. They're paralyzed
by a fear that's sent by God.

505
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,970
All of those who were conquered
are put to the band or the Harem.

506
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,060
That's the sacred devotion of
objects and persons to God,

507
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,910
which entailed killing them.
So they were utterly destroyed.

508
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:30,160
So the first half of the book of Joshua
contains a streamlined and idealized

509
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:34,810
account according which to which the
Israelites managed in relatively short

510
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:36,940
period to take the central hill country,

511
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:42,130
confining the Philistines to a little
strip here on the coastal plain will come

512
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,180
to the Philistines in a minute.

513
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,980
The account of the Conquest in Joshua two
through 12 is concerned to express the

514
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:54,400
basic idea that Israel is victories
would not have been possible without

515
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:57,340
Galloway, without his wondrous
help. It was your way.

516
00:30:57,341 --> 00:30:59,560
Who divided the Jordan before them?

517
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,220
It was Yahweh who broke down the
walls of Jericho. It was, yeah, way.

518
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:05,660
Who put fear in the hearts
of the Canaanites. Yeah.

519
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,360
Way was present at every battle.

520
00:31:07,361 --> 00:31:10,690
The Ark was a visible sign of his
presence and at marched before them.

521
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:15,310
And soon after the conquest
representatives of all of
the tribes of Israel are

522
00:31:15,311 --> 00:31:19,420
going to meet and make a solemn covenant
at Chef [inaudible] to be the people of

523
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:23,500
y'all way to worship him alone.
And according to the book of Joshua,

524
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,490
Israel's tribal structure assumed
its classical form at this time.

525
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:32,590
This is a very neat picture of
the rapid conquest of Canaan,

526
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:38,190
but it's at odds with statements elsewhere
in Joshua and in the book of judges.

527
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,173
For example,

528
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,550
the victories in chapters two through
10 are confined to a very small area.

529
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:49,120
What would actually be the
tribe of Benjamin basically.
So just one small area.

530
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:55,470
And Joshua 13 verse one Joshua 13 opens
with the statement that Joshua was old,

531
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:00,370
advanced in years and there was much
of the land remaining to be possessed.

532
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,390
And Joshua 10 which is in the
first part of Joshua, right?

533
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:09,391
So Joshua 10 versus 36 to 39 report the
conquest of several cities in the south,

534
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,430
including Hebron and deveer.

535
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,280
But in judges we read that
they hadn't been captured.

536
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:17,770
They were captured later
after Joshua's death.

537
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,260
Joshua 12 verse 10 reports the defeat
of the king of Jerusalem in judges eight

538
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:28,290
or judges one verse eight and 21 we
read that the people of Judah did this,

539
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:32,500
conquered the king of Jerusalem,
and that despite that victory,

540
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:36,520
they failed to actually drive out the
inhabitants, the Jebusites who live there.

541
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:40,790
And it's not until King David
200 years later that in fact,

542
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,400
we will read about the
capture of Jerusalem.

543
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:49,040
Judges one gives a long list of the
places from which the Canaanites were not

544
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,200
expelled.
Also,

545
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:56,030
archeological evidence contradicts the
picture in Joshua in the ancient near

546
00:32:56,031 --> 00:32:59,300
east destroyed cities tended to be
leveled and then a new city would just be

547
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:03,980
built on top of the ruins and you would
have these slowly rising mounds and that

548
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,640
each one of those is called a tail,
right? So you may have heard of tell door.

549
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,480
These aren't mounds which represent
the successive layers of destroyed and

550
00:33:11,481 --> 00:33:16,010
rebuilt cities and excavations.
We'll reveal the destruction layers,

551
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:20,570
um, under the floor of new cities.
So following the biblical account,

552
00:33:20,571 --> 00:33:25,571
we would expect evidence of a 13 century
destruction of Canaanite cities and

553
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,020
archeologists for a long time were
convinced that they would find these

554
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:32,360
destruction layers. Um,
but they were disappointed.

555
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:38,080
They have found really no evidence of
extensive conquest and destruction in 13th

556
00:33:39,111 --> 00:33:41,570
and 12th century archeological layers.

557
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:45,650
Some of the sites that are said to be
destroyed by Joshua and the Israelites

558
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,280
weren't even occupied in, in
this period, the late Bronze Age,

559
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:51,800
beginning of the Iron Age, right?
The Iron Age begins around 1200.

560
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:57,290
So excavations at Jericho and I indicate
that both of these towns were laid

561
00:33:57,291 --> 00:34:01,490
waste at least 200 years before
the probable time of Joshua.

562
00:34:01,491 --> 00:34:06,491
So there weren't even any walls in
Jericho at the time of Joshua of 20

563
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:11,270
identifiable sites that were said to be
conquered or captured by Joshua and the

564
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:16,160
next generations only to show
destruction layers for this time. Hud,

565
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:19,430
soar and Bates l.
And yet interestingly enough,

566
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,640
HUD source capture described Joshua
is contradicted elsewhere in the Bible

567
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:25,190
because in judges four and five,
it's still a Canaanite city.

568
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:27,800
It said there that it's still a Canaanite
city and Joshua failed to take it.

569
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,280
So the conclusion one can draw from all
of this is that Joshua two through 12 is

570
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,560
a kind of ideological construction.

571
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,240
The significance and the purpose of
which we'll come back to in a moment,

572
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:46,490
but clearly the formation of a nation
state Israel was much more complicated

573
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,290
than the picture that's
presented in Joshua.

574
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:53,291
Two through 12 scholars have proposed
three possible models to explain the

575
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:57,380
formation of Israel.
The first is an immigration model.

576
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,320
This was first posed by a German scholars,

577
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:08,330
um, since the main Canaanites cities that
existed in the land at that time were

578
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:12,470
fortified, are walled cities down
on the plains, the Israelites,

579
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:15,710
it's thought according to this model
would have entered and they would have

580
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:18,820
occupied the very sparsely
populated central highlands.

581
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:22,070
They would slowly have
began to take control of the
plane's coming down from the

582
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:26,450
highlands. While we do know that
at the end of the late Bronze Age,

583
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:28,310
beginning of the Iron Age around 1200.

584
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,580
This was a time of great upheaval
throughout the Mediterranean world.

585
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,840
You have the collapse of Mycenaean
civilization, you have the Trojan wars,

586
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,560
the Hittites are Asia minor, modern,
modern day Turkey, uh, to the north.

587
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,270
And these upheavals are leading to
mass migrations, migrations of people.

588
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,320
Many are sailing from mainland Greece
and from the Greek islands and they are

589
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,760
flooding this area there, the coasts of
Phoenicia, the coast of Canaan and Egypt.

590
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,890
And these people are,

591
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,170
are spoken about in a lot of our ancient
sources are referred to as peoples of

592
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:02,700
the sea coming in from the sea, from
islands and coastal areas of the north,

593
00:36:02,701 --> 00:36:06,540
eastern Mediterranean,
one of these peoples of the sea.

594
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,880
One of these groups
inhabited an area here.

595
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,750
One of these groups put
Rasta harassed or per lasta.

596
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:17,160
This is the word Palestine comes from
this Podesta, pilaster or Philistines.

597
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:19,070
It's all the same route.
Um,

598
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,470
and so a group of these see peoples
comes in and occupies this area.

599
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,730
They will be the Philistines.

600
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:28,050
The area that is now the Gaza Strip and
they found the five Philistine cities

601
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:30,750
that you'll hear about
increasingly in the book of judges,

602
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,960
Gaza Ashkelon got Ashdod and Eq.
Ron,

603
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:40,110
the idea of the integration model is that
Hebrew settlement would have probably

604
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:44,310
occurred at about the same time. I'm
in the latter part of the 13th century.

605
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:49,290
The Hebrews could take advantage of all
of these upheavals and the weakened hold

606
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:51,930
of Egypt, right? Remember each
of Ted Control of this area,

607
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:53,670
but their grasp is weakening with the,

608
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,130
with the flood of people
coming in from the,

609
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,750
from the sea and other migrations there
hold is weakening and the Israelites

610
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:00,990
would have,

611
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,590
or the Hebrews would have been able to
take advantage of that and enter in and

612
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:05,820
occupied areas in the central highlands.

613
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,920
The problem with the immigration model
again is the archaeological record.

614
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,870
Archeologists have indeed found several
sites in the central hill country.

615
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:19,740
It's just pretty exciting and they're
clearly newly established in the 13th,

616
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:20,850
12th,
11th centuries.

617
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,560
So clearly something new was happening in
the central highlands at this time. Um,

618
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,620
it also extends throughout the land
but mostly the central highlands.

619
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:33,060
And these are thought to be Israelite
especially because they appear in places

620
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:35,910
that the Bible identifies
as strongholds of Israel.

621
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:41,210
So you remember also you have their Moneta
a steel of 1204 in which the Egyptian

622
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:44,040
Pharaoh boasts that he
managed to wipe out Israel.

623
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,260
It's obviously a hyperbolic boat boast,

624
00:37:46,261 --> 00:37:50,790
but the point is it shows that there was
an identifiable entity Israel in Canaan

625
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:53,710
by 1204.
Um,

626
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:57,660
these new 13th century settlements,
however,

627
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,590
are in their material culture. That is
to say their, their pots in their jars,

628
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:06,591
in their houses entirely
Canaanite inhabitants seem
to have been peasant farmers

629
00:38:07,741 --> 00:38:09,210
like other Canaanites.

630
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,270
One interesting difference is
the absence of any pig bones,

631
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,420
which is kind of interesting.
But in any event,

632
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,570
this suggests that these settlements
were established peacefully,

633
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,910
not by a group coming in and,
and conquering.

634
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:25,620
Maybe they emerged from
within rather than, um,

635
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,500
being established by people's
immigrating from without.

636
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,690
So there are two other models.

637
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,650
Then other model is different from the
immigration model to other models for

638
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:39,130
understanding the formation of Israel that
build on this archaeological evidence.

639
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,920
The second model is what
we call the revolt model.

640
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,260
The revolt model proposes that Israel
began really as a social revolution within

641
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:52,620
Canaan.
We do have a set of letters.

642
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:55,950
These are letters that date
from the 14th century BCE.

643
00:38:55,951 --> 00:39:00,600
They were written by people in Canaan
to the Pharaoh in Egypt. Remember,

644
00:39:00,601 --> 00:39:03,060
the Pharaohs still has control
over Canaan at this time.

645
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:07,560
And then these letters are lots of
complaints about groups that are causing

646
00:39:07,561 --> 00:39:09,600
turmoil and upset in Canaan.

647
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:13,860
There challenging Egypt's rule and
these people are called [inaudible] or

648
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,150
[inaudible]. Um, they
weren't an ethnic group. Um,

649
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:22,590
so much as a marginal social
group of people in revolt,

650
00:39:22,591 --> 00:39:23,424
if you will,

651
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:28,490
some have suggested that Israelites
escaping from Egypt may have joined with

652
00:39:29,191 --> 00:39:34,191
these disaffected Canaanites in revolt
known as that be of these troublemakers,

653
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:38,830
um, to establish their own settlements
and to worship elaborator God. Yeah,

654
00:39:38,831 --> 00:39:41,820
way rather than follow
the rule of Pharaoh.

655
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:47,190
A final model then is a
model of gradual emergence,

656
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:56,610
which simply holds that Israelites were
basically Canaanites who had developed a

657
00:39:57,071 --> 00:40:00,460
separate identity and settled
increasingly in the central highlands.

658
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:02,050
They withdrew and settled in this area.

659
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,770
The theory doesn't try to explain
why they separated. We don't know.

660
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:07,180
Perhaps it was disaffection.

661
00:40:07,181 --> 00:40:11,410
Perhaps they were pushed out by the
invading see peoples and maybe it was

662
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:14,890
something else.
But they withdrew for some reason.

663
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:19,990
And how and why they took up the worship
of Yahweh or the cult of Yahweh isn't

664
00:40:19,991 --> 00:40:20,824
really clear,

665
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:25,270
but it seems to have been what marked
them as distinct from other Canaanites.

666
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:30,540
The [inaudible] may have been introduced
by people escaping slavery from Egypt.

667
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:35,470
Most scholars see the exodus story as
evidence for the presence of some escaped

668
00:40:35,471 --> 00:40:39,880
slaves among this community. So the
important thing is that the Hebrews,

669
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:43,660
at this stage,
we're probably not a United people.

670
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:48,670
Various elements went into the final mix
that would emerge as the nation Israel

671
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,110
local Canaanites who for some reason
with drew and establish their own

672
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:57,760
settlements with a continuous
material culture and established, um,

673
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,490
agricultural lifestyle.
You have them,

674
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,660
you have escaping slaves from Egypt and
remember we do have some evidence of

675
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:06,010
destruction from outside,

676
00:41:06,011 --> 00:41:10,750
so there could also have been some
foreigners coming in and destroying and

677
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:11,584
settling.

678
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,460
It even seems that some local foreigners
were admitted to the community.

679
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:18,400
We read of Midianites who
covenant into the community.

680
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:23,260
We read if Ken EITs who Covenant Covenant
into the community and archaeological

681
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,120
archeology supports this picture of
merging of people's, a picture of,

682
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,890
of the merging of peoples rather than
conquest or even large scale immigration

683
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:37,040
because the new settlements in this
period show such continuity with the past,

684
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:38,990
with the past,
not a complete break.

685
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,890
I'm not the initiation of
something radically new. And again,

686
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:46,130
some of the elements within this group
may have brought with them the story of a

687
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,810
miraculous escape from Egypt.

688
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:53,150
They may have understood this to be the
work of the halfway a god known probably

689
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:58,151
from southern regions and so the mixed
group that would join together to become

690
00:41:58,671 --> 00:42:00,260
Israel accepted.
Yeah,

691
00:42:00,261 --> 00:42:04,910
way though perhaps not exclusively and
adopted the national story of the exodus

692
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,781
as its own.

693
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:10,781
At some point the Hebrew tribes themselves
were likely still in the process of

694
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:11,684
formation,

695
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,590
but the tribal structure of Israelite
Society that would develop would be

696
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:19,220
strengthened by the natural division
of the land into these separate

697
00:42:19,221 --> 00:42:22,560
geographical areas that only reinforced,
um,

698
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,580
the tribal tribalization of,
of society.

699
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:30,530
And these local tribes probably
did assimilate elements
of the local population.

700
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,470
We've really seen already,
um,

701
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:37,940
the ethnic mix of various elements
reflected in religious imagery and

702
00:42:37,941 --> 00:42:39,610
institutions. We've seen that, yeah,

703
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:43,250
way is represented in terms
reminiscent of the tent dweller,

704
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:48,310
l the god of the semi nomadic tent dwell
in Hebrews and their patriarchs and

705
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:50,720
certainly it god of
the Canaanite Pantheon.

706
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:54,800
We've seen that Yahweh way
is also represented in terms
reminiscent of bowel of

707
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:59,780
the Canaanite Pantheon, the god of the
settled Canaanite population. In fact,

708
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:03,680
in the book of judges,
you will read of a temple to Israel's God,

709
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:07,500
the God of the Covenant. And
that temple is um, called, uh,

710
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,750
the temple to the god of
the covenant or bow buried.

711
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:13,100
The word Burrito means covenant.

712
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,700
It's referred to as bow breed.

713
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:20,300
It's referred to as El
Burrito or bile l breed.

714
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,210
And this is in reference to Yap way.

715
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,930
These terms are all used to describe
the God of the Covenant, so in short,

716
00:43:26,931 --> 00:43:31,460
we really may hypothesize
a union of cultural,

717
00:43:31,461 --> 00:43:35,120
religious and ethnic elements,
local Canaanite agriculturalists,

718
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:38,780
semi nomadic Hebrews,
perhaps of the exodus escaped slaves,

719
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:43,190
perhaps happy rule up here through a
disaffected or a group that's in revolt.

720
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:47,060
All of these would come together to
produce what would be a new political and

721
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:50,750
religious reality called Israel.
If so,

722
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,530
why does the book of Joshua
provides such a different account?

723
00:43:55,250 --> 00:44:00,250
One of outside conquest by means of a
war led by the hosts of the Lord because

724
00:44:01,011 --> 00:44:01,611
in this account,

725
00:44:01,611 --> 00:44:05,930
military skill is much less important
than ritual preparation and purity, right?

726
00:44:05,931 --> 00:44:09,860
The Israelites marched around Jericho
for six days with seven priests carrying

727
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:13,720
seven horns and the Ark of the covenant
and then with a blast and a shout,

728
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,050
the walls tumble.

729
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:19,190
The conquest is represented as
a miraculous victory by God.

730
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:23,330
That's emphasized in Joshua
24 12 it wasn't. It was God,

731
00:44:23,331 --> 00:44:26,330
not the sword or the bow
that drove out the enemy.

732
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:32,260
And why the claim of the utter destruction
of the Canaanites when points to

733
00:44:32,581 --> 00:44:36,990
close Canaanite origins, this
practice, which I mentioned before,

734
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:40,260
it was known as hair ram or the
ban is not unique to Israel.

735
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,210
I know some of you have
studied it in sections.

736
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:46,320
You looked at the inscription of King
Mesha can measure of Moab and there's a

737
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:50,940
very, a important famous inscription from
the Ninth Century BCE written by King

738
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:55,530
measure of Moab. MARV is to the south
east. No, so I'm bad with directions.

739
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:58,290
South West. Yeah, that's east.
Yeah. So kind of to the east,

740
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:00,080
southeast of the Dead Sea.
Um,

741
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:03,660
so king may show of my lab and
in the inscription he writes,

742
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:08,370
he boasts and the God emotion said to me,
go take Nivo from Israel.

743
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:12,060
So I went by night and fought against
it from the break of dawn until noon,

744
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,060
taking it in slaying all 7,000 men,
boys,

745
00:45:15,061 --> 00:45:18,660
women and girls and maid servants for I
had devoted them to destruction for the

746
00:45:18,661 --> 00:45:21,030
god, Ash, dark emotion referring to him.

747
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:25,800
It's likely that such claims
are hyperbolic in Moab and uh,

748
00:45:25,801 --> 00:45:27,600
it's likely they were
hyperbolic in Israel,

749
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:31,050
but that doesn't lessen the shock value
for a modern reader even though war and

750
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:33,570
our time is no less
savage and no less brutal.

751
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,880
But the important question here is why a
biblical writer or editor would want to

752
00:45:38,881 --> 00:45:41,820
insist that the Canaanites were
to be completely destroyed.

753
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,090
I think assertions of national identity
and independence are often predicated on

754
00:45:48,091 --> 00:45:51,390
differentiation from others.
If the Israelites were in fact,

755
00:45:51,391 --> 00:45:55,530
basically Canaanites who had withdrawn
from the larger collective who insisted

756
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:59,790
on the overlord ship of Galloway and
Canaanites who did not join them in this,

757
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:02,160
where a special threat
to the new, yeah, wisdom,

758
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,650
this same dynamic of intense sibling
rivalry appears again in the first few

759
00:46:07,651 --> 00:46:11,910
centuries of the common era when some
Jews separated from others and in

760
00:46:11,911 --> 00:46:15,870
differentiating themselves and creating
their own identity as Christians felt it

761
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:19,500
necessary to engage in devastating leave
at [inaudible] and violent rhetoric

762
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:23,370
against their fellow Jews. The
interesting thing, however,

763
00:46:23,371 --> 00:46:26,940
is that we mustn't ignore another voice
that's in the biblical text and it's a

764
00:46:26,941 --> 00:46:29,550
voice that adds a level of
complexity to this picture.

765
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:34,650
Because alongside the idealized portrayal
of the Israelite conquest in the first

766
00:46:34,651 --> 00:46:38,430
half of the book of Joshua alongside
the call for the destruction of all

767
00:46:38,431 --> 00:46:42,460
Canaanites, we find interesting
tales of alliances and um,

768
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,400
incorporation of various Canaanite groups.
Indeed who is one of the battles,

769
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:51,840
uh, one of the heroines of the battle
of Jericho, if not a Canaanite woman,

770
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,150
a prostitute,
no less named Rahab.

771
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,230
She declares her faith in the hallway
and she delivers the city into Joshua's

772
00:46:58,231 --> 00:46:58,831
hands.

773
00:46:58,831 --> 00:47:03,831
The biblical writers soft fit to preserve
and include this account of a heroic

774
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,840
Canaanite prostitute,
another Canaanite group. Uh,

775
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,670
the give me nights trick the Israelites
and to making a covenant with them and

776
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:14,820
it's a covenant the Israelites.
Then I feel bound to observe.

777
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:19,410
Michael Coogan has described
such stories as ecological tales.

778
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,970
They are attempts to explain the fact
that there are lots of Canaanite groups

779
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:28,560
included in Israel and we
need to understand and explain
that reality as much as

780
00:47:28,561 --> 00:47:32,800
we are an ideological account in which
all Canaanites are obliterated are

781
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:33,634
destroyed.

782
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:39,270
At the very least these stories raise
questions about the biblical portrait or

783
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:44,200
portrayal of invasion and conquest and
at most they illustrate the biblical

784
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:47,170
writers taste for literary subversion.
Yet again,

785
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:52,350
something we'll see over and over the
imperative of preserving a distinct

786
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:54,904
identity.

787
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:59,680
It's based on giving up the worship of
other of other gods are older gods and

788
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:01,160
observing.
All that is written in the,

789
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:06,130
in the law of Moses is reiterated in
Joshua's farewell address in Joshua 23 and

790
00:48:06,131 --> 00:48:11,020
in the Covenant Renewal Ceremony in 24
and the central idea is that there is one

791
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:16,021
proper response to God's mighty acts on
behalf of Israel and that is resolute

792
00:48:16,211 --> 00:48:20,170
observance of the book of the Torah of
Moses without intermingling with the

793
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:23,320
peoples that remain.
So in Joshua 23 verses seven and eight,

794
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,320
do not under the names of
their gods or swear by them.

795
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:28,150
Do not serve them or bow down to them,

796
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:33,100
but hold fast to the Lord your God is you
have done this day and verses 11 to 13

797
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,750
for your own sakes.
Therefore,

798
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:38,770
be most mindful to love the Lord your
God for you should you turn away and

799
00:48:38,771 --> 00:48:41,050
attach yourself to the
remnant of these nations,

800
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:43,570
to those that are left among
you and intermarry with them.

801
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,120
You joining them and they join in.

802
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,670
You know for certain that the Lord your
God will not continue to drive these

803
00:48:48,671 --> 00:48:52,090
nations out before you. They shall
become a snare and a trap for you,

804
00:48:52,091 --> 00:48:56,230
a scorge to your sides and thorns in
your eyes until you perish from this good

805
00:48:56,231 --> 00:48:58,300
land that the Lord your God has given you.

806
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,770
In 24 the Israelites are assembled at
check them to renew the covenant and

807
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:06,910
Joshua be counts God's mighty deeds on
behalf of Israel and exhorts them to

808
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:10,090
choose whom they will serve. Yeah.
Highway. Who's done all of this for them,

809
00:49:10,091 --> 00:49:15,091
so undeservedly or the gods of those
whose lands they are settling in and the

810
00:49:15,401 --> 00:49:19,030
people are warned of God's jealousy.
He demands exclusive loyalty.

811
00:49:19,031 --> 00:49:23,080
He will not tolerate any deviation
in service of alien gods.

812
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,930
The ban on intermarriage
here is quite specific.

813
00:49:25,931 --> 00:49:27,850
It's directed against Canaanites only,

814
00:49:27,851 --> 00:49:31,150
not all non Israelites
for very specific reason.

815
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,880
Religious purity marriage with Canaanites.

816
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:38,500
The people closest to you specifically
will lead to the worship of the of that

817
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:38,921
spouses,

818
00:49:38,921 --> 00:49:43,921
God and Israel is to show
undivided loyalty to God or
God will take the gift of

819
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:46,690
the land from her as
he did the Canaanites.

820
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,300
One last remark for you to think about,

821
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,690
consider the position of the
Israelites in the sixth century.

822
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:56,710
The time of the final editing
of the Deuteronomistic history.

823
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:59,170
The Israelites are sitting
in exile in Babylon.

824
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:02,950
They're trying to make sense of the
tragedy that has befallen them the loss of

825
00:50:02,951 --> 00:50:03,784
their land.

826
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:08,890
Consider how a text like Joshua 23 in
Joshua 24 would go a long way towards

827
00:50:08,891 --> 00:50:11,260
explaining their fate
while retaining faith.

828
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:15,070
In way we're going to be turned to this
when we reached the conclusion of the

829
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:17,140
digital animistic history in second kings.
