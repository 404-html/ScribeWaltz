1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,590
We were talking last time
about the mysterious episode
by the [inaudible] River,

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,440
uh,
when Jacob undergoes a change name.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,920
And I mentioned the fact
that in the biblical view,

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,120
the name of something somehow encapsulates
its very essence and knowing the name

5
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:19,050
of something gives one power
or control over that thing.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,980
Many commentators have observed that the
change in name accompanies a change in

7
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:30,300
character, a change of essence
in Israel. So some have a noted,

8
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:34,140
one scholar in particular is noted that
the struggle with the angel is the final

9
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:39,141
purging of the unsavory qualities of
character that Marc Jacobs past career.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,990
And although Jacob appears to
be something of an anti hero,

11
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:46,720
he actually literally limps into
the promised land alone. Uh,

12
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,570
Jacob is a new and honest man and we
see this immediately in his reunion with

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,050
Esau. He greets his former rival
and enemy with these words.

14
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,900
This is in Genesis 33 verses 10 to 11.

15
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,930
If you would do me this
favor except for me,

16
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:05,190
this gift for to see your face is like
seeing the face of God and you have

17
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:08,070
received me favorably.
Please accept my present,

18
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:11,130
which has been brought to you for
God has favored me and I have plenty.

19
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,570
And when he urged him,
he accepted with Jacob,

20
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:16,530
who is now Israel.

21
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:21,510
God's seems perhaps to finally have found
the working relationship with humans

22
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:24,210
that he has been seeking
since their creation.

23
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,210
God learned immediately after creating
this unique being that he will exercise

24
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:33,420
his free will against God. God's seed, uh,

25
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:38,220
saw that he had to limit the lifespan
of humans or risk creating an enemy that

26
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:42,960
was nearly equal to him.
So he casts the humans out of the garden,

27
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:44,910
blocks access to the tree of life.

28
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,050
But humans continue their violence
and evil ways. And in desperation,

29
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,330
God wipes him out and starts again.

30
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,040
And this second creation proves
to be not much better. Um, gut.

31
00:01:56,041 --> 00:02:00,870
They forget God, they turn to idolatry.
God has promised at this point, however,

32
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,180
not to destroy all humankind again.

33
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,270
So he experiments with a single
individual of faith and Abraham's faith

34
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,320
withstands many a trial.

35
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,220
He is obedient to God in a way that no
one has been up to this point in the

36
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:15,054
narrative.

37
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,620
But perhaps ultimately the model
of blind obedience is rejected too.

38
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,130
When Abraham prepares to
slaughter his own son,

39
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,540
perhaps God sees that blind faith
can be as destructive and evil as

40
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,680
disobedience. So God relinquishes
his demand for blind obedience,

41
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:33,540
he stops Abraham himself.

42
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,080
The only relationship that will work
with humans is perhaps one in which there

43
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:44,661
is a balance between unchecked
independence and blind
obedience and God seems to

44
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:49,260
find that relationship with Jacob and
the metaphor for that relationship is a

45
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:53,760
metaphor of struggle or wrestling.
Remember East by all means,

46
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:55,890
one who wrestles,
who struggles with God,

47
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,920
God and humans lock in
an eternal struggle,

48
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,220
neither prevailing yet both
forever changed by their
encounter with one another.

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,340
Now, the rest of genesis relates the
story of Joseph and his brothers,

50
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:11,650
the 12 the 12 sons of Jacob.

51
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,940
It's one of the most magnificent
psychological dramas in the Bible.

52
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:17,350
The stories intensely human.

53
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:20,980
We don't have a lot of supernatural
interference in this story if focuses very

54
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:23,800
much on the family relationships
and the jealousies,

55
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,170
very little reference
to a divine perspective.

56
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,550
It's like a little novella and scholars
are divided over the authenticity of the

57
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:33,430
Egyptian elements. In the story, you
will read radically diverse things,

58
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:37,750
some point to the presence of Egyptian
names and customs and religious beliefs

59
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:42,730
and laws as a sign of, of,
uh, some historical memory,
uh, being preserved in this,

60
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,300
in these stories. Others point to
all the problems, the anachronisms,

61
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,080
the general lack of
specificity that's assigned,

62
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,430
that these are composed quite late.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,720
The Art of dream interpretation plays
a very important role in this story.

64
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,300
And dream interpretation
was a developed science,

65
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:01,240
particularly in Egypt and the
other parts of Mesopotamia,

66
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,850
but the Egyptians were known in the
ancient world is dream interpreters.

67
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,120
Joseph is also known for his
ability to interpret dreams,

68
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,540
but the biblical narrator, the
monetizing biblical narrator, uh,

69
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,430
is very concerned to describe him as
reporting what God reveals to him rather

70
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:20,410
than relying on some kind of occult
science of interpretation. Now,

71
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:25,210
Joseph's brothers are jealous
of Jacob's partiality to Joseph,

72
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,080
and they conspire to be rid of him.
But at the last moment,

73
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:33,280
his brother Judah convinces the
brothers that if instead of killing him,

74
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:37,180
they sell him, they can profit
a little for their troubles.

75
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,860
So Joseph is sold,

76
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:43,861
ultimately ends up in the household of
Pharaoh in Egypt and his adventures there

77
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,780
prove his a meritorious character.

78
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,280
So he rises to a position of great
power when he correctly interprets, um,

79
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:53,980
some dreams regarding an impending famine.

80
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,110
And with Joseph as the governor of the
country in control of the grain supply,

81
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:04,150
Egypt's successfully weathers seven
years of famine. Now this famine,

82
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:05,860
which strikes Kanan as well,

83
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,030
drives Joseph's brothers
to Egypt in search of food.

84
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,380
And Joseph doesn't reveal himself to
his brothers. He puts them to the test.

85
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:18,700
He wants to know if they are the same
men who so callously broke their father's

86
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:23,110
heart by selling Joseph his
father's favorite so many years ago.

87
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,050
And in the climactic moment in the story,

88
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,820
Joseph demands that his frightened
brothers leave Benjamin,

89
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,210
the other son of Rachel,
the other son of the beloved wife,

90
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,180
leave Benjamin as a pledge in Egypt.

91
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,410
And Joseph knows that it would
decimate his father Jacob to lose.

92
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:43,420
Rachel's only remaining son,

93
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,380
but he's testing his brothers to see
whether they have reforms since the day

94
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:50,470
that they sold him into slavery.
And indeed Judah,

95
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:54,880
the one who had figured so prominently
in the sale of Joseph that had crushed

96
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:59,360
his father Judah steps and offers
himself instead of Benjamin.

97
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:03,610
He says it would, it would kill my father
now to lose Benjamin. Um, the, the last,

98
00:06:03,611 --> 00:06:05,690
uh,
son of his beloved wife Rachel.

99
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:10,760
So the brothers having proven their
new integrity, uh, Joseph weeps,

100
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:15,380
he reveals his identity in a very moving
scene and ultimately the family has

101
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:20,381
relocated to and reunited in Egypt where
they live peacefully and prosperously

102
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,160
for some generations.

103
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,700
That's the basic outline of the
story of Joseph and his brothers.

104
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:30,701
But one of the important themes of
these stories is the theme of God's

105
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:35,150
Providence. The writer wants
to represent Jacob's sons.

106
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,560
They're petty jealousies there.
Murderous conspiracy, Joseph himself,

107
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,790
all as the unwitting instruments
of a larger divine plan.

108
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,830
In effect, Joseph says to his brothers
in Genesis 50 verse 20, as for you,

109
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,690
you meant evil against me,

110
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,620
but God meant it for good to bring it
about that many people should be kept

111
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:58,940
alive as they are today.
So Joseph's betrayal by his brothers,

112
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:00,920
his descent into Egypt,
uh,

113
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,610
set the stage not only for the
reformation of his brothers characters,

114
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:06,140
which is an important part of the story,

115
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,940
but for the descent of all of the
Israelites into Egypt so as to survive

116
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,800
widespread famine. So yet another
threat to the promise is overcome.

117
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:20,120
Threat of famine is overcome by the
relocation to Egypt. Significantly,

118
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,380
God says to Jacob in genesis 46,
verse four,

119
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,920
I myself will go down with you to Egypt
and I myself will also bring you back.

120
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,020
So in short, there seems
to be a plan afoot, right?

121
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:35,810
The writer wants to represent God.
God's going down there and he will,

122
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,920
he will bring them back.

123
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,350
Israel's descent to Egypt sets the stage
for the rise of a pharaoh who the texts

124
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:46,130
says didn't know Joseph and
all that he had done for Egypt.

125
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,980
And this new pharaoh will
enslave the Israelites,

126
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:52,820
and so embitter their lives that
they're cry will rise up to heaven.

127
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:54,770
The same cry from the
generation of the flood,

128
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:59,510
the same cry from Sodom and Gomorrah,
and thus begins the book of Exodus,

129
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:02,090
which will lead us from Egypt to Sinai.

130
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,600
Most of the narrative account
in Genesis 12 to 50 is uh,

131
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,770
with the exception of the
Joseph story actually,

132
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:13,940
but most of genesis 12 through 50 is
assigned by scholars to the j source.

133
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,390
And certain themes emerge
in the j narrative.

134
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,840
The first is that while God's promise
is sure the manner and the timing of its

135
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:26,120
fulfillment is quite unpredictable,

136
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,220
the land never belongs to the
Patriarchs to whom it was promised their

137
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:33,200
descendants will take possession of it,

138
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:37,130
but only after tremendous
struggle in other ways,

139
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:38,840
God's methods are curious.

140
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,220
Why does he go against the traditional
ancient near eastern practice of

141
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:47,240
primogenitor primogenitor
inheritance by the firstborn,

142
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,780
he chooses Jacob a liar and a cheat in
his early life over the elder east saw.

143
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,030
Why does he choose young Joseph
who's an arrogant, spoiled Brat?

144
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,330
He provokes his brother's with
his delusions of grandeur.

145
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,230
Compare the law of primogenitor that's
listed in Deuteronomy 21 verses 15 to 17

146
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,750
if a man has two wives,

147
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,870
one loved and one the other unloved and
both the loved and the unloved have born

148
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:19,440
him sons. But the first born
is the son of the unloved one.

149
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,900
When he wills his property to his sons,

150
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:26,820
he may not treat as first born the son
of the loved one in disregard of the son

151
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,870
of the unloved one who is older.
And yet isn't this what happens to you?

152
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,690
Should mail, is it? This
is what happens to Esau,

153
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,830
is this what happens to all of Joseph's
brothers who are born before him?

154
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,890
And there's no explanation
in the text yet,

155
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:45,891
despite the false starts and the trials
and the years of famine and the and the

156
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:48,420
childlessness and the infertility,

157
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,500
the seed of Abraham survives
and the promise is reiterated,

158
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:57,501
I will go down myself with you to Egypt
and I myself will also bring you back.

159
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:03,020
So ultimately the j source would appear
to assert God does control history all

160
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:05,910
tends toward his purpose.

161
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,900
And the book of Exodus is really the
sequel then to the book of Genesis. Um,

162
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,670
despite God's promise of land and
blessing, things don't look so good.

163
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:19,020
At the end of Genesis, the book closes
with the Israelites residing in Egypt.

164
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,030
They've managed to procure a no more
than a burial plot in the promised land.

165
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,680
Even God has left his land descending
with the Israelites into Egypt.

166
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:31,590
So the promises and their
fulfillment seem quite remote.

167
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,970
The book of Exodus will relate the
beginning of the process by which the

168
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:40,971
promises will be fulfilled just charted
the structure very briefly for you so

169
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:43,200
you can get your footing
in the book of Exodus.

170
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,610
The first 15 chapters tell
the story of Israel in Egypt,

171
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,700
the rise of a new pharaoh
who didn't know Joseph,

172
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,900
the oppression of the Israelites,
their enslavement in a state labor force,

173
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,910
the killing of all firstborn Hebrew
males. Um, the birth, the early life,

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,730
the call of Moses,
the struggle for freedom.

175
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,930
Moses will plead with the Pharaoh to let
his people go and worship their God in

176
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:10,170
the wilderness. Um, and
then the final liberation.

177
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:13,860
When God does something at the Red Sea.

178
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:17,480
We'll talk about that later so
that the Israelites can pass, uh,

179
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,180
leaving the heavy Egyptian Cherry
tree to flounder in the mud.

180
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,880
We have about two and a half
chapters 15 verse 22 til chapter 18.

181
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,420
That recounts then the
journey towards Sinai. Uh,

182
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,110
this is a journey that's filled with
complaints that people complain they're

183
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:39,111
going to starve and God responds with
quail and Manna and water chapters 19 to

184
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:41,790
24 very,

185
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:46,290
very important chapters that contain the
theophanous self revelation of God to

186
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:49,260
the Israelites and the covenant
that's concluded at Sinai.

187
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:51,090
We'll be talking more about that next time

188
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,340
versus a chapters 25 to 40,
um,

189
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,550
contained beside the incident. The
unfortunate incident with the golden calf,

190
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:01,990
which is an exodus 32,

191
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,260
but the rest of this unit from 25 to 40
is God's instructions on how to build or

192
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:08,890
erect the tabernacle.

193
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,490
And then an account of the Israelites
actually constructing a erecting the

194
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,680
tabernacle source.

195
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:18,940
Critical scholars believe that Jay
supplies the main narrative of this unit.

196
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:23,200
In exodus, it's supplemented by
excerpts from [inaudible], from e,

197
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,190
and then the addition of considerable,
um,

198
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,490
legal and ritual and
geological material from p.

199
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:36,450
Now the historical value of the
exodus story has fascinated scholars,

200
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,410
but also lay people for generations.
Could the exodus really have happened?

201
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,140
And if so, when? And does it matter?

202
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,830
And is there any evidence for the story,
for example,

203
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:51,880
an external sources outside
the Bible? Well, no,

204
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,120
there isn't any direct evidence
outside the Bible. Well,

205
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:56,140
let's start at the beginning.

206
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,490
We do have a victory him a victory,

207
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,610
and that's inscribed on a steel
a or a slab of stone, I guess,

208
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,880
which was erected in the year 1204 BCE.

209
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,390
It was erected by a pharaoh,
Pharaoh, Marin, Septa.

210
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,310
So this delay of Moneta dates to
about 1204. And in this victory him,

211
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:18,760
he's boasting of his victory
over various groups in Canaan.

212
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,580
And one of the groups he claims
to have to feed it is Israel.

213
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,470
Now this is a fabulously
important inscription because
it's the earliest known

214
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:33,040
reference outside the Bible to any
person or entity that is mentioned in the

215
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:33,874
Bible.

216
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,300
And it suggests that a people known as
Israel was indeed in the land of Canaan

217
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,130
by the end of the 13th century BCE.

218
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,560
Whether they arrived there after an exodus
from Egypt is not of course indicated

219
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,330
the source doesn't tell us that.

220
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,020
And in fact there's really no
archeological evidence of a group,

221
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:55,780
a large group entering the
land of Canaan at this time.

222
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:57,700
There's a steady cultural continuum,

223
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,230
not a not evidence of destruction as
we would expect for a big invasion.

224
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,460
We'll talk more about that when we get
to the book of Joshua, but nevertheless,

225
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:09,430
let's just go with this for a minute
and if we suppose that it took about a

226
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,630
generation to enter the land. So you
see I've done the math on the side here.

227
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:16,330
I suppose I should've done subtractions
and since we're talking BCE,

228
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,800
but if we put 20 years in four actually
arriving and settling in the land,

229
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:25,801
that takes us to about two 20 1225 and
if we assume 40 years of wandering in the

230
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:28,330
desert or wandering from Egypt,

231
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,230
that takes us to about 1265
as a date for the exodus.

232
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:37,650
While in 1265 the 18th dynasty sees most
illustrious farrow occupied the throne

233
00:14:38,801 --> 00:14:43,660
Ramses the second who in fact was
pharaoh for 70 years or something,

234
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:48,430
most of the 13th century, and he is
very famous for his building projects.

235
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,800
Now,
according to the biblical record,

236
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:55,730
the Hebrews were set to work on urban
building projects in the Delta region

237
00:14:55,731 --> 00:14:57,830
where the Nile at the
north part of the Nile,

238
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:01,760
the Delta region of the Nile in the
cities of [inaudible] and Ramses.

239
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,770
The Bible states that Israel
was in Egypt for 430 years.

240
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,760
So if we had that, then that would
put her descent into Egypt. Joseph,

241
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:15,790
the other sons of Jacob around the year
1700 while there's a certain appeal to

242
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:16,964
that scenario,

243
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,240
because in the 1720s Egypt was invaded
and conquered by a Semitic people known

244
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:28,130
as the HIG sauce. They established
a dynasty of Semitic rulers.

245
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,150
They were centered in the north of Egypt,
in the area known as Goshen.

246
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,550
So it's possible that the pharaohs of
the Hicks Sauce Dynasty might've favored

247
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,660
other Semites.

248
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:42,200
They might have allowed them to enter
in times of famine and to dwell in the

249
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:43,040
land of Goshen,

250
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:48,041
which the Bible says the Israelites lived
in the land of Goshen so that Joseph

251
00:15:48,051 --> 00:15:51,800
was submitted. Foreigner could
be elevated to an important post.

252
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:56,150
The post of governor is a little less
surprising if we suppose there was a

253
00:15:56,151 --> 00:16:00,050
Semitic regime in the 16th century.

254
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,080
The native Egyptians who were smarting
and smoldering under the humiliating

255
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:09,020
foreign rule of the Hicks sows finally
succeeded in rising up and driving them

256
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:12,080
out and reestablishing a
native Egyptian dynasty.

257
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,360
So some spa scholars have speculated that
that's the historic reality behind the

258
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:17,931
statement.

259
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:22,931
In exodus one verse 18 that a new Pharaoh
who knew nothing of Joseph and what he

260
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:25,850
had done for Egypt began
to oppress the Hebrews.

261
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:31,010
The feeling is that the establishment
of a new native Egyptian dynasty might

262
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:36,020
have led to the enslavement of any
remaining Semites or submitted outsiders.

263
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,340
And that would include of course
the Hebrews. So in all probability,

264
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:44,600
anyone who was associated with the
hated occupying regime would be treated

265
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:49,550
poorly. And it all seems to fit well.
There's a problem with this theory.

266
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:50,430
Uh,

267
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,800
the Bible itself contains
very contradictory statements
regarding the length of

268
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:57,050
the Israelites stay in Egypt.

269
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:02,170
So Exodus six versus 16 to 20 says that
the Israelites were there for only four

270
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:08,570
generations,
maybe 80 years from Levi to Moses.

271
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:12,800
Levi was a great grandfather of Moses,
so only four generations,

272
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,550
which would mean and arrival in Egypt
a long time after the hicks sauce,

273
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,680
not 430 years.

274
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,710
And we don't even know whether migration
occurred in the hicks sauce periods.

275
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:24,200
So what we have really
is only a hypothesis,

276
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,860
the 430 years numbers also
something of an ideal number.

277
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:32,660
It places the exodus 480 years before
Solomon's building of the temple.

278
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,410
480 is a multiple of 12 and the
Bible really likes multiples of 12.

279
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,850
So it is an ideal number.

280
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:40,360
It's a kind of number that
crops up a lot in biblical is,

281
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,210
which makes it suspect for
other sorts of reasons as well.

282
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:49,030
So the heck sauce theory is one that
got people very excited for awhile,

283
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,870
but it's really not well supported.
But still,

284
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:56,871
there's some very interesting
circumstantial evidence
for Semites engaged in

285
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:59,340
building projects in the 13th century.
However,

286
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:01,350
and whenever they may
have gotten into Egypt,

287
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,890
we do know archaeologically that the
fortified city of p rodacy very much like

288
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,590
Pete told,

289
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:12,590
Ramses was rebuilt in the early 13th
century on the site of the old Hicks Sauce

290
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:14,220
capitol.
There was a capital avarice.

291
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:17,940
They had moved the capital up to the
delta region. It had fallen into decay.

292
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:21,750
Now in the 13th century, this is being
rebuilt and that's in the area of Goshen.

293
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,770
So the city was being reoccupied in the
time of the Pharaoh Ramses Ramses the

294
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,330
second in the 13th century.

295
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,810
We do know that Egypt officials allowed
hungry nomads to enter the Delta region

296
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,840
for food. We have records
written records of this. Uh,

297
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,070
we also know that Semitic slaves are
well attested in Egypt at this time,

298
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:43,470
the end of the 13th century.
We also have records of that.

299
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,180
We know of a people called the
[inaudible] or [inaudible].

300
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,800
They don't seem to be an ethnic group
so much as a marginalized social class,

301
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,880
but some have suggested a
connection with the word Hebrew. Um,

302
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:02,820
we know that they worked on the
building of the capital city of Ramses.

303
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:06,000
The second other scholars deny there
would be any connection with Hebrew.

304
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,440
The debates are endless.
Um,

305
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,910
one 13th century Egyptian per pirates
describes Egypt's tight control of her

306
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:17,640
border areas and another reports,

307
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,460
some Egyptian officials
pursuing some runaway slaves.

308
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:23,310
Obviously this happened from time
to time escaping into the desert.

309
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,620
The exodus story also contains many
Egyptian elements. The name's Moses,

310
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,380
Aaron Pin Hus.
These are all Egypt.

311
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:34,860
[inaudible] name's Moses is simply

312
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,090
this part of Ramses tooth.

313
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:43,800
Moses Ramen sees this is Egyptian
for Bourn of Bourn of the god Ra.

314
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,630
The name Moses is an Egyptian name.

315
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,650
So none of this of course,

316
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,620
corroborates the specific
details of the biblical story.

317
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,690
There's no Egyptian record of the
biblical Moses, no record of plagues,

318
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:59,910
no record of a defeat of Pharaoh's army.

319
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,440
There is a lot of circumstantial evidence
and some scholars think that that

320
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:09,441
lends plausibility to a story of
slaves working on building projects.

321
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,340
Who escaped from Egypt at this time,

322
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:16,500
and if there's any historical basis to
the exodus, then the most plausible time,

323
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,390
the most plausible, plausible backdrop
would be the 13th century BCE.

324
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,790
Some scholars assume there's a historical
memory behind the elaborate and

325
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,420
dramatic story of a
miraculous redemption by God.

326
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,310
Why would you invent it?
Hero,

327
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:35,340
a national hero who's entirely
Egyptian and has an Egyptian name.

328
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:39,390
Why would you invent an or
a myth of origins in which
your ancestors are slaves?

329
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,190
Um,
nevertheless,

330
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,170
as I emphasized earlier in the
patriarchal stories, in the end,

331
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,190
we are dealing here,
sacred history.

332
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,630
We're dealing with a highly embellished
and theologically interpreted myth of

333
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:54,100
origins for a nation.

334
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,350
So much more important than historical
verifiability is the conviction of the

335
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:03,550
ancient Israelites who received and Ben
are rated these traditions and develop

336
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:07,630
them and embellish them that God
had, wants, acted on their behalf,

337
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:12,160
rescuing them from bondage, binding
them to himself in an eternal covenant.

338
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,310
A little bit about the outline of the
story and then we're going to finally have

339
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:21,370
an introduction between God and Moses,

340
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:25,480
which will I think bring us back to some
of the conversations we've had at the

341
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:26,980
beginning of the course.

342
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,040
So let me first say a little bit about
the storyline and some of the themes.

343
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,370
At the beginning of exodus, the
first, uh, six or seven chapters,

344
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,820
according to the texts the
Israelites have multiplied,

345
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,450
they filled the land of Goshen that
had been given to them during Joseph's

346
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:45,430
tenure of an office. And this new pharaoh
who feared them, he didn't know Joseph.

347
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:50,170
He feared the foreign
presence. Um, he rose and he
attempted to curb their growth.

348
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,440
He pressed all of the
adult males into slavery.

349
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:57,370
The tech says harsh labor at mortar
and brick, but the text says,

350
00:21:57,371 --> 00:21:59,980
the more they were oppressed,
the more they increased in spread out.

351
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,560
So Pharaoh resorts to
more drastic measures.

352
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,430
He decrees the murder of all newborn
Israelite males at the hands of Egyptian

353
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:10,750
midwives. He's forwarded by these
midwives. They say, oh, these,

354
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:12,550
these ladies are too quick.
We get there too late.

355
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:14,470
They've already given birth
by the time we arrive.

356
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,570
They allow the male infants to live.

357
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,100
So the Fairlawn lists all of the people
to annihilate the Israelites by drowning

358
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,770
all newborn males in the Nile river.

359
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,780
And this leads then to the account of the
birth of Moses and his exposure to the

360
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,980
Nile River. He's born to a Levite family.
The Levites will be priests in Israel.

361
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:34,750
So he's born to a priestly family.

362
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,460
He's hidden away for three months and
then he's placed in a wicker basket,

363
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:42,930
which is lined with bitchumen tar,
um,

364
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,750
and set among the bull rushes
at the edge of the Nile River.

365
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,840
Pharaoh's daughter will
eventually discover him.

366
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,910
His own mother will volunteer to be
his nurse and Pharaoh's daughter will

367
00:22:54,911 --> 00:22:58,810
eventually adopt him and named him
Moses. Again, this is an Egyptian name.

368
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:01,510
The etymology given in the
biblical text is, is invented.

369
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,170
A lot of scholars have noted
that this story is full of irony.

370
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:11,310
The rescue of Moses who will foil Pharaoh
is affected by the daughter of that

371
00:23:12,461 --> 00:23:16,840
Pharaoh and Moses grows up in a sheltered
right in the Pharaoh's own palace.

372
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:21,650
Further, the significance of Moses is
hinted at through literary allusions in,

373
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,460
in the narrative of his,
his birth, his infancy,

374
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,020
the basket in which he has placed is
called an arc. The Hebrew word is Teva.

375
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,400
This word is used precisely
twice in the entire Hebrew Bible.

376
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,580
It's not the same word that's used
for Ark of the covenant. By the way,

377
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,690
the Ark of the covenant, the word
is our own. This word for arc,

378
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,530
Teva occurs exactly twice here and
in the story of Noah's Ark. Okay.

379
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,530
Noah's Ark a Teva and scholars have always
been quick to point out that in both

380
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:53,960
cases, this, this arc, this Teva,
is in the words of one scholar,

381
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:56,840
the instrument of salvation
through perilous waters,

382
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:58,610
waters that threatened to capsize it.

383
00:23:58,611 --> 00:24:02,630
And so blot out God's hopes
and plans for his creatures.

384
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,470
Moreover,
the basket is placed among the reeds,

385
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,290
but the Hebrew word for reeds safe.

386
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:13,280
And that's a hand or an illusion to the
fact that Moses will lead the Israelites

387
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:18,110
through the Reed Sea. The yum soup. It's
not the Red Sea, it's the reeds. See,

388
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,130
but we'll talk about that
later also. But legendary. Uh,

389
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:27,080
this legendary birth story has important
parallels in ancient near eastern and

390
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:28,070
other literature.

391
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:33,080
It's very common to find stories of the
extraordinary events that surround the

392
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:38,081
birth of someone who will later become
great Cyrus of Persia eat us Jesus.

393
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,363
So on.

394
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,780
Many scholars have pointed out that this
story in particular is paralleled by

395
00:24:44,781 --> 00:24:49,781
the birth story of a great Acadian King
Sargon from about 2100 BCE Sargon of

396
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,040
ICAD,

397
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,120
strikingly similar story to Moses placed
in a basket line with tar putting the

398
00:24:56,121 --> 00:25:00,920
river and so on and underscores the
degree to which this story is part of a

399
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:03,290
literary genre,
part of the literary convention,

400
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,190
how much the exodus story itself
is very much a literary story.

401
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,860
Nothing is said of Moses,
his childhood,

402
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,500
but we learn of his awareness of his
Israelite identity or as identification

403
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:18,200
with the Hebrews in the following passage.

404
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:23,201
This is an exodus two verses 11 to 15
some time after that when Moses had grown

405
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:26,840
up, he went out to his kinsfolk
and witnessed their labors.

406
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,440
He saw an Egyptian beating,
a Hebrew, one of his kinsman.

407
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,140
He turned this way in that
and seeing no one about,

408
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:35,510
he struck down the Egyptian
and hit him in the sand.

409
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,560
When he went out the next day he found
two Hebrews fighting and so he said to

410
00:25:39,561 --> 00:25:42,980
the offender, why do you strike your
fellow? He retorted, homemade you,

411
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:45,470
chief and ruler over us.
Do you mean to kill me?

412
00:25:45,471 --> 00:25:49,490
As you killed that Egyptian Moses was
frightened and thought than the matter is

413
00:25:49,491 --> 00:25:52,850
known and when Pharaoh learned of
the matter, he sought to kill Moses,

414
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,500
but Moses fled from Pharaoh.

415
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:58,220
He arrived in the land of Midian
and sat down beside a well.

416
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,730
So coming to the aid of
an oppressed kinsmen,

417
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,920
Moses kills an Egyptian and he has to
flee to the territory of Midian and

418
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:10,840
they're at the whale again.
He acts to defend the defenseless.

419
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,170
This is a key to his character.

420
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:15,470
These two episodes are the two
that were given of Moses, his life.

421
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:20,150
So continuing verses 16
and 17 in exodus to now,

422
00:26:20,151 --> 00:26:23,930
the priest of Midian had seven daughters.
They came to draw water and fill,

423
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,450
filled the troughs to
water their father's flock.

424
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,580
But shepherds came and drove them off.

425
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,050
Moses rose to their defense and
he watered their flock. So again,

426
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:36,290
it's a key to Moses,
his character aiding the defenseless.

427
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,610
Moses will later Mary's Apora one of
these women and lives as a shepherd in

428
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:43,350
Midian for about 40 years now,

429
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,770
the situation of the Israelites in Egypt,

430
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,030
the text says remains bitter.
Exodus two 23 to 24,

431
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,020
the Israelites were groaning under the
bondage and cried out and their cry for

432
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:57,360
help from the bondage rose up to God.

433
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,470
God heard their moaning and God remembered
his covenant with Abraham and Isaac

434
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:06,471
and Jacob One day in the
wilderness at a place called Horeb,

435
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,320
also Sinai, where there's a mountain. Uh,

436
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,380
Moses sees a flame in a Bush
that doesn't consume the flame,

437
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,550
and then he hears a voice and the voice
says, I am the god of your father,

438
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,730
the god of Abraham, the god of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

439
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,170
And Moses hides his face and fear, but
God continues. He has a job for Moses.

440
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:30,240
I have marked well the plight of my people
in Egypt and have heeded their outcry

441
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:32,430
because of the task master.
Yes,

442
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:36,090
I am mindful of their sufferings and
I've come down to rescue them from the

443
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:39,720
Egyptians and to bring them out of
that land to a good and spacious land,

444
00:27:39,721 --> 00:27:43,740
a land flowing with milk and honey, the
region of the Canaanites, the Hittites,

445
00:27:43,741 --> 00:27:46,530
the Amorites, the parasites,
he invites and the Jebusites.

446
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,770
Now the cry of the Israelites
has reached me. Moreover,

447
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,950
I have seen how the Egyptians
oppress them. Come. Therefore,

448
00:27:52,951 --> 00:27:55,710
I will send you to Pharaoh
and you shall free my people.

449
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:57,450
The Israelites from Egypt.

450
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:02,400
It's exodus three verses seven to 10
and Moses Dumb Yours, right? Who? Me?

451
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:06,030
Why not my big brother Aaron?
He's a much better public speaker.

452
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,280
So the line that he takes,
I'm slow of tongue,

453
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,190
but as we've already seen in genesis,

454
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,810
God chooses who he chooses and
his reasons aren't always fathoms.

455
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,830
Moses says,
may I say who sent me?

456
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:25,680
He asks for God's name. The Israelites
would want to know who has sent me.

457
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:30,270
And God replies with a sentence.
He Gay. I share. Hey, Yay.

458
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:35,580
This is the first part, second sentence
that can be translated. I am who I am,

459
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,640
or perhaps I will be who I will be or
perhaps I cause to be what I cause to be.

460
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,930
We really don't know,
but it has something to do with being so.

461
00:28:45,931 --> 00:28:47,730
We asked who god is.
God says,

462
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:51,390
I am who I am or I will cause
to be what I will cause to be.

463
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:56,250
So Moses wisely enough converts that
into a third person formula. Okay.

464
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,590
He will be who he will be. He is who he
is. Yeah. Wait, I share. Yeah. Hawaii.

465
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:05,750
God's answer to the question of his
name is with this sentence and Moses

466
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:09,390
converts it from a first person
to third person sentence.

467
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:14,370
He will be who he will be. He is
who he is. He will cause to be.

468
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,400
I think most people think now what he
will cause to be and that sentence gets

469
00:29:19,861 --> 00:29:24,600
shortened to [inaudible]. This is the
Bible's explanation for the name. Yeah,

470
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:27,930
way and as the personal name of God.

471
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,440
Some have argued that the name halfway
expresses the quality of being an active

472
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:37,620
dynamic. Being this God is one
who brings things into being,

473
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,970
whether it's a cosmos from chaos or
now new nation from a band of runaway

474
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:43,804
slaves.

475
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,570
But it could well be that this is simply
God's way of not answering most of his

476
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,060
question.

477
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,480
We've seen how the Bible feels about
revealing names and the divine being who

478
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:55,150
struggled and wrestled with Jacob,
sure didn't want to give him his name.

479
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:59,350
So I've often wondered if were to
read this differently. Who am I?

480
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,300
I am who I am and never you mind.

481
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,370
But there are certain important and
unique features of this burning Bush

482
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,080
dialogue. First, God identifies
himself to Moses as the god of Abraham,

483
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:15,880
Isaac, and Jacob. And as
numerous commentators have
pointed out, in so doing,

484
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:20,881
the biblical writer is trying to
establish an unbroken historic continuity

485
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,170
between the president,

486
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:28,171
revelation to Moses and the revelations
and promises that are received by

487
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:30,760
Israel's forefathers,
the Patriarchs.

488
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,400
And yet paradoxically,

489
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:38,430
the various [inaudible] of continuity
only serves to underscore a fundamental

490
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:43,450
discontinuity. Because even as God asserts
that he is the God of the Patriarchs,

491
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:46,300
he reveals to Moses a new name.
Yeah. Halfway. So that, yeah,

492
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:50,560
wisdom and the hallway called can
be said to begin only with Moses.

493
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:55,540
Now as we've seen,
the biblical sources differ on this point.

494
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:00,690
According to the j source in genesis
four 26 the earliest humans worshiped

495
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,400
Galloway Sci way.
The name was always known.

496
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:08,401
Jay wants to assert a direct continuity
between the God of the Patriarchs and

497
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:12,310
the god of the exodus,
the P and e sources.

498
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,930
Tell it a little differently.

499
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,620
Exit a six verses two to
four very important passage.

500
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,540
Exodus six verses two to four.
It's assigned to p and here God says,

501
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:27,220
I am [inaudible]. I
appeared to Abraham, Isaac,

502
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:29,230
and Jacob as El Shaddai,

503
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,340
but I did not make myself known
to them by my name. Yeah. Halfway.

504
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,760
Now this contradicts the j source
and many scholars have suggested

505
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,390
that p and e preserve a memory of a
time when Israel worshiped the Canaanite

506
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:47,260
God,

507
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:52,260
l p and a wish to claim that the God who
covenanted with the Patriarchs is the

508
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:58,270
god of the exodus. But now with
a new name. They also liked j.

509
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:01,540
They want to assert a continuity.
But in doing so,

510
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:04,960
they do it in a way that really ultimately
draws attention to the fundamental

511
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:09,460
discontinuity, the sense
of a new beginning. And to
understand that new beginning,

512
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:13,600
we need to look at the differences
between patriarchal religion and the new,

513
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:15,940
yeah. Wisdom. And there's
a list on your handout.

514
00:32:15,941 --> 00:32:18,370
So I hope everyone got a copy
of the handout. If you didn't,

515
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,210
perhaps you can raise your hand.
And if the tfs have any left,

516
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:26,140
you'll want to take a look at these
differences between patriarchal religion,

517
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,840
mosaic. Yeah. Was the miss
this, this is going to help us.

518
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:32,990
This list is based on information that's
supplied by you, by many scholars. Um,

519
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,030
I relied very much on Michael Coogan,
but others as well.

520
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,800
Look, first at the sheet that gives
you the titles, the titles of God,

521
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:46,370
and you'll see that in the
patriarchal traditions. All right,

522
00:32:46,371 --> 00:32:50,780
so we're talking about genesis primarily.
I've thrown in some other texts also,

523
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:53,780
but, but focusing for a moment on the
patriarchal traditions of Genesis,

524
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,480
God is six times called El Shaddai.

525
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,150
Other names are El El Young, El
[inaudible], El [inaudible], El Beth El.

526
00:33:02,151 --> 00:33:05,660
You can see the translations of these,
the everlasting God, God most high,

527
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:08,180
and God is seeing the god of
the House of God and so on.

528
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:13,460
L is the name of the chief
God in the Canaanite Pantheon.

529
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,010
Flip over to the other
side of your handout

530
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,740
where I discuss an important set of texts
that were discovered at a place called

531
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,490
Russ Shamara.
Rochelle was ancient Uga street.

532
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
In 1928 a peasant in Syria
discovered a tomb at rush shamrock,

533
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,980
which was subsequently
excavated by the French,

534
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,160
and it was found to contain a library of
tablets that were written in a language

535
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,000
very,
very close to biblical Hebrew.

536
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:43,760
It's clear that Hebrew was simply
a Canaanite dialect. In fact,

537
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,310
I remember reading, one scholar
said, if you go back far enough,

538
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,870
you're really hard pressed to tell the
difference between Canaanite and a Hebrew.

539
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,540
And in these texts we read of the exploits
of the gods of Canaanite religion.

540
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,070
These gods include the sky
God l I've listed here,

541
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:06,380
uh, the father of the various
gods and humans. L has a wife.

542
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:10,640
I shared raw. She's listed third
on your paper, a mother goddess,

543
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:15,200
their daughter, and not to as a goddess
of love and war. She's quite fierce.

544
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,410
And then their son bow,
who is a storm. God.

545
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,760
He's depicted in mythological literature
as defeating both the chaotic,

546
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:26,960
see God to see God,
Yum and the god of death.

547
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:32,020
Mote there are striking resemblances
between the biblical God of the Patriarchs

548
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,920
and the Canaanite God.

549
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:37,400
L L is the head of the council of Gods.

550
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:42,380
He has said to have a long white beard.
He dwells on a mountain top in a tent.

551
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:47,240
His epithets include father
of all creatures, Bull King.

552
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:51,860
He is also described as the protector
of Patriarchs. Patriarchal figures,

553
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:55,850
eight God of the father of the clan.
It says in the text, he guides them.

554
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,180
You protects them.
He promises them descendants.

555
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:04,780
Many biblical passages depict God exactly
this way as the head of a council of

556
00:35:04,851 --> 00:35:05,840
divine beings.

557
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:10,130
He's occasionally described with some of
the epithets that are associated with l

558
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,290
is referred to as the
father of all creatures.

559
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:15,410
There are poetic passages in which
he is referred to as bull. Also,

560
00:35:15,411 --> 00:35:18,590
certainly as king and in
the patriarchal narratives.

561
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,730
God refers to himself as the god of
the father. I am the god of the father,

562
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:27,050
the same way El Reef is referred to.
He Guides and protects the Patriarchs.

563
00:35:27,051 --> 00:35:30,850
He makes promises of progeny
to Abraham and his heirs. Um,

564
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,910
he also is associated with a mountain
top Sinai and gives instructions for the

565
00:35:34,911 --> 00:35:36,230
building of a tabernacle,

566
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:41,260
a tent like structure in which he will
dwell many personal and place names in

567
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:46,521
the patriarchal narratives are
compounds in which one element is l use,

568
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,000
right? Hell, you Schmidt,

569
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,350
l l l is the God of the Patriarchs.

570
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,200
By contrast,
after the time of Moses,

571
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,010
Israelite names start
to be formed using yeah,

572
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,270
or Yahoo as part of the name Yahweh,
Alijah and Hebrews Eliyahu.

573
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:08,570
So you start to have Thea forex names
that use a name of a deity which are using

574
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:11,220
forms of Yahoo instead of l.

575
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,080
There are other descriptions
in the Bible of God,

576
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:21,290
which are much more reminiscent however
of the storm God Baal according to

577
00:36:21,421 --> 00:36:26,421
Canaanite mythology by I'll defeated l
and assumed his position at a certain

578
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:28,980
point as the head of
the Canaanite Pantheon.

579
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:33,300
So there was a switch and
Canaanite mythology from l
two to bow becoming supreme

580
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,570
like bow. Yeah, wait,

581
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:39,450
is said to ride on the clouds of a
poetic passage in which that's the case.

582
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,920
His revelations are accompanied
by thunder storms. Earthquakes,

583
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,140
by all is a god of the storm.

584
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,120
There are poetic fragments also that
allude to you always victory over watery

585
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:54,120
foes. And that is a motif
that's associated with,

586
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:57,270
by all who does battle with the yum,
with the C.

587
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,360
And finally also associated
with Israel's God.

588
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:04,210
We have ancient near eastern
holy war traditions. Um,

589
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:07,650
God is depicted as a
warrior who leads his host,

590
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:12,480
the Lord of hosts in battle. He's armed
with spear and, and bow and arrows,

591
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,840
the worship practices of ancient Israel.

592
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:19,830
And Judah clearly resemble what we know
of Canaanite and ancient near eastern

593
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:24,000
worship practices.
Canaanite religious ritual took places,

594
00:37:24,001 --> 00:37:27,480
small temples that housed cultic,
a cultic statues.

595
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,070
There were stone pillars.

596
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:31,830
Perhaps the symbols of the
gods are memorials to the dead.

597
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,810
There were altars for animal
sacrifices, cereal, liquid sacrifices.

598
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:38,003
Similarly,

599
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:43,010
Israel's gods or Israel's God was
worshiped at various high places.

600
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:45,300
They're referred to as
elevated or high places.

601
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:47,670
These were shrines with little altars,

602
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,430
maybe cultic pillars and wooden poles.

603
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:54,460
The word for a wooden pole that's
used in the Bible is I Shay Ra.

604
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:00,060
These shrines may have been associated
with some kind of contact with ancestors.

605
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,280
Um,
some kind of cult of the dead.

606
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:07,820
Now worship at these local altars and
high places will come to be banned.

607
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,680
Deuteronomy is going to
polemicizing against this.

608
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,680
Deuteronomy will insist that all worship
must occur in one central sanctuary and

609
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:19,050
these outlying areas and they're
Ashley wrote, are to be destroyed.

610
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,400
It will just decree the destruction
of all of these altars in high places.

611
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,300
The patriarchal stories are clearly
not the work of the deuteronomist.

612
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,980
And these stories must have had very long
standing traditional authority if they

613
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:36,640
were adopted without serious modification
by the deuteronomist redact or some

614
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:40,500
modification, but not serious.
So what is going on here?

615
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:45,510
What are we to make of the incredible
similarity of Israel's deity and cult to

616
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:48,970
those of her neighbors?

617
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:53,770
How are we to understand the rise
of Israel's God, Israel's religion?

618
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:58,150
Well, so far we've had two models
that have been thrown out to you.

619
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,480
I'm the kind of classic evolutionary
model from polytheism is worship of many

620
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:08,620
gods. There's a natural evolution to
henotheism his denial of all gods,

621
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:09,340
but I'm sorry,

622
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:14,200
the elevation of one God to a supreme
position sort of one comes to be favored

623
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,820
and then eventually becomes so important
to the others, really fall away.

624
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,160
And you have really
the denial of all gods.

625
00:39:21,161 --> 00:39:26,110
But the one we saw Koufman in
the 1930s reacted against this.

626
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:29,740
He argued that monotheism and polytheism
are so radically distinct that one

627
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:32,110
could not possibly have
evolved from the other.

628
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,940
Surely there's an element
of truth in both models.

629
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:42,460
The evolutionary model is
I think responding to and
picking up on the fact that

630
00:39:42,461 --> 00:39:46,900
in many respects, yeah, wait, resembles
the gods of Israel's neighbors.

631
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,520
To Be Blunt, the Patriarchs seem
to have worship the Canaanite God l

632
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,860
the problem with the evolutionary model
is that it doesn't account for those

633
00:39:56,861 --> 00:40:01,210
aspects of the biblical texts that show
a clear political relationship between

634
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:03,490
Israel's religion and
that if her neighbors,

635
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:08,260
we saw when we read genesis one that
there was something going on there.

636
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:10,810
There's a polemic going on.
All right?

637
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:14,860
There are straight up within the Bible
that are clearly polemicizing against,

638
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,970
um, certain kind of mythological
presentation of the deity.

639
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,070
By contrast,

640
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:26,100
Kaufman's revolutionary model pharmacists
focuses almost exclusively on the

641
00:40:26,681 --> 00:40:30,670
dissimilarities and the polemic over
relationship between your wisdom and

642
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:32,080
Canaanite polytheism.

643
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:36,970
So the revolutionary model also fails
because it doesn't acknowledge the many,

644
00:40:36,971 --> 00:40:40,480
many areas of contact,
similarity, and even identity.

645
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:46,240
So a third way has emerged in the
last 20 years or 15 years or so,

646
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,400
and it's one that seeks to avoid
this dichotomy between polytheism and

647
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:52,234
monotheism.

648
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:57,870
Instead of viewing Israelite religion as
an evolution from and a refinement just

649
00:40:58,351 --> 00:41:03,351
as natural process of refinement of
Canaanite religion or as a radical break

650
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,730
with and polemic against
Canaanite religion,

651
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:11,650
you have some biblical smart scholars.
Mark Smith is among them. Stephen Geller,

652
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,400
who,
um,

653
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,570
examine the cultural and ideological
negotiations that gave rise to Israelite

654
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:20,770
monotheism.
What do I mean?

655
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:26,460
Mark Smith specifically describes the
origin and development of Israelite

656
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:31,540
religion as a process of what he
calls convergence and differentiation.

657
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,273
He writes,

658
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:38,630
convergence involve the coalescence of
various deities and or some of their

659
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:40,990
features into the figure of Yahweh.

660
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:45,080
There is a period of convergence
and blending of the deities.

661
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,390
By contrast,

662
00:41:47,391 --> 00:41:52,391
he describes differentiation as a process
whereby Israel came to reject it's

663
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:55,340
Canaanite roots and create
a separate identity.

664
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:59,450
At some point there was a desire to
separate and in that process of identity

665
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:03,430
formation, a polemic began to
develop that created um, uh,

666
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:07,550
y'all way in a distinct
way, didn't differentiate it
from the Canaanite deities.

667
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:10,490
So let's consider Smith's convergence.
First.

668
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:15,260
The Canaanite roots of
Israel's ancestors are clear.

669
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:19,340
The Hebrew language itself is
essentially Canaanite, Canaanite dialect,

670
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:24,320
the Canaanite, Canaanite God
l was from the Biblical text,

671
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:29,150
the God of Israel's earliest ancestors.
Through a process of convergence,

672
00:42:29,151 --> 00:42:31,310
he argues the god,
Yahweh,

673
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:35,390
the God that we think originally came
from a region further South Sinai,

674
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,070
you dome somewhere further south.

675
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:41,090
But this God through a
process of convergence and
cultural mixing began to take

676
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,370
on the characteristics of other deities,

677
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:48,371
first l and then bow or sort of
simultaneously l and bow later.

678
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:53,890
Certain aspects of this convergence would
be polemicizing against and rejected

679
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:59,470
as a yacht way only party sought to
differentiate itself from those that it

680
00:43:01,071 --> 00:43:06,071
would now label as other and call
Canaanites as distinct from Israelites.

681
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,990
Smith's model of convergence.

682
00:43:08,991 --> 00:43:12,980
And then differentiation
has great explanatory power.

683
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:18,050
It explains the deep similarity
of Israel's Dd and the
deities of her neighbors,

684
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,380
but it also explains the vehement biblical
polemic against Canaanite religion

685
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,330
and Baal worship in particular,
which we will come to see.

686
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:30,110
It reminds one of sibling
rivalry, right? Um,

687
00:43:30,111 --> 00:43:33,950
siblings who obviously share a tremendous
amount and can be extraordinarily

688
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:38,870
similar, are precisely the siblings who
can struggle and wrestle the most to

689
00:43:38,871 --> 00:43:41,000
differentiate themselves from one another.

690
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:46,670
Smith's model of convergence and
differentiation also avoids unhelpful

691
00:43:46,671 --> 00:43:50,690
dichotomies. Israel is either
like or unlike her neighbors,

692
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,610
right.
That's not helpful.

693
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:57,410
It helps us to understand Israel's God
as the end product of familiar cultural

694
00:43:57,411 --> 00:43:58,191
processes,

695
00:43:58,191 --> 00:44:01,190
the processes of convergence and we see
convergences of cultures all the time

696
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,390
and differentiation, differentiations
of culture happen all the time as well.

697
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,100
When and why,

698
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:11,750
you may ask did this differentiation
occur when and why did some Israelites

699
00:44:11,751 --> 00:44:16,751
adopt a yacht way only position and seek
to differentiate what they would call a

700
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:20,450
pure Yoffe wisdom from the cult of bottle?
For example,

701
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,370
the debate over that question is fierce
and it's one we're going to leave for

702
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:25,910
another day.

703
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,970
We will come back as we continue moving
through the biblical text and we will

704
00:44:28,971 --> 00:44:32,340
address that question,
but to sum up,

705
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:37,320
it's clear that the biblical patriarchs
and matriarchs or not strict yeah.

706
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,480
With says we will come
to understand that term.

707
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:44,100
The p and the east sources
depict a preserve the insight.

708
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:48,060
They preserve this insight and they
preserve it in their insistence that the

709
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:52,200
Patriarchs worshiped God as l.
But at the time of the exodus,

710
00:44:52,201 --> 00:44:54,180
God revealed himself as he halfway.

711
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:59,460
It's an interesting passage in the book
of Joshua Joshua 24 verses 14 to 15

712
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,770
Joshua who's the successor to Moses,

713
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:05,010
he presents the Israelites
with the following choice.

714
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,630
Now therefore revere the
Lord using the word Yahweh,

715
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,030
revere Yaffe Way and serve
him with undivided loyalty.

716
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,290
Put away the gods that your forefathers
served beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt,

717
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:21,150
put away the gods your forefathers served
beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt and

718
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:25,320
serve Yahweh. Choose this day
which ones you are going to serve,

719
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:27,870
but I in my household
will serve you halfway.

720
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:32,871
Serves the Lord only later what a Galloway
only party polemicizing against and

721
00:45:33,661 --> 00:45:37,710
seek to suppress certain what came
to be seen as undesirable elements of

722
00:45:37,711 --> 00:45:38,970
Israelite Judy and religion.

723
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:43,170
And these elements would be labeled
Canaanite as a part of a process of

724
00:45:43,171 --> 00:45:44,730
Israelite differentiation.

725
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:49,560
But what appears in the Bible
as a battle between Israelites,

726
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:50,533
periodicity,

727
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:55,470
and Canaanites pure polytheists is
indeed better understood as a civil war

728
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:59,790
between Yahweh way only Israelites and
Israelites who were participating in the

729
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,050
color of their ancestors.
