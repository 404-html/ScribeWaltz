1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,360
So, as we saw last week before we
start to talk about the produce,

2
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:08,010
the materials and the holiness code,
as we saw last week,

3
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:13,011
the covenant ceremony at Sinai included
Gods announcement of and Israel's

4
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:16,260
agreement to certain
continental stipulations.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,740
So exodus 24 verses three
and four, describe this, uh,

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,870
agreement as follows.

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,770
Moses went and repeated to the people
all the commands of the Lord and all the

8
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:29,670
rules and all the people answered with
one voice saying all the things that the

9
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:31,140
Lord has commanded we will do.

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,840
And Moses then wrote down
all the commands of the Lord.

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,710
So the Covenant concluded at
Sinai is the climactic moment, uh,

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,200
in the pentitude will narrative.

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,230
And it came to be viewed as the initiation
of God's articulation of the laws and

14
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:51,300
rules and ordinances and instruction
by which the ancient Israelites were to

15
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,134
live.

16
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,290
And so later edit editors consequently
inserted lock collections from later

17
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:02,511
times and circles into the story of
Israel's meeting with God at Sinai and

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,080
Subsequent Sojourn in the wilderness.

19
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,250
This was done in order to lend these
collections and air of high antiquity and

20
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:09,840
to give them divine sponsorship.

21
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,390
The conclusion of Biblical scholarship
is that a number of separate bodies of

22
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:20,391
law have gravitated to the story of the
40 year period of Israel's formation

23
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:24,120
into a people. So that's the period
of the Covenant at Mount Sinai.

24
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:26,070
And then the journey
towards the promised land.

25
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,610
All Israelite law is represented in the
biblical account as having issued from

26
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:36,600
that time, that 40 year period
of intimate contact with,

27
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,130
between God and Israel. So a,
on your handout, I've given um,

28
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,750
a division,

29
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,620
a rough division of the different
legal collections that we have in the

30
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,270
pentitude.
Um,

31
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,160
the laws that scholars will often refer
to as the Jie laws since they sort of

32
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:54,780
are introduced by that narrative.

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,110
Some people think it's best to just think
of these as separate legal collections,

34
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,640
but those occur in exodus and so
they're 10, they tend to be dated 10th,

35
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:06,020
ninth century in their written form.
The laws of the priest,

36
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:09,090
the material are mostly going to be
found in Leviticus and numbers. Um,

37
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,690
and those will be formulated somewhere
from the eighth to the sixth century,

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,600
same period of time. Roughly.
We have the laws of D,

39
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,790
which are found obviously in Deuteronomy,

40
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,680
but these sources themselves are clearly
drawing upon much older traditions.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,890
Some of the individual laws
are clearly quite ancient.

42
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,800
They have a great deal in common with
ancient near eastern legal traditions

43
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:33,120
generally of the second millennium,
the laws of exodus, for example.

44
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:38,121
Some of them bear such similarity to
the code of Hammurabi that we can really

45
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:43,500
assume that they are drawing
upon a common legal heritage,

46
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,780
a Canaanite law,
what would have been known as a,

47
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:47,910
as a legal tradition in in Canaan,

48
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,420
so whatever their actual origin.
However,

49
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,040
the Bible represents these materials
as having been given at Sinai or during

50
00:02:56,041 --> 00:03:00,400
that 40 year period after, so given
at, now this is on your sheet,

51
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,080
you have the deck, a log, not very
well translated as the 10 commandments.

52
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,620
We'll come back to that covenant code,
so that's the chunk of material,

53
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,000
three chapters and exodus.

54
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,210
Then we have a small passage
referred to as a ritual deck log.

55
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:14,080
We'll come back to that.

56
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,490
You have priestly legislation a little
bit in exodus about the cult, obviously.

57
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:23,200
Then on into Leviticus and some numbers
and according to the biblical narrative,

58
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:27,550
then the following materials were given
in the 40 years after Sinai as the

59
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:30,580
Israelites are encamped in the wilderness
on their journey toward the land of

60
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:30,911
Israel.

61
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:35,830
So those are presented as supplements
in numbers but also the Deuteron due to

62
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,420
anomic code. Let's talk a little
bit now about the deck log.

63
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,890
It was this scholar by the name
of Alt, a l t, Albrecht alt

64
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,000
German scholar who examined the illegal
material of the Bible in general and he

65
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:55,020
noticed that there were
really two forms of law. Yeah.

66
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,290
Are these things I forgot to write down.

67
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,370
There's conditional conditional
law and [inaudible] law.

68
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,120
Conditional Law is case lock has with
stick law and then there's absolute or APP

69
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,980
apoplectic law. So Kacie with
stick. He noticed these two forms.

70
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,030
Um,

71
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,500
Cassie was stick law is the common form
of law that that law is the common form

72
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:19,480
that law takes in the ancient near east.

73
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:23,110
And you've seen it in the code of
Hammurabi. It has a characteristic.

74
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,910
If then pattern Cassie was stick
law tells you, for example,

75
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:32,590
if a person does x or if x happens,
then y will be the consequence.

76
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,760
It can be complex, it can be
quite specific. If x happens,

77
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:41,080
why is the consequence? But if x happens
under these different circumstances,

78
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,590
then z is the consequence and it can
be quite detailed giving through your

79
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:48,310
forced sub-cases with qualifications
at the absolute or APP.

80
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:53,311
Addictive law by contrast is
an unconditional statement
of a prohibition or a

81
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:56,950
command. It tends to be general
and somewhat undifferentiated.

82
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,130
You shall not murder you
shall love the Lord your God.

83
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,120
And absolute law at predictive law is
not unknown as a form in other ancient

84
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:07,270
near eastern cultures,

85
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,190
but it seems to be most characteristically
Israelite find a great deal more of

86
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:15,100
it in our legal collections in
the Bible than anywhere else.

87
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,260
The provisions of the deck log.
Um,

88
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,340
and again the translation 10 commandments,

89
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:24,250
it's actually a very poor translation
in the Hebrew is simply means 10

90
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:26,480
statements, 10 utterances. Um,

91
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,450
these are in the ones that are in some
sort of legal form are in absolute or APP

92
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,560
addictive form.

93
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,040
The deck log is the only part of God's
revelation that is disclosed directly to

94
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,300
all of Israel without an intermediary.

95
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,510
But it's directives are couched
in the masculine singular.

96
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,590
So it seems to be addressing Israelite
males as the lead legal subjects in the

97
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:48,424
community.

98
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,500
And the deck log sets out some of God's
most basic and unconditional covenant

99
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,890
demands.
The division into 10 is a bit awkward.

100
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,510
It's probably should be
seen as an ideal number,

101
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:02,210
an effort to find 10 statements in there.

102
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,950
Because in fact there were really about
13 separate statements. And um, we,

103
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,510
we see the fact that 10 doesn't work very
well in a very interesting phenomenon,

104
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:12,344
which is,
um,

105
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,490
that's so called commandments are actually
numbered differently by Jews and by

106
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:18,620
Christians. And then even
within the Christian community,

107
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,850
different Christian denominations number
the commandments one through 10 quite

108
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:23,810
differently from one another.

109
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,600
They disagree about what is number one
and what does number two. And so on.

110
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,140
The first statements,
either one through four,

111
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,850
one through five depending
on your counting,

112
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,600
but the first group of statements
concern Israel's relationship with her,

113
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:39,380
Susan with God. She used to be
exclusively faithful to God.

114
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,200
She's not to bow down
to any man made image.

115
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,350
She may not use God's
name in a false oath,

116
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,110
right to a test two or
swear by a false oath.

117
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,000
She's to honor God's Sabbath Day
and on our parental authority,

118
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:55,520
which is arguably an
extension of God's authority.

119
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,380
The remaining statements then concern
Israel's relationship with her fellow

120
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:05,270
vassals if you will, and they prohibit
murder and adultery and robbery,

121
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,450
false testimony and covetousness.

122
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,390
It's important to realize that the
pentitude contains three versions of the

123
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:17,300
decalogue and there are
differences among them.

124
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,480
The deck log is going to be repeated in
Deuteronomy chapter five and there are

125
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:22,820
some minor variations.

126
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,750
Specifically you'll see that the
rationale for observing the sabbath is

127
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:31,751
different gods name in Deca law in a deck
log and Deuteronomy five is not to be

128
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:35,120
used in a vein oath as
opposed to a false oath.

129
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,300
There are differences in the meeting and
there are some more differences too in

130
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:39,134
language.

131
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,430
So what are we to make of this one
scholar Mark Brittler whose name I've

132
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:44,211
mentioned before,

133
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:48,980
he says that when we learn from this are
these variations is something about the

134
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:52,370
way ancient Israel preserved
and transmitted sacred texts.

135
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,320
They didn't strive for
verbatim preservation when
they transmitted biblical

136
00:07:57,321 --> 00:08:01,730
texts and they didn't employ cut and paste
methods that might be important to us

137
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,960
in the transmission of something.

138
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,520
Texts were modified in the course
of their transmission verbatim.

139
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:11,750
Repetition was not valued in
the way that it might be for us,

140
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,610
so that even a text like the deck,

141
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:16,880
a log which is represented as
being the unmediated word of God,

142
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,530
can appear in more than one version as
a more surprising variation that occurs.

143
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:21,831
However,

144
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:26,831
an exodus 34 after smashing the first
set of tablets that were inscribed with a

145
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:30,620
deck, a log, um, the deck
log, the tablets in exodus 20,

146
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:32,780
those are smashed after
the golden calf incident.

147
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,730
Moses is then given a second set of
tablets and the biblical writer emphasizes

148
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:42,230
in the story at that point that God writes
on the tablets the words that were on

149
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:45,110
the former tablets that were broken,
the same words.

150
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,200
So we expect now a verbatim repetition
of exodus 20 and yet we don't have it.

151
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,361
The deck,

152
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:55,710
a log that follows in fact has very
little overlap with the earlier a log.

153
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:59,790
There's really only two, um, statements
that even have the same content.

154
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,050
And even those which do overlap
in content very in wording,

155
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,440
this deck log,
which is often called the ritual deck log.

156
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:11,860
So it's listed on there and exodus 34
it bands intermarriage with Canaanites

157
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,710
lest they entice the Israelites into
worship of their gods. It has other terms,

158
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,030
um, that give pro commandments about
the observance of the festivals,

159
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,660
various festivals,
the dedication of first fruits to God,

160
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:27,240
the dedication of firstborn
animals to God and so on.

161
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,300
Things that were not in
the exodus 20 deck a log.

162
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,850
So evidently there were
different traditions regarding
the contents of the deck,

163
00:09:34,851 --> 00:09:37,590
a log and the story of the golden calf.

164
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,880
And Moses is destruction of the first
set of tablets is brilliant narrative

165
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:45,300
strategy for introducing this
second deck log tradition.

166
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,580
Also surprising is the fact that the
decalogue and exodus 20 doesn't stand

167
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:52,590
completely unchallenged in the Bible.

168
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,930
Exodus 20 verses five through six
contain explicitly the principle of

169
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,580
intergenerational punishment.

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
God has said to spread punishment for
sin out over three or four generations.

171
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,380
This is understood as a sign of his mercy.

172
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,250
It's reducing the punishment on the
actual center by spreading it out and

173
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:14,460
limiting the consequences to
only three or four generations.

174
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,580
In contrast to what is said in
the next verse. But kindness,

175
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:21,060
he spreads out over thousands of
generations, right? So it's seen as,

176
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:23,370
as as a merciful mode of,
of operation.

177
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,660
But the notion of intergenerational
punishment is something that some segments

178
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,210
of the community or perhaps
later in time was rejected.

179
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,720
Some segments of the community have
rejected this notion and so in Deuteronomy

180
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:35,900
seven we see that quite pointedly,

181
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:41,110
God punish is only those who spurn
him and does so instantly [inaudible].

182
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,600
When we get to a Zico, we'll see that
he will also very adamantly a reject.

183
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:47,640
The idea of intergenerational punishment.

184
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:50,790
The children do not suffer for the
sins of the father, only the father.

185
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,640
So what are we to make of this? Again,
Mark Brittler concludes that the deck,

186
00:10:55,641 --> 00:11:00,641
a log or deck logs did not originally
possess the absolute authority that is so

187
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:04,560
often claimed for it. Uh, even today,

188
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,060
later religious traditions have
elevated the deck log in exodus 22,

189
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:10,800
a position of absolute authority,

190
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:15,690
a position that's not completely justified
given the Bible's own fluid treatment

191
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,310
of the wording, right? The deck
logs text and it's content,

192
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,940
right? And it's later objection
even to one of its terms.

193
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,240
So the claim that God's revelation of
the decalogue was fixed inform the words

194
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:31,950
that we see in exodus 20,
for example,

195
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,750
and immutable in substance is not a
claim that's really native to or even

196
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:38,460
justified by the biblical text.

197
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:41,640
It's a later ideological
imposition upon the text.

198
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,030
I don't want to talk a little
bit more about biblical laws,

199
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:47,910
connection with the legal
patrimony of the ancient Near East,

200
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,910
because certainly biblical
law shares in that patrimony,

201
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,190
even if sometimes it's clearly reforming.

202
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,460
So it's helpful and it's instructive
to compare it with other ancient law

203
00:11:57,461 --> 00:11:59,650
collections. And I hope you've
had time to sit and read.

204
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,730
There was a study guide posted on the
website and I hope you had time to work

205
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:04,990
through these materials.

206
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,170
They're fascinating and we'll see that
there are certain key features that

207
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:11,980
distinguish Israelite law from the other
ancient near eastern legal collections.

208
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,620
I've also put on the handout for today,
just a list of those collections. The,

209
00:12:16,621 --> 00:12:20,080
the laws of or nominally all is the
laws of Lipid Ishtar that laws of

210
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:24,870
[inaudible] of the code of Hammurabi
which is c h m the Hittite laws. Um,

211
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:25,330
the,

212
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,170
the youngest laws would be the middle of
Syrian laws giving you rough dates and

213
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:32,950
so on. So you have that to refer to for
the information about these particular

214
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:35,630
collections. I should also say that, um,

215
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,910
we would do better to under understand
these materials as legal collections and

216
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:42,700
not codes. I know the word
code gets thrown around a lot,

217
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:45,520
code of Hammurabi and so on,
but they really aren't. Codes,

218
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,180
codes are generally
systematic and exhaustive,

219
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,310
and they tend to be used by courts.

220
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,240
We have no evidence about how
these texts were used. In fact,

221
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,880
we think it's not likely that
they were really used by courts,

222
00:12:57,881 --> 00:13:01,540
but they were part of a learned tradition
and scribes copied them over and over

223
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:06,250
and so on. They are also certainly not
systematic and exhaustive. So for example,

224
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:09,550
in the quote of homer ropy, we don't
even have a case of intentional homicide.

225
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,410
We only have a case of
accidental homicide.

226
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:13,390
So we really don't even
know what the law would be.

227
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:14,770
In a case of intentional homicide,

228
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:16,870
we can't really make that
comparison with the biblical law.

229
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,540
Now in a very important article that was
written nearly half a century ago now,

230
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:27,130
it's hard to believe, um, by a
man named Moshe Greenberg. Um,

231
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,550
he's a biblical scholar and
he argued that a comparison,

232
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:35,551
a biblical law with other ancient near
eastern collection reveals the central

233
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,630
postulates or values that
undergird biblical law. Uh,

234
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,640
I'll be drawing extensively on Greenberg's
work in this presentation as well as

235
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:48,100
other scholars who have
picked up some of his ideas.

236
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,410
And I've taken them in other directions.
So,

237
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:53,830
but it was really Greenberg who was the
one who I think made the first foray

238
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:55,510
into this kind of comparative approach.

239
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,370
And since then others have have
taken advantage of that idea. Um,

240
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,560
there is Greenburg says and immediate
and critically important difference

241
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,150
between ancient,

242
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,450
ancient near eastern collections and the
Israelite laws as they're presented by

243
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:14,500
the biblical narrator. And that's a
difference in authorship. So if you look,

244
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:17,510
for example, at the prologue to
the laws of war Namo on an end,

245
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:20,010
little gave kingship to or not,

246
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,220
but or Namu is said to
establish equity and the laws,

247
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,810
if you look at Liquid Ishtar,

248
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,640
the both the prologue and
the epilogue on and legal,

249
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,330
the gods give kingship
to liberty each star.

250
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:36,100
But Lipid Ishtar establishes justice to
be first and the laws as my handiwork

251
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:40,450
and the first person or the prologue
to the code of Hammurabi again, laugh,

252
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:45,280
Deon Newman and end lil established
for him and enduring kingdom,

253
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,420
they name him to promote the welfare
of the people cause justice to prevail.

254
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,590
When Marduk commissioned me to direct
the land and now it switches into first

255
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:56,990
person speech. I established law and
justice in the language of the land.

256
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,690
At that time I decreed
the laws of justice.

257
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,210
The law is that the efficient
King Hammurabi set up.

258
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,820
I wrote my precious words on my stele,
which you can go and see it.

259
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:09,950
Sterling Memorial Library. Um, and
in the presence of the statue of me,

260
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,550
the king of justice, I set it up in
order to administer the law of the land,

261
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:16,790
to prescribe the ordinances of the land,
to give justice to the oppressed.

262
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,060
And we first do it is my justice,
my statutes,

263
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:24,210
no one should we send them my
scribes, delay my precious words, um,

264
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,370
do not alter the law of the land
which I enacted I AI throughout. Um,

265
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,720
by contrast in Biblical law,
authorship is not ascribed to Moses ever.

266
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,640
It is attributed always to God.

267
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:39,650
So you see an exodus 24 verses three
and four Moses went and repeated to the

268
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:39,921
people,

269
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:43,610
all the commands of the Lord and all the
rules and all the people answered with

270
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:47,240
one voice. All that the Lord has
commanded, we will obey and do.

271
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,820
Moses then wrote down all
the commands of the Lord.

272
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,500
It's the repetition makes you feel
that the biblical writer here is not

273
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:57,440
accidentally saying these things,
trying to drive home a very strong point.

274
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:03,190
Exodus 31 18 when he got finished speaking
with him on Mount Sinai with Moses on

275
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,124
Mount Sinai,

276
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,940
he gave Moses the two tablets of the
pact stone tablets inscribed with the

277
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:08,990
finger of God.

278
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,880
So Greenburg and since him rettler
and many others have argued that the

279
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:18,200
principle of divine authorship has
certain very important implications.

280
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,640
First,

281
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,080
it has a significant effect on the scope
of the law in ancient near eastern and

282
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:29,081
Biblical law differ concerning the areas
of human life and activity that fall

283
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:31,580
within the concern of the law.

284
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,950
It doesn't mean they don't fall
within the concern of humanity.

285
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,600
They just fall within
the concern of the law.

286
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,660
That's an ideal come back to in a minute
is relight law will contain more than

287
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:45,911
just rules and provisions that fall
within the scope of the coercive power of

288
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:48,680
the state to enforce,
right?

289
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,310
More than what would fall under the
jurisdiction of law. Courts, for example,

290
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:56,960
or illegal decides source. It is holistic.
The scope of the law is holistic.

291
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,340
It's going to contain social and ethical
and moral and religious prescriptions

292
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:03,860
and very often they're going to be
couched in an authoritative app,

293
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:04,760
addictive style,

294
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,700
particularly the things that aren't
enforceable in a court of law.

295
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:10,610
They will tend to be the ones that
are backed up by the authority of God

296
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:12,860
directly. You shall do this,
I the Lord am your God.

297
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:17,360
Notice how many times that that refrain
is used and it's almost always used with

298
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:20,030
those unenforceable kinds of things.
Love your neighbor as yourself.

299
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,480
You know I the Lord your God.
It's me who's watching out for this one,

300
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,800
not the court.
Okay.

301
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:30,770
The extra biblical law collections deal
almost exclusively with matters that are

302
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:33,680
enforceable by the state.
That doesn't necessarily mean they were.

303
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:34,970
We don't know how these were used,

304
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,820
but they don't tend to deal
with matters that we would call,

305
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,670
we would call it matters of
conscience or moral rectitude.

306
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,690
So you'd be very hard pressed in the
extra biblical collections to find a law

307
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:49,691
like exodus 23 verses four and five when
you encounter your enemies ox or ass

308
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:51,780
wandering,
you must take it back to him.

309
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,680
When you see the ass of your enemy lying
under its burden and you would refrain

310
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:56,430
from raising it,

311
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:01,430
you must nevertheless raise it with him
or Leviticus 19 verses 17 and 18 you

312
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:03,630
shall not hate your
kinsfolk in your heart.

313
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,400
You imagined congress
passing a law like that.

314
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,480
You shall not hate your kinsfolk in
your heart. Reprove your kinsmen,

315
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:12,480
but incurred no guilt because of him and
don't carry around a grudge. Reproof.

316
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:15,090
I'm tell him what's wrong. Clear the
air. Don't carry around a grudge.

317
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,080
You shall not take vengeance or bear
a grudge against your countrymen.

318
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,770
Love Yourself, love your fellow
as yourself. I am the Lord, right?

319
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,560
That refrain always comes after
those kinds of statements.

320
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,160
So the Bible includes norms for human
behavior set by the divine will,

321
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,120
even though enforcement has to be left
to the individual conscience and in the

322
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:40,050
tour. Therefore life is treated
holistically in the realm of law.

323
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,630
One's actions aren't compartmentalized,

324
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:45,930
and that's why the legal materials
to us can sometimes seem like an

325
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:49,230
indiscriminate mix of laws
concerning all areas of life.

326
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,350
And it's one of the things that makes
people confused because a lot of moderns

327
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:55,500
have gotten the idea that the Bible
only deals with what we call morality.

328
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,560
And so they don't understand all this
other stuff that's in there, right?

329
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,320
And sometimes if we tell ourselves,
well, this is illegal collection,

330
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:04,050
then we don't understand why there's
all this moral looking stuff in there.

331
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,330
It is a mixture because it's holistic.

332
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,390
It is the will of God and God has
something to say about all areas of life.

333
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,660
And so in exodus 23 you're going to have
a law that's tells you not to oppress a

334
00:19:13,661 --> 00:19:15,300
stranger because you were a stranger.

335
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,230
It tells you to not plow your land in
the sabbath year immediately following

336
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:20,940
that to let the poor
and needy eat from it.

337
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,100
It tells you to observe the Sabbath Day.
Rest,

338
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:25,560
you shall not mention any other gods.
Um,

339
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:28,740
it tells you how to observe the three
pilgrimage festivals and rules of ritual

340
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:31,170
offering.
And then there are also civil laws.

341
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,730
Same thing in Leviticus 18 through 20.
We have incest laws, we have ritual laws,

342
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:39,720
we have civil laws, and we have
moral laws altogether. Now,

343
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,320
a second implication,
right?

344
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,420
Another idea that flows from the fact
that this law is, is divinely authored.

345
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,200
So second implication of divine
authorship according to Greenberg,

346
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,990
is this connection
between law and morality.

347
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,210
So that in the biblical legal framework,
every crime is also a sin.

348
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:02,070
Every crime is also a sin.
Law is the moral will of God,

349
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,560
and nothing is beyond
the moral will of God.

350
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,070
So what's illegal is also immoral
and vice versa. What's immoral?

351
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:11,160
It's also illegal.
Law and morality are not separate.

352
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:16,080
As we moderns tend to think they are
an ought to be right in our society.

353
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,750
Offenses against morality. In the biblical
world are also religious offenses.

354
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,690
There are also sins because they
are infractions of the divine will.

355
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,100
So the fusion of morality
and Law Greenberger I use
is the reason that biblical

356
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:32,310
law not only expresses,

357
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:36,690
but legislates a concern for the
unfortunate members of society.

358
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,390
For example, orphans, strangers, widows,

359
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,750
as well as respect for the aged from the
priestly sources is Leviticus 19 verse

360
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:50,181
32 we read you shall rise before the
aged and show deference to the old you

361
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:53,950
shall fear your God. I am the Lord. Yeah,
I refrain always has to come with us.

362
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:54,784
Kind of a statement.

363
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:59,440
The extra biblical codes certainly exhibit
concern for the rights of the poor.

364
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,290
This is very important,
particularly in their prologues.

365
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,740
We read some of these prologues, you know,
I, my desire was to help the orphans,

366
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:09,760
the strangers and so on. Um,
but when you look at the,

367
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:14,590
the content of the laws as in our society,
they don't legislate charity.

368
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,140
They don't legislate compassion,
compassion.

369
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,880
It's likely that these were considered
acts of who knows, personal conscience,

370
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:22,900
religious convictions,

371
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:25,840
something that was between the
individual and society and their God,

372
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:29,500
I don't know, but they were outside the
domain and jurisdiction of the court.

373
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,030
That doesn't mean that charity
and compassion we're not at,

374
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,070
we're not present in other
ancient near eastern cultures.

375
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,330
The point is that law is not understood
as being the appropriate vehicle for the

376
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:41,470
expression of those values.

377
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,010
There were other sorts of texts that
might do those sorts of things and urge

378
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:46,270
people to charity and compassion.

379
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,040
But law legislation is not understood
to be the appropriate vehicle for the

380
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,050
expression of those values. So again, I'm,

381
00:21:53,051 --> 00:21:55,360
I'm not trying to say the ancient
near eastern side. Everybody was mean.

382
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,450
I'm starting to say that the law,
because of its done,

383
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,760
divine authorship
suddenly takes on a scope,

384
00:22:00,761 --> 00:22:04,960
a holistic scope and a fusion of law
and morality that are kept separate in

385
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:08,700
other cultures in it and very
much in our own right. Um,

386
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,990
so the two,
however,

387
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:15,100
our combined and law is understood to
be the appropriate vehicle to legislate

388
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,810
compassion,
for example.

389
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,220
So in Leviticus 19 nine
verse 10 legislating charity.

390
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,960
When you reap the harvest of your land,

391
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:25,870
you shall not reap all the way to
the edges of your field or gather the

392
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:28,330
gleanings of your harvest.
You shall not pick your vineyard,

393
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:31,090
bear or gather the fallen
fruit of your vineyard.

394
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:35,680
You shall leave them for the poor and the
stranger. I The Lord am your God. Again,

395
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:36,970
from the holiness code live,

396
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:41,590
it gets 1914 you shall not insult the
death or place a stumbling block before

397
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:44,110
the blind. You shall fear
your God. I am the Lord again.

398
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:46,930
Always has to back it up because this
is not something the courts can backup,

399
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,231
right?

400
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:51,760
This is a question of your morality or
Leviticus 20 verse 18 love your fellow as

401
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:53,110
yourself.
I am the Lord.

402
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:58,290
Leviticus 19 verses 33 to 34 when a
stranger resides with you and your land,

403
00:22:58,481 --> 00:22:59,710
you shall not wrong him.

404
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,730
The Stranger who resides with you shall
be to you as one of your citizens.

405
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:07,270
You shall love him as yourself. For you
were strangers in the land of Egypt.

406
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,830
I The Lord am your God.

407
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,040
Deuteronomy 22 six if along the road you
chance upon a bird's nest in any tree

408
00:23:15,221 --> 00:23:19,090
or on the ground with fledglings or
eggs and the mother sitting over the

409
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:22,840
fledglings are on the eggs, do not take
the mother together with her young.

410
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,980
Let the mother go and take only the
young in order that you may fare well and

411
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:29,650
have a long life, meaning God
will reward you. So again,

412
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,800
this is enforceable by God.
Furthermore,

413
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:37,801
Greenberg argues that the fact that
every crime is also a sin lays the ground

414
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:43,711
for certain acts to be viewed
as absolutely wrong and
transcending the power of

415
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,960
humans to forgive absolutely wrong,

416
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,790
and they transcend the power of humans to
pardon or forgive. Take for an example,

417
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:53,683
adultery.

418
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,760
Deuteronomy 2122 if Amanda's found
lying with another man's wife,

419
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,880
both of them, the man and the
woman with whom he lays shall die.

420
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:06,770
Thus you shall sweep away evil from
Israel and murder is the other one.

421
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:11,480
Number's 35 verse 16 the
murderer must be put to death.

422
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,750
You may not accept a ransom
for the life of a murderer.

423
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:17,990
This is now verse 31 who is
guilty of a capital crime.

424
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:21,860
He must be put to death in
the view of the biblical text.

425
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,860
Adultery and murder are absolutely wrong.

426
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,840
They must always be punished regardless
of the attitude of the offended parties.

427
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,770
All right, so a husband can
say, oh, that's okay. I don't
want to punish my white.

428
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:37,790
Let them have their fun. It's no
big deal. I don't mind. All right,

429
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,560
and the family of a murder of victor
can't murder victim can't say, you know,

430
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,620
Joe was such a pain in the neck anyway.
You've really done us a favor. You know,

431
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,040
just pay the funeral costs. We'll call
it quits. You know, you can't do that.

432
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,930
These are absolutely wrong.

433
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:55,070
These deeds as infractions
of God's will and God's law,

434
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:56,120
they're always wrong.

435
00:24:56,121 --> 00:25:01,121
They transcend the power of human
parties to pardon or forgive or excuse,

436
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,610
and you compare that with the extra
biblical collections and you see quite a

437
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:08,350
difference in the code of Hammurabi
number at one 29 adults rate.

438
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,080
These are adultery is considered a
private affair. If the wife of his senior,

439
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:16,670
I have to,
this terminology is just wonderful senor.

440
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,090
This comes I think from um,
French feudalism.

441
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:22,610
These have to do with class distinctions.

442
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:27,560
And so the translators of this particular
translation, a chose these futile,

443
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,620
very meaningful to you.
I'm sure these futile categories.

444
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,890
Essentially what's going on here
is the underlying Acadian words,

445
00:25:33,891 --> 00:25:37,490
I guess are we alone? Moosh, Ghanem
and then a third category slave.

446
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,620
When the three,
when they appear together,

447
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:43,910
IBM tends to refer to an upper class
person and which came to a common,

448
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:45,710
or having them can just
mean an ordinary citizen.

449
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,990
But when it's in juxtaposition
with the other terms,

450
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:52,300
it's clearly someone of a higher social
class. So I will, we'll use aristocrat,

451
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,850
which is where we get the French feudal
senor and then we'll use common or and

452
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:59,720
slave. So when the code of Hammurabi
and the wife, if the wife of a,

453
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,020
a citizen has been caught
while lying with another man,

454
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,060
they shall bind them and
throw them into the water.

455
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,580
But if the husband of the
woman wishes to spare his wife,

456
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,400
then the king and turn may spare
his subject. It's up to the husband.

457
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,860
He is the offended party.
It's a private matter.

458
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,510
He decides the middle of Syrian laws
on tablet a numbers 14 to 16. Again,

459
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:19,790
it's a crime against the
property of the husband.

460
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:22,430
And so it's within his power
to either prosecute or not.

461
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,570
If a senior and I'll be loom has
lane with the wife of another,

462
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:31,490
either in a temple bravo or in the street
knowingly knowing that she was a wife,

463
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,930
then they shall treat the adulterer as
the senior orders his wife to be treated.

464
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,320
Okay. So whatever he does to hurt, they
do the same thing to the, to the mail.

465
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,800
But if he was innocent, he didn't
know that she was a married woman.

466
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,610
The senor shell prosecute
his wife, treating her as he
thinks fit. It's up to him.

467
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,930
If the woman's husband, um, this more
ifs and dens. But here's the case,

468
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:54,540
that if the woman's husband put him,
puts his wife to death,

469
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,020
he shall also put this in your to death.
But if he cuts off his wife's,

470
00:26:58,021 --> 00:26:59,850
knows he shall turn this in,

471
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,700
you are into a unit and I guess this
is considered equivalent and they shall

472
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:05,880
mutilate his whole face. However,
if he let his wife go free,

473
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:08,790
they shall let the Senor
Goffrey. All right. Again,

474
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,550
it's a private matter and
the Hittite laws as well,

475
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,560
tablet to one 97 to one 98 the husband
can decide to spare his wife if he brings

476
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:20,400
them to the gate of the palace and
declares my wife shall not be killed and

477
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:22,080
thereby spares his wife's life.

478
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,130
He shall also spare the life of the
adulterer and shall mark his head.

479
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,640
But if he says, let them die, both of
them, then the king may order them killed,

480
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:31,780
but also the king can spare their lives.
All right,

481
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,070
and we see the same sorts of
distinctions in murder cases. We'll,

482
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,270
we'll come back to them later.

483
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,700
A third implication or consequence of
the divine authorship of biblical law

484
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,900
according to Greenberg,

485
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,800
is that the purpose of the law in
Israelite Society is going to be different

486
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:51,630
from the purpose of the law in other
societies. So in Non Israelite Society,

487
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:56,370
the purpose of the law is um,
to secure certain sociopolitical benefits.

488
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,640
Um, think about the preamble
of the American constitution,

489
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,710
which states the purpose of the law.

490
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,770
It reads almost exactly like the
prologues to these ancient collections.

491
00:28:04,771 --> 00:28:07,110
You can pick out words that are identical.

492
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:11,280
The purpose of the law is to establish
justice, insure domestic tranquility,

493
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,990
provide for the common defense,

494
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:16,170
promote the general welfare and
secure the blessings of liberty.

495
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,430
So when you see the prologue of
board anomal the purpose of the law,

496
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,740
established equity,
protect the underprivileged,

497
00:28:22,741 --> 00:28:24,240
promote the common wheel and welfare.

498
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:28,020
Basically loss of liberty star in
the prologue. Established justice.

499
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,960
Banish complaints. I like
that one. Bring wellbeing,

500
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:34,880
promote the common wheel and welfare.
Same again with the quote of Hama.

501
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:38,520
Robbie's a prologue to promote the
welfare of the people. Good government,

502
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,690
the right way prosperity.
But for Israel, the law is,

503
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,830
it does include these benefits but
is not limited to these benefits.

504
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,340
The law also aims at sanctifying.
All right.

505
00:28:50,341 --> 00:28:52,860
A concept we dealt with at great
length in the last lecture,

506
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,370
sanctifying rendering holy or like God,

507
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,560
those who abide by its terms.

508
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:04,100
So the laws that are presented in the
holiness code are introduced with this

509
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:08,610
exhortation which you don't
find in other places. Uh,

510
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,240
Leviticus 19 verse two you shall
be holy for I the Lord your God,

511
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:15,630
am holy and then the laws began. You
shall eat, revere your mother and father,

512
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:18,300
keep my sabbaths, et Cetera, et
cetera. But the introduction,

513
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,730
you shall be holy for I the Lord your God,
am Holy.

514
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:25,731
Being wholly in imitation of
God is emphasized repeatedly
as the purpose of the

515
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:27,840
laws in the holiness code,

516
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:32,430
especially the holiness Motif is
represented as being present at the very

517
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:36,420
inception of the covenant when when
Israel is assembled at Mount Sinai,

518
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,830
that opening speech that God makes an
exodus 19 verse five and six now then if

519
00:29:40,831 --> 00:29:44,410
you obey me faithfully and
keep my covenant, keep my laws,

520
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:47,540
you shall be my treasured possession
among all the peoples. Indeed,

521
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,700
all the earth is mine,

522
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,640
but you shall be to me a kingdom
of priests and a holy nation.

523
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:56,440
These are the rules that Deema market
you as dedicated to me, I, he holy.

524
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:58,331
Now,

525
00:29:58,331 --> 00:30:03,160
there are lots of general and specific
similarities and parallels between

526
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:08,050
Israelite and ancient near eastern laws,
lots of goring oxen,

527
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,740
lots of pregnant women who are in the
wrong place at the wrong time and getting

528
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:14,300
struck and accidentally miscarrying.
Um,

529
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:19,150
but we're going to look at some of the
formal and stylistic differences between

530
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,620
ancient near eastern and Biblical law.

531
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,770
And we can assume just a tremendous
amount of common ground. Okay.

532
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,310
And some of these are pointed out by
Greenburg and some by other scholars,

533
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,260
but I've listed them there under features.

534
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:34,790
One distinguishing feature of his
Israelite law is the addition of, um,

535
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,640
a rationale or a motive clause in many
of the laws. All right? Which again,

536
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:44,641
is not something that's really a featured
in the genre of law writing in these

537
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:47,770
other collections.
It's not a part of the genre of writing.

538
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:49,390
Those doesn't mean that he
didn't have a rationale,

539
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,960
but it wasn't how it was presented.
So we find this in the Bible,

540
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:56,740
particularly in what we might refer
to as the, as the humanitarian laws.

541
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,120
And on the whole,

542
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:03,210
these rationales will appeal to historical
events like the exodus or creation.

543
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:10,330
You're a few laws that express the
idea that the experience of slavery,

544
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,860
slavery, and liberation should be
the wellspring for moral action.

545
00:31:14,861 --> 00:31:18,580
It should be the impetus for moral action.
Exodus 2120.

546
00:31:18,581 --> 00:31:22,600
You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress
him for you were strangers in the land

547
00:31:22,601 --> 00:31:24,580
of Egypt.
23,

548
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:27,820
nine you shall not oppress a stranger for
you know the feelings of the stranger.

549
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:31,630
Having yourself, yourselves been
strangers in the land of Egypt.

550
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,750
And Leviticus 19 contains
a similar x rotation.

551
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:36,940
Not to wrong a stranger
who resides with you,

552
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,090
but love him as yourself for you
were strangers in the land of Egypt.

553
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:45,640
Likewise in Deuteronomy five,
this is the deck log and Deuteronomy,

554
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,503
um,

555
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:51,510
which is talking about Sabbath observance
and ensuring that all in your abode

556
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,690
rest you, your son, your daughter, your
male or female slave, your ox, your ass,

557
00:31:55,691 --> 00:31:57,940
or any of your cattle and the
stranger and your settlements.

558
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,300
So that your male and female slave may
rest is you do remember that you were a

559
00:32:01,301 --> 00:32:05,680
slave in the land of Egypt. And the
Lord God freed you from there. Um,

560
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,400
also for the Lord your God has God
supreme and Lord Supreme, the great,

561
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:13,030
the mighty and the awesome God who
shows no favor and takes no bride.

562
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,770
Bribe takes no bride also but takes
no bribe but upholds the cause of the

563
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:21,520
fatherless and the widow and befriends
the stranger providing him with food and

564
00:32:21,521 --> 00:32:23,740
clothing. So you two must
have a friend, a stranger,

565
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,380
you were strangers in the land of Egypt.
We have two rationales there.

566
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,200
One is the explicit rationale.
If imma Tatsuo Day,

567
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:34,160
this is what I do and this is
what you should do. Um, and, and,

568
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:37,780
and there are more many of them referring
to the exodus and Egypt and others

569
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,630
referring to the notion of imitates CEO d.
So it's awesome,

570
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:43,030
illuminating to compare,
um,

571
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:47,540
the ancient near eastern and the
biblical legal materials in terms of, um,

572
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,230
the concern for the disadvantaged,
the elimination of,

573
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,190
of social class distinctions and
a trend towards humanitarianism.

574
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:01,930
Greenburg notes that the Torah is concern
for the disadvantage of society is

575
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:05,420
quite marked in the
actual laws themselves.

576
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,230
Many of the extra biblical
legal collections pay homage
to this idea and they're

577
00:33:09,231 --> 00:33:12,710
prologues doesn't always seem
to be appearing. However,

578
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:16,490
in the actual terms of these collections,
now these collections are incomplete.

579
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,620
We don't have everything.
And again,

580
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:22,370
it may be another literary genre that
accomplished some of that work in that

581
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:26,720
culture, the Torah laws, um, and that, oh,

582
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:29,330
and also the laws in those collections,
very often,

583
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:33,740
despite the prologues rhetoric that they
bring justice to the disadvantaged and

584
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:38,690
so on. Many of the laws clearly served
the interests of an upper class. Okay.

585
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:40,400
That's the more important part point.

586
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:42,170
They clearly serve the
interest of an upper class.

587
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,420
The Torah laws do not contain all the
same distinctions of social class among

588
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:51,560
free persons as the contemporary laws,
the laws of Vishnu motion,

589
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,870
the laws of Hammurabi.

590
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:58,420
These laws distinguish between punishments
for crimes committed against upper

591
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:02,330
class and lower class person's
not to mention slaves.

592
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:06,470
So if we look at the code of Hammurabi,
there's a stretch of, of um, laws.

593
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,190
Number one,
nine one 95 to up to eight something.

594
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,150
Um, and they're, they're very
interesting to read them all in a row.

595
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,430
I'll hit some highlights. So
if an upper class person, okay,

596
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,470
and if an aristocrat has destroyed the,
I have a member of the aristocracy,

597
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:26,030
they destroy his eye. If he breaks
his bone, they break his bone.

598
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,220
But as you move down to one 98,

599
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,000
if he destroys the high of a commoner
or breaks the bone of a commoner,

600
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:35,450
a commoner, he pays one Mina
of silver. And if it's a slave,

601
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,480
he pays half the value of the slave
onto 200 and 201 if he knocks out and

602
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:44,420
aristocrats tooth, they knock out his
tooth. But if it's a commoners tooth,

603
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:49,090
he pays a third of a mean of silver.
And so on the Hittite laws too,

604
00:34:49,091 --> 00:34:52,940
they are different. There are
different amounts fixed by class.

605
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,880
In the miscarriage laws,
95 and 99,

606
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:58,830
the middle of Syrian laws also
distinguished between the hour.

607
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:01,420
We learned the Mooc Kanombe in the slave.
Uh,

608
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:05,030
Leviticus 24 verses 17 to 22,

609
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,590
we have their laws of personal liability,
bodily injury,

610
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,660
assault and battery or bodily injury.

611
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:16,850
And we find a clear and explicit statement
to the effect that there shall be one

612
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,160
standard for citizen and stranger alike.

613
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:23,510
This is known as the principal
of Talon Lex Talionis.

614
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,950
So reading from Leviticus,
if anyone names his fellow,

615
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:35,990
if anyone names his fellow as he
has done so shall it be done to him?

616
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,090
Fracture for fracture, eye
for eye, tooth for tooth,

617
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:42,390
the injury he inflicted on
another shall be inflicted on him.

618
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:45,630
You shall have one standard for
stranger and citizens alike.

619
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,070
For I the Lord am your God.
This was a radical concept and its day.

620
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:55,071
Evidently the punishment should fit the
crime no more and no less for all free

621
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:56,250
persons.
Granted,

622
00:35:56,251 --> 00:36:01,251
slaves are not included regardless of
social class equality before the law and

623
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:07,050
this cast the principle of Italian, I
hope in a new light, the law of Italian,

624
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:10,470
which is essentially the principle that
a person should be punished according to

625
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:14,490
the injury they inflicted.
It's been decried as a primitive,

626
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:17,820
archaic reflex of the vengeance
or vendetta principle.

627
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,820
The notion of an eye for an eye,
it's usually cited,

628
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:24,720
are held up as typical of the harsh
and cruel standards of the uh,

629
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:28,830
vengeful Old Testament God. But when
you look at it in a comparative light,

630
00:36:28,831 --> 00:36:30,000
in its legal context,

631
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:34,470
we see that it's a polemic against the
class distinctions that were being drawn

632
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,910
in antecedent and contemporary legal
systems such as the code of homer ropy.

633
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,590
According to the Bible,

634
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:44,250
the punishment should always fit the
crime regardless of the social status of

635
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:46,680
the perpetrator on the one hand
or the victim on the other.

636
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,360
All free citizens who injure are
treated equally before the law.

637
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,690
They're neither led off lightly
nor punished excessively.

638
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:58,320
If you read the middle of Syrian laws,
don't want to do that on an empty stomach,

639
00:36:58,321 --> 00:37:02,280
a 20 a 21 and f one, you have multiple
punishments that are carried out.

640
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,580
Someone who causes a miscarriage,
they have a monetary fine,

641
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:09,780
they have to pay to talents and 30
meters of led their flogged 50 times,

642
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:12,930
and then they have to do curvey forced
labor for the state for a month.

643
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,180
Multiple punishments for sheep stealing.

644
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,720
That's even worse if flogged a hundred
times and they pull out your hair and

645
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:21,990
there's a monetary fine and you do
curvey forced labor for a month.

646
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,790
So are these ideas,

647
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:28,200
is this idea that the punishment should
be neither too little, nor too much?

648
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,490
It should match the crime that all
free persons are equal before the law.

649
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:36,270
That one standard should apply
regardless of the social status of the

650
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,340
perpetrator or the victim. These
ideas really primitive legal concepts.

651
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:47,400
In addition to asserting the
basic equality before the
law for all free citizens,

652
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:50,550
the Bible mandates concern
for the disenfranchised.

653
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:54,930
We've already seen that a little bit and
the laws of Leviticus 19 verses nine to

654
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:57,060
10 which says that you have to leave.
Do you know,

655
00:37:57,061 --> 00:37:59,760
don't go over your fields picking
every little last bit. You know,

656
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:00,900
just go through,
give it you need,

657
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:04,200
but leave a little bit behind and let
the poor and the stranger glean their

658
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:09,240
Deuteronomy is a little less generous.
They substitute for the substitute.

659
00:38:09,241 --> 00:38:13,170
The phrase the widow, the orphan, and
the stranger in that law were Leviticus,

660
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:17,430
says the poor. Uh, Deuteronomy
24 verses 20 to 22,

661
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:20,520
when you beat down the fruit of your
olive trees or gather the Grapes of your

662
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:22,680
vineyard,
do not go over them again.

663
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:25,740
That which remains on the tree shall go
to the stranger and the orphan and the

664
00:38:25,741 --> 00:38:28,740
widow always remember, you are a
slave in the land of Egypt. Therefore,

665
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:30,720
do I enjoy new to
observe this commandment?

666
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:34,500
So Leviticus supports outright charity
for the poor in the form of gleanings

667
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,930
kind of a welfare system. Deuteronomy
has more of a work fair system in mind.

668
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:39,020
They actually never mentioned the poor.

669
00:38:39,021 --> 00:38:42,190
It's only Leviticus that mentions
the poor. Uh, for Deuteronomy,

670
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,810
it's the those who really can't provide
for themselves. I'm the widow, the orphan,

671
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,330
and the stranger who,
who may not be able to find employment.

672
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,760
The poor should be working,

673
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,080
but you can assist them
with loans according to
Deuteronomy and these should be

674
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:56,914
generous.

675
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,240
Here's Deuteronomy is admonition to
loan money to the poor even if it means

676
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:05,080
potential loss to yourself because
the seventh year is imminent.

677
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:08,920
The sabbatical year in the sabbatical
year, all debts were released, canceled,

678
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:13,600
okay. Sort of a economic corrective to
restore people to a more equal economic

679
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,680
situation. So in the sixth
years, some people will feel,

680
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,080
I don't really want to lend money and
it's going to be canceled next year I

681
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:24,190
won't get my money back. Loans must be
made even if the debt will be canceled.

682
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,420
For the simple reason that the problem
of poverty is a terrible and persistent

683
00:39:28,421 --> 00:39:33,190
problem. Deuteronomy 15 verses
seven through 11 if there
is among you a poor man,

684
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:34,090
one of your brethren,

685
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,600
you shall not harden your heart or shut
your hand against your poor brethren,

686
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:40,750
but you shall open your hand to him
and lend him sufficient for his need,

687
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:45,520
whatever it may be. Beware,
lest you harbor the base
thought woo. The seventh year,

688
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:49,330
the year of debt releases approaching so
that you are mean to your poor kinsmen

689
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:53,170
and give him nothing you shall give to
him freely and your heart shall not be

690
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:57,220
grudging when you give to him for the
poor will never cease out of the land,

691
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,920
right? The poor will always be with
you. This is where it comes from,

692
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:04,150
but it gets misquoted later.
Um, it's taken to me in the
poor are always with you,

693
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,730
so you don't have to do anything. It's
not what it means here in Deuteronomy.

694
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,480
Lend to them because the poor will
never see side of the land. Therefore,

695
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:13,510
I command you, open wide your
hand, get busy, give charity.

696
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,340
It's a problem that never goes away
so you can never rest connected with.

697
00:40:18,341 --> 00:40:21,760
This is the biblical trend
towards humanitarianism.

698
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,040
And there is of course,

699
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:27,970
much in biblical legislation that
offends modern sensibilities.

700
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,350
There's no point in pretending
that there isn't. For example,

701
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,770
as in the rest of the ancient world,
slavery existed in Israel.

702
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,580
It did even so,
and this is not to apologize for it.

703
00:40:39,581 --> 00:40:44,050
There is a tendency toward humanitarianism
in the laws concerning slavery.

704
00:40:44,051 --> 00:40:46,900
The Bible's equivocating
on this institution. Um,

705
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:51,400
some societies in their legal systems,
it's clear that slaves are the chattel,

706
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:55,390
the property of the master. The Bible,
again, equivocates on this question,

707
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:59,740
they affirm some personal rights
for the slave, but not all. Uh,

708
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,690
in contrast to,
for example,

709
00:41:01,691 --> 00:41:05,620
the middle of Syrian laws were a
master can kill a slave with impunity.

710
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:09,820
The Bible legislates that the master
who wounds his slave in any way,

711
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,230
even losing a tooth,

712
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,170
which is understood to be a minor thing
because it's not in any way in a central

713
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:18,280
Oregon. So even if he knocks out a
tooth, right, uh, he has to set him free.

714
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,340
That's an exodus 21 verses 26 to 27.
Moreover,

715
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,960
the slave is entitled to the Sabbath
Rest in all of the sabbath legislation.

716
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:31,210
And quite importantly, a fugitive slave
cannot be returned to its his master.

717
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,850
That's in Deuteronomy
three verses 16 to 17.

718
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:36,620
You shall not turn over to his master,

719
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:39,320
a slave who seeks refuge
with you from his master.

720
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,180
He shall live with you in any place.

721
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:44,570
He may choose among the settlements
in your midst, wherever he pleases,

722
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:48,590
you must not ill treat him. This is
the opposite of the fugitive slave law,

723
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:53,380
actually in this country in
the 19th century, but also
in Hammurabi's code, right?

724
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:58,460
I'm Ravi is code 1516 through 19 if
a citizen has harbored in his house,

725
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,530
either a fugitive male or female slave
belonging to the state or a private

726
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:06,680
citizen and has not brought him
forth at the summons of the police,

727
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,420
that householder shall be put to death.

728
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:12,200
The term of Israelite Israelite slavery.

729
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:15,470
That is to say an Israelite who has
fallen into service to another Israelite

730
00:42:15,471 --> 00:42:19,180
through generally indebtedness. That's,
that's a form that's slavery took in the,

731
00:42:19,181 --> 00:42:20,960
in the ancient world and
in the biblical picture,

732
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:24,950
the term was limited
to six years by exodus,

733
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:28,760
by the covenant code and the Priestly
Code. It's prohibited altogether.

734
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,610
No Israelite can be a
slave to another Israelite,

735
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:35,540
so it's actually done away with as an
institution altogether. In general,

736
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,390
the Bible urges humanitarian
treatment of the slave.

737
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:41,570
Again for you were once slaves
in Egypt is the refrain.

738
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:47,030
Other evidence of the trend towards
humanitarianism is the lack of legalized

739
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,980
violence in the Bible here,

740
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:52,010
if you compare the middle of Syrian law
is you'll see something quite different

741
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,130
there.

742
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:57,020
The middle of Syrian loss
explicitly authorize inhumane
treatment of a deserting

743
00:42:57,021 --> 00:43:00,560
wife. You can cut off her
ears, um, legalized violence.

744
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,590
In the case of a disc trainee.
A dis trainee is a pledge,

745
00:43:03,591 --> 00:43:06,650
someone who has been placed in your house
because of a debt and is working for

746
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:10,880
you. Um, the, the citizen
may do what he wishes, um,

747
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:13,520
as he feels the dis strain he
deserves and he pull out his hair,

748
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:17,690
he made mutilate his ears by piercing
them. I'm in the middle of Syrian laws,

749
00:43:17,691 --> 00:43:21,950
also legalized violence against
a wife when she deserves it.

750
00:43:21,951 --> 00:43:25,130
A Senor may pull out the hair of his wife,
mutilate or twist her ears.

751
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,080
There's no liability attaching to him.

752
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,990
Legal systems often express their values
by the punishments that are positive

753
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,430
for various transgressions.
And here,

754
00:43:34,431 --> 00:43:36,980
Moshe Greenberg has done something very
interesting, a little controversial.

755
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,570
Not everyone agrees with this,

756
00:43:38,571 --> 00:43:42,710
but he's pointed out that
the Bible differs from the
other extra biblical codes

757
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,720
in the value that it places on human life.

758
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,310
And you consider the crimes that are
punished by capital punishment and the

759
00:43:49,311 --> 00:43:52,070
crimes that are punished
by monetary compensation.

760
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,870
And he feels this is quite revealing.

761
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:59,060
So I've put this very handy little chart
on the board for you listing codes on

762
00:43:59,061 --> 00:44:02,930
one side and you'll see the kinds of
things that are punished by monetary fine

763
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,410
or compensation. In the
Hittite laws. Homicide,

764
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:11,090
you pay a certain amount of money
to compensate for the desk, right?

765
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,040
Um, personal injury, bodily injury,
you pay a certain amount of money, um,

766
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,220
in the middle of Syria and laws also
homicide. It's up to the family.

767
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:21,860
They'd can decide how they want this to
be punished, but they can take money.

768
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:26,000
Quote of Hama ropy we only
have accidental homicide case.

769
00:44:26,001 --> 00:44:28,190
We don't have an intentional
homicide cases and we don't know,

770
00:44:28,191 --> 00:44:32,910
but bodily injury when it's between equals
than the principle of Italian applies.

771
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:37,200
But when it's not between equals
monetary payment as cell on death.

772
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:39,480
On the other hand is um,

773
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,370
is the punishment for certain property
crimes instead of personal injury and

774
00:44:43,371 --> 00:44:44,204
homicide crimes,

775
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,050
death for theft in the Hittite
laws and for bestie reality.

776
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:54,720
I'm in the middle of Syrian laws also
theft and in the code of Hammurabi,

777
00:44:54,721 --> 00:44:57,420
theft and cheating. I'll go over some
of these in a little more detail.

778
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,860
So Greenburg is going to argue that the
Bible reverses the view of the other

779
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:05,880
codes and he says because in those life
is cheap and property is highly valued.

780
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:09,630
So Hammurabi's code imposes the death
penalty for the theft of property for

781
00:45:09,631 --> 00:45:11,280
assisting in the escape of a slave,

782
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:14,460
which is it's master's property for
cheating a customer over the price of a

783
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,070
drink.
Middle of Syrian laws,

784
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:21,270
there's death to a wife if she steals
from her husband and death to any who

785
00:45:21,271 --> 00:45:22,800
purchased the stolen goods.

786
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:28,050
The Bible never imposes his death penalty
for violations of property rights,

787
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:31,270
personal property rights,
private property rights, um,

788
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:36,120
only for intentional homicide and
certain religious and sexual offenses,

789
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:38,100
which are seem to be
direct defenses to God.

790
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:42,630
Greenburg argues that in so doing the
Bible is expressing the view that the

791
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:45,990
sanctity of human life is
paramount in its value system.

792
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,540
The Bible states explicitly that
homicide is the one crime for which note

793
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:54,990
monetary punishment can be substituted.
You cannot ransom the life of a murderer.

794
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:59,100
He must pay with his life numbers.
35 31 to 34.

795
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:02,370
You may not accept a ransom for the
life of a murderer who is guilty of a

796
00:46:02,371 --> 00:46:04,200
capital crime.
He must be put to death,

797
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:09,360
nor may you accept ransom in place of
flight to a city of refuge. Remember,

798
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:11,040
if it's an accidental homicide,

799
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,650
there is the lenient seen in the law
that that person can run to a city of

800
00:46:13,651 --> 00:46:17,010
refuge and remain there until the
death of the high priest. His,

801
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:20,160
the shedding of his blood purchased
the land of blood guilt, if you will,

802
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:23,970
because this is a religious
crime. Um, and you can't, but you,

803
00:46:23,971 --> 00:46:27,810
he can't pay money instead of running
to the city of refuge. Um, and, uh,

804
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:29,910
you shall not pollute the
land in which you live.

805
00:46:29,911 --> 00:46:32,880
There's a notion here of blood guilt
of pollution. Blood pollutes the land,

806
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:35,790
and the land can have no expiation
for blood that is shed on it,

807
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:37,980
except by the blood of Him who shed it.

808
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,610
You shall not defile the land in which
you live. In which I myself abide for.

809
00:46:41,611 --> 00:46:45,300
I The Lord abide among the Israelite
people and outside the Bible,

810
00:46:45,301 --> 00:46:50,301
we'd really don't have that absolute
ban on monetary compensation for murder.

811
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,640
And Greenberg has argued that
for the biblical legislators,

812
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,630
human life and property are
simply incommensurable crimes.

813
00:46:57,631 --> 00:47:02,160
And the one realm cannot be compensated
by punishment. In the other realm,

814
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,750
a crime in the realm of of life personal
injury has to be compensated in the

815
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:11,280
same realm. In the same way, property
crimes are not punished by death.

816
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:14,430
Also in the Bible, there is no
what I call literal punishment.

817
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,980
You'll sometimes see people refer
to this as vicarious punishment.

818
00:47:16,981 --> 00:47:19,500
I don't think it's vicarious punishment.
I call it literal punishment.

819
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,550
Little punishment. For example, in
the code of homer ropy where, um,

820
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,720
someone's ox kills a child,
um,

821
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:32,350
then the ox child is killed.
That's not vicarious.

822
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:37,210
You're not substituting. It's literal.
The the legal subject is the father.

823
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,050
He has lost a child. So I have to suffer
the literal punishment as a father,

824
00:47:41,051 --> 00:47:43,450
I have to lose my child,
right? It's not a substitution.

825
00:47:43,451 --> 00:47:45,340
It's a literal punishment for
what you did to the other.

826
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:49,770
And the Bible explicitly rejects
that idea. In exodus 21, um,

827
00:47:49,771 --> 00:47:53,110
and explicitly says that the owner's
child is not to be put to death,

828
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:55,330
is not killed.
Deuteronomy 24,

829
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:59,260
16 states that parents shall not be put
to death for children or children be put

830
00:47:59,261 --> 00:48:00,250
to death for their parents.

831
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:03,010
A person shall be put to
death only for his own crime.

832
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:07,690
The equal value of human life and limb
is also protected by the principle of

833
00:48:07,691 --> 00:48:10,960
tallying that we discussed
above in the quote of Hama,

834
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:14,680
ropy and Aristocrat can simply pay
money for injuring an inferior.

835
00:48:14,681 --> 00:48:16,990
That's not going to be much of
a hardship to a wealthy person.

836
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,310
And it certainly reflects the low value
that's placed on the life and limb of a

837
00:48:21,311 --> 00:48:22,690
member of the lower class.

838
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:26,890
[inaudible] only applies between
social equals in the code of Hammurabi.

839
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:27,971
But in the Bible,

840
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:31,630
the extension of Townie and all
free persons regardless of class,

841
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:34,930
expresses the notion that all
persons are of equal value.

842
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:36,910
In the case of rape,

843
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:41,080
the rapists wife is not rate as happens
in the middle of Syrian laws. Again,

844
00:48:41,081 --> 00:48:42,280
a literal punishment.

845
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:46,960
Other biblical values are reflected in
the emphasis on laws that deal with the

846
00:48:46,961 --> 00:48:50,980
plight of the poor, the slave, the
alien, the rights and dignity of debtors.

847
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:56,010
And so on. Reach just about the end of
my time. Just one last statement. Um,

848
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,110
because I don't want to leave you
with the impression that the biblical

849
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:01,570
materials speak with one
voice. They don't, I mean,

850
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:06,450
Greenberg has tried to pull
out some, some common, um, uh,

851
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,840
values.

852
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,790
Biblical legal materials
contain provisions that
contradict one another later

853
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:14,950
versions of the law,
particularly in d for example,

854
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:18,310
we'll update and revise earlier versions
of the law. And I love it. It gets,

855
00:49:18,311 --> 00:49:20,080
takes issue with the whole
institution of Israelites,

856
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:23,470
slavery that's accepted in the covenant
quote. And in Deuteronomy it says,

857
00:49:23,471 --> 00:49:27,220
it's just, no, it can't happen. You can't
be all Israelites are servants of God.

858
00:49:27,221 --> 00:49:31,090
None of you can be servants to another.
All right, so these, these laws had,

859
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:33,130
there's contradiction.
Nevertheless,

860
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:37,330
I think what Greenberg is trying to
say is that it is still fair. Um,

861
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:41,230
even though the materials
are contain contradictions,

862
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:44,830
it's still fair to say that they
sound certain common themes,

863
00:49:44,831 --> 00:49:49,450
a express certain important principles
and values which include the supreme

864
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:53,200
sanctity of human life that's pretty
consistently maintained among the codes.

865
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:58,090
The value of persons over property pretty
consistently maintained the equality

866
00:49:58,091 --> 00:50:01,920
of all free persons before the
law consistently maintained.

867
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,680
The importance of assisting the
disadvantaged in society very consistently

868
00:50:05,681 --> 00:50:07,030
maintained.
Um,

869
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:11,080
the integration and the interdependence
of all aspects of human life all coming

870
00:50:11,081 --> 00:50:15,040
within the will of God to legislate
very consistently maintained.

871
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,360
We come back on Monday.

872
00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:19,090
I just want to say a little bit about
the narrative context in which the laws

873
00:50:19,091 --> 00:50:21,430
are found before we move
on into Deuteronomy.

874
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:26,700
Monday evening will be the time at which
the midterm exam will be posted on the

875
00:50:27,351 --> 00:50:29,870
website and that'll be at
6:00 PM Monday evening.

876
00:50:29,871 --> 00:50:34,370
You'll have a 24 hour period of time
in which to find, I forget what I said,

877
00:50:34,371 --> 00:50:35,240
30 or 40 minutes.

878
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:38,000
It'll be clear on the instructions to
just sit and treat it as if you're in an

879
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:40,310
in class exam situation.
Write your essay.
