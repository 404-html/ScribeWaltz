1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,720
One thing that kept cropping up and it's
something that crops up every time I

2
00:00:03,721 --> 00:00:06,720
teach this course, and I should always
say something about it preemptively.

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,040
It's just a terminological issue.
Israelites are not as Railey's.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,353
Um,

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,250
the word Israeli term Israeli refers to
a citizen of the modern state of Israel.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,970
So there are no Israelis
before the year 1948. Okay.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,650
And we use Israelite to refer to the
ancient inhabitants of the ancient kingdom

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,530
of Israel. Okay. So that's
an important distinction.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,520
And I know you hear Israelis and so that's
just a term that people thought would

10
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:34,770
apply to anyone who inhabited
a place called Israel.

11
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:38,520
But Israeli and Israelite
are used precisely in order
to make that distinction

12
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:40,470
between the ancient and the modern period.
Okay.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,050
So we're talking about Israel lights
and while we're on the subject,

14
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:46,170
we're not talking about Jews yet either.
We can't really use the term Jew.

15
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,770
It's not historically accurate for the
period that we've been dealing with in

16
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:50,590
the Bible.

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,130
When we get towards the very end of the
biblical period and we've see that, uh,

18
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,910
when Persia conquers and reconstitutes
this area or designates as a province,

19
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:02,490
this area as you who'd,
right?

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,100
So the Persians are going
to be the ones to create

21
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,500
a province called [inaudible] in
this area, including Jerusalem.

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,130
And they will allow the Israelites who
were in exile to go back and live there

23
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:17,700
and they will become you who dates and
this is going to be where the word Jew

24
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:18,211
comes from,

25
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,750
but that's not going to be historically
accurate before the end of the sixth

26
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:24,150
century. Okay. So, and even then,

27
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:27,660
it's still a technical term having to
do with living in the province Eva,

28
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:30,600
who is not an ethnic, uh,
an ethnic term, right?

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,940
The word you who did you doesn't become
an ethnic term for quite some time.

30
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,110
So Israelites a is the correct term for
the group that we're dealing with here.

31
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,340
Hebrew is not bad either.

32
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:42,150
It basically is a linguistic term that
refers to people who speak Hebrew. Um,

33
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:45,270
and so the Hebrews,
it's something of a social ethnic term,

34
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:49,950
but based mainly on the linguistic
feature of speaking Hebrew. Okay.

35
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:54,090
So no Israelis, only
Israelites. All right.

36
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:57,570
We were reaching the end of June of
Joshua and we're going to be moving on to

37
00:01:57,571 --> 00:02:02,400
judges today. And the Bible
describes the early Israelite,

38
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,770
a sociopolitical unit as the tribe.

39
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:07,830
And this is what's going to be featured
in the last part of the book of Joshua.

40
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,590
We're going to see that
tribes are territorial units.

41
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,440
Tribe is attached to a
territory within the tribe.

42
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:17,490
You have clan elders and the clan elders
are the ones who dispense justice.

43
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,390
They make decisions regarding
the general welfare of the tribe.

44
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,690
So the second half of the book of Joshua,
um,

45
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:27,080
so the first half recounts the Conquest,
uh,

46
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:31,530
and then the second half recounts the
division of the land among the 12 tribes

47
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,670
who it is claimed we're descended
from the 12 sons of Jacob.

48
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,050
We have a couple of different
lists of the tribes in the Bible.

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,560
So if you take a look sometime you
might want to compare the list.

50
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:45,990
That's in genesis.
Genesis 29 or 30,

51
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,210
it's a pretty much the same
list that's in genesis 49. Um,

52
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,290
these are in a blessings,
you know,

53
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:55,380
patriarchs will very often give a blood
the blessings of all their children.

54
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:59,500
And so you look at the names
of the children and you'll
see the list of 12. Um,

55
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,730
you had the six sons of layer, you have
the four sons of the two concubines,

56
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:07,540
Bilhah and Zilpah and the two sons
of Rachel, Joseph and Benjamin.

57
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,940
And that is probably the
oldest list that we have.

58
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,080
But if you compare it to numbers 26,
I'm in Joshua and,

59
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:17,560
and the list that's in Joshua with
the distribution of the land, um,

60
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:22,561
you'll see that lavey or Levi is not
included presumably because the Levi's who

61
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:26,620
were to function as a priestly class
in Israel, they have no land allotment,

62
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,160
right? They're supported through
the cultic practices and the,

63
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:34,480
and the perquisites that come from
the sacrifices. Um, and so, uh,

64
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,050
instead of the Levites,
we find that too,

65
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,050
there are tribes named for
the two sons of Joseph.

66
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:43,270
So there is no Joseph tribe per se.

67
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,070
Joseph's two sons are f rhyme and
Menasha and this is how we then reach the

68
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:51,610
number 12.
So there's no Levi in the later lists,

69
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,270
but the Joseph tribes have been split
into a Fryman Menasha, if you will,

70
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,910
who are said to be the
two sons of Joseph Joseph.

71
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,120
So the consensus is a scholarly consensus
is that what you have in Canaan isn't

72
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:06,820
alliance of tribes, perhaps
not precisely 12. You know,

73
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:09,820
at different times there might've been
a different number and different groups

74
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:12,170
that came together at
different times. But, uh,

75
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,980
you have these tribes who
are worshiping, yeah, way,

76
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:17,020
perhaps not exclusively as we've seen.

77
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,040
And they have some loose obligations
of mutual defense in these different

78
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:21,874
alliances.

79
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,330
The book of Joshua presents this very
idealized portrait of these 12 tribes who

80
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:28,900
are preexistence.

81
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,620
They come into the land of Canaan
already formed basically as 12 tribes are

82
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:37,390
United with one another by their covenant
with Yahweh and they conquer the land

83
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,210
in concert.
Um,

84
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,550
but there are other elements
of the biblical narrative
as we've already begun to

85
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:45,670
talk about. And we'll continue to talk
about today as we move into judges,

86
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,350
which really suggests there was much more
sporadic cooperation among the tribes.

87
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,160
We never have more than one or two really
acting in concert until the very end

88
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,030
of the book of judges.

89
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,930
And so this suggests that there really
was no super tribal government or

90
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,720
coordination at this early age.

91
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,160
The Ark is said to have circulated
among the different tribal territories.

92
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,260
Didn't rest permanently in the territory
of one tribe until somewhat late in the

93
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:16,090
period it comes to rest
at a place called Shilo.

94
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:17,830
Shilo,
uh,

95
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,960
and it's seems that only in extraordinary
cases would you have the tribes acting

96
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:26,350
together perhaps by decision
of the tribal elders,

97
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,830
but super imposed upon the authority of
the elders is the authority of certain

98
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:33,670
inspired individuals.

99
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:38,671
And these are known as judges and it is
the exploits of these individuals that

100
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,440
are recorded in the book of judges. And
we'll turn to the book of judges. Now

101
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,380
the book of judges is set in that
transitional period between the death of

102
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:52,540
Joshua and the establishment

103
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,510
of a monarchic system.

104
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,230
It's about a 200 year period
from about 1200 to a 1000 or so.

105
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,390
It is an imaginative and embellished
reconstruction of that period of

106
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:07,670
transition.
We'll also see it's a very ideologically,

107
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,100
ideologically laden reconstruction.

108
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,470
So the story's depet depict
local tribal skirmishes, um,

109
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,120
rather than confrontations
between nations. You have
pretty much skirmishes with,

110
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,350
with groups around the country and that
makes a lot of sense for this 200 year

111
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,480
period when Canaan is making a transition,

112
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,720
a transition from sort of city states
in the bronze age to the emerging nation

113
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:36,730
of what we'll be Israel next to it.
Philistia on the east side around.

114
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,250
So we have nations are going to be coming
into being by the end of this period,

115
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,330
but there's this 200 year transitional
period before you get the formation of

116
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:47,840
these independent states.
Like Joshua,

117
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,080
the book of judges consists of various
sources that were fused together in a

118
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:57,800
Deuteronomistic framework and
we'll come back to that. In fact,

119
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:02,180
it's really a collection of individual
stories that senator on local heroes,

120
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:07,070
several of whom are interestingly enough,
socially marginal.

121
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:08,660
These are pretty scrappy characters.

122
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:12,160
You've got the illegitimate son of
a prostitute, you've got a bandit,

123
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,990
you've got very interesting,
colorful, and as I say,

124
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:19,991
socially marginal people and the stories
have a real folkloristic flavor to

125
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:23,060
them. They're full of drama
and a lot of local color,

126
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:26,540
local references to places
and, and um, customs and so on.

127
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,190
So if you were to list the stories of
the various judges, the major judges,

128
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:34,280
we have, um, six major
in six minor judges.

129
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:37,040
And my inner judges is simply a reference
to the fact that they judged for a

130
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:41,020
certain period of time. So there's
12 listed in all, I believe. And the,

131
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,830
there are six major judges for whom
there is a lengthy story beginning with a

132
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:50,740
who'd and chapter three.
So very a very funny story.

133
00:07:50,741 --> 00:07:52,040
And I'm against the,

134
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,190
they who had leaves the Israelites against
the mower bites a lot of about sort

135
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:59,660
of bathroom humor in that one. In chapters
four and five, you have Deborah who,

136
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,530
um, helps the Israelites in battle
against certain Canaanite groups.

137
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,580
You have three chapters, four
chapters, chapters six through nine,

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,590
recording the adventures
of Gideon, Gideon, uh, uh,

139
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,200
fights against the Midianites.
Gideon is interesting.

140
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:18,050
There are signs in his story
that he is divinely chosen.

141
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,850
I mean there's some evidence of,

142
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,720
of the enunciation of his birth and
some signal that he is divinely chosen.

143
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,290
Then in I'm 11 and into a
little bit of chapter 12,

144
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:31,580
you have the story of youth talk or
Jephthah who fights against the ammonites.

145
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:35,330
Very, um, interesting and
tragic story of his daughter,

146
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:38,690
which echoes similar sorts of stories.
And in Greek,

147
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,610
in Greek legend,

148
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,980
you also have chapters 13 to 16 Samson
who of course fights against the

149
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:50,300
Philistines. Sampson is
somewhat atypical. Um,

150
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,870
he also has a,
a,

151
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:55,680
a tremendous and fatal
weakness for foreign women
and that's a strong throughout

152
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,690
the Samson stories.
We'll come back to some of that.

153
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,090
Then towards the end you have
some interesting chapters
at the end, 17 and 18,

154
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:07,470
tell the story of Mika or Micah
and his idolatrous shrine.

155
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,380
And then finally the quite
horrifying and gruesome tail, um,

156
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,790
beginning chapters 19
going on through 20 and 21,

157
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:18,900
the story of the Levites conky
mine, um, and the civil war.

158
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,550
We'll come back and talk about
some of these a little more detail,

159
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:24,600
but that's just to give you a sense of
the different units that are in the story.

160
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,850
And then these are that are in the book.

161
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,900
And these stories have then been
embedded in a Deuteronomistic framework.

162
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:36,180
This framework provides the editors view
and pronouncement on and judgment of

163
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:37,770
the period.
Um,

164
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,420
some of the stories seem to have been
left pretty much intact themselves or

165
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:47,250
isn't in many cases a lot of
interference inside the story. Um,

166
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,660
only a few interpretations that express
the editors a theology of history,

167
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,650
but the editors theology of history is
best seen in the preface to the book,

168
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:58,680
which is why I sort of stuck
these over to the side. Um, this,

169
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:03,681
this preface that that frames the book
and chapter one gives a detailed summary

170
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,820
of the situation at the end of
Joshua's conquest, right? Taking stock,

171
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:14,090
listing the extensive areas that Joshua
had failed to take from the Canaanites,

172
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:17,640
despite the impression that's given by
the book of Joshua is certainly the first

173
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:21,090
part of it. They did everything they were
supposed to have done and fulfilled, uh,

174
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,490
the commandments to Moses and so on.

175
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,300
But here we get a list of all the places
they failed to take from the Canaanites

176
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:29,700
starting in Judah and moving
northward. They tend to, uh,

177
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,270
tend always start in the southern area
and Judah and then listings northward

178
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:34,104
direction.

179
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,320
Then in judges two verses one
through five and angel appears, um,

180
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,540
before Josh was death and
the Angel Recounts God's
redemption of the Israelites

181
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:47,460
from Egypt and then quotes God as follows,

182
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,690
I will never break my covenant
with you, but you, for your part,

183
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:54,240
must make no covenant with
the inhabitants of the land.

184
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,570
You must tear down their altars.
That's a phrase that's frowned.

185
00:10:57,571 --> 00:10:58,800
And Deuteronomy 12 again,

186
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:03,801
one of those phrases that makes us link
Deuteronomy with all of these subsequent

187
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:06,720
books and we refer to it all as a school,
the Deuteronomistic school,

188
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:10,260
because we have these phrases from
Deuteronomy that we'll pepper be peppered

189
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:13,950
throughout the rest of these books.
God will be faithful to his covenant,

190
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,580
in other words, but it's a two way
street and if Israel doesn't do her part,

191
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:21,450
she will be punished to the editor is
setting us up with that expectation before

192
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:23,550
we even begin to read an
account of what happens.

193
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:29,100
The Angel then relates that Israel
has already not been obedient,

194
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,000
so God has resolved, right? This
is a fait accompli. At this point,

195
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:36,360
God has resolved that he will no longer
drive the Canaanites out before the

196
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:36,841
Israelites.

197
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:41,841
He will leave them as a snare and a
trap to test their resolve and their

198
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:42,834
loyalty.

199
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,740
So it's a very far cry from the idealized
portrait that we had in the first half

200
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:47,730
of the book of Joshua.

201
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,500
So that opening announcement listing all
of the ways in which they have failed

202
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:57,501
to take the and the visit by the Angel
who tells them you've already failed in

203
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:58,241
so many ways,

204
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:01,330
and so God's not even going to help
you to route the Canaanites any longer.

205
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,261
That's followed.

206
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:07,261
Then in a section from chapter two verse
11 through Chapter Three Verse six and

207
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:10,810
this is a kind of prospective summary,

208
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,200
write a summary before the
fact of the nation's troubles,

209
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,500
and this is a passage that expresses the
editor's judgment on the nation of this

210
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:23,710
period.
Another generation arose after them,

211
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,760
which had not experienced
the Lord experience the
deliverance of the Lord or the

212
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:31,720
deeds that he had brought for Israel and
the Israelites did what was offensive

213
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,290
to the Lord, but was literally what was
evil in the eyes of the Lord, right?

214
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,510
If an important phrase,
what was evil in the eyes of the Lord,

215
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,540
they followed other gods from among the
gods of the peoples around them and bow

216
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,810
down to them.
They provoked the Lord.

217
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,590
Then the Lord was incensed it Israel
and he handed them over to foes who

218
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:51,640
plundered them as the Lord had declared
and as the Lord had sworn to them and

219
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:53,140
they were in great distress.

220
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,620
And then the Lord raised up leaders who
delivered them from those who plundered

221
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:59,050
them, but they did not
heed their leaders either.

222
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,870
They want a straight after
other gods and bow down to them.

223
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,500
And when though I'm sort of skipping
right, I'm condensing all of this.

224
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,020
When the Lord raised up leaders for them,

225
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,650
the Lord would be with the leader and
would save them from their enemies during

226
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:15,820
the leader's lifetime for the Lord
would be moved to pity by their mornings

227
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:19,510
because of those who oppressed and
crushed them. But when the leader died,

228
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,553
they would act.

229
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,120
They would again act basically even more
than the preceding generation following

230
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:27,370
other gods were shipping
them and bowing down to them.

231
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,440
They omitted none of their practices
and stubborn ways. So in short,

232
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,500
it's the view of the Deuteronomistic
historian expressed here in judges that

233
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Israel's crises are caused
by her infidelity to your
way through the worship of

234
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:45,640
Canaanite gods.
And for this sin,

235
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,560
God sells the Israelites to their enemies
and then move to pity when they cry

236
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:51,420
out.
Um,

237
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,050
under the oppression he raises
leaders to deliver Israel.

238
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:00,220
And this pattern of sin,
punishment, repentance,

239
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,240
and deliverance through leaders, um, is
the recurring pattern throughout the book.

240
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:09,270
And it punctuates the transition from
each of these leaders that God will raise

241
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:10,031
up,
right?

242
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:15,031
So it's this recurring pattern and this
Deuteronomistic perspective as well as

243
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:20,221
Deuteronomistic ideology generally isn't
always apparent within the individual

244
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,050
stories themselves.
As I stressed,

245
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,790
some of them seem to be
pre Deuteronomistic folk
tales about the exploits of

246
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,160
these local heroes.
They were popular stories.

247
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,790
So Gideon we'll see builds an altar,
uh,

248
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:38,140
despite the fact that we know Deuteronomy
insisted on centralized worship and

249
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:41,730
prohibited outlying alters
or multiple alters. Um,

250
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,010
he is also known. His
other name, if you will,

251
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:50,770
is [inaudible] howl.
I just a name that's made with bow,

252
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,180
um, meaning, um, about Al will
strive or buyable content.

253
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,830
So this is an alternate name for
Gideon. He erects an idol. Uh,

254
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:03,770
the people of chef him where he is,
I'm after his death.

255
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:07,670
They continue to worship by,
I'll burrito the bow of the covenant,

256
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,200
which was an interesting sort of merger
of Bile Ism and covenantal religion,

257
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:13,161
right?

258
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:17,000
So you have a lot of these elements
that presumably the deuteronomist would

259
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,343
disapprove.

260
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:23,000
The story of Sampson also appears
to be largely pre Deuteronomistic.

261
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:23,751
It was again,

262
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:28,370
probably a very popular entertaining
folktale about a legendary strong man.

263
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,040
Um, you know, he can lift
up the gates of the city,

264
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:35,690
he can tie the tales of 300
foxes with torches and so on.

265
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,890
Um, but this great strong man
is undone by his one weakness,

266
00:15:39,891 --> 00:15:43,040
which is a weakness for foreign women,
particularly Philistine women.

267
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:47,150
At least we think Delilah was Philistine.
And that proves to be his downfall.

268
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,130
So you can see in a way how these stories
were fodder for the Deuteronomistic

269
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,593
editor.

270
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,160
The Deuteronomistic editor insists that
foreign gods often accessed through

271
00:15:58,161 --> 00:16:02,780
marriage to foreign women,
exercised a fatal attraction for Israel.

272
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,250
And it was the inability to resist the
snare of idolatry that would ultimately

273
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:12,230
lead to ruin. We have to remember that
the final editing of this, of these,

274
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,680
these, um, this narrative history
is happening in exile, right?

275
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,550
It's happening from people for whom all
of this is ultimately leading towards a

276
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:21,560
tragedy.
All right?

277
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:26,570
So the leaders who are raised
by God are called judges.

278
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,870
That's a term that's used
in other Semitic texts, um,

279
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,380
to refer to leaders in
the second millennium,

280
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:36,350
sometimes human and sometimes divine.
Um,

281
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,190
so the term is used here in the biblical
text that we fear refers always to a

282
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,060
human leader and one who exercises
many different powers or functions,

283
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:47,390
not merely judicial. We think of the word
judge really in a judicial context in,

284
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:50,480
but that's not, that wasn't the
extent of the function of the judge.

285
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,610
These are light judge was
actually primarily a military
leader commissioned with

286
00:16:55,611 --> 00:16:59,960
a specific task.
And only in times of national crisis,

287
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,600
the judge had a charismatic
quality, which, um,

288
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,170
in several cases as
expressed by the phrase,

289
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,300
the spirit of the Lord came upon him.

290
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,260
God would raise up the judge to deliver
the people from a specific crisis.

291
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,610
The judge might muster troops
from two tribes or three tribes,

292
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,160
sometimes only a clan or two,

293
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,180
which suggests that there was wrote no
real national entity at this particular

294
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:29,960
time. We never see more than one or two
tribes acting together or some clans of a

295
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:34,020
tribe, but the institution
of judges never, um,

296
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,470
created fixed political,
uh,

297
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:41,471
forms and each judge deferred from the
last in background in class and even

298
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:46,820
gender. We do have one
female judge Deborah, who did
exercise judicial functions.

299
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:48,410
Evidently according to the text,

300
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,380
the judges aren't chosen
necessarily for their virtue.

301
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,710
Many of them seem to fall into the
literary type of the trickster.

302
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,160
You know, a bit like Jacobs. Some of
them are, they're crafty, tricky types.

303
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,400
A Gideon is explicitly chosen for his
weakness and not because of his strength.

304
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,590
Turns out that he's quite a ruthless
fighter and he's clearly not a devout Yak.

305
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,870
Whist. Um, Jephthah is an outlaw.

306
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,630
Samson is hardly a moral exemplar.

307
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:24,210
So these are not meant to be
idealized heroes, but popular heroes.

308
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,450
And there a very interesting tension,
uh,

309
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,070
in the book of judges that will continue
beyond and to book of Samuel as well.

310
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,470
But attention regarding kingship,

311
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,760
the individual stories seem to suggest
a very deep seated distrust of kingship.

312
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,380
So in judges eight,
the people ask one of the judges,

313
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,670
Gideon at that time to become king.
And he responds this way,

314
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,570
I shall not rule over you, nor shall
my son's rule over you, Yahweh.

315
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,070
He shall rule over you.
That's eight,

316
00:18:56,071 --> 00:19:01,071
verse 23 and indeed the short rain of
Gideon's ruthless son of the Melech,

317
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,750
which means my father is king,
ironically, um, is a complete disaster.

318
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,660
The position of judge is temporary.

319
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:12,420
God was viewed as the
permanent king in Israel,

320
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,070
the temporary authority of the judge
derived from the kingship of God.

321
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:20,280
So the judge's position could
not become absolute or permanent.

322
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:22,710
That would be a rejection
of God's leadership.

323
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,360
So the book of judges seems to be
squarely against the notion of kingship in

324
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:28,194
Israel,

325
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,980
but the book as a whole seems to suggest
a certain progression towards kingship.

326
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:39,330
And this emerges from some of the kind of
editorial elements and interpretations.

327
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,900
The final chapters of judges document
Israel's slow slide into disorder and

328
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:47,670
ultimately into civil war.

329
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,340
Chapter 18 opens with an ominous statement
or phrase that recurs throughout the

330
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:57,840
final chapters. In those days,
there was no king in Israel.

331
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:58,780
Uh,

332
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,780
that happens again in Chapter 19 Verse
One Chapter 21 verse 25 and in addition,

333
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:07,140
it is said that everyone
did as he pleased,

334
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:09,750
or everyone did what was
right in his own eyes.

335
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,780
It's in chapter 21 verse
25 by the end of the book,

336
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,850
the Israelites find themselves spiraling
out of control in an orgy of violence

337
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:22,080
and rape.
And in the final chapter,

338
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,770
all out civil war alleviates concubine,

339
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:30,510
is raped by a gang murdered
by the tribe of Benjamin.

340
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,250
And this is an atrocity that's to a
be avenged by all the other tribes.

341
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:37,710
They leave. Eit takes her
body, cuts it into 12 parts,

342
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:40,320
sends a part to each of the
tribes as a call to war,

343
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:45,000
to join together in a war of
extermination against Benjamin.

344
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,680
And many scholars have observed that.

345
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:52,420
It's ironic and tragic that the onetime
the tribes do all act in concert is

346
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:53,620
against one of their own.

347
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,710
This is the only time all 12 tribes or
if the other 11 tribes come out against a

348
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,950
common enemy and it is the tribe of
Benjamin at a certain point, however,

349
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:06,820
they realize with some regret that the
tribe of Benjamin is near extinction.

350
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,710
This is not a good thing.

351
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:13,711
So the other tribes then arrange to kidnap
women from Shiloh as mates Shilo for,

352
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,600
for the remaining Benjamin Nights.

353
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,260
So as a final comment on this horrible
symphony of barbarity of rape,

354
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,690
murder, civil war,
kidnapping, forced marriage,

355
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,890
the Deuteronomistic his story
and concludes the book of
judges with this refrain.

356
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,300
In those days, there was no king in
Israel and every man did. Is he pleased?

357
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:39,130
Right? It's a wonderfully,
um, polysomic phrase,

358
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,820
no king in Israel, no human king,
perhaps also given their behavior,

359
00:21:42,821 --> 00:21:47,110
no divine king. Um, so again, I see that
as sort of an ominous refrain throughout.

360
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,570
There was no king in Israel.
Every man is doing as it pleases.

361
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:52,930
And look at the situation we've reached
by the end of the book of judges,

362
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,210
the Deuteronomistic,

363
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:59,860
a explanation for the moral and
social bankruptcy of Israel.

364
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:04,861
At the end of the period of the judges
and the dawn or the on the eve of the

365
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:08,590
monarchy is Israel's
continued in fidelity.

366
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,400
And the prescription for this situation
at some level in the texts is a king.

367
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,520
This sits uneasily with an anti
monarchic trend in some of these stories.

368
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,230
But according to the
Deuteronomistic historian,

369
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,020
the institutional structure
of a kingdom of God,

370
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:30,190
right to sort of a theocracy is how a
later Jewish historian would describe this

371
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:32,500
period at kingdom in
which God is the king.

372
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,510
And the community is led by inspired
judges in times of crisis. That structure,

373
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:41,860
that institutional structure
failed to establish stability,

374
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,590
um, uh, stable, continuous government.

375
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,490
It failed to provide leadership against
Israel's enemies within and without you,

376
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:50,410
if I'm on and Moab to the east,

377
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:54,340
you have the Philistines to the west
and they soon managed to subjugate the

378
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:55,174
entire land.

379
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:00,400
So the tribes seem to be conscious of
the need for a centralized authority,

380
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:01,810
a strong central authority.

381
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:07,050
And the demand for a king arises in their
search for a new political order that

382
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:12,790
people turn to the Prophet Samuel.
Samuel is the last,

383
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,870
the last in a line of profit judges.
Um,

384
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,960
uh, and they ask him to
anoint a king for them.

385
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,210
So we're moving now into the book of
Samuel and the Book of Samuel deals with

386
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:32,620
the transition from the period of the
judges to the period of the monarchy.

387
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,440
And the first book of Samuel,

388
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,940
you have the opening chapters that record
the birth and career of Israel's last

389
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,800
judge Samuel. So that's chapters one
through four. The next few chapters, um,

390
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:49,130
through seven deal with the
Philistine crisis. And at this time,

391
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:53,180
the Ark of the covenant itself is captured
and taken into Philistine territory.

392
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,060
Um,
chapters eight through 15,

393
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,650
give us a story of Samuel and Saul
who will be Israel's first king.

394
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,620
And then the last half of the,
of the book,

395
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,000
16 onto 31 are going to,
um,

396
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,290
give us the story of Saul and David.

397
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,280
So first Samuel opens with the story
of Samuel's birth to Hannah and her

398
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:18,200
dedication of her son to the
service of God at Shiloh,

399
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:19,610
at the sanctuary at Shiloh.

400
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,230
So Shiloh appears to have been the most
important shrine in the period before

401
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,243
the monarchy.

402
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,240
The Prophet Jeremiah is going to refer
to shy though as the place where God

403
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:31,220
first made his name to dwell.
You remember,

404
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:34,160
the Deuteronomist is always speaking
about centralization around a place where

405
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:37,220
God will cause his name to
dwell. At first, that was Shiloh.

406
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,280
It's been noted that after
the birth of Samuel, um,

407
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:46,420
the text conveys a sense of three crises
and I've sort of listed them on the far

408
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:51,230
side of the board over there.
The first crisis is a religious crisis.

409
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,950
The priest of the time,
Aly Eli,

410
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,470
he's also described as a judge,

411
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,700
but perhaps that's just to fit him
literarily into the pattern of leadership

412
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:04,220
that predominates in this
section of the Bible.

413
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:08,930
He's said to be aging and his sons
are quite corrupt. As a result,

414
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:12,560
the text says the word of
Yahweh is rare in those days.

415
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,160
So there's a crisis in
religious leadership.

416
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,240
There's also a crisis in political
leadership or political succession to some

417
00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:21,540
degree.
Um,

418
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:25,640
judges two tells us that Eli's
two sons are clearly not worthy.

419
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,850
They dishonor the sacrifices
and according to one reading,

420
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:31,520
they lie with the women
at the door of the shrine.

421
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,140
God says he will cut off
the power of Eli's house.

422
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,820
His two sons will die in one day and
God will find and raise up a faithful

423
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:43,310
priest. But in the meantime,
no leader is a parent.

424
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:45,440
So we have a crisis in succession,
if you will.

425
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,290
The third crisis is a military crisis.

426
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,430
In judges four through seven,
um,

427
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,040
the Israelites suffer a defeat
at the hands of the Philistines.

428
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:58,790
I'm sorry for Samuel. Um, they suffer a
defeat at the hands of the Philistines.

429
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:01,250
The arc is captured.
Eli's two sons are killed.

430
00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:03,710
And the news of all of
this kills Eli as well.

431
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,420
So when we first meet Samuel,
we wonder,

432
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,140
is he going to be the answer to all
of these crises, these problems?

433
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,550
Chapter three says that the word of
the word of God comes to Israel through

434
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:17,460
Samuel.
I,

435
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,690
in contrast to the statement that the
word of God was rare in those days,

436
00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:23,030
we hear that the word of God is now
coming to Israel through Samuel.

437
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,750
It raises some hope in
Chapter Seven Samuel Exhorts,

438
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,020
the people to stop serving
alien gods and Ashley Roach,

439
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,200
and to serve God and only then will god
deliver them so that people do this.

440
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,030
And Samuel lead them.
He employs his,

441
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:41,840
his military tactics mostly include
prayer and confession and sacrifice,

442
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:43,690
but he manages to,
uh,

443
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,710
lead them to victory over the Philippine
Philistine's God thunders and the

444
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,993
Philistines Flea in fear.

445
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,740
So Samuel seems to be combining
in one person several functions.

446
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,550
He is a priest. He's in the shrine.
He offers sacrifices. He builds.

447
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:04,230
Alters is also a seer and a prophet.
He receives the word of the Lord.

448
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,140
And like a prophet,
he will be annointing kings.

449
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:12,030
And he's also a judge in the sense that
he leads Israel to military victory.

450
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,370
But he also travels a circuit acting
as a judge in a judicial sense.

451
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,200
Um,
it says throughout Israel,

452
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:22,770
but really most of the places we hear
about are within the confines of Benjamin.

453
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,160
So this story seems to mostly be
focused in the southern region,

454
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,270
in the tribe of Benjamin,

455
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,340
but even he is unable to provide Israel
with the kind of leadership that, uh,

456
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,280
the texts suggests is required.

457
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,320
The philistine threat is going to
reemerge and the crisis of succession will

458
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,700
remain obviously.

459
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,200
And so the representatives of
the 12 tribes come together
to Samuel to ask for a

460
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:46,800
king.

461
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,540
Samuel is therefore a kind of a
transition figure between Israel,

462
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:55,050
the semi Democratic
Confederation and Israel,

463
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,940
the nation and monarchy.

464
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,090
It's going to be a huge
transformation as we'll see,

465
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,450
but he's going to be the one to bridge
the gap to this new kind of leadership.

466
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,700
Now, as an judges, um,

467
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:11,130
the historical account that we
have in first Samuel contains many

468
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:13,080
contradictions,
many duplicates.

469
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,550
So scholars take these as evidence of
the existence of various conflicting

470
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:20,760
sources and traditions that have been
put together in a larger framework.

471
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,900
So for example, we have three
different accounts of, of um,

472
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,520
the choice of Saul as king. We have
two accounts of his being rejected.

473
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,660
Ultimately by God.

474
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:35,220
We have different accounts of how David
came to know Saul and how David entered

475
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:36,150
Saul Service.

476
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:41,190
We have more than one account of David's
escape into Philistine territory of his

477
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:43,650
sparing Saul's life. That
happens twice, twice.

478
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:47,160
He has the opportunity to kill him twice.
He spares his life and so on.

479
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,380
Goliath is killed twice.

480
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:53,310
Only one of those occasions is by David
and the other occasion he's killed by

481
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:56,700
some other hero.
So most important for us,

482
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:01,701
however is the existence of sources that
hold opposing views of the institution

483
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:06,480
of kingship. This makes for an interesting
and complicated structure in the book.

484
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,590
Some of the passages are clearly
antinarcotic and some are clearly promo

485
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:15,060
anarchic and I've put them up here.
The anti monarchic passages.

486
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:19,740
First Samuel eight there's a passage in
10 there's a passage and 12 the promo

487
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:24,390
anarchic passages are sandwiched in
between these right and nine and 11 so you

488
00:29:24,391 --> 00:29:27,300
have this alternating sequence
of anti pro, anti pro,

489
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:32,301
anti first Samuel Eight is a classic
example of the antimony narcotic

490
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:37,380
perspective. Samuel is initially
opposed to the whole idea.

491
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:42,650
He apparently resents the use or patient
of his own power until God says he the

492
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,420
demand of the people and everything
they say to you for it is not you.

493
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:49,960
They have rejected it is me.
They have rejected as their king,

494
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,430
he their demand,

495
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:55,900
but warn them solidly and tell them
about the practices of any king who will

496
00:29:55,901 --> 00:29:58,150
rule over them.
And so Samuel does that.

497
00:29:58,151 --> 00:30:02,830
He does that in verses 11 through
18 he wards of the tyranny of kings,

498
00:30:02,831 --> 00:30:04,300
the repair seriousness of kings,

499
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,800
the service and the sacrifice that we
choir of the people in order to support

500
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:11,800
their luxurious court life.
And they're large Harem,

501
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,780
their bureaucracy and their army.

502
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:18,880
The Day will come Samuel Warren's when
you cry out because of the king whom you

503
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:23,350
yourselves have chosen and the Lord will
not answer you on that day. All right,

504
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:26,830
very antimony narky passage that people
won't listen to him and they say quite

505
00:30:26,831 --> 00:30:28,060
significantly.
No,

506
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:32,800
we must have a king over us that we may
be like all the other nations that are

507
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:36,430
king rule over us and go out at
our head and fight our battles.

508
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,090
So this is an explicit and ominous
rejection that only have Yaffe way,

509
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:43,690
but of Israel's distinctiveness from other
nations and what after all it does it

510
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:45,730
mean to be a holy nation,

511
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:49,930
but to be a nation separated out from
observing different rules from other

512
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:50,764
nations.

513
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:56,610
In Samuel 12 Samuel retires and he says
as he does so see it is the king who

514
00:30:58,001 --> 00:30:58,390
leads you.

515
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:03,390
Now I am old and gray and he again
outlines what is required of a good king.

516
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:09,280
And then again chastises the people
for even having asked for a king,

517
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,540
a warning that really God
must be served wholeheartedly.

518
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,560
A king should not interpose himself.

519
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:21,020
Some have argued that the editors who
compiled the text preserved the Promo

520
00:31:21,021 --> 00:31:23,350
anarchic perspective of their sources,

521
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:27,830
but they chose to frame the promo
anarchic passages with their own antum

522
00:31:27,831 --> 00:31:32,050
anarchic passages with the result that
the anti monarchic passage is really

523
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:35,590
provide a, um, a stronger interpretive
framework and our dominant.

524
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:40,420
And the implication is that despite
positive contemporary evaluations of

525
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:44,770
Israel's kings from the perspective of
a later period, from the perspective of,

526
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:46,930
of the editors and perhaps
those sitting in exile,

527
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,800
the institution of kingship
was a disaster for Israel.

528
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:56,250
And that negative assessment is introduced
by the Deuteronomistic redactor into

529
00:31:56,801 --> 00:32:00,220
his account of the origin
of the institution that
God himself warrant at the

530
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:03,880
time that this transition was being made.
And this request was being made.

531
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:07,420
God himself warned that this had the
potential to be quite disastrous.

532
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:13,180
Others feel that the Promo anarchic and
anti Menarche fuse were contemporaneous

533
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:17,140
and both ancient. And we see that simply
reflected in these dueling sources.

534
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:22,270
So whether one view is
older and one a more recent,

535
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,930
whether both are ancient views or
both are recent or later views,

536
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,050
the end result is a very complex
narrative. As you read it,

537
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:32,560
you feel thrown back and forth between
these positive and negative assessments

538
00:32:32,561 --> 00:32:34,030
of kingship.
Um,

539
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,930
and we feel these and see these very
different views of monarchy in ancient

540
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:41,720
Israel. So these views really
defy categorization. In the end,

541
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,770
they're one of the things that give the
book such complexity and sophistication.

542
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,560
Not only is their ambivalence,
however,

543
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:51,260
about the institution
of kingship or monarchy,

544
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,190
there's also a great deal of ambivalence
about the first and habitat of the

545
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:58,690
office. The first King
King Saul himself, uh,

546
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:03,710
judges has three different accounts
of Saul's appointment as king.

547
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:08,630
In chapter nine for Samuel Nine,
it's a private affair.

548
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,600
It's just between Saul
and the Prophet Samuel.

549
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:16,370
Samuel anoints Saul as king with oil
and a kind of a private encounter.

550
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:22,210
The anointing of kings is also found
among other ancient near eastern groups.

551
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:25,640
The Hittites, for example, in Israel,

552
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:30,350
it seems to be a right of dedication
or consecration, making sacred to God,

553
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,950
consecration making sacred,
and it's done not just for kings,

554
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:37,490
it's also done for high priests.
They are also anointed with sacred oil.

555
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,730
Then in First Samuel 10,

556
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,310
you have Saul's appointment
represented as um,

557
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,690
being affected by lottery. It's a
lottery that's presided over by Samuel,

558
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:52,130
but there is a lottery system and the
lot falls to Samuel to be appointed king.

559
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,180
In the next chapter. In
First Samuel 11, we have, um,

560
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,150
Saul victorious in a
battle over the ammonites.

561
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:02,930
And so he's elected by popular
acclaim, if you will. Um,

562
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,580
these could all be complimentary ways
of his slowly securing the position.

563
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,690
Um, they could be seen as
competing accounts, but he's a,

564
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:15,410
an important and a striking figure.
Nevertheless,

565
00:34:15,411 --> 00:34:19,640
there seems to have been some controversy
about Saul and it's preserved within

566
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:24,410
our sources. On the one
hand, he's described in very
positive terms. He's tall,

567
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:27,500
he's handsome, he's winning,
he's charismatic. In fact,

568
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:31,730
he's associated with ecstatic prophecy
at the spirit of the Lord comes upon him

569
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:33,780
and he,
he prophesies in that in a,

570
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:38,630
in a sort of a raving and dancing and
ecstatic mode. He defends his own tribe.

571
00:34:38,631 --> 00:34:43,430
He's from the tribe of Benjamin and he
defends them from ammonite raids and he's

572
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:47,720
hailed by the tribes as a
leader in time of war as king.

573
00:34:47,721 --> 00:34:50,600
He did enjoy some initial
military victories.

574
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:55,310
He drove the Philistines from their
garrisons and he was such a popular and

575
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:57,380
natural leader that even Samuel,

576
00:34:57,381 --> 00:35:02,381
who at first resented Saul and resented
the idea that king came to appreciate

577
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:05,600
him and was said to really
grieve for him upon his death.

578
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,330
But once David enters the story,

579
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:12,650
which is about halfway through the book
of First Samuel, um, it's per Samuel 16,

580
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,730
then we begin to see, begin to see
clearly negative assessments of saw,

581
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,260
perhaps because the sources about David
does stem from circles that were loyal

582
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:24,530
to the house of David and
David is going to succeed.

583
00:35:24,531 --> 00:35:26,960
Saul obviously as the
second king of Israel.

584
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,990
Perhaps the negative
assessment is because of cells,

585
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,450
Saul's ultimate failure and suicide.

586
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:36,650
And that had to be accounted for by
identifying some fatal flaw in him.

587
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:42,470
So now his ecstatic prophecies
are presented as irrational
fits of mad behavior.

588
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,730
So where once the spirit of the
Lord was said to come upon him,

589
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,210
now he said to be seized by
an evil spirit from the Lord,

590
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:55,520
that Russia's upon him suddenly
causing him to rave in his house, uh,

591
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,110
elsewhere.
He commits errors.

592
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,380
He doesn't obey Samuel's instructions to
the letter and that's going to cost him

593
00:36:02,381 --> 00:36:04,740
the support of Samuel.
And ultimately, God,

594
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:09,030
we have two stories of disobedience
unrelated in First Samuel.

595
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:14,630
One is in chapter 13 he sees 'em that
the morale of his men is sagging.

596
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:18,990
And so to sort of rallied them together,
he officiates at a sacrifice.

597
00:36:18,991 --> 00:36:21,810
He was supposed to wait for Samuel
to arrive and do it, but he,

598
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,240
he sees that it needs to happen now.

599
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:29,070
And so he officiates at the sacrifice
himself and this appropriation of a

600
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:32,010
priestly function and rages Samuel.

601
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,460
And this is Samuel's first pronouncement
or prediction that God will not

602
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:39,450
establish Saul's dynasty over
Israel despite the fact, by the way,

603
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:42,780
that other kings at other times we'll
sacrifice with impunity. So it's,

604
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:45,370
it's interesting because David
and others will sacrifice and,

605
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:47,010
and it doesn't seem to be a problem,

606
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,940
but here it's given as the occasion
for Samuel's fury and his first

607
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:53,580
pronouncement that the dynasty
of Saul will not be established.

608
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,680
In Chapter 15 we have a second instance
of disobedience that earns Samuel's

609
00:36:58,681 --> 00:37:01,740
disapproval again against Samuel's order.

610
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:06,400
He spares the life of an enemy
king. This king a Gog, um,

611
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,770
he spares his life and otherwise
violates the terms of hire him. You know,

612
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:15,450
this notion of total destruction or
devotion of booty and enemies to God,

613
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:19,640
um, through total destruction.
And again, when he violates the,

614
00:37:19,641 --> 00:37:20,880
the order of Krm,

615
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,990
Samuel again announces that God
regrets having made Saul King.

616
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,900
The Lord has this day torn
the kingship over Israel,

617
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:31,560
away from you and has given it to
another who is worthier than you.

618
00:37:31,561 --> 00:37:35,760
That's Chapter 15, verse 28. In any event,

619
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,160
with his support eroding,

620
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:41,820
Saul seems to sink into a
deep depression and paranoia.

621
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,740
And toward the end of his life,

622
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:48,600
he's depicted as being completely obsessed
with David and the threat that David

623
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,340
poses to saw himself,

624
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:54,480
but also his dynasty saw is
angry that his own son, Jonathan,

625
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:57,460
who presumably should succeed
him to the throne, um,

626
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,010
has a deep friendship with David and in
fact throws his support over to David

627
00:38:02,011 --> 00:38:06,380
instead of himself in, in
several jealous rages, um,

628
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:11,390
saw attempts to kill David or to have
him at his supporters killed a one

629
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:16,940
particularly violent infinity. Kills
85 priests who he believes have, um,

630
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,730
given shelter to David and his supporters.

631
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:25,620
So in these encounters, right
between Saul and David, um,

632
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:30,420
the sources portray Saul is this,
this raving obsessed, paranoid person.

633
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,870
And David is seen as a
sort of innocent victim.

634
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:37,930
And he protests his loyalty
and his support for Saul.

635
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:41,650
He doesn't seem to understand why saw,
should view him as a threat.

636
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,540
And twice he passes up the opportunity
to do a way with Saul himself.

637
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:50,200
He says, I will not raise my
hand against the Lord's anointed.

638
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:55,000
So the portrayal of Saul is a raving and
paranoid man who's obsessed with David,

639
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:57,640
probably reflects the views of later.

640
00:38:57,641 --> 00:39:00,520
Writers who are apologists
for the house of David.

641
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:06,400
Positive views of Saul's character weren't
entirely extinguished by the biblical

642
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:08,330
writer. David, uh,

643
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:12,430
David's own lament when he
hears of Saul's death by, um,

644
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:17,460
by suicide and Jonathan's death also may
reflect Saul's tremendous popularity.

645
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,530
David orders the Judah Heights to sing
what's called the song of the bow in

646
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:28,510
praise of Saul. Your glory. Oh,
Israel lies slain on your heights.

647
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,780
How have the mighty
fallen Saul and Jonathan,

648
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,590
beloved and cherished never
parted in life or in death.

649
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,040
They were swifter than eagles.
They were stronger than lions.

650
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:43,480
Daughters of Israel weep over Saul
who closed you in Crimson and finery,

651
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,940
who decked your robes with jewels of gold.

652
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,580
How have the mighty fallen
in the thick of battle?

653
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,660
Jonathan slain on your heights. I
grieve for you. My brother Jonathan.

654
00:39:52,661 --> 00:39:55,930
You were most dear to me.
Your Love was wonderful to me.

655
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:58,990
More than the love of women.
How have the mighty fallen,

656
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,790
the weapons of war perished,

657
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:06,600
of course representing David as Bill
Wailing Saul and Jonathan in these terms

658
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:09,250
would have served and
apologetic function as well.

659
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:14,230
David is cleared of any part in or
even desire for the death of Saul.

660
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:19,870
So halfway through the book of Samuel
then, um, is the first part of,

661
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:23,770
of the story of David and his encounters
with saw running through to the end of

662
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:27,820
first Samuel and the first few chapters
of second Samuel about second Samuel

663
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:30,220
Five.
And this whole section,

664
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:35,221
this first part of the story of David
has the feel of a historical novel or um,

665
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,590
or narrative. It's it, there's lots
of direct speech and lots of dialogue.

666
00:40:39,591 --> 00:40:44,591
So it has the feel of a fiction of a novel
given that the ruling family in Judah

667
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:50,970
was referred to as the house of David
for several centuries and given a

668
00:40:51,731 --> 00:40:55,700
wonderful archeological find
dating from the ninth century. Um,

669
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,470
it's a Syrian inscription that
refers to the House of David.

670
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:02,800
I'm dating to the ninth century.
So given some of those, those,

671
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:03,940
those two pieces of evidence,

672
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:07,120
I think most scholars would
see David as a real person.

673
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:12,110
None of the details of the biblical
account can really be confirmed. Um,

674
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:16,330
of course. But I think the consensus
is that David was a real person.

675
00:41:16,331 --> 00:41:20,050
There are obviously some who do not hold
that and believe this is a much later

676
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:21,880
retro ejection vector rejection.

677
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:27,340
But David is surprisingly enough,
presented as very human.

678
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:32,680
He's not a divine character and he's
certainly not even a highly virtuous

679
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,553
character.

680
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,550
The first installment of his story through
about second Samuel five is clearly

681
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:40,250
sympathetic to David
and favorable to David,

682
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:43,550
but it's not entirely
obsequious or flattering,

683
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,840
which is the sort of genre that we very
often have coming out of an ancient near

684
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,730
eastern texts dealing with royalty.

685
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,360
This part of the story may
be an apology for David,

686
00:41:53,361 --> 00:41:57,470
but it's also subtly critical of him.
Certainly David is a hero,

687
00:41:57,471 --> 00:42:01,580
but if you read between the lines, he's
also an opportunist. He's an outlaw.

688
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,880
He serves as a mercenary for the
Philistines for some of the time,

689
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,370
and he can act pretty unscrupulously.

690
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:11,720
So this isn't royal propaganda
in the simple sense,

691
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:14,840
even though to some degree it
may be an apology for David.

692
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,800
As we're going to see in a minute,
David will fare much,

693
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:22,040
much worse in the second
installment of his story.

694
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:25,310
And this is the story that takes up
the bulk of second Samuel. Right.

695
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:29,750
So moving now into the book of Second
Samuel and the latter part of David's

696
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:32,920
story.
Um,

697
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,450
actually no,
I lied.

698
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:38,930
We're going to back up for one minute
just to talk about the different accounts

699
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:42,470
of Davidson merchants, right? The
three different stories, if you will,

700
00:42:42,471 --> 00:42:43,580
of David's discovery.

701
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:48,140
Because in the first Samuel again
secretly sort of annoyance, um,

702
00:42:48,141 --> 00:42:49,700
him king of Judah.
So it's a,

703
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:53,780
it's a private affair and he announced
them and now annoyance him as the king of

704
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:57,890
Judah, which is just the southern region.
Uh, and he does this installs lifetime.

705
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,250
David is the youngest of his father's son.

706
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,840
So this anointment is another
reversal of primogenitor,

707
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,780
the Xl Taishan of the lowly that
we see so often in the Bible.

708
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:10,850
In the second account,

709
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:15,740
we first meet David when he is summoned
to play music for a disturbed Saul who

710
00:43:15,741 --> 00:43:19,200
of course is suffering from
these irrational fits. Um,

711
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:23,070
and then in the third account, David
is introduced as the, you know,

712
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,750
98 pound weakling who takes
on the legendary Goliath.

713
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:29,210
Later after the death of Saul,

714
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:33,350
David will be anointed king in
Hebron over his own tribe, Judah.

715
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:38,360
He then manages to either win over or
kill off the rest of Saul's household.

716
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:43,361
Anyone else who could make a dynastic
claim to the throne based on descent from

717
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:44,680
saw a,

718
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:49,100
anyone who might be a threat to his
claim to kingship in the more northern

719
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:52,640
region. And eventually the northern
tribes will also elect him king.

720
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,590
And so the United kingship of the
northern parts of Israel and the,

721
00:43:57,591 --> 00:44:00,560
and the tribe of Judah is finally formed.

722
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:05,660
Once his reign seems secure and the
nation is consolidated behind him,

723
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:10,870
David then captures Jerusalem and launches
attacks against Israel's neighbors.

724
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:13,970
And the text says that the
Lord gives him victory.

725
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,780
This is in second Samuel eight now and um,
versus six and 14.

726
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:19,310
God gives him victory.

727
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:24,500
The Biblical narrative depicts them
as the master of a huge empire that

728
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:26,450
stretches from the desert to the sea.

729
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,070
There's very little evidence
that Israel actually, um,

730
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:33,990
established lasting control over
all of the states in this region.

731
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,310
It's likely that David was able to
take advantage of a power vacuum.

732
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:42,450
Egypt's hold on. Canaan was
crumbling. Um, the, again,

733
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:46,200
the migration of these peoples of the
seas throughout this region and other

734
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:49,710
people's pressing in from the desert
had really upset. And, um, uh,

735
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:54,360
the two major powers right in Mesopotamia
and in Egypt and they really had lost

736
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:56,430
control of the central region.
And so David was,

737
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,400
and the Israelites were able to take
advantage of this and establish an

738
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:00,390
independent state.

739
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,810
And David's independent state was
probably able to dominate the area for a

740
00:45:03,811 --> 00:45:07,650
little while. Um, ending the
Philistine threat, for example,

741
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:10,500
and possibly even collecting tribute
from some of the surrounding our

742
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:12,990
neighboring states.
I'm on and Moab and Itam,

743
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:19,460
but it's the prophet Nathan who
transmits God's promise to David,

744
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:26,120
a promise that will become the basis
for the faith in the eternity of the

745
00:45:26,401 --> 00:45:31,020
Davidic kingdom. And that happens
in Second Samuel Chapter seven,

746
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:32,610
verses eight to 17.

747
00:45:32,611 --> 00:45:37,611
Very important passage and very important
in the construction of what we'll see

748
00:45:37,621 --> 00:45:42,621
is a royal ideology or royal ideology
that comes to contest some of the basic

749
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:49,440
ideology of the nation. Thus says the
Lord of hosts. This is Nathan speaking.

750
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:53,010
Now I'm quoting God,
thus says the Lord of hosts.

751
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:57,750
I took you from the pasture from following
the sheep that you should be prince

752
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:58,441
over my people,

753
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:02,370
Israel and I have been with you wherever
you went and have cut off all your

754
00:46:02,371 --> 00:46:06,840
enemies from before you and I will make
for you a great name like the name of

755
00:46:06,841 --> 00:46:10,020
the great ones of the earth and I
will appoint a place for my people,

756
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:13,920
Israel and will plant them that they
may dwell in their own place and be

757
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:14,431
disturbed.

758
00:46:14,431 --> 00:46:18,930
No more and violent men shall afflict
them no more as formerly from the time

759
00:46:18,931 --> 00:46:20,850
that I appointed judges over my people,

760
00:46:20,851 --> 00:46:24,900
Israel and I will give you rest
from all your enemies. Moreover,

761
00:46:24,901 --> 00:46:27,480
the Lord declares to you that
the Lord will make you a house,

762
00:46:27,481 --> 00:46:28,620
meaning here dynasty.

763
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,710
When your days are fulfilled and
you lie down with your fathers,

764
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:35,430
I will raise up your offspring after you
who shall come forth from your body and

765
00:46:35,431 --> 00:46:38,610
I will establish his kingdom.
He shall build a house,

766
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,050
Ma meaning now he temple for my name
and I will establish the throne of his

767
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:46,860
kingdom forever. I will be his
father and he shall be my son.

768
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,750
When he commits iniquity,

769
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,920
I will chase in him with the rod of men
with the stripes of the sons of men,

770
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,820
but I will not take my steadfast
love from him as I took it from Saul,

771
00:46:56,821 --> 00:47:00,840
whom I put away from before you and your
house and your kingdom shall be made

772
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:02,100
sure forever before me.

773
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:07,920
Your throne shall be established forever
in accordance with all these words and

774
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:10,470
in accordance with all this vision.
Nathan spoke to David.

775
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:14,580
It's a very important passage and it's
with this passage that you have the idea

776
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:15,301
of an eternal,

777
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:19,980
an unconditional covenant between God
and the House of David or the dynasty of

778
00:47:19,981 --> 00:47:24,270
David. And this is now the fourth covenant
that we've met, the Noaa Hide Covenant,

779
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,950
the Patriarchal Covenant, the Synetic
Covenant, and now the Davidic covenant.

780
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:33,580
Note that God says that David and his
descendants may be punished for sin.

781
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:35,140
They certainly will be punished for sin,

782
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,490
but he will not take the kingdom
away from them as he did from Saul.

783
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:44,770
So God's oath to preserve the
Davidic dynasty. And by implication,

784
00:47:44,771 --> 00:47:47,260
we'll see later next
time Jerusalem as well,

785
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,270
would lead eventually to a popular belief
in the invincibility of the holy city.

786
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,220
In addition,

787
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:59,910
the belief in Israel's
ultimate deliverance from
enemies became bound up with

788
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:03,010
David and his dynasty.

789
00:48:03,011 --> 00:48:07,930
David was idealized by later biblical
and posts biblical tradition and became

790
00:48:07,931 --> 00:48:09,370
the paradigmatic king.

791
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:14,790
So even when the kingdom fell finally to
the Babylonians in five 86 the promise

792
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:17,230
to David's house was
believed to be eternal.

793
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:21,520
The community looked to the future for
a restoration of the Davidic line or a

794
00:48:21,521 --> 00:48:23,560
Davidic king or a messiah.

795
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:28,590
Now the Hebrew Word Messiah simply
means anointed one who is Mashiah is

796
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:33,190
anointed, okay, with the holy oil.

797
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:37,180
That's a reference to the fact that the
king was initiated into office by means

798
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,940
of holy oil being poured on his head.

799
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:43,510
So King David was the Messiah of God,

800
00:48:43,511 --> 00:48:47,590
the King anointed by or to God.
And in the exile,

801
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,050
Israelites would pray for another messiah,

802
00:48:50,051 --> 00:48:54,010
meaning another king from the House of
David appointed and anointed by God to

803
00:48:54,011 --> 00:48:59,011
rescue them from enemies and reestablish
them as a nation at peace in their land

804
00:48:59,591 --> 00:49:00,580
as David had done.

805
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,600
So the Jewish hope for a messiah be
speaking now in the post biblical so that

806
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,860
where it's correct to say Jewish,

807
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:09,880
the Jewish hope for a messiah was
thus always political and national and

808
00:49:09,881 --> 00:49:14,410
involved the restoration of the nation
in its land under a Davidic king.

809
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,510
We're going to talk next time about the
royal ideology that begins to emerge and

810
00:49:19,511 --> 00:49:22,630
challenge the older senate.
It can covenantal ideology,

811
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,280
but that's too much to get into now.

812
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,550
So we'll deal with that on Wednesday
and then move on through the rest of the

813
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,750
Deuteronomistic history.
