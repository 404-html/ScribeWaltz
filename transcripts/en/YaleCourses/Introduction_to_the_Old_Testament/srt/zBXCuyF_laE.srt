1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,840
So we were talking last time about the
Deuteronomistic historian and their

2
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:05,940
interpretation of the
events that befell Israel,

3
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:10,560
a very special interpretation that would
make it possible for Israel to remain

4
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:14,970
intact after the destruction of the state,
the temple in the national basis of,

5
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:19,830
of their society. And according to the
Deuteronomist, it's the sin of idolatry,

6
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:24,831
specifically the sin of idolatry and
particularly the idolatry of the king for

7
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:28,830
which the nation is punished
with exile and destruction.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,480
Punishments come for other sorts of sins,

9
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:34,840
but the national punishment of exile and
destruction follows upon the idolatry

10
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:39,090
and particularly the idolatry of the king.
So in the book of Second Kings,

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,770
a king who permits sacrifice only
at the Jerusalem temple is praise,

12
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:47,700
no matter what other faults
he may or may not have. Um,

13
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,620
and one who does not is condemned no
matter what other accomplishments he may

14
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:54,330
have to his credit.
Now,

15
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:58,080
the Deuteronomistic historian is aware
that the historical record doesn't lend

16
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:02,010
itself very easily to this kind of
interpretation because there are some good

17
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:06,660
kings who reigned very briefly and there
are some very bad kings on their view

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,360
who reigned for a very long time.
And now she has a case in point.

19
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:13,380
He reigned for over 50 years and is
viewed as the most wicked of all kings.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,920
Sometimes disaster would strike right
after the rule of the king that the

21
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,810
deuteronomist would view as a good king
because of their faithfulness to way.

22
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,440
And sometimes, uh, uh, it,

23
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,730
it would not strike after the rule of a,

24
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:28,620
of a king that was
viewed to be very wicked.

25
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,210
So the Deuteronomistic sounds
the theme of delayed punishment,

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,930
delayed punishment, deferred
punishment. So for example,

27
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,350
Solomon's misdeeds in allowing
the building of altars
for the worship of foreign

28
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:44,250
gods to please his,

29
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:48,870
his many wives is foreign wives is
blamed for the division of the kingdoms,

30
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:52,380
but the punishment was deferred until
after his death and the time of his sons.

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,400
And then you have the split between north
and south with Jeroboam and Rehoboam,

32
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,190
um, raining respectively
in the north and south.

33
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,170
The deuteronomist sees Israel's defeat
at the hands of the Assyrians in seven 22

34
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:09,150
as deferred or delayed punishment for
the sins of Jeroboam. The first Jeroboam,

35
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:10,800
the first nine 22 or so,

36
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,180
came to the throne and installed to
cultic centers at Dan and Bethel erecting

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,610
golden calves.
Uh,

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,480
this is seen as a sin for which the
nation was punished 200 years later.

39
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,210
As for the southern Kingdom of Judah,

40
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,770
he had some good kings in the view of
the deuteronomist in the south has a Kia.

41
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,390
He's judged to be a good king.

42
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:35,100
He instituted sweeping reforms and got
rid of idolatrous altars and manage to

43
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:39,510
maintain Judas independence against
the Assyrians. But his son, Manasseh,

44
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:43,560
who reigned for a large part
of the seventh century is
viewed as extraordinarily

45
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:48,510
wicked. He turned the Jerusalem temple
into a, um, a pagan temple and, uh,

46
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:51,950
it was a time of, of, uh, great
misery for those who are loyal to,

47
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,430
to Yaffe way time of great terror.
And yet he reigned a long time.

48
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,240
His eight year old grandson,
Josiah, uh, came to the throne in a,

49
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:04,120
upon his death sometime
probably in the six thirties.

50
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,510
And the Deuteronomistic
views Josiah as a good king.

51
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:12,511
We've already heard about the story which
is reported in second kings chapter 22

52
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,370
of the refurbishing of the temple,

53
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:19,630
which happens when he's
about 25 or 26 years old,

54
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,730
discovers a book of the law,
reads it,

55
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:24,400
and is distressed because it's
terms are not being fulfilled.

56
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,970
And so Josiah orders the abolition
of outlying altars and Pagan Colts.

57
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:33,100
He brings all of the priests to Jerusalem
and centralizes all worship there in

58
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:36,130
Jerusalem. Uh, so in
the deuteronomist view,

59
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:40,120
Josiah is believed to be very good
king for purging the country of these

60
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:42,640
idolatrous rights and
centralizing worship.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,260
But the thin of Monash IA was too
great and it had to be punished.

62
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,800
So I profit tests a profit tests named
Holda tells desire that God plans to

63
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:57,070
bring evil punishment on Judah for it,
for these sins.

64
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,390
But it will be after Josiah is lifetime
as, as something of a mercy to him.

65
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,740
And in fact, it's in the next
generation that Judah falls in five 86,

66
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:11,130
the walls of Jerusalem are breached and
the temple is destroyed and the king at

67
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,860
that time, King Zedekiah
is blinded and, uh,

68
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,900
taken in chains into exile with his
court and only the poor are left behind.

69
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,560
This is the deuteronomist attempt to
account for these anomalies within their

70
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,810
Historia sophic view,
right?

71
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,560
And the result of the Deuteronomistic
interpretation was remarkable because if

72
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:38,440
the defeat of the nation where to be
seen as the defeat of the nations,

73
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:40,780
God by the God of the conquering nation,

74
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,700
then the Israelites would have turned
from the worship of their god, Yahweh,

75
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,710
and embraced the new ascendent God Marduk.

76
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,820
And undoubtedly there were
Israelites who did do this, right?

77
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:54,550
That would have been the argument
of history in their view,

78
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,930
but not all did for some defeat,

79
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,760
did not lead to despair or apostasy
because it could be explained by the likes

80
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,810
of the Deuteronomistic,

81
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,430
a historian or the Deuteronomistic
school as fitting into the monotheistic

82
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:10,810
scheme,
right?

83
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:15,340
This did not impugn God's kingship
or Lordship over the universe.

84
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:19,840
It was proof of it. God was punishing
Israel for the sin of idolatry,

85
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:23,260
which was in violation of his
covenant and to punish Israel.

86
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:26,350
He had raised the Babylonians.
They were merely his tool.

87
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,090
The historiography of the Deuteronomistic
historian finds its classic expression

88
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:34,100
in second kings chapter 17.
Um,

89
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,180
I'm going to skim through sections of it
so you can see the argument that's laid

90
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:42,010
out there. In the ninth year of Jose,
the king of Assyria captured some area,

91
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:44,890
the capital of the northern kingdom.
He deported the Israelites,

92
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,430
the Israelites to Syria and
settled them in various places.

93
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,670
And this happened because the
Israelites sinned against the Lord,

94
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:54,760
their God who had freed them from the
land of Egypt, from the hand of Pharaoh,

95
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:56,980
King of Egypt.
They worshiped other gods,

96
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,650
followed the customs which the kings
of Israel had practiced, putting again,

97
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:03,260
the blame and the kings as the,
as the head of this idolatry,

98
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,130
the Israelites committed against the
Lord their God acts which were not right.

99
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,060
They built for themselves shrines and
all their settlements from watchtowers to

100
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,050
fortified cities.

101
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,220
They set up pillars and sacred posts
for themselves on every lofty hill and

102
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,750
under every leafy tree,

103
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,800
and they offered sacrifices there at all
the shrines like the nation's whom the

104
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:23,810
Lord had driven into exile before them.

105
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,660
So now he's going to follow through since
they behave the same way to drive them

106
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:27,740
into exile.
Also,

107
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,700
they committed wicked acts to vex
the Lord and they worshiped fetishes

108
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:34,430
concerning which the Lord had said
to them, you must not do this thing.

109
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,950
The Lord warned Israel and Judah
by every profit in every sear.

110
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,620
So God didn't just stand by idly.
He was constantly sending profits,

111
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:45,500
messengers to tell them to turn back
to the covenant and we'll start talking

112
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:46,640
about those profits today.

113
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,330
He sent warnings by every prophet
and every senior are saying,

114
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,570
turn back from your wicked ways and
observe my commandments and my laws

115
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:56,600
according to all the teaching that
I commanded your fathers and that I

116
00:06:56,601 --> 00:07:00,140
transmitted to you through my servants,
the prophets. But they didn't obey.

117
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,440
They stiffen their neck.

118
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:04,310
It's like their fathers who did not
have faith in the Lord their God.

119
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,730
They spurned his laws and the covenant
that he had made with their fathers and

120
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:11,660
the warnings he had given them. They
went after delusion and we're diluted.

121
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,780
They made Moulton idols for themselves.
Two calves,

122
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,740
the specifically now the sin of, of
Jeroboam at Dan and Bethel, two calves,

123
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,280
and they made a sacred post and they
bowed down to all the hosts of heaven and

124
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:24,680
they worshiped by aisle.
We'll hear more about that today.

125
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,680
They can sign their sons
and daughters to the fire.

126
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,550
They practiced augury and divination
and gave themselves over to what was

127
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:35,270
displeasing to the Lord and Vex Tim.
The Lord was incensed it Israel,

128
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:36,770
and he banished them from his presence.

129
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,110
None was left with the
tribe of Judah alone,

130
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,870
but nor did Judah keep the
commandments of the Lord their God.

131
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,270
They followed the customs
that Israel had practiced,

132
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,290
so the Lord spurned all the offspring
of Israel and he afflicted them and

133
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:52,250
delivered them into the
hands of plunderers and
finally he cast them out from

134
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:53,084
his presence.

135
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,080
It's a very depressing ending of things
that started so auspiciously back in

136
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:59,580
genesis one.
But if the Deuteronomy,

137
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:03,620
this laid the blame for the tragic
history of the two kingdoms at the door of

138
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:07,250
the sin of idolatry, in particularly
the idolatry of the royal house,

139
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,820
a different answer will be provided
by Israel's classical profits.

140
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:11,571
No less than answer,

141
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:14,510
no lesson interpretation and the lesson
interpretation that was intended to

142
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:18,860
shore up faith in this God that one
might think had abandoned his people.

143
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,890
And we'll be turning to the
prophetic answer to this,

144
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,590
to this great crisis
that face the Israelites.

145
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,990
In the next lecture in this lecture,

146
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:30,440
I first want to talk about the phenomenon
of prophecy and some of the profits

147
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:33,320
who appear in the historical narrative.

148
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:38,350
So in the historical books that we've
been looking at of the section of the

149
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:41,420
Bible, we call the former prophets.
Remember this section called the profits.

150
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,240
We divide into former
prophets ladder profits.

151
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,360
The section we call former
profits as a historical narrative.

152
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,510
It runs from Joshua through second kings.
It reads like a narrative.

153
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,160
And in that material,

154
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:56,820
you have several prophets who appear and
they play a very role in the national

155
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,940
drama,
the profits of the 10th century,

156
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:04,620
the Ninth Century BCE.
We're associated with religious shrines.

157
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:07,290
On occasion they were
associated with the royal court.

158
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,990
But starting in about the eighth century,

159
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,060
you have profits whose words were
eventually sat down and writing,

160
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:20,270
and they come to be in the books that
now bear the names of the profits to whom

161
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:25,110
they are attributed. Um, so these profits,

162
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,080
the ones whose words get recorded
in books that bear their name,

163
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,060
these profits we call the literary profits
or the classical prophets in contrast

164
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,530
to the prophets who are characters in
the stories that we read from Genesis

165
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:41,090
through second kings, right? So
there are two kinds of profits. Um,

166
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,070
the literary profits,
those books are collected together.

167
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:47,700
In the section we call the latter
prophets. I hope this is making sense.

168
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,530
So former profits is the historical
narrative which happens to feature king's

169
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:55,800
and profits as characters in the
narrative, the latter profits.

170
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,810
Those are the books of Prophetic oracles
that bear the name of the person who

171
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:05,700
gave the utterance or the
Oracle. Okay. And as I just said,

172
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:09,180
the literary profits just like the
deuteronomist struggle to make sense of

173
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:13,770
Israel suffering and defeat and to come
up with an explanation and a message of

174
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:16,680
constellation and we will
get to that next time.

175
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,960
Today we'll look at the phenomenon of
prophecy in ancient Israel by comparing or

176
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:25,080
examining narratives in Samuel and kings,

177
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:29,190
particularly narratives that feature
profits and that will provide very

178
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:33,210
important background for the next
lecture when we turn to the books of the

179
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:36,360
literary or classical prophets
and the themes of that literature.

180
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,650
Now prophecy is very widespread
in the ancient near east.

181
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,180
It took different forms in different
societies, but ultimately very widespread.

182
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:49,800
We know of ecstatic profits
from second Millennium Bce,

183
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:52,190
texts in Mesopotamia.
Um,

184
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,520
seventh century is Syria
also have ecstatic profits.

185
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,110
Their primary focus was on,
um,

186
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,250
delivering oracles for kings.

187
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Usually favorable was always wise to
give a favorable oracle to your king.

188
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,210
Um, and we have ecstatic prophecy in the
Bible also among the earliest profits.

189
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:13,044
In particular,

190
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,940
the term ecstasy when it's used in this
context refers to the state of being

191
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:20,970
overcome with such powerful emotions.

192
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,880
That reason seems to be suspended.

193
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:27,810
Self control is suspended. What
we might think of as, you know,

194
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,290
normative behavior, these things,
normal behavior, these are suspended.

195
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,180
Ecstatics would employ music
and dance. They would, um,

196
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,540
they would induce a sort of emotional
seizure or a frenzy and they would often

197
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,740
be left riving and raving.

198
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,250
And the Bible attributes this kind of
ecstatic state to the spirit of the Lord.

199
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:53,410
The spirit of Galloway which falls upon
a profit or Russia's upon a prophet

200
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:58,411
comes upon a profit and transforms
him then into some sort of carrier or

201
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:01,690
instrument of the divine
will or the divine message.

202
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,680
We'll see that we have bizarre
behavior among many of the profits.

203
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:10,550
We even have bizarre behavior among
many of the later literary profits. Um,

204
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,770
Zko for example, we'll engage in
all kinds of unusual, outrageous,

205
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:18,760
dramatic behavior as a vehicle for
the communication of his message.

206
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:23,050
And I think this is the heritage of the
ecstatic prophecy that was so much a

207
00:12:23,051 --> 00:12:26,050
part of ancient near east and prophecy.
But not all.

208
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:28,630
Biblical prophecy has
this ecstatic character.

209
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,660
The Hebrew word for profit is a Navi.

210
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,980
And then the word [inaudible]
seems to mean one who is called,

211
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,010
or perhaps one who announces that's
important because it signals to us that a

212
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:44,860
prophet is someone who is
called to proclaim a message,

213
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:48,130
to announce something called
by God to carry a message.

214
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:53,340
And so in the Bible we have
this phenomenon of what we
call epistolic prophecy.

215
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,170
And Apostle is merely a messenger.

216
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:58,960
The word apostle means messenger
one sent with a message.

217
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,250
So at Apostolic Prophecy,
this refers to messenger profits.

218
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:05,830
They are called by God and
charged with a mission.

219
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,560
They can even be elected
against their will.

220
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,890
They must bring the word
of God to the world.

221
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,240
This is very different from profits
who are consulted by a client, right?

222
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:20,350
And given a fee to divine something,
this is different.

223
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:25,150
This is the deity. Now charging
a profit with a message, uh, to,

224
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:25,984
to a people.

225
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,000
So these epistolic profits are represented
in the Bible as the instrument of

226
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:35,410
God's desire to reveal himself and
to reveal his will to his people.

227
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,600
And many scholars have
noted that in a way. Um,

228
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,240
Moses is really the first in a long
line of apostolic prophets in the Bible.

229
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,330
And in some ways his
call and his response,

230
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,100
our parodic matic for some of
these later classical prophets,

231
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,350
in many of the literary
profits you will read,

232
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,070
they will contain some account
of their call, you know,

233
00:13:57,071 --> 00:14:00,040
have this sudden dramatic
encounter with God.

234
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:04,930
Usually the call consists of certain,
um, uh, standard, uh, stages.

235
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,810
You first have this
unexpected encounter with God,

236
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,330
maybe a vision of some kind or a voice,
um,

237
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,440
that issues in a summons or a calling.

238
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,340
And then you have the
reluctance of the individual.

239
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,570
And that was also paradigmatic with Moses,
wasn't it the,

240
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,530
the reluctance of the individual
concerned to answer this,

241
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:28,400
but ultimately the individual is
overwhelmed and eventually surrenders to,

242
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:32,350
to God and his persuasiveness. That
happens in many of the prophetic books.

243
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,030
So in the Bible,

244
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:38,230
this kind of epistolic prophecy is a
little different from ecstatic prophecy.

245
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,630
It's also distinct from divination.

246
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Divination is an attempt to
uncover the divine through some,

247
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,010
um, technique or excuse me, the
divine will through some technique,

248
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,890
perhaps the manipulation
of certain substances,

249
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,120
perhaps inspecting the end trails
of a sacrificed animal. Um,

250
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:04,210
divination of this type as well as sorcery
and spell casting and consulting with

251
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:09,110
ghosts and spirits are all
condemned by Deuteronomy.

252
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,530
This is very important part of the
Deuteronomistic diatribe against the

253
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:14,000
practices of other nations,

254
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:19,250
but the fact that Deuteronomy polemicizing
so vehemently against these practices

255
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,600
is a sure sign that they were practiced.
You know,

256
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,900
they were practiced at a popular level.
This is probably what is related.

257
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:30,140
Judy and religion consisted of to some
degree and some of you will be looking in

258
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:32,780
section,
I know at the story of the witch of endor,

259
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,550
right when Saul goes to a witch to conjure
up the spirit of the ghost to Samuel

260
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:39,860
to, to consult with him. Um,

261
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:44,690
moreover we do have divination
in the outweigh cult itself,

262
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,720
but this was performed by priests.

263
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,930
They consulted some sort of divinely,
um,

264
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,560
designated or Rachid
[inaudible] object or objects.

265
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:56,780
We call these the RM and the term him,

266
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,420
which should be familiar
to all of you here at Yale,

267
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,380
but [inaudible] are usually untranslated
in your texts because actually we don't

268
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:06,830
really know what they mean. They might be
related to the word for light, which is,

269
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:10,580
or, and the, the word for, um, you
know, integrity perhaps or perfection,

270
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:14,600
which is Tom. So it might be, it's
probably something like Abracadabra,

271
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,710
a little bit of a nonsense syllable that
plays on words that did have meaning.

272
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,950
We don't really know what
the ORM and tuning word,

273
00:16:20,951 --> 00:16:22,700
but they are said to be assigned by God.

274
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:26,150
We think they may have been colored stones
that were manipulated in some way by

275
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,330
the priest to give a yes or a
no determination to a question.

276
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,770
But these are said to be assigned by God
as a means that he himself authorizes

277
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,420
for defining his will. And so the
Deuteronomistic steps accepts these,

278
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:43,550
but in general it's the view of the
Deuteronomistic historian that divination

279
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:46,160
sorcery and the like
are not only prohibited,

280
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:48,230
they're quite distinct from
the activity of profits.

281
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,420
That's not what the profits were about.

282
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:53,240
According to the Deuteronomistic
a representation,

283
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:59,710
the Hebrew prophet wasn't primarily a
fortune teller and I think this is a very

284
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:02,480
common misconception.
The Navi,

285
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:07,460
the Prophet was addressing a very
specific historical situation and was

286
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:09,890
addressing it in very concrete terms.

287
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,280
He was revealing God's immediate
intentions as a response to the present

288
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:16,850
circumstances.

289
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:21,680
And the purpose of doing this was
to inspire the people to change, to,

290
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,200
to come back to faithful
observance of the covenant.

291
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,740
Any predictions that the profit might
make had reference to the immediate future

292
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:34,340
as a response to the present situation.
So in reality,

293
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:38,330
the profits message was a message
about the present. What is wrong now?

294
00:17:38,331 --> 00:17:43,130
What has to be done to avert the
impending doom or two n to avert a future

295
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:47,360
calamity. There were some
women prophets in Israel, um,

296
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,770
none of them are found
among the literary profits.

297
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:53,220
That is to say none of those books bearing
the names of the prophets who uttered

298
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:55,470
the oracles in them are named for women.

299
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,690
So we have no women among
the literary profits,

300
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:02,060
but you do have prophetic or prophesizing
women besides Miriam and the pen to

301
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:02,550
Tuk.

302
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:07,550
There's also Debra who was a tribal leader
and a profit featured in judges four

303
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:09,390
and five.
I mentioned Holda.

304
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:14,220
Her advice is sought during the reign of
King Josiah and you also have no idea,

305
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,680
no idea prophesied in
the post exit periods.

306
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:20,790
So this doesn't seem to
be limited to two males.

307
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,760
Prophecy and kingship are
closely connected in ancient
Israel and this is going

308
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:30,120
to be very important.
You'll recall first of all,

309
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:33,930
that the king is the anointed
one of Yahweh and it's the
prophet who's doing the

310
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:34,764
anointing.

311
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:39,450
And that makes the connection between
kingship and prophecy quite strong.

312
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,940
If you think about
Israel's first two kings,

313
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:44,910
you also see a strong link with
the phenomenon of prophecy.

314
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,890
The first King Saul who was anointed
by the Prophet Samuel is in addition,

315
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:54,520
said to have prophesied himself in the
manner of the ecstatic profits. Um,

316
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,650
when he is anointed king,
he's then seized by the spirit of Yahweh.

317
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,940
He joins a band of men. And this
is in First Samuel 10, verse five,

318
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:07,410
there playing Harp, tambourine,
flute and liar. And he joins them.

319
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:08,820
And this induces a,

320
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,170
an ecstatic frenzy or religious frenzy
that transforms him into another man

321
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,580
according to the text. And on another
occasion, during his ecstatic prophesying,

322
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:19,080
Saul strips himself naked.

323
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,680
We have other accounts in the Bible of
ecstatic prophets who would engage in

324
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:24,990
self laceration.
David,

325
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:28,260
the second king is also
said to prophesize himself.

326
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:32,490
He also receives the Holy Spirit
or charisma from time to time,

327
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:34,650
in addition to being
anointed by a prophet.

328
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,130
Subsequent monarchs aren't
said to prophesied themselves.

329
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:39,850
So that ends really with David.

330
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:43,860
It's only Saul and David who are
among the prophets. But um, even so,

331
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,850
those subsequent profits do not.
The monarchs do not themselves prophesied.

332
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,180
The connection with prophecy remains very,

333
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:55,650
very close and it's exemplified
in several ways. Again,

334
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,910
profits not only anoint kings, but they
also announced their fall from power,

335
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,230
right? They are king makers and
king breakers to some degree. Also,

336
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:08,520
you have a remarkable motif that runs
through so much of biblical narrative.

337
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,330
And that's the Motif of
prophetic opposition to kings.

338
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:17,460
Every king had his prophetic thorn
in his side. So you have, uh,

339
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,510
Samuel against saw, right?
You have Nathan against King.

340
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:25,890
David will talk about him a bit later. You
have other prophets, Elijah, of course,

341
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,810
against Ahab.

342
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:31,790
My Kia against Ahab Have Alicia
against the House of Ahab. Um,

343
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,950
Jeremiah is going to a soup
stand against the king, uh,

344
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,690
quite the quite dramatically. So that
prophetic opposition to the monarch,

345
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:40,351
to the king,

346
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:44,520
sort of God's watchdog over the king
is an important theme throughout the

347
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:46,620
stories of the form of profits,
right?

348
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:50,800
It sets and it sets a stage for us to
understand the writings of the named

349
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:51,940
profits that will come later.

350
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,270
Those are very often given in opposition
to official policy or royal policy.

351
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,290
And very often you have
this sort of literary motif
that introduces the profits.

352
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,560
Opposition.
The word of the Lord came to x,

353
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:08,320
profit x against why? Against King, why?

354
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,920
And then you get the content of it because
you have sinned. I will destroy you.

355
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:14,530
I will rest of the kingship
from you and so on.

356
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,520
So I want to take a quick look though
at some of the roles that are played by

357
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:23,410
profits in the stories and Samuel and
kings and I have them listed over on the

358
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,950
far side of the board. The first thing
I want to consider is the notion of um,

359
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,860
what I call yes men.
Um,

360
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:34,600
as opposed to true profits
like the kings of Assyria,

361
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:40,290
the kings of Israel and Judah found
it politic to employ prophetic gilts.

362
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:42,130
And in many cases,

363
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:47,370
these court prophets who were in the
king's employ were little more than

364
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:49,600
endorsers of royal policy.

365
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,920
So on numerous occasions we
see these professional profits,

366
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:58,921
these royal profits at odds with figures
that the biblical writer will view as

367
00:21:59,171 --> 00:22:00,070
true profits.

368
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,940
They are truly for claiming the word of
God and not just endorsing royal policy.

369
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,430
And they proclaim it whether the
king wants to hear it or not,

370
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:11,020
whether the people want to hear it or not.
And the classic example is my Kale,

371
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,760
the son of Emma.
My Kia prophesies the truth from your way,

372
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:19,570
even though it displeases the king and
ultimately is going to cost him his

373
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:23,770
freedom. I'm not to be confused
with Micah, my chaos. Uh,

374
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,970
his story is told in first kings 22.
Uh,

375
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,200
this story is, um, uh, pointed
critique of the prophetic.

376
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,260
Yes men who are serving as court profits
for and automatically endorse the

377
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:39,160
policy of King Ahab.

378
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:43,150
He's the king in the northern Kingdom
of Israel in the ninth century.

379
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,220
And during King Ahab Rain,

380
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,420
the kingdoms of the north and the south
of Israel and Judah have decided to form

381
00:22:49,421 --> 00:22:50,254
an alliance.

382
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,740
They want to try to recapture some of
the territory that has been lost to the

383
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:55,150
north territory in Syria.

384
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,840
But you didn't undertake any military
expedition without first obtaining a

385
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:02,950
favorable word from the Lord.

386
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,980
So King Ahab's profits and he has 400
of them and they're called and the king

387
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,180
asks them,
shall I?

388
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:14,050
March upon remote Gilliad this is
this region in the north for battle,

389
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,450
or shall I not?
March they said,

390
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,300
and the Lord will deliver it
into Your Majesty's hands.

391
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,420
So we see that prophecy
here is an institution,

392
00:23:22,421 --> 00:23:25,000
it's functioning as a
source of royal advice,

393
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,030
but the king of Judah Kings Jehoshaphat's,

394
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:32,410
he had been perhaps hoping for an
oracle against the campaign and he says,

395
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,280
isn't there another prophet of the
Lord here through whom we can inquire?

396
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,900
And the king of Israel
answered Jehoshaphat's there
is one more man through whom

397
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:42,310
we can inquire of the Lord,

398
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:46,970
but I hate him because he never prophesies
anything about me. Only disaster.

399
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,650
My Kia son of [inaudible],

400
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:54,550
well Jehoshaphat insists and my Kia is
summit and he's worn by the Messenger who

401
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:59,750
summons him that he better
speak a favorable word like
all the other prophets.

402
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:03,170
The Messenger says the words of the
prophets with one accord are favorable to

403
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:07,460
the king. Let your word be like the
word of one of them and speak favorably.

404
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:11,930
It's almost an open admission that the
profits are in a little more than yes men.

405
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:16,160
So my Kia answers the king's question
when he asks about the advisability of

406
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:19,700
marching to the north and he says,
March and triumph,

407
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:22,160
the Lord will deliver it
into Your Majesty's hands.

408
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,760
He's done what he's been told to do, give
the same answer as the other prophets.

409
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,640
But he doesn't use the prophetic formula.
He doesn't say,

410
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:33,641
thus says the Lord or some
other indication that he's
had a vision that he's

411
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:37,040
prophesying that is actually
conveying the word of the Lord.

412
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,270
And the king seems to sense this. And
since this deception, and he says,

413
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,650
how many times must die Jura you to tell
me nothing but the truth in the name of

414
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,920
the Lord. So my Kale, it's the king habit.

415
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,130
And he tells of this vision
that he received from God,

416
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:56,260
a vision of Israel scattered among
of, sorry, of, of, of, of uh,

417
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,280
of Israel scattered over hills like
sheep. So he's seeing sheep, right?

418
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,400
Without a shepherd.

419
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,420
The implication being that Israel's
Sheppard who was the king is going to be

420
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:10,040
killed in battle. And like
the sheep spread on the hill,
Israel will be scattered.

421
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,110
So the king is very irritated
by my k is prophecy. He says,

422
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:17,900
didn't I tell you he would not
prophesied good fortune for me,

423
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:19,040
but only misfortune.

424
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,460
What's interesting is in the
section that follows my k,

425
00:25:23,461 --> 00:25:27,110
it gives an explanation for
why he is the lone dissenter.

426
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,980
He doesn't accuse the other
profits of being false prophets.

427
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:36,010
He represents them instead as being
misled and is being misled by God if you

428
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:41,810
will. So for the second time my
Kia utters the word of the Lord.

429
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:46,811
He has a second vision and this vision
is a vision of God who is seated on the

430
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:52,010
throne and the host of heaven are
gathered around him and God asks,

431
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:57,170
who will entice Ahab so that he will
march and fall at Ramos Gilliad and a

432
00:25:57,171 --> 00:25:58,940
certain one, uh, comes forward.

433
00:25:58,941 --> 00:26:02,600
He volunteers for this task and he tells
me how he's going to do this. He says,

434
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:07,130
I will go out and be a lying spirit
in the mouth of all his prophets.

435
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,690
God says, you will entice and you
will prevail. Go out and do it.

436
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,960
So my Kia concludes this vision by saying,

437
00:26:14,961 --> 00:26:18,470
and so the Lord has put a lying spirit
in the mouth of all these profits of

438
00:26:18,471 --> 00:26:23,450
yours. For the Lord has decreed disaster
upon you. It's all part of God's plan.

439
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:26,480
God is setting up a hub for disaster,

440
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:29,770
presumably as punishment
for his many sins. Justice.

441
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,730
He set up pharaoh by hardening his heart
so that he would be punished. Um, and uh,

442
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,510
hardening his heart against Moses is
pleased to let these are lights go.

443
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:42,200
This is God's way of ensuring their
demise, ensuring their punishment.

444
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,440
Kings a little upset.
He doesn't know whom to believe.

445
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,640
So he doesn't kill my Kia on the spot.
He imprisons him,

446
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,500
he puts them on rations
of bread and water. Um,

447
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,230
just to see what the outcome
of the battle will be first.

448
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,570
And my k agrees to this.
He says,

449
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,230
if you ever come home safe and the
Lord has not spoken through me,

450
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:05,140
his prophecy proves
accurate. Of course. Um,

451
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:09,030
the king tries to disguise himself so
that no one will know that he is king and

452
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:11,970
no one will be able to target him in
the battle. So he disguises himself.

453
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,050
Nevertheless, he's killed in the
battle and his army scatters.

454
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,920
The story of my Kia is polemicizing
against what the biblical writer perceived

455
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:28,601
to be the nationalization or the
cooptation of the prophetic guild.

456
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:33,550
And in the process it paints a
portrait of what the true profit, uh,

457
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,493
looks like.

458
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:39,150
My Kia is someone who is
determined to deliver God's word,

459
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,000
even if it's opposed to, um, the,

460
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:45,420
the wishes of the king or the view of
the king and the view of the majority.

461
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:48,960
He's going to proclaim God's judgment
and it will be a judgment against the

462
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:52,860
nation. It will be a message of
doom. And interestingly enough,

463
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:57,510
this will eventually become understood
as the mark of a true prophet.

464
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,440
The prophet of doom is the one who is
the true profit. Um, as you can imagine,

465
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:05,190
this kind of negativity, and it didn't
sit well with established interests,

466
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:07,800
but at a later point in time,
looking back,

467
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,670
the tradition would single out some of
these profits as the ones who had spoken

468
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:15,220
truly. So that's one role. The
true profit stands up against the,

469
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:19,830
the Prophetic Gilds, the prophets who are
employed by the Kings, um, by the kings.

470
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:24,930
A second role that we see profits
playing in this section of historical

471
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:27,870
narrative.
We see profits as God's zealots.

472
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:34,020
And here again, there's a contrast
between true prophets and false prophets.

473
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,970
You find it particularly in those zealous,
Yahweh's Elijah and Elijah.

474
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,700
The Elijah stories are found in first
kings chapter 17 through 19 and 21 first

475
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:48,660
kings 17 through 19 and 21.

476
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:52,500
The Elijah stories appear towards
the beginning of second kings,

477
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,740
chapters two through nine a
little bit in a chapter 13.

478
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,900
These materials are good examples,
again of independent units of tradition,

479
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:04,620
popular stories that were incorporated
into the Deuteronomistic history.

480
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:10,410
They're highly folkloristic.
They have lots of drama and color,

481
00:29:10,411 --> 00:29:11,520
plenty of miracles.

482
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:16,550
Animals who behave in interesting ways
that this material began as a set of folk

483
00:29:18,211 --> 00:29:22,320
stories is also suggested by the fact
that there's a great deal of overlap in

484
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:24,870
the depiction of the
activities of the two profits.

485
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,290
So you have both of the profits.
I'm multiplying food.

486
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:31,650
Both of them predict the death of
Ahab's, queen, Queen Jezza Bell,

487
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:36,720
both of them part water and so on.
But in their final form,

488
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:41,750
the stories have been interspersed with
historical footnotes about two profits

489
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,020
and then set into this framework,

490
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:47,740
this larger framework of the history
of the kings of the northern kingdom.

491
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,190
So they've been appropriated
by the Deuteronomistic school,

492
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,540
which remember is a southern Judy
and based Deuteronomistic school. Um,

493
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,420
they've been appropriated for
its purposes, which include, um,

494
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,140
a strong condemnation of the northern
kingdom of Israel and, and her kings as,

495
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:09,280
as idolatrous. So Elijah,
Elijah the Tishbite,

496
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:12,190
which means that he comes from
the city of Tish Bay in Gilliad,

497
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:16,210
which is the other side of the Jordan.
Elijah is a very dramatic character.

498
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:19,120
He comes across the Jordan,

499
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:22,840
he's dressed in a garment of
hair and the leather girdle.

500
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,520
At the end of his story, he's sort of
whisked away. One of the king's servants,

501
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:29,380
surmises by the wind of God.

502
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:33,310
He does battle with the
cult of Baal and Asherah.

503
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:38,140
We Associate Alijah most with the battle
with the cult of bile and ashy raw.

504
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:42,850
This had been introduced by King Ahab
to please his bow. We're shipping queen,

505
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:46,390
Queen Jezza bow.
And as his first act,

506
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:51,610
Alijah announces a draft. Yeah, announces
a drought in the name of Yaffe way.

507
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,960
Now this is a direct challenge to bow
because bio is believed to control the

508
00:30:55,961 --> 00:30:56,321
rain.

509
00:30:56,321 --> 00:31:01,321
He's believed to control the general
fertility of the land and and life itself.

510
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,760
So ally just purpose is presumably to
show that it is your way and not by all

511
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:08,410
who controls fertility.

512
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,520
We have very good evidence that bow
was in fact worshiped in the northern

513
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:14,230
kingdom,
right down to the destruction.

514
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:16,390
This is something we've
touched on earlier as well.

515
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:21,780
It's quite possible that Israelites in
the northern kingdom saw no real conflict

516
00:31:22,601 --> 00:31:25,450
between the cult of bile
and the cult of [inaudible].

517
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,880
But in the Elijah story,

518
00:31:27,881 --> 00:31:32,770
the Deuteronomistic historian represents
these two cults as being championed by

519
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:35,110
exclusivist.
It's one or the other.

520
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,840
Jessebelle Ahab's queen kept a retinue
of 450 by all profits and was killing off

521
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:45,640
the profits of Galloway,
right? And by the same token,

522
00:31:45,641 --> 00:31:47,980
Elijah is equally zealous for Galloway.

523
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:51,960
He refuses to tolerate the worship
of any God but Yaffe way. Um,

524
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,750
and he performs miracles constantly in
the name of your way to show that it is

525
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:59,500
yeah, halfway and not bow who
gives life. For example, he, um,

526
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,210
he raises a dead child.

527
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:05,230
He multiplies oil and flour and so on
all of this in the name of the Lord to

528
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:09,460
show that it is your way and not
by al who has true power. Um,

529
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:12,250
but as I've mentioned
before, there are some, um,

530
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:16,990
some scholars who argue that biblical
religion, again as opposed to Israelite,

531
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:20,650
Judy and religion, what actual people
were doing in Israel and Judea.

532
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,640
That's one thing. But Biblical religion,
which is this exclusive, I'm yeah,

533
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:26,740
wisdom or the tendency towards monotheism.

534
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,340
There are some who believe that that
biblical religion originated in the

535
00:32:30,341 --> 00:32:34,960
activity of zealous prophets like Elijah
and Elisha in the north doing battle

536
00:32:34,961 --> 00:32:39,620
with the, with the bout with bile worship.
Um, after the fall of the kingdom,

537
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:40,460
those traditions,

538
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:44,030
those Yahweh only traditions came south
and were eventually absorbed in the

539
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:48,290
Deuteronomistic school. So this
in fact, maybe the origin of, of,

540
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:53,240
of some of this is this Jaqui only party
represented by figures like Elijah and

541
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:57,380
Elisha.
The conflict between the two cults,

542
00:32:57,381 --> 00:33:02,240
the outweigh cult and the bowel called
reaches a climax in the story in first

543
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:04,850
kings 18 is wonderful story in which,
uh,

544
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:09,860
Elijah challenges the prophets of
Baal and Asherah to it contest.

545
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,640
We have to remember that a severe drought
has fallen on the land which Alijah

546
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:21,260
attributes to God's punishment for
Ahab's sin in introducing by worship on,

547
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,300
on a broad scale.
Now,

548
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,810
Elijah is hiding from the king who's
very angry with him for declaring this

549
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:30,770
drought in the name of God. After
three years, he returns to Ahab.

550
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:35,450
Ahab sees Elijah and he says, is
that you, you troubler of Israel?

551
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,620
And the profit responds. It is not I
who have brought trouble on Israel,

552
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:43,640
but you and your father's house by
forsaking the commandments of the Lord.

553
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:48,230
And going after the bowels now summoned
all Israel to join me at Mount Carmel

554
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,440
together with the 450 prophets of Baal
and the 400 prophets of our ra who eat at

555
00:33:54,111 --> 00:33:57,440
Jezza bells table that are
supported by the royal house. Uh,

556
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:02,390
when all of these people are gathered,
Elijah challenges the Israelites, he says,

557
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:06,980
how long will you keep hopping between
two opinions? If the Lord is God,

558
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:10,880
follow him. And if by I'll follow him,
you're hopping between two opinions.

559
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,320
So it seems that at the popular level,

560
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:14,660
there's no problem with
integrating these two cults,

561
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:18,500
but you have the profits of both that
are demanding a certain exclusivism.

562
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,240
He's met with silence.

563
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:24,680
So Elijah prepares for a
dramatic context contest.

564
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,370
Two bowls are slaughtered and
they are laid on altars. One,

565
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,190
an altar to Baal and one
an altar to [inaudible].

566
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:35,690
And the 450 prophets of Baal
are to invoke their god.

567
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:40,691
And Elijah will invoke his God to
send a fire to consume the sacrifice.

568
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,250
And the God who answers first,

569
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:46,430
or the God who answers
with fire is truly God.

570
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,230
So the Baal prophets invoke their God
a morning to noon and they're shouting,

571
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:55,580
Oba, I'll answer us. And the description
that follows is wonderfully satirical,

572
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,940
but there was no sound
and none who responded.

573
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:03,680
So they performed a hopping dance about
the alter that had been set up when noon

574
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:08,210
came. Alijah mocked them saying
shout louder after all he is a god,

575
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:12,350
but he may be in conversation or he may
be relieving himself in the bathroom or

576
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:16,190
he may be on a journey or perhaps
he's asleep and we'll wake up.

577
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,140
So they shouted louder and Gash
themselves with knives and spears, uh,

578
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,710
according to their practice until
the blood streamed over them.

579
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,660
And when noon past,

580
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,840
they kept raving until the hour
of presenting the meal offering.

581
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:34,310
So more hours have gone by and still
there's no sound and nun who responded are

582
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:36,410
heated.
And then it's Elijah's turn.

583
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,650
Elijah sets up 12 stones
to represent the 12 tribes.

584
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,390
He lays the bull out on the altar.
He then digs a trench around the alter,

585
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:46,081
any orders,

586
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:49,740
water to be poured over the whole thing
so that it's completely saturated in the

587
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:50,850
trenches,
filled with water.

588
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:53,940
This is going to highlight of course
the miracle that's about to occur.

589
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,590
And then he calls upon the name of the
Lord and instantly a fire descends from

590
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:02,280
God and consumes everything.
Offering Woodstone earth, water,

591
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:05,790
everything and the people prostrate
themselves and declare. Yeah,

592
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,610
way alone is God.
Yahweh alone is God.

593
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,180
The prophets of Baal are
all seized and slaughtered.

594
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:18,290
Alijah expects an end to the drought and
a servant comes to report to him that a

595
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:23,751
cloud as small as a man's hand is rising
in the west and the sky grows black and

596
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:29,340
there's a strong wind and a heavy
storm and the drought is finally over.

597
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,480
The language that's used to describe this
storm is the language that's typically

598
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:35,910
employed for the storm God bow.
Um,

599
00:36:35,911 --> 00:36:38,940
it drives home the point of
the whole satire that yeah,

600
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:42,750
way is the real god of the storm, not
by Ollie. Galloway controls nature,

601
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:47,220
not by aisle. It's God who's effective
by all is silent and powerless.

602
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,780
And Israel's choice should be clear.
Yeah.

603
00:36:49,781 --> 00:36:54,781
We should be the only God for Israel just
as he is for Alijah whose name Eliyahu

604
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:58,090
means. My God. Illy my God is Yahweh.

605
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:04,330
So Jessebelle is pretty upset and
she threatens Alijah with execution.

606
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:09,270
So he flees into the desert and he
will spend 40 days and 40 nights at a

607
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:11,280
mountain called Horeb or Sinai.

608
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,970
That of course is the site
of God's revelation to Moses.

609
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:19,971
Moses also spent 40 days and 40 nights
there and many scholars have pointed out

610
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:23,250
the numerous parallels
between Elijah and Moses.

611
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:25,960
It seems that I'm the writer.
Um,

612
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,850
there was a conscious literary shaping
of the Elijah Traditions on the model of

613
00:37:29,851 --> 00:37:33,390
Moses and in more ways than just
these two. We'll see a few coming up.

614
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,980
Elijah is in great despair that Sinai,
he wants to die.

615
00:37:37,981 --> 00:37:42,981
He feels that he has failed in his fight
for God and so he hides himself in a,

616
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:47,760
in a rocky cleft and this is also
reminiscent of the cleft that Moses hides

617
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:52,260
himself in in order to catch a
glimpse of God has God passes by. Um,

618
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,071
similarly,

619
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:58,071
Alijah hides in a cleft where he will
encounter God as passages in first kings

620
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:01,950
19 verses nine through 12.

621
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,110
Then the word of the Lord came to him.
He said to him, why are you here Elijah?

622
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,020
He replied,
I am moved by zeal for the Lord.

623
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:13,170
The God of hosts for the Israelites
have forsaken your covenant,

624
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,230
Torn Down Your Altars and put
your prophets to the sword.

625
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:21,330
I alone am left and they are
out to take my life. Come out.

626
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:25,500
He called and stand on the mountain before
the Lord and low. The Lord passed by.

627
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,400
There was a great and mighty
wind splitting mountains
and shattering rocks by

628
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:30,270
the power of the Lord.

629
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:34,170
But the Lord was not in the wind
after the wind and earthquake,

630
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,630
but the Lord was in the earthquake
after the earthquake fire.

631
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,320
But the Lord was not in the
fire and after the fire,

632
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:44,140
a soft murmuring sound or
perhaps it's still small voice,

633
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:47,800
a lot of translations use that phrase,
which is very poetic.

634
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,360
And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped
his mantle about his face and went out.

635
00:38:52,361 --> 00:38:54,760
It stood and stood at
the entrance of the cave,

636
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,990
so I just seems to be renewed somehow.
At Sinai,

637
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,800
this was the mountain that was a
source of Israel's covenant with God,

638
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:07,690
but whereas the earlier theophanous there
at Sinai had involved earthquake and

639
00:39:07,691 --> 00:39:08,770
wind and fire.

640
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:13,480
The narrative here seems to be making a
point of saying that God is not in the

641
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:16,750
earthquake and the wind and the fire.
He's in the lull after the storm.

642
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:21,790
This might then be providing a kind of
balance or corrective to the preceding

643
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:25,810
story that we've just had of Mount Carmel.
Elijah on Mount Carmel.

644
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,330
God may be the master of the storm and
Elijah dramatically demonstrated that,

645
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,620
but he isn't to be identified with the
storm in the same way that bow was.

646
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,640
He's not a nature God and
he's known only in silence,

647
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,750
kind of awesome vocal
silence in the theophany.

648
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,380
Then that follows to Elijah.
God Instructs Elijah to return.

649
00:39:47,381 --> 00:39:50,860
He has to leave Sinai. He has to be
turned to the people he has work to do.

650
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:54,580
He has to foment rebellion or revolution,
I should say in the royal house.

651
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,030
This task is one that Elijah
will not complete his disciple.

652
00:39:58,031 --> 00:39:59,680
Elisha will end up completing it.

653
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,940
But the importance in this scene I think
is its emphasis on God as the God of

654
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:08,200
history rather than a nature God.
Israel's God acts in history. He's been,

655
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,320
he's made known to humans
by his acts in history.

656
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,620
His Prophet cannot withdraw
to a mountain retreat.

657
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:19,030
He has to return and he has to play
his part in God's plans for the nation.

658
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,530
So we've discussed the
prophet as gods zealots.

659
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,450
It's particularly as illustrated or
exemplified by Elijah and Elisha.

660
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:33,340
The Prophet, uh, also had other
roles and we'll see this in Elijah.

661
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,800
Elijah succeeds Alijah.
Um,

662
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:39,730
the cycle of stories about Elijah ends
with Elijah's ascent into heaven on a

663
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:42,890
fiery chariot chariot and a whirlwind.
Um,

664
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:46,900
that's a detail in the story that has
contributed to the longstanding belief

665
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:51,580
that Elijah never died. And so Elijah
will be the harbinger of the Messiah.

666
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:55,230
He will come back to announce that
the coming of the Messiah, um,

667
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:59,900
Elijah left his prophetic cloak to
his disciple and successor Elijah.

668
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:05,500
Elijah's involvement in the political
arena was also important and highlights,

669
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:06,710
um,

670
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:11,410
another prophetic role we've touched
on before that of king maker and King

671
00:41:11,411 --> 00:41:12,100
Breaker.

672
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:17,100
So just as Samuel Anointed Saul King
and then David King in private meetings,

673
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:18,430
you also have Elijah,

674
00:41:18,431 --> 00:41:23,431
he sends an associate to
secretly anoint Jay who Jay,

675
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:27,490
who is one of Ahab's x
captains as King of Israel.

676
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:31,830
This is going to initiate a
very bloody civil war. Um,

677
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,750
Jay who's going to massacre all of
Ahab's family, all of his supporters,

678
00:41:35,751 --> 00:41:37,460
his retinue in Israel.

679
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:43,060
He also assembles all of
the bowel worshipers and a
great temple that was built

680
00:41:43,191 --> 00:41:44,630
by Ahab in some area.

681
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,960
And then he orders all of them
killed and the temple demolished.

682
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:52,010
So it is a pitched battle, an all out
war between the halfway only party,

683
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:53,390
the [inaudible] party.

684
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,290
We're not going to be looking
at Elijah in great detail,

685
00:41:57,291 --> 00:42:02,291
but I will just point out one last aspect
of his prophetic profile that I think

686
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:07,060
is notable here in the book of Kings.
And that is um,

687
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,130
the characteristic of,
of uh,

688
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:12,650
profits as miracle workers like Elijah.

689
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,430
Elijah performs miracles.
He causes an iron ax to float.

690
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,420
He raises a child from the dead.
He feels jars of oil.

691
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,730
He makes poison soup edible.

692
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:28,160
He causes 20 loaves of barley to
feed a hundred men and heals lepers.

693
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:32,070
These legendary stories in which,
um,

694
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:37,210
divine intentions are effected by means
of the supernatural powers of holy men.

695
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:42,260
This represents a popular religiosity.
Um, people would turn to wonder,

696
00:42:42,261 --> 00:42:45,920
working holy men when they were sick
or in crisis when they needed help.

697
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,470
And this kind of religious activity,

698
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:52,530
which was clearly widespread in the
ancient near east in Israel. Um,

699
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:56,780
this kind of popular belief,
this fascination with
wonder, working charismatics,

700
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:00,320
it's also seen very prominently in
the gospels of the New Testament.

701
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:06,970
A final prophetic role is I'm very
well illustrated by the Prophet Nathan.

702
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:12,110
Nathan is a classic example of a prophet
who serves as the conscience of the

703
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:16,970
king.
In Second Samuel Chapters 11 and 12,

704
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,890
we have the dramatic story
of David and Bathsheba King.

705
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:25,610
David's elicit union with Bathsheba.
As you know, she's the wife of Uriah.

706
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,020
He was fighting in the king's army.
Um,

707
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:31,190
his illicit union with Bathsheba
results in her pregnancy.

708
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,270
And when David learns that
Best Sheba is pregnant,

709
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:39,170
he first tries to avoid the
issue. He grants Uriah, you know,

710
00:43:39,171 --> 00:43:42,260
a leave from, from the front lines. Um,

711
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:46,430
he's come on home and have a conjugal
visit with your wife and your Ryan's very

712
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:50,360
pious leaves you to wonder who knew
what when, um, it's a great story.

713
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,370
It's told with a lot of
subtlety and indirection,

714
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:54,470
but your eyes very pious and he refuses.

715
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:57,410
Know How could I enjoy myself
when people are out there dying,

716
00:43:57,411 --> 00:44:01,550
which is an implicit criticism of the
king who just did that very thing. Um,

717
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:06,050
and so David has foiled there and he
plans to then just dispose of Uriah.

718
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,410
So he orders your eyes,

719
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:10,760
commanders to place your idea in the
front lines of the battle and then pull

720
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:13,640
back so that your eye is basically
left on his own and he will be killed.

721
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:17,720
And indeed he is.
So David ad's murder to adultery,

722
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:23,440
but not even the king is above God's
law and God sends his Prophet Nathan to

723
00:44:23,811 --> 00:44:25,040
tell the King of fable.

724
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,040
This is in Second Samuel 12 verses one
through 14 there were two men in same

725
00:44:31,351 --> 00:44:33,630
city,
one rich and one poor.

726
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:36,630
And the rich man had very
large flocks and herds,

727
00:44:36,631 --> 00:44:40,290
but the poor man had only one
little Ewe lamb that he had bought.

728
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,950
He tended it and it grew up
together with him and his children.

729
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,940
It used to share his morsel of bread
and drink from his cup and Nessel in his

730
00:44:47,941 --> 00:44:50,040
bosom.
It was like a daughter to him.

731
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,950
One day a traveler came to the rich man,

732
00:44:52,951 --> 00:44:56,550
but he was loath to take anything from
his own flocks or herds to prepare a meal

733
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:57,810
for the guest who had come to him.

734
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:02,400
So he took the poor man's
land and prepared it for
the man who had come to him.

735
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,410
And David flew into a rage against the
man and said to Nathan, as the Lord lives,

736
00:45:07,411 --> 00:45:09,450
the man who did this deserves to die.

737
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,230
He shall pay for the lamb four times over
because he did such a thing and showed

738
00:45:13,231 --> 00:45:16,860
no pity. And Nathan said
to David, that man is you.

739
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,470
It's such a wonderful story and it's,

740
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:24,390
and it's wonderful to think that
Nathan wasn't struck down on the spot.

741
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:27,630
Uh, he escaped with his
life after this accusation,

742
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:31,530
but it's symptomatic of the
biblical narrators view of monarchy,

743
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,510
the subjugation of the king
to Ya'll way to highways,

744
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:39,530
teachings to you always commandments to
always true profits that we don't hear

745
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,580
that a Nathan is carted off,

746
00:45:41,581 --> 00:45:46,380
but instead David acknowledges
his guilt and he repents.

747
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,770
He doesn't escape all
punishment for this deed.

748
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,100
The child of the Union does in fact die.
Um,

749
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:57,060
and there's a great deal of future strife
and treachery in David's household as

750
00:45:57,061 --> 00:46:01,140
we know. And the writer does blame
a good deal of that on the deeds.

751
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:05,580
These terrible sins of David's Alijah
similarly is going to function as the

752
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:08,940
conscience of King Ahab in First Kings 21.

753
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,980
There you have a story of a vineyard,
the king covets,

754
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,940
this particular vineyard of,
of a particular man.

755
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:19,050
So the king's wife Jessebelle falsely
accuses the man of blast for me.

756
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:21,990
That is a capital crime and
the man is stoned to death,

757
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,770
even though these are trumped up charges
and his property is transferred to the

758
00:46:25,771 --> 00:46:26,604
crown.

759
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Shortly after that Alijah appears and
he pronounces doom upon a Ahab and his

760
00:46:32,461 --> 00:46:37,230
descendants, uh, for this terrible
deed, Ahab admits the sin, he repents.

761
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:40,290
Um, and so his punishment is
delayed. But as we've seen,

762
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:45,150
he is later killed in battle at
remote Giliad. So in these stories,

763
00:46:45,151 --> 00:46:48,360
we see the prophets functioning
as troubler of Israel. You know,

764
00:46:48,361 --> 00:46:49,530
certainly from the [inaudible],

765
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,370
the royal point of view and their
relationships with the royal house. Um,

766
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:55,440
these relationships are quite adversarial.

767
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,330
So we're ready to move
into what we call the,

768
00:46:59,331 --> 00:47:02,220
the period of classical prophecy
and the literary profits.

769
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:06,120
And that's a period that begins
with two prophets, Amos and Hosea,

770
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:09,300
who we'll be talking about next time.
They,

771
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:12,570
the last prophet of the
classical prophets was Malakai.

772
00:47:12,571 --> 00:47:14,940
So you have about a 320 year period.

773
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:19,980
If the prophets prophesied from about
seven 50 down to about four 30 but 320

774
00:47:19,981 --> 00:47:21,930
years, um, that's what's,

775
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,530
that's the span of time covered by
these books of the literary profits.

776
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:29,410
And these profits were responding to
urgent crises in the life of the nation.

777
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,300
It's,

778
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,900
it's easiest if we think of them as being
grouped around four periods of crisis

779
00:47:34,901 --> 00:47:37,150
or four critical periods,
which I've listed here.

780
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,240
First we have profits of
the Assyrian crisis, right?

781
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,850
I remember the fall of a series
of fall of Israel and seven 22.

782
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:45,310
So around that clustering,
around that time,

783
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,800
we have profits of the Babylonian crisis,

784
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:49,900
the destruction of
course there is five 86.

785
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:53,500
So we have prophets who cluster around
that time a little bit before. Um,

786
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:57,730
then you have profits of the exile, the
years that are spent in exile in Babylon,

787
00:47:57,731 --> 00:47:59,110
and that's primarily a Zeo.

788
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,680
And then we have profits of the Post
Zelig or restoration community when the

789
00:48:04,721 --> 00:48:08,420
Israelites are allowed to come back
to restore their community. Uh,

790
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:12,580
and we'll see certain profits there.
So in the eighth century,

791
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,760
the Assyrian Empire is threatening Israel.
And Judah,

792
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,170
you have to northern profits, Amos
and Hosea, the n is for north.

793
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:24,000
So Amos and Hosea are prophesying
in the north. And then in the, uh,

794
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,090
their warning of this doom,

795
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:28,420
it's going to come as punishment for
violations of the Mosaic Covenant.

796
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,700
Israel fell in seven 22.

797
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:34,210
You have a similar threat being posed by
the Assyrians to the southern kingdom,

798
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:38,170
Judah. And so you have to Judy
and prophets, Isaiah and Micah,

799
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,050
they carry a similar message to the Judy.

800
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:45,550
And so those four we associate with the
Assyrian crisis with the fall of Nineveh,

801
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:48,370
the capital of Assyria
that falls in six 12.

802
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:50,890
And that's something that the
profit not home celebrates.

803
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:55,900
Then Babylon is the master of the region.
Judah becomes a vassal state,

804
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:59,650
but tries to rebel and the profits.
Habbakuk and Jeremiah,

805
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,430
they prophesied in the southern
kingdom in Judah. Um, Jeremiah,

806
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,840
he urges political submission to Bab to
Babylon because he sees Babylon as the

807
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:09,550
agent of God's just punishment.

808
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:11,980
But we'll come back and look at
all these messages in great detail.

809
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,550
Post exit like profit or exhibit
Prophet Ezekiel, as I said,

810
00:49:15,551 --> 00:49:19,330
a prophet of the exile who's consoling
the people in exile in Babylonia,

811
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:23,050
but also asserting the justice
of what has happened. Um,

812
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,000
and then finally at the
end of the sixth century,

813
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:28,060
when the first exile is our
returning to restore the community,

814
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:32,260
returning to their homeland, they face a
very harsh life. And you have had guys,

815
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:34,330
Zechariah promising a better future.

816
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:38,680
You have profits like Joel and Malakai
who brings some ex eschatological hope

817
00:49:38,681 --> 00:49:42,070
into the mix. So that can help frame.
Those are the ones we're gonna touch on.

818
00:49:42,071 --> 00:49:44,380
Mostly. We're not going to hit
all of the prophetic books,

819
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:48,070
but these are the main ones will hit and
we'll start in with them. Aimless. Uh,

820
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:48,700
next time.
