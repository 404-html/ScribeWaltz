1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,040
We were talking last time about,
uh, profits of the Syrian crisis.

2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:06,330
We focused on,
we've seen,

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:09,540
we've talked about two of the
northern profits almost in Hosea.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,580
And we started talking about
Isaiah who was a southern Prophet,

5
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:13,440
a prophet in Judah.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,880
And we'll be talking now about the second
southern profit of the Assyrian crisis.

7
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:22,160
And that is Miko Amica. And he said
to come from the town of more Russia,

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,630
which is about 25 miles
southwest of Jerusalem.

9
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:28,920
So he's in Judah and he's the last
of the eighth century profits.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,790
He's quite different from
the city bread Isaiah.

11
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,470
He seems to been a rural,

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,880
a prophet who spoke for the poor farmers.

13
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:41,490
Now he's prophesying in the
second part of the eighth century.

14
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:44,100
So seven 40 to about 700.

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,030
He's attacking the s the northern kingdom,
although he's a southern profit,

16
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:50,360
he attacks Israel for,
um,

17
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,450
idolatries and says that the kingdom
will surely fall because of these.

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,900
So he also follows the other
profits as we've seen in,

19
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:01,620
in condemning the people for their
moral failings, the greedy land owners,

20
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:04,050
a dishonest merchants,
the aristocracy.

21
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:08,130
They are all targets of his denunciations
as our other leaders, the priests,

22
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,780
the judges, a royalty, the royal
house, as well as other false profits.

23
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,260
But the greatest contrast
between Isaiah and Micah.

24
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:19,200
So if you want to differentiate these
two southern profits of the Assyrian

25
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:20,160
crisis in your mind,

26
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,430
the greatest contrast lies in his view
of the city as inherently corrupt.

27
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:30,450
It's inherently sinful.
It's inherently doomed to destruction.

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,750
Isaiah had preached the inviolability
of Xeon and Micah is sharply critical of

29
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,310
the Davidic Dynasty.

30
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,750
He ridiculed the idea of the
invite inviolability of xenon.

31
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:47,430
He ridicules the belief that the presence
of the sanctuary in Jerusalem somehow

32
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:51,090
protects the city from harm.
He says on the contrary,

33
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:54,570
that God will destroy his
city and his house if need be.

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,250
Micah three verses nine through 12 here,
this you rulers of the House of Jacob,

35
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,930
you chiefs of the house of Israel who
detest justice and make crooked all that

36
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:07,920
is straight who build Zion with crime,
Jerusalem with iniquity,

37
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,140
her rulers judge for gifts,

38
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:14,670
her priest give rulings for a fee
and her profits divine for pay.

39
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,660
And yet they rely upon the Lord
saying the Lord is in our midst.

40
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,720
No calamity shall overtake us assuredly
because of use ion shall be plowed as a

41
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:28,020
field. And Jerusalem shall become
heaps of ruins. And the Temple Mount,

42
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,750
a shrine in the woods. Stark contrast
then between site between Isaiah who,

43
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:36,570
who trusts and has confidence that God
will never allow his holy city to be

44
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:38,910
destroyed.
His sanctuary to be destroyed.

45
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:42,840
His presence in the midst of the city
is guarantee that it will survive.

46
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,510
And Micah says it's no
guarantee of anything.

47
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,830
One of the most famous passages in
the book of Micah is in chapter six,

48
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:51,480
eight verses in chapter six.

49
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,200
And this is a passage that takes
the form of a covenant lawsuit,

50
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,250
which we've talked about
before, the Reeve. Um, and
the structure is as follows.

51
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:02,140
I've put it up on the whiteboard there.

52
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,610
The first two verses are the issuing of
the summons, the summons to the case.

53
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,530
So the profit here is acting as God's
attorney and he summons the accused.

54
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:12,940
Any summons,
the witnesses,

55
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,200
those would be the mountains who
are to hear the case against Israel.

56
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:19,960
God's case against Israel.
Hear what the Lord is saying,

57
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:23,590
come present my case before the
mountains and let the hills here,

58
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,410
you pleading here you mountains.
The case of the Lord,

59
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,560
you from foundations of the
earth for the Lord has a case,

60
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:32,860
a lawsuit against his people.
He has a suit against Israel.

61
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,190
So those are the opening verses
and in verses three to five,

62
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:40,060
we then move on to the plaintiffs
charge God's charge or accusation.

63
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,670
And this is given again
through the attorney.

64
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,940
He appeals to Israel's memory of,

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,600
of all of the events that have
manifested his great love for her.

66
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,820
That begins with the exodus of course,

67
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:54,850
and continues with the entry into
the promise land. And he says,

68
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:58,180
Israel seems to have forgotten all of
these deeds that God has performed on her

69
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:02,860
behalf and the obligations that
those deeds obviously entail.

70
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,320
Israel's conduct in response to this
continuous benevolence on God's part is

71
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:12,760
appalling. In verses six to seven
you have the defendant's plea.

72
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:16,270
This is Israel, I'm speaking,
but Israel really of course,

73
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:21,271
has no case to plead and Israel knows
that I'm her only choice is to try to

74
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,360
affect reconciliation,
but she doesn't know where to begin.

75
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,380
Versus six to seven with what
shall I approached the Lord,

76
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,060
do homage to God on high shall I
approached him with burnt offerings with

77
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:37,720
calves, a year old? Would the Lord
be pleased with thousands of rams,

78
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:42,100
with myriads of streams of oil? Shall I
give my first born for my transgression,

79
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,890
the fruit of my body for my sin
and the prophetic attorney, right?

80
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,220
Because the profit is here acting as
the attorney in verse eight responds to

81
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:53,530
this. He has told you, Oh man,

82
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:58,210
what is good and what the Lord requires
of you only to do justice and to love

83
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:00,580
goodness and to walk humbly with your God.

84
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,320
And the word that has been translated
here, as goodness is this word has said,

85
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:08,830
this is the word that we discussed
last time in relation to Hosea.

86
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,720
And it's a word that seems to
refer to that covenantal loyalty,

87
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:16,450
that the loyal love of
covenantal partners.

88
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,820
And this is a classic passage that
really typifies the prophetic emphasis on

89
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,210
morality or the primacy of
morality and prophetic thought.

90
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,350
The book of Micah itself structurally
alternates three prophecies of doom with

91
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:35,320
three prophecies of restoration
or hopes it's doom restoration,

92
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:37,360
doing restoration, dune
restoration. These,

93
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:41,590
these last prophecies tell of the
Glory of Zion to come in the future.

94
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:47,200
These restoration passages may seem a
little out of keeping her out of step with

95
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,410
the scathing denunciations
are condemnations of Judah
in the other parts of

96
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:54,850
Micah's prophecy.

97
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:00,150
And so some scholars have suggested that
those restoration passages and those

98
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:04,730
references to God's unconditional promise
to preserve the Davidic kingdom and

99
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,020
the optimistic predictions
of universal peace. Um,

100
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,640
these must be interpretations
by later editor.

101
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,940
And it's true that certain
parts we see again in Isaiah,

102
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,700
but this is always a very difficult
case or issue because we know that the

103
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:24,701
prophetic writings do fluctuate wildly
between denunciation and constellation.

104
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,760
So I think that a shift in theme alone
is not ever a certain basis for assuming

105
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:33,590
interpolation,
outright contradiction perhaps.

106
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,280
But a shift in theme or tone is,

107
00:06:36,281 --> 00:06:39,890
is never a solid basis for
assuming interpolation.

108
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,950
Anachronism is a very good
guide to interpretation.

109
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,490
So Micah explicitly refers to
the Babylonian exile, of course,

110
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:49,810
and that's going to be in five 86
and he's in the eighth century. Um,

111
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,240
he's also going to refer to the
rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem.

112
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:56,990
The walls of Jerusalem aren't even
destroyed until five 86 for anyone to even

113
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:58,100
speak about rebuilding them.

114
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:02,120
So those little units or passages
may of course represent late,

115
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,130
late editorial interpretations,
but in its present form.

116
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,990
And that, that nice structure
of alternation, of, of
denunciation, restoration,

117
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:14,570
denunciation, restoration of
pattern, that happens three times.

118
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,250
And that structure is,
I think,

119
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:21,251
typical of the common paradox that we
find in the prophetic writings where they

120
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:23,570
try to balance God's stern judgment.

121
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,220
On the one hand is punishment with
his merciful love and salvation of his

122
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:29,054
people.

123
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,890
A further paradox lies in the very
preservation of prophecies like Mike is

124
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:35,890
Prophecy, prophecy. Um,

125
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,370
these prophecies were probably preserved
by priests in the temple even though

126
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,290
priests were very often among the targets
of the profits in their denunciations,

127
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,960
particularly mica.
All right,

128
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:51,980
so we've talked about the profits who've
responded to the Assyrian crisis right

129
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:55,580
towards the end of the eighth century
to in the north too, in the south.

130
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,500
Jerusalem survived the siege of seven
Oh one when the Assyrians laid siege,

131
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:05,570
I'm in 701 and that gave credence to
the royal ideology and the idea that God

132
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:12,170
was with Zion was with Jerusalem and
was with the house of David and would

133
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:16,370
preserve them. But even so, Judah
moves into the next century,

134
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:21,090
into the six hundreds in a considerably
weakened state after the siege. Um,

135
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:22,790
and it's during that century,

136
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:27,320
the first half of the next century that
is Syria reached the zenith of its of

137
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:31,420
its power in Judah.
You have king Monash,

138
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:34,400
it raining that King Manasseh
rain for nearly 50 years.

139
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,840
We're not sure of exact dates,

140
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:38,930
but somewhere around the six nineties
to the six forties, about six 40,

141
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,810
50 years now,
remarkably,

142
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,940
the Deuteronomistic historian devotes
only 18 verses to this king who reigned

143
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:51,630
for 50 years. And all of those
verses are entirely negative. Uh,

144
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,040
and that's in great contrast to their
treatment of his father has a Kia and his

145
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,680
grandson who follows him, um, Josiah, uh,

146
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,900
Menasha was apparently a loyal
vassal of Assyria. And it,

147
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,390
according to the biblical writer,

148
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:10,710
he reversed the reforms of his father
has a Kaia who is said by the writer to

149
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:15,200
have, um, you know, destroyed
idolatry and so on. Um, but he said,

150
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:20,201
who have reversed that and to have
adopted a Syrian norms as we move through

151
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,840
this century and move towards the
latter half of this century is Syria,

152
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,380
which is overextended itself,
is beginning to decline.

153
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,800
And some of the other states in the
ancient near east are able to break away

154
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:34,950
from Egypt, breaks away,
Babylon breaks away.

155
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Josiah comes to the throne in Judah in
seven 40 he sees a serious weakness.

156
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:45,480
He decides to take advantage of that and
asserts Judean independence carries out

157
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:50,481
a series of reforms we've talked about
several times in six 22 which include

158
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,230
purging the cult,
perhaps of a Syrian religious influences,

159
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:59,760
centralizing worship of Yahweh
only and in Jerusalem and so on.

160
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:04,530
So this centralization of the cult served
probably a political political agenda

161
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:06,740
as well of asserting
independence from a Syria.

162
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,410
Syria is continuing to decline
towards the end of this century.

163
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,340
And in six 12 the capital
Nineveh will fall.

164
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,120
The Babylonians managed to conquer these
Syrians. And by destroying Nineveh,

165
00:10:19,121 --> 00:10:22,260
it's actually an alliance
of meads and Babylonians.

166
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,100
So things are going quite well.
Josiah is king, he's a favored king.

167
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,660
But just a few years later,

168
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,630
he will die in a battle
against the Egyptians at Mcgee.

169
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,620
So just a little bit of
historical background for
you as we talk about the next

170
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,840
profits. Alright. So Josiah,
the king who's highly favored
will die in six oh nine.

171
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:45,910
Now Zephaniah was a Judean Prophet who
prophesied during the reign of King

172
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:49,470
Josiah. So we're going to be moving
on now to Zephaniah and Jeremiah as,

173
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,770
as the Babylonian, uh, profits
of the Babylonian crisis.

174
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:55,440
So we're going to throw in a couple
of prophetic characters along the way,

175
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:59,130
but there'll be the two main
profits of the Babylonian crisis.

176
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,550
Obviously in the south. All we have,
and I was a southern kingdom, Judah, um,

177
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,670
but I'll be picking up on two
other profits in a moment as well.

178
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,030
So he prophesied during the
time of King Josiah. Um,

179
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:14,210
some of his prophecies seem to date to
the time we think before Josiah's reforms

180
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:19,470
in six 22. And those prophecies tend
to be very pessimistic and very grim.

181
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,890
Judah is condemned. It's
condemned for apostasy, it's
condemned for decadence. Um,

182
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,880
all of the things that that
flourished under King Manasseh,

183
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,210
God is wrathful and his,
his wrath is imminent.

184
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,400
There will be a universal destruction
according to Stefania. All life hand,

185
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,520
animal and human will be exterminated.

186
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,830
So as we saw in the book
of Amos This Day of Yahweh,

187
00:11:42,831 --> 00:11:45,990
way this day of the Lord,
which has been so eagerly awaited,

188
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,810
will not in fact be a day of triumph,

189
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,110
but a day of dark destruction and despair.

190
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Zephaniah one 15 to 18 that
day shall be a day of Wrath,

191
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,330
a day of trouble and distress,
a day of calamity and desolation.

192
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:04,900
A day of darkness and deep gloom.
A day of densest clouds,

193
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,460
a day of horn blasts send alarms against
the fortified towns in the lofty corner

194
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:10,294
towers.

195
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,440
I will bring distress on the people and
they shall walk like blind men because

196
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:15,790
they sinned against the Lord.

197
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,590
Their blood shall be spilled like dust
and their fat like Dung. Moreover,

198
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:24,580
they're silver and gold shall not avail
to save them on the day of the Lord's

199
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:26,470
wrath and the fire of his passion,

200
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,430
the whole land shall be consumed for
he will make a terrible end of all who

201
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:34,840
dwell in the land can see why people
didn't enjoy listening to these profits.

202
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,910
Um, but at the same time, like the other
profits, Zephaniah also offered hope.

203
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:44,590
There will be a humble remnant which
will seek refuge in God. Um, these will,

204
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,290
these, these, um, Jewish exiles, uh,

205
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:52,291
he says will be delivered from their
oppressors and even gentiles will join in

206
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:56,860
the worship of God.
Zephaniah three verses 11 to 13.

207
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,420
In that day,

208
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,170
you will no longer be shamed for all
the deeds by which you have defied me.

209
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,370
For then I will remove the
proud and exalted within
you and you will be haughty.

210
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:11,300
No more on my sacred mount, but I will
leave within you a poor, humble folk.

211
00:13:11,301 --> 00:13:13,750
So this idea of purging
the dross and leaving the,

212
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,070
the pure remnant and they shall
find refuge in the name of the Lord.

213
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:21,460
The remnant of Israel shall do
no wrong and speak no false hood.

214
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,230
A deceitful tongue shall not be in their
mouths only such as these shall graze

215
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:28,830
and lie down with none to trouble them.
Uh,

216
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,990
there will also be an end
gathering of any exiled. Verse 20.

217
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,740
At that time I will gather you and at
that time I will bring you home for I will

218
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:38,320
make you renowned and famous
among all the peoples on earth.

219
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:41,440
When I restore your fortunes
before their very eyes.

220
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,210
There's one passage in particular that
seems extraordinarily a joyous, uh,

221
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:51,010
it seems to announce the salvation as,
as happening now is present.

222
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,770
And so a lot of scholars
think that this was, um, um,

223
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,880
Zephaniah his reaction to
Josiah and Josiah is reform,

224
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,410
which seemed to him to perhaps be the
very salvation for which the nation was

225
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:07,390
longing. Chapter three verses 14 and
15, shout for joy fairs ion cry aloud,

226
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:10,780
o Israel, rejoice and be glad with
all your heart fair. Jerusalem,

227
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,250
the Lord has a node. The judgment
against you, he has swept away your foes.

228
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,320
Israel is sovereign. The Lord is within
you. You need fear. Misfortune. No more.

229
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,660
So this, this sounds very much like a, um,

230
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,720
a reaction to these reforms
initiated by Josiah.

231
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:30,460
This is hailed as the very restoration
of God's presence in the community of

232
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:34,000
Judah, uh, that that was desired.
The judgment has been a node.

233
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,610
These terrible things I've been
prophesying will not happen.

234
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,080
Another short prophetic book we should
mention now is the book of [inaudible].

235
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,130
Um, it's very different from
the other prophetic books.

236
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,420
It doesn't really contain prophecies
and it doesn't really upgrade the people

237
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:53,960
for their failings, which are two things
that most of the other prophets do. Um,

238
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,870
the book of Nahum is a short little
book and it's really a three,

239
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,820
a series of three poems.

240
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,560
And these are the first one is an
acrostic poem and alphabetical poem.

241
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,460
Um, you know, lines beginning with
successive letters of the alphabet,

242
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:08,390
the Hebrew Alphabet,

243
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,810
and these poems rejoice over the
fall of Nineveh in in six 12,

244
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,600
um,
the capital of the cruel Assyrian Empire.

245
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,850
The Assyrians were actually quite
widely hated in the ancient near east.

246
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:27,020
They were noted for their exceptional
brutality there in humanity,

247
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,960
particularly in their
conquest and empire building.

248
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:32,630
They deported populations wholesale.

249
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,410
They were guilty of all sorts of
atrocities like mutilating their captives.

250
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,160
They would butcher women and children,
all sorts of horrendous deeds.

251
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,280
We have lots of testimony about this,
both in a Syrian sources,

252
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:47,000
but other ancient near eastern sources,
texts as well as artwork.

253
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,210
So not home in this poem
is celebrating the Avenger,

254
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,380
avenging and wrathful God who has finally
turned around to destroy this terrible

255
00:15:56,391 --> 00:16:00,650
enemy of, of Israel. And indeed
the world according to knock him.

256
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,370
It's quite true that God had
used a Syria as his tool.

257
00:16:04,371 --> 00:16:09,080
He had used a Syria to discipline
the Kingdom of Israel, right?

258
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,190
They did destroy Israel and to
discipline Judah for Judas sins.

259
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,370
But God is ultimately
the universal sovereign.

260
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:18,650
And so a serious savagery,

261
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,190
even if it was part of God's
disciplining of his children,

262
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:27,140
is a serious savagery is itself something
that must be punished. So for now,

263
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:32,141
come the fall of Nineveh is God's
vengeance upon a Syria for her barbaric in

264
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:35,740
humanity. And the book of Naca, uh,

265
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,860
has often been praised for its very vivid,
poetic style.

266
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,880
It describes these armed legions that
march against Nineveh and plundered.

267
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:48,860
It's treasures and some of
the most exciting archeology
that's been going on has

268
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:50,600
been the digging up of,
of Nineveh.

269
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:55,070
I think the dig has up obviously stopped
for reasons having to do with the

270
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:58,710
climate and that part of the world.
But, um, the, the findings of,

271
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,790
of Nineveh and the stacking
of Nineveh and how, you know,

272
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:05,270
shallow pits were dug and treasures
thrown into them and covered over by the

273
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:08,240
gates of the city as people were fleeing.
And many of these things,

274
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:10,790
when you read the description of Nineveh
and look at some of the archeological

275
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,350
data, it's, it's quite fascinating,

276
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:18,110
but on looks forward to a
happy era of freedom for Judah.

277
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,260
And he says in two verse 15 for never
again shall the wicked come against you.

278
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,830
Well, this isn't true. And in
fact, in a few years Josiah
is going to be killed. Um,

279
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,840
Judah's going to be made subject to Egypt
and in fact, Babylon by six Oh five,

280
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,750
um, Babylon manages to
extract, um, you know,

281
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:39,920
tribute from Judah as a, as a vassal. Um,

282
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,180
so in a way we have here really a glaring
error and it's important to note that

283
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:48,130
this error in not home, it wasn't
updated. It wasn't, um, uh,

284
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:52,650
repaired in order to protect
his prophetic reputation.

285
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,540
So we see this interesting tension. We
sometimes see a prophetic books, um,

286
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,090
being edited, revised, um,

287
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:03,960
having interpretations put into them
partly out of this conviction that their

288
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:06,780
words must be relevant and
continue to have some relevance.

289
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:10,890
And other times there seems to be good
evidence that prophetic oracles were

290
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,810
preserved rather faithfully.
But with the fall of Nineveh,

291
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,590
national confidence
was probably boosted a.

292
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,120
And then things quickly turned sour with
the death of Josiah and six oh nine,

293
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:25,530
which was a terrible shock.

294
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,710
You have Judah lying trapped as
it were between two great powers,

295
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,900
Egypt in the South West Babylon in
the north east and in six oh five,

296
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:37,531
as I said,

297
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:42,150
Babylon managed to defeat Egypt and
reduced Judah to the status of a tributary

298
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,710
vassal under the king you theme,
um,

299
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,910
King Jehoiakim rebels.
And in response,

300
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,220
the Babylonians laid siege to Jerusalem.

301
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:55,950
There will be two sieges of
Jerusalem by the Babylonians,

302
00:18:55,951 --> 00:19:00,090
just as we've had two sieges
earlier to see just one in five 97,

303
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:04,740
one and five 87, both
under Nebuchadnezzar, he
lays siege to Jerusalem.

304
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:07,940
And five 97 it doesn't destroy Jerusalem.
He kills the,

305
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,200
the king takes the king's son into
captivity in Babylon and installs a puppet

306
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:14,760
king.

307
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,350
I'm still under the assumption that
things could be kept under control.

308
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,830
So the puppet King
Zedekiah is on the throne,

309
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,030
but he also decides to rebel and
Assert Judas independence against the

310
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:29,430
Babylonians.
So neighborhood Netzero returns,

311
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:33,720
and this is in five 87 and now
the city is in fact captured.

312
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:38,750
The sanctuary is completely destroyed
and the bulk of the population is exiled.

313
00:19:38,851 --> 00:19:40,990
And this is what brings to end,
uh,

314
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,700
nearly 400 years of independent
of an independent Hebrew nation.

315
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,610
The book of Habakkuk Cook was written
during this period, sort of 602,

316
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:53,010
the destruction somewhere in those years.

317
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,140
That's the period in which the
Babylonians attack Jerusalem twice.

318
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,800
And Habakkuk is another
unusual prophetic book.

319
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:06,801
It doesn't contain prophecies so much
as it contains philosophical musings on

320
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,830
God's behavior.
And we're going to see this increasing.

321
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:12,960
Now as we move into the
next section of the Bible.

322
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,430
When we complete the prophetic section,

323
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,610
we'll be encountering writings of very
different genres and some of them do

324
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:21,030
contain these philosophical
musings on God's conduct.

325
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:26,810
Have a cook one and two are a kind of
poetic dialogue between the profit and

326
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,360
yeah way and the prophet complains
bitterly about God's inaction.

327
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,220
Verses two and three of the first chapter,

328
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,480
How long o Lord Shall I
cry out and you not listen.

329
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,590
Shall I shout to you
violence and you not save?

330
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,630
Why do you make me see iniquity?

331
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:49,090
Why do you look upon wrong rating
and violence are before me.

332
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,240
Strife continues and contention goes on
and skipping down to verses 13 and 14

333
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,960
you whose eyes are too pure to look upon
evil who cannot countenance wrongdoing,

334
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:03,100
why do you countenance treachery and
standby idle while the one in the wrong

335
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:07,300
devours the one on the right, you have
made mankind like the fish of the sea,

336
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:09,460
like creeping things that have no ruler.

337
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,840
So God responds to these charges by
saying that the Babylonians are the

338
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:15,280
instruments of his justice,

339
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,570
even though they ascribed there might
and their success to their gods rather

340
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:24,160
than to Yak way.
Now we've already seen in other books.

341
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,510
The idea that I'm a conquering nation is,

342
00:21:27,511 --> 00:21:29,920
is serving as the instrument
of God's punishment,

343
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,110
but Habbakuk is a little bit unusual
because he doesn't couch this idea in the

344
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:39,790
larger argument that Judah deserves
this catastrophic punishment.

345
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,930
There's a great difference between Haba
Cook and the Deuteronomistic historian,

346
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:44,764
for example,

347
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:49,030
because Haba Cook doesn't assert that
the people are suffering for their sins.

348
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,830
Haba Cook is struggling with what appears
to him to be a basic lack of justice,

349
00:21:53,831 --> 00:21:58,000
right? The Deuteronomistic a story and
wants to assert God's justice and whatever

350
00:21:58,001 --> 00:22:01,780
suffering happens is justifiable.
A cook is resisting that idea.

351
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:05,110
We're going to see that resistance
really come to a climax next week when we

352
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:06,280
talk about the book of Job,

353
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:12,090
but Hypo Cook in one for struggles with
this decision fails and justice never

354
00:22:13,121 --> 00:22:16,840
emerges for the villain hedges
in the just man. Therefore,

355
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:18,790
judgment emerges deformed.

356
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,050
It's not merely that the wicked and
the righteous suffer the same fate.

357
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,260
It's that the wicked really seemed
to fair better than the just,

358
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,850
and that reduces humankind to the level
of fish and creeping things for whom

359
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:34,930
sheer power and not morality
is the principal consideration.

360
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,750
And having made this charge Habbakuk
awaits God. God's answer in chapter two,

361
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:43,930
verses one to five, he says,
I will stand on my watch,

362
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,920
take up my station at the post and
wait to see what he will say to me,

363
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,690
what he will reply to my complaint.
The Lord answered me and said,

364
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,070
write the prophecy down and scribe it
clearly on tablets so that it can be read

365
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,240
easily. The righteous man is
rewarded with life for his fidelity.

366
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,450
How much less then shall
the defiant go unpunished?

367
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,260
Not a terribly deep answer.

368
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:11,920
The righteous simply have to have faith
that justice will prevail and this faith

369
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:15,910
has sis to stain them through the
trials that challenged that very idea.

370
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,820
We'll see a deeper answer to this
same problem in the book of job.

371
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,820
The third chapter then shifts gears.
So much so that once again,

372
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:27,880
scholars say it must be an
interpolation. Um, but again,

373
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:31,870
I would warn that dramatic shifts in tone
and theme or not that uncommon in the

374
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:35,260
prophetic books, and we'd have to be
careful. But in this third chapter,

375
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,340
God is described as a warrior.
God, uh, he thunders from the east.

376
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:42,820
He hurls his spear.
He seeks vengeance on Israel's oppressors.

377
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:48,060
It may be that this is some editors to
respond to Hubba cooks skepticism that

378
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,670
y'all way will bring justice and bring
it soon. That he's waiting. How long?

379
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:55,010
Why is this taking you so long?
Why are you not acting?

380
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,010
And this image of I'm an avenging warrior.

381
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:01,460
God answers Hubba cooks opening question.

382
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,990
How long will God stand by and watch while
the Babylonians rape and pillage? Uh,

383
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,920
but on the other hand, it's possible
that it's Habbakuk himself. And again,

384
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:13,610
the book exhibits that same paradoxical
tension we've seen through so many of

385
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:15,740
the prophetic books.
Specifically,

386
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:19,220
he holds out the paradoxical
view that God's injustice,

387
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,920
God's justice is slow in coming,

388
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,330
but the righteous must have complete
faith in its ultimate execution.

389
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,740
But he's raised the issue of
theodicy the problem of evil,

390
00:24:30,741 --> 00:24:32,090
the problem of suffering.

391
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Ultimately he sees the problems resolution
only in some vision of the future and

392
00:24:37,701 --> 00:24:39,830
avenging God when justice will be done.

393
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,560
That is typical of some
texts that we will see later,

394
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:44,390
particularly apocalyptic literature,

395
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,690
which is going to emphasize
patient waiting for an end
time where there will be

396
00:24:47,691 --> 00:24:51,410
a cataclysmic final acts that
will bring justice and judgment.

397
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,350
Now the prophet who lived at the time of
the final destruction of Judah and saw

398
00:24:57,351 --> 00:25:02,270
the fall of Jerusalem at the hands of the
Babylonians in five 87 was the prophet

399
00:25:02,271 --> 00:25:05,810
Jeremiah. Another one,
another long prophetic books.

400
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:09,380
We have our three long prophetic books.
Isaiah of the Assyrian crisis,

401
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:13,520
Jeremiah of the Babylonian crisis and
Ezekiel writing from exile in Babylon.

402
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:19,280
And Jeremiah was born of a priestly family
in a village near Jerusalem, Anatolia.

403
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,330
And he began prophesying
while he was still a boy.

404
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,880
Now he was a contemporary of King
Josiah. And, and so he saw the, uh,

405
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,870
the renaissance that briefly occurred
under his guidance, the sweeping reform,

406
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:37,770
the eradication of a Syrian influences
that had been welcomed by King Monash,

407
00:25:37,771 --> 00:25:40,060
Shia, the renewal of the covenant. Uh,

408
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,010
all of these activities that are so
highly favored by the biblical writer.

409
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,990
And when Josiah died,

410
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:48,680
Jeremiah also lamented his passing
along with the rest of the nation.

411
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,600
Jeremiah witnessed the final
destruction and the exile. Um,

412
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:59,230
the book of Jeremiah is a collection
of very different types of material.

413
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,410
There's really no clear organization.
There's no clear chronological order,

414
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:04,011
not that kind of thing.

415
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:06,410
You've been just sort of sit down and
read from beginning to end and hope it

416
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:08,810
will make sense.
There are prophecies.

417
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,500
There are oracles and diatribes
against foreign nations.

418
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:17,110
There are stories by a graphical
narratives. There's some poetry, uh,

419
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,910
and at the very end,
a little brief historical appendix,

420
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:24,170
which really resembles second
kings chapter 24 and 25.

421
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,630
So the literary history of,

422
00:26:26,631 --> 00:26:30,950
of the book itself is also quite complex
because there's a great variation in

423
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:33,710
our ancient witnesses.
The CEP to again,

424
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:38,300
which is the Greek translation
of the Bible, Third Century BCE,

425
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:43,330
Greek translation of the Bible is it's
Jeremiah is much shorter than the version

426
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,000
of Jeremiah. Uh, and it's
arranged differently internally.

427
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,170
The arrangement is different.

428
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,370
There are also significant differences
between the Hebrew texts that we have now

429
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,270
and some fragments of Jeremiah that had
been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.

430
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,800
So this attests to the very open
ended nature of written compositions.

431
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:06,720
In antiquity, we find three main types
of material. However, in Jeremiah,

432
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,920
the poetic oracles that I'm
generally are attributed to Jeremiah.

433
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:16,020
Then biographical anecdotes
and narratives about him,

434
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:21,230
which are attributed to his menu Ansas
and assistant whose name I don't think I

435
00:27:21,521 --> 00:27:26,110
put up your morale,
Ben and Ben,

436
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:30,290
simply meaning son of. So Barak,
the son of Nuria whose uh,

437
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:34,740
whose name comes up quite a bit in the
book of Jeremiah and he is a scribe who

438
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:38,880
assists Jeremiah and it's thought that
perhaps a biographical narrative sections

439
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:40,860
were composed by [inaudible] Maria.

440
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,060
And then we also have certain editorial
notes about Jeremiah Jeremiah that are

441
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:48,690
in the style of the Deuteronomistic
historian, Deuteronomistic editor,

442
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,520
Jeremiah in general,

443
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,600
it seems to have very close connections
with the language and the ideology of

444
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:59,280
Deuteronomy. So if we look quickly
at the structure of the book,

445
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:01,980
for the most part,
the first 25 chapters,

446
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:06,570
Jeremiah one through 25 contain an
introduction and an account of Jeremiah's

447
00:28:06,571 --> 00:28:09,270
call,
but then also poetic,

448
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:13,440
Oracle's with some biographical snippets
thrown in there as well, not snippets,

449
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,230
narratives,
biographical narratives as well as poetic.

450
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:19,290
Oracle's 26 to 29.

451
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:23,760
We have stories of his, um,
encounters, I should say,

452
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:28,710
run ins with other profits and with
authority figures of various types.

453
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,900
Chapters 30 to 33 are oracles
of hope and consolation.

454
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:37,500
34 to 45 are more pros,

455
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:40,050
stories and these stories center around.

456
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,960
And after the time of
the final destruction,

457
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,750
then we have several chapters,

458
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:50,160
46 to 51 that contain
Oracle's against nations.

459
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:54,150
Some of these scholars think might be
from other writers. And then again,

460
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:54,651
as I say,

461
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:58,710
it concludes with this historical appendix
about the fall of Jerusalem that's

462
00:28:58,711 --> 00:29:01,320
extracted from second kings.
Uh,

463
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:06,510
Jeremiah preached the inevitable doom
and destruction of the nation because of

464
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:11,700
its violation of the covenant, which
was a very charter for her existence.

465
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,540
And his descriptions were quite
vivid and quite terrifying.

466
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,820
He denounced Israel's leaders,

467
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,950
the professional profits in particular
with whom he has many, uh, encounters. Um,

468
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:26,700
the professional profits are liars. He
says, because they prophesied piece.

469
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,760
He has some negative
references to priests as well,

470
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,740
but he's especially critical of king
you Jolla Keem who's the son of Josiah.

471
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:40,320
He can be compared to mica because he
also attacked this idea of this popular

472
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:43,000
ideology of the Inviolability of Zion.

473
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,380
As long as injustice and
oppression are practiced in Judah,

474
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,950
the presence of the temple
is no guarantee of anything.

475
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:55,840
Judah will suffer the faith that she
deserves for failure to fulfill her

476
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:57,340
covenantal obligations.

477
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,530
So God tells Jeremiah to go stand at
the gate of the temple and speak these

478
00:30:02,531 --> 00:30:06,100
words. And this is a passage that's
often referred to as the temple sermon.

479
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:11,500
It's from chapter seven, thus said,
the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel,

480
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,670
mend your ways and your actions.
And I will let you dwell in this place.

481
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,720
Don't put your trust in illusions
and say the temple of the Lord,

482
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:22,960
the Temple of the Lord, the Temple
of the Lord. Are these buildings? No.

483
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,510
If you really mend your
ways and your actions,

484
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:28,450
if you execute justice
between one man and another,

485
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,660
if you do not oppress the stranger,
the orphan and the widow,

486
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:33,220
you hear the language of Deuteronomy,
right?

487
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:36,460
Those three are always together
and Deuteronomy drawing
very heavily on the same

488
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:40,150
language. If you do not oppress the
stranger, the orphan and the widow,

489
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,850
if you do not shed the blood
of the innocent in this place,

490
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:45,520
if you do not follow other
gods to your own hurt,

491
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:49,810
then only will I let you dwell in this
place in the land that I gave your

492
00:30:49,811 --> 00:30:54,490
father's for all time. See, you are
relying on illusions that are to no avail.

493
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,890
Will you steal and murder and commit
adultery and swear falsely again illusion

494
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,080
to the deck log, right? Those
four terms in the decalogue,

495
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,850
will you steal and murder
and commit adultery and swear
falsely and sacrificed a

496
00:31:05,851 --> 00:31:10,180
ball and follow other gods whom you have
not experienced and then come and stand

497
00:31:10,181 --> 00:31:14,590
before me in this house which
bears my name and say we are safe,

498
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:18,460
safe to do all these apart things.
Do you consider this house?

499
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:21,310
Which bears my name to be a
den of thieves? As for me,

500
00:31:21,311 --> 00:31:23,350
I have been watching declares the Lord.

501
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,630
So he attacked this doctrine
of the inviolability of Zion,

502
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:29,380
and that would have been,
I kind of clastic to say the least,

503
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,550
but he pointed to history
as proof for his assertion.

504
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,850
He cites the example of
Shiloh as an example,

505
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:40,450
if you remember during the period of the
judges when the Ark of the covenant was

506
00:31:40,451 --> 00:31:42,580
peripatetic and would
stay at different places,

507
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:46,990
but for some time it came to rest at
Shiloh with the priest, Eli and his sons.

508
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:52,290
And in that time the Philistines managed
to destroy the sanctuary and capture

509
00:31:52,571 --> 00:31:54,970
the ark and carry it off
into Philistine territory.

510
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,990
So the presence of the Ark of the covenant
is no guarantee of anything and the

511
00:31:58,991 --> 00:32:01,960
belief that God would not
allow his temple, his city,

512
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:06,430
his anointed ruler to be destroyed.
Jeremiah says is a deception.

513
00:32:06,431 --> 00:32:08,860
It's an illusion.
He,

514
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:13,150
his political message resembles very
much the message of his predecessors.

515
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,480
He says that the nation's pathetic
attempts to resist the great powers and to

516
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,090
enter into alliances with
the one against the other.

517
00:32:22,091 --> 00:32:27,091
These were all completely futile and to
dramatically illustrate the destruction

518
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:29,470
and the slavery that were inevitable.

519
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,420
He paraded around Jerusalem first in a
wooden yoke and then in an iron yoke.

520
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:38,890
He does this in chapters 27 and 28
this is a symbol of the slavery,

521
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:43,891
the yoke of the master that is to come
in chapter 27 verse six he claims that

522
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:49,310
God has power over all the earth and
has given the earth to Nebuchadnezzar of

523
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:52,010
Babylon. God's servant.
As you can imagine,

524
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,570
referring to the destroyer of the
nation as God's servant would have been

525
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,000
shocking,
not to say dangerous.

526
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:03,650
You can imagine parallels in our own
time where people would see the god most

527
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:06,020
commonly understood to be
the god of most Americans,

528
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,720
being the one who orchestrated
attacks against that,

529
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:12,650
so it would have that same kind of
feel and power to people and in several

530
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,690
passages, Jeremiah exhorts the king
to submit to the Babylonian forces.

531
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:22,790
This is acceptance of God's will, the
forces that are surrounding Jerusalem, um,

532
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:28,580
to ensure the preservation of his words,
which were not popular.

533
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,990
Jeremiah had his amendments,

534
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,950
this borough write down
everything that God spoke to him.

535
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,700
Chapter 36 gives us an
insight into this process.

536
00:33:37,701 --> 00:33:41,230
It's kind of interesting
because, um, Jeremiah, Jeremiah,

537
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,290
Jeremiah's words are transcribed.
God specifically tells Jeremiah how,

538
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,450
how to do this. Get a scroll. He says,

539
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,230
and write upon it all the words that I
have spoken to you concerning Israel and

540
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:54,740
Judah and all the nations from the time
I first spoke to you in the days of

541
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,970
Josiah to this time.
Now it's the time of King Yo Jakeem.

542
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,490
And then in verse four we read.
So Jeremiah called Barak,

543
00:34:01,491 --> 00:34:05,810
the son of Nuria and Barack wrote down
in the scroll at Jeremiah is dictation.

544
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,940
All the words which the
Lord had spoken to him.

545
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,740
Now Jeremiah is in hiding at this time
because he's politically very unpopular.

546
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:16,760
So he instructs Barack to take the scroll
to the temple and to stand there and

547
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:19,610
to read it to the people.
The king's officials are there.

548
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,720
They report to the king about the
submersive, the subversive message,

549
00:34:23,721 --> 00:34:27,680
which has been delivered by Barbara.
So brook goes into hiding,

550
00:34:27,681 --> 00:34:32,681
the scroll is torn into strips and
burned God orders Jeremiah to get another

551
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,390
scroll and repeat the process.

552
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,330
And he does verse 32 of Chapter 36.

553
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:42,770
So Jeremiah got another scroll and gave
it to the scribe by real son of Neriah.

554
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,330
And at Jeremiah is dictation.

555
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:47,750
He wrote in it the whole text of the
scroll that King you Jolla Keem of Judah

556
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:51,410
had burned and more of the like
was added. So, and then some right,

557
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:55,010
they got came back with even more.
So it's possible that these,

558
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:57,480
some scholars suggest
that what was written, um,

559
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,260
would have been the contents
of chapters one to 25,

560
00:35:00,261 --> 00:35:04,760
which really contains the
irregular material, the
oracles. Um, but in any event,

561
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:08,690
this story gives us some insight into
the profit. The process of prophecy.

562
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,330
It doesn't appear to have
been really off the cuff.

563
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,710
The compositions of the profits were
literary compositions that were committed

564
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:20,690
to memory. They could then be dictated
again. And on an archeological note,

565
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,580
I should point out that one of the most
exciting fines I think, um, is a claim.

566
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,310
In 1975,
they found a clay bula,

567
00:35:28,311 --> 00:35:31,510
which is like a clay imprint of,
um,

568
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:36,010
baroque son of Nuria. The scribe is
what it says on the clay imprint.

569
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:39,930
Another one was found in 1996 it was
said to be found in a burnt house in

570
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:42,330
Jerusalem, which would've been
around the time of the destruction.

571
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,690
And it just showed up on the
antiquities market. So some question,

572
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:46,950
whether it's genuine or not,

573
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:50,310
the second one that was found has a
fingerprint on it. And people say, well,

574
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:52,800
that could be the fingerprint of
[inaudible], son of Neriah. Anyway,

575
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:55,230
this is the fun stuff you get
to do if you do archeology.

576
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,520
But there are plenty of people who think
that these probably are the seals of

577
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:03,120
the scribe, but Roxanne of an area that
he would've used to stamp anything, uh,

578
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:05,160
that he would have a
transcribed or written.

579
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:10,350
So Jeremiah was rejected.
He was despised.

580
00:36:10,351 --> 00:36:13,320
He was persecuted by fellow Judeans.
Naturally,

581
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:17,850
they would have seen him as a trader.
Um, he was flogged. He was imprisoned,

582
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,280
uh, often in his life. He was in hiding.

583
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:25,110
He was a very troubled person and he
lived in very difficult times. But he,

584
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,560
we also get an insight into his,
his emotional state,

585
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,220
which we don't for many of the other
prophets. He suffered immensely.

586
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:36,150
He weeps over Jerusalem.
In chapter eight a and nine,

587
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,090
we get a sense of the
turmoil that he suffers,

588
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:42,960
particularly because of a group of
passages that are referred to as the

589
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:46,650
confessions of Jeremiah. And these
are sort of scattered throughout, um,

590
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,640
some in chapters 11
and 12, 15, 17, 18, 20.

591
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,400
But these are passages
that reveal his interstate.

592
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,250
Some people question their authenticity,
but in any event,

593
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,550
they paint a very fascinating
portrait of the Prophet.

594
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,100
He curses the day that he was born.

595
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,830
He accuses God of deceiving him,

596
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,340
of enticing him to act as God's messenger,

597
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:11,280
only to be met with humiliation and shame.

598
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:16,560
But he can't hold it in God's words,
rage inside him. And he must prophesied.

599
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,920
It would be better had he not been born
at all than to suffer this ceaseless

600
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:27,150
pain. Chapter 20 verses seven through
18 just selections from there,

601
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,540
you enticed me,
Oh lord and I was enticed.

602
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,300
You overpowered me and you prevailed.
I have become a constant laughingstock.

603
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:39,300
Everyone jeers at me for every
time I speak, I must cry out.

604
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:43,770
I must shout lawlessness and ray pine
for the word of the Lord causes me

605
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:48,570
constant disgrace and contempt. I thought
I will not mention him no more. Well,

606
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:52,860
I speak in his name, but his word was
like a raging fire in my heart. Shut up,

607
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:56,910
shut up in my bones. I could
not hold it in. I was helpless.

608
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,960
I heard the whispers of the crowd
terror all around, informed.

609
00:38:00,961 --> 00:38:04,620
Let us inform against him. A curse would
be the day that I was born a curse.

610
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:07,200
It'd be the man who brought
my father the news and said,

611
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,930
a boy is born to you
and gave him such joy.

612
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,710
Let that man become like the cities
which the Lord over through without

613
00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:16,800
relenting because he did
not kill me before birth.

614
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,630
So that my mother might be my grave
and her womb big with me for all time.

615
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:26,990
Why did I ever issue from the womb to see
misery and woe to spend all my days in

616
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:30,570
shame?
Nevertheless,

617
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,020
despite all of his very
harsh criticisms of,

618
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,040
of the establishment authorities
or royal house and even scribes,

619
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:42,550
other profits who are
labeled as liars by Jeremiah,

620
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:47,650
his words were preserved by scribes,
by the Deuteronomistic editors.

621
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,990
Shortly after the fall of Judah,

622
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:55,290
Jeremiah was taken forcibly to Egypt and
he lived his final years out in Egypt.

623
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,800
He didn't give up his job, though he kept
announcing people. He, um, we have, uh,

624
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:04,410
records of his denouncing his fellow
Judean exiles down in Egypt, uh,

625
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,890
for worshiping the Queen of Heaven.

626
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,520
And as before it seems
very few heated him there,

627
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,460
but like the earlier prophets,

628
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:16,150
Jeremiah also balanced his message
with a message of constellation.

629
00:39:16,151 --> 00:39:20,020
And there's some very interesting and
unique features of Jeremiah's message of

630
00:39:20,021 --> 00:39:20,920
consolation.

631
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:25,000
These are particularly these passages or
found particularly in chapters 30 to 33

632
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,850
where we have more
hopeful, um, prophecies.

633
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:32,740
He envisages a restoration.
The exile will come to an end.

634
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,881
And in fact,

635
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:38,881
Jeremiah is the first to actually set a
time limit to what we might refer to as

636
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:42,430
the dominion of the idolaters and
idolaters holding sway over God's people.

637
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,310
And that time limit,
and he says is 70 years.

638
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:50,500
Jeremiah writes a letter to
the first group of deportees.

639
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:55,030
So remember the first siege and five
97 you have the king killed his son and

640
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:57,160
many people taken into exile in Babylon.

641
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:01,840
Jeremiah from Jerusalem writes a letter
to that first group of exiles and it's

642
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:02,740
quite remarkable.

643
00:40:02,741 --> 00:40:06,550
It's found in chapter 29 and it's
quite remarkable for its council.

644
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:10,480
It's advice to the exiles to settle down
and their adopted home and just wait

645
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:13,090
out.
The time there is an appointed end,

646
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:17,440
he warns the people not to listen to
prophets who say you will return shortly.

647
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,760
It's just a lie.

648
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:23,290
The Israelites have to serve the king of
Babylon and by doing so, they will live.

649
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:28,300
So in Jeremiah 29 versus four to seven,
thus said,

650
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:31,330
the Lord of hosts, the God of
Israel, to the whole community,

651
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:35,440
which I exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon.
Nice. He's writing to the exiles,

652
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:40,030
build houses and live in them.
Plant gardens and eat their fruit.

653
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,800
Take wives and beget sons and daughters
and take wives for your sons and give

654
00:40:44,801 --> 00:40:48,640
your daughters to husbands that they may
bear sons and daughters. Multiply there.

655
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:53,641
Do not decrease and seek the welfare of
the city to which I have exiled you said

656
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:55,400
of seek the welfare of Jerusalem.

657
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:59,380
Seek the welfare of the city to which I
have exiled you and pray to the Lord and

658
00:40:59,381 --> 00:41:03,250
its behalf for in its prosperity,
you shall prosper.

659
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,720
In other words,

660
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:09,190
you're in for the long
haul and you shouldn't be
deceived by the idle dreams or

661
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:12,820
the false prophets, uh, who tell
you that return is imminent.

662
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:17,020
God has other plans. They are
plants for welfare, not for evil.

663
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:22,000
And they will give you a future
and a hope. At the end of 70 years,

664
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:26,680
Jeremiah said there will be a great war
of all the nations and Judah and Israel

665
00:41:26,681 --> 00:41:28,300
will be returned to their land.

666
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,960
Xi'An he declared would be acknowledged
as the holy city and a new Davidic king

667
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,110
would rein new covenant would
be made with Israel as well.

668
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:44,030
And this time Jeremiah says
it's a covenant that will
be etched on the heart in

669
00:41:44,031 --> 00:41:46,160
coded as it were into human nature.

670
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,060
Jeremiah 31 verses 31 to 34 see,

671
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:52,190
a time is coming declares the Lord.

672
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:55,970
When I will make a new covenant with the
House of Israel and the House of Judah,

673
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:59,870
it will not be like the Covenant I made
with their fathers when I took them by

674
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:03,560
the hand to lead them out of the land
of Egypt to covenant which they broke so

675
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:05,600
that I rejected them,
declares the Lord,

676
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,320
but such as the covenant I will make
with the house of Israel after these days

677
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:10,190
declares the Lord.

678
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:15,560
I will put my teaching into their inmost
being and inscribe it upon their hearts

679
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,620
and then I will be their God
and they shall be my people.

680
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,890
And no longer will they need to teach
one another and say to one another,

681
00:42:21,891 --> 00:42:23,660
he'd the Lord for all of them,

682
00:42:23,661 --> 00:42:27,440
from the least of them to the greatest
shall he'd me, declares the Lord.

683
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,920
So this is a remarkable idea.
It seems to express some,

684
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:33,650
some dissatisfaction with
the element of free will,

685
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:38,030
which is otherwise so crucial to the
biblical notion of Covenant and Morality.

686
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:41,810
The idea that humans freely
choose their actions. After all,

687
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:45,200
when you think about some of the major
themes set out in the Hebrew Bible at the

688
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:49,880
very beginning and the opening
chapters, um, this would seem to be, uh,

689
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:53,120
a cardinal principle choice,

690
00:42:53,121 --> 00:42:56,720
but free choice does mean of course
that there will be bad choices and there

691
00:42:56,721 --> 00:43:00,770
will be disobedience and evil
and people can get tired of that.

692
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,450
And Jeremiah was so,
his utopian ideal is inspiring,

693
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:07,910
but it does eliminate
the element of free will.

694
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:12,500
It seems to describe a situation in
which humans are almost hardwired to obey

695
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:13,580
God's covenant.

696
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:17,420
And that's attention that will also
be developed in some later texts.

697
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:21,320
I just note it here in a
very beautiful passage.

698
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,370
Jeremiah describes a future
restoration of the temple,

699
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:29,630
the bringing up offerings. Again,
the singing of psalms and praise.

700
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:35,180
And this is in contrast to chapter 25
they're in chapter 25 he warned that God

701
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:38,600
will banish the sound of mirth
and gladness, the voice of bride,

702
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:41,360
groom and bride leaving
the land desolate ruin.

703
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:45,800
And now in his article of
Constellation, Jeremiah says, and again,

704
00:43:45,801 --> 00:43:49,220
there shall be heard in this place in
the towns of Judah and the streets of

705
00:43:49,221 --> 00:43:53,060
Jerusalem that are desolate without
men, without inhabitants, without beast,

706
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:56,630
the sound of Mirth and gladness,
the voice of bridegroom and bride,

707
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:59,870
the voice of those who cry give
thanks to the Lord of hosts,

708
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:02,870
for the Lord is good for his kindness,
his everlasting,

709
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,810
as they bring Thanksgiving
offerings to the house of the Lord,

710
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,740
for I will restore the fortunes of
the land as of old, said the Lord.

711
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:13,730
So just to kind of summarize these,

712
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:16,910
these profits leading up to the time
of the destruction, because next,

713
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:21,170
next time we'll be talking about
the exile and and later the return.

714
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:26,090
But the fall of Jerusalem
shattered the national and,

715
00:44:26,091 --> 00:44:29,990
and territorial basis of
Israel's culture and religion.

716
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,700
The had burned the temple to the ground.

717
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:37,230
They carried away most of the people
to exile, to live in exile in Babylon,

718
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,910
leaving behind mostly members of of the
lower classes to eke out a living, um,

719
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:42,960
as best they could.

720
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:48,350
And it was the completion of a tragedy
that had begun centuries earlier and it

721
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:52,620
was interpreted as a fulfillment
of the covenant curses.

722
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:55,140
It was the end of the Davidic monarchy,

723
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:59,250
although the Deuteronomistic historian
does close with this note that the son of

724
00:44:59,251 --> 00:45:02,880
your holy Jakeem was alive
and living in Babylon,

725
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,200
kind of holding out hope that the
line had actually been killed out. Um,

726
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,340
I haven't, uh, been completely wiped out,

727
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,900
but the institutions seemed to
have come to an end for now. Um,

728
00:45:12,901 --> 00:45:14,640
it was the end of the temple,
the end of the priesthood,

729
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:17,250
the end of Israel as a nation
is that an autonomous nation.

730
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,640
And so the Israelites were confronted
with a great test as I've stressed before.

731
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:27,180
One option would be to see in these
events a signal that Yahweh had abandoned

732
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:32,181
them to or had been defeated by the
god of the Babylonians and Marduk would

733
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:36,780
replace Yaffe way as the
Israelites assimilated
themselves into their new home,

734
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,750
and certainly there were
Israelites who went this route,

735
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:44,430
but others who were firmly rooted
and exclusive. Yeah, wisdom did not,

736
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,560
and they're the ones who left us there.
Literature.

737
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:52,430
How could this faith survive outside
the framework of Israelite National

738
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:58,020
Culture, away from the temple and
the land uprooted and scattered?

739
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:01,830
Could Israelite religion survive
without these national foundations and

740
00:46:01,831 --> 00:46:06,180
institutions and on foreign soil or
would it go the way of other national

741
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:07,014
religions?

742
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,430
You hear the pain and the despair that
would have been experienced at this time.

743
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,470
In the words of the Psalmist,

744
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:18,030
Psalm one 37 which is written at
this time by the rivers of Babylon.

745
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,020
There we sat,

746
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:23,160
sat and wept as we thought
of Zion there on the poplars,

747
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:27,330
we hung up our liars for our captors.
Ask us there for songs,

748
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,470
our tormentors for amusement.
Sing us one of the songs of Zion.

749
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:36,540
How can we sing a song of the Lord on
Alien Soil? If I forget you o Jerusalem,

750
00:46:36,541 --> 00:46:39,750
let my right hand,
whether that my tongue stick to my palate,

751
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:43,680
if I cease to think of you,
if I do not keep Jerusalem in memory,

752
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:45,330
even at my happiest hour.

753
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:50,220
And it was the message of the profits
that helped some Israelites make sense of

754
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:54,720
their situation in a manner that kept
them distinct and invulnerable to

755
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:55,560
assimilation.

756
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,820
And this was probably the reason for the
preservation of the prophetic writings,

757
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:04,200
even though they had often been despised
or an unheated in their own lifetimes.

758
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,580
Yeah, why hadn't been defeated? They
claimed the nation's calamities.

759
00:47:08,581 --> 00:47:11,850
We're not disproof of his power and
covenant. They were proof of it.

760
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:15,900
The prophets had spoken truly when they
had said that destruction would follow

761
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:20,070
if the people didn't turn from their moral
and religious violations of God's law.

762
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,950
So that rather than
undermining faith in God,

763
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:27,330
the defeat and the exile when interpreted
in the prophetic manner had the

764
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:32,331
potential to convince Jews of the need
to show absolute and undivided devotion

765
00:47:32,381 --> 00:47:35,800
to God and his commandments.
So that paradoxically,

766
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,840
the moment of greatest national despair
could be transformed by the profits into

767
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:44,380
an occasion for it.
The renewal of religious faith,

768
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,930
the great contribution of the profits
was their emphasis on God's desire for

769
00:47:49,931 --> 00:47:54,190
morality as expressed in
the ancient covenant there.

770
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:59,220
The great contribution of Jeremiah was
his insistence on God's everlasting

771
00:47:59,381 --> 00:48:02,620
covenant with his people,
even outside the land of Israel.

772
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:06,670
And despite the loss of national religious
symbols, the temple, the holy city,

773
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:07,660
the Davidic King,

774
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:12,760
and this insistence that the faithful
person's relationship with God wasn't

775
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:17,380
broken even in an idolatrous land when
added to Jeremiah as notion of a new

776
00:48:17,381 --> 00:48:18,130
covenant,

777
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:22,960
provided the exiles with the ideas that
would transform the nation of Israel

778
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:24,700
into the religion of Judaism.

779
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:29,790
And next time we're going to turn to to
post destruction profits who also helped

780
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:33,820
the nation formulate a viable response
to the tragedy that had befallen them.

781
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:37,510
This is a point at which we can
begin to use words like Judaism.
