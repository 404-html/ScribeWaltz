1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,390
We're going to move on now to
our second literary profit.

2
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:06,810
And this is the Prophet Hosea.
He was a native of the northern kingdom.

3
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:07,920
So Amos and Hosea,

4
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:10,710
you're going to associate with the
Assyrian crisis and they profits of the

5
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:14,550
northern Kingdom of Israel.
He's prophesying in the time of Jeroboam.

6
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:19,130
The second Jeroboam reigned
until about seven 47. Okay. Um,

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,140
and then he continues to the last
king who is confusingly named Hosea.

8
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,130
Uh, so he prophesies in the
seven forties, thirties, 20s,

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,180
somewhere in there. He doesn't seem
to have seen the fall of Israel,

10
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:34,890
though now,

11
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:39,180
Hosea is considered by many to be the
most difficult of the prophetic books.

12
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:42,750
The Hebrew is very difficult. Um, and
it sometimes seems rather garbled.

13
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,180
It's very hard to render it intelligibly.

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,870
But structurally we can divide
the book into two main sections.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,630
Chapters one to three have
a certain coherence to them.

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,790
And then chapters four through 14,

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,260
one to three tells of the profits
marriage to a promiscuous woman named

18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,360
[inaudible]. Um, this is, uh,

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,320
his marriage is a metaphor for
Israel's relationship with God.

20
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,340
And these chapters also contain
an indictment or a lawsuit.

21
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:11,220
Remember this Reeve form lawsuit form.

22
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:14,580
We're going to see it both in
Hosea and Amos. Isaiah today.

23
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,310
Then chapters four through 14 contain
Oracle's primarily Oracle's against the

24
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:22,740
nations,
but also against the Kingdom of Israel.

25
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,670
We're going to be focusing primarily on
chapters one to three since these are so

26
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:31,230
distinctive to Hosea and we'll refer
occasionally to some of the other chapters

27
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,270
where they might pronounce. I'm an
important theme for Hosea, so again,

28
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:39,780
the historical background for the
book of Hosea is the Assyrian threat.

29
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,770
The Assyrians are wiping out a number of
the smaller states in the ancient near

30
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,570
east,
the middle of the 18th century,

31
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,540
and Israel obviously
could not be far behind,

32
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,610
and the line that was taken by Hosea was
to condemn the attempts that were made

33
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:54,570
by various kings,

34
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:59,571
by Israel's kings to withstand defeat
or to avoid defeat at the hands of a

35
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:02,880
Syria.
If a Syria was going to conquer Israel,

36
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,440
Hosea said then it was God's just
punishment and to fight against it,

37
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,610
to fight against the inevitable with
simply another kind of rejection of God.

38
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,160
Another rejection of
his plans and purpose.

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,240
It demonstrate a lack of trust
or faith in the power of God.

40
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,570
Hosea 10 verse 13 spells out
the disastrous consequences
of trusting in human

41
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,990
power or foreign alliances
rather than trusting in God.

42
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:31,890
And this is a theme that we'll see
occurring again and again. Hosea 10 13,

43
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,160
you'd have plowed wickedness.
You have reaped iniquity,

44
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,120
and you shall eat the fruits of treasure
treachery because you relied on your

45
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:43,410
way on your host of warriors.
He was suggesting in action.

46
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,660
Now that surely would have
been viewed by the king and uh,

47
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,850
the court as against all reason.
But this was Jose,

48
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:54,600
his insistence Israel was
faced with a choice, uh,

49
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,630
who and whom should she placed her trust
in God or in human leaders and their

50
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:01,954
armies?

51
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,640
Hosea one seven a go so far as to suggest
that actually the moment of decision

52
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,200
has passed for the northern kingdom.

53
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,060
There's still some hope
for the southern kingdom,

54
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:12,670
but the northern kingdom has obviously
made its choice than it was the wrong

55
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:15,940
choice. Um, Hosea says that God says,

56
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,060
I will no longer accept the
house of Israel or part in them,

57
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,690
but I will accept the house of Judah
and I will give them victory through the

58
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:25,000
Lord, their God, right? Victory
through the Lord their God.

59
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:28,840
I will not give them victory with Bo and
sword and battled by horses and riders,

60
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,870
right? If you think that's what gives
you victory, you're mistaken. Some.

61
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:35,980
See that verse as perhaps
a later interpolation into
Hosea has such a positive

62
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:37,690
assessment of the southern kingdom,

63
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,120
but there is this sense
of impending disaster that
resonates throughout the book

64
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:48,121
of Hosea Chapter Eight verse seven they
so wind and they shall reap whirlwind

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,860
standing stocks devoid of ears and
yielding no flour. If they do yield,

66
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:57,400
any strangers shall devour it.
Israel is bewildered,

67
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,940
so the catastrophe is unavoidable and
Jose has often been described as painting

68
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:07,300
a portrait of unrelieved,
a gloom. It's very grim.

69
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,970
He seems to hold out no
real hope for Israel.

70
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,420
She has to pay the price
for her infidelity to God,

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,780
but we need to look a little more
closely at some of the themes of the book

72
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,900
before we accept that evaluation entirely.

73
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,650
And I think the one overarching theme
that helps us organize most of the

74
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:27,760
material in the book of Hosea and one
that shows it's deep indebtedness to or

75
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:31,210
interconnectedness with the book of
Deuteronomy is the theme of Covenant.

76
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:33,040
Particularly Deuteronomy
is notion of covenant.

77
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,910
So I've put covenant at the top there
and we see the theme being played out in

78
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:40,420
several different ways. The first
I've just discussed as, yeah,

79
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,110
Hawaii is covenant partner as a
vassal of the covenant partner. Yeah.

80
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:48,160
Way The sovereign Israel should be
placing her confidence entirely in yeah.

81
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:50,290
Outweigh any foreign alliance.

82
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,620
Any alliance with Egypt against
a Syria for example, is,

83
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,990
is against the terms of that,
that covenant,

84
00:04:55,991 --> 00:05:00,400
that exclusive treaty between God and
Israel and she should not be relying on

85
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,980
her military might, but relying
on the southern, the Susan.

86
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,460
So anything short of complete trust in
halfways power to save the vassal Israel

87
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:10,570
is a violation of the
terms of the covenant.

88
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:12,370
So we see it in the
notion of it's confidence,

89
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:15,220
exclusive confidence and
trust in God and his power.

90
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,450
A second way in which the theme of
Covenant is expressed is found in Jose,

91
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:23,110
has denunciation of social
injustice and moral decay.

92
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:26,260
And of course this is a theme
that's common to the profits.

93
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,030
Here he follows Amos, but uh,
he's now the first two couch,

94
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:35,680
his charge in the form of this,
a formal review or lawsuit.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,630
He's a in which God is said to bring a
charge against Israel for violating the

96
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:43,990
terms of the covenant for breach of
Covenant. This happens in chapter four,

97
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:45,490
the first three verses of chapter four,

98
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:50,491
Israel's charged and Hosea
employs language that
deliberately invokes the deck.

99
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:53,440
A log. Here are the word of the Lord. Oh,

100
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:55,900
people of Israel for the Lord has a case,

101
00:05:55,901 --> 00:06:00,200
a lawsuit against the inhabitants of
this land because there is no honesty and

102
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:04,130
no goodness and know obedience to
God in the land. False swearing,

103
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,300
dishonesty and murder and theft
and adultery are rife, right?

104
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:12,620
Picking out key terms from the
decalogue, false swearing, murder, theft,

105
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:14,630
and adult free,
which of course occurred a threesome.

106
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:17,690
And the decalogue crime are rife.
These things are rife.

107
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:21,530
Crime follows upon crime.
For that the earth is withered.

108
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,910
Everything that dwells on it languishes
beasts of the field and birds of the sky,

109
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,460
even the fish of the sea parish.

110
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,220
Unlike Amos,

111
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,250
Hosea also engages in a prolonged or
sustained condemnation of Israel's

112
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:40,470
religious faithfulness,
which is termed in it,

113
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,570
which is figured in terms of
adultery. Um, and so here again,

114
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:49,571
the theme of Covenant is dominant and
organizes the profits presentation to

115
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:52,580
represent Israel's faith.

116
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:57,670
Faithlessness he invokes other types of
covenantal relationships as metaphors.

117
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,530
Most notably the metaphor of marriage.
Marriage can be referred to as a breed,

118
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,530
as a covenant between a husband and wife.
And so it's an appropriate metaphor.

119
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,350
And we see it primarily in
chapters one through three.

120
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,260
He addresses the relationship between,
yeah,

121
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:15,110
white and Israel through
the metaphor of marriage.

122
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,140
And Israel is the
unfaithful adulterous wife.

123
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,170
He describes in Lurid terms,

124
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,200
her lecherous addiction to images and
idols for adulterous worship of Baal.

125
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,530
He points to the nations
leaders and their failures,

126
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:31,850
the kings and the priests there,

127
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:35,420
failure to prevent the people's
waywardness there debauchery.

128
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,140
The first chapter is
reported in the third person.

129
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,410
And this contains God's command to Hosea,

130
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,590
to marry a promiscuous woman as a symbol
of God's own marriage with a faceless

131
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:50,300
wife, Israel. Go get yourself.

132
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:54,290
A wife of whoredom and a children of
whoredom for the land will stray from

133
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,590
following the Lord.
So he marries this woman named Gomer,

134
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,340
and she bears three children who
have very in auspicious names.

135
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,230
These names are symbolic of God's anger
over Israel's religious infidelity.

136
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Jezreel Jezreel because God plans to
punish Jay who for his slaughter of the

137
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:16,820
House of Ahab.
Even though Ahab was no favorite of God,

138
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:21,110
you still should not raise
your hand against the Lord's
anointed. Um, and so Jay,

139
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:23,150
who will have to be, um, I have,

140
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:26,240
will have to be avenged Jay who
will have to be punished at Jezreel,

141
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:30,170
which is where the murder happened.
Lo Ruca mob, which means not loved,

142
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:31,100
not forgiven,

143
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,240
because God will no longer love or
forgive or part in the house of Israel.

144
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,900
And the third child's name
is low. Amit, not my people.

145
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,620
A sign that God has
dissolved the Covenant Bond.

146
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:46,520
He's rejected Israel as
his people divorced Israel.

147
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,850
There really could be no more stark
and shocking denial of the covenant.

148
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,790
Then this chapter three
contains a first person.

149
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:02,340
Hosea was first person account
of God's command to him. Um,

150
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,970
there had said that God
commands him to be friend,

151
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,360
although he seems to hire
a woman on condition that
she not consort with others.

152
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,040
The woman again symbolizes Israel,

153
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:18,870
who's brought into an exclusive
relationship that requires her to remain

154
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:22,800
faithful to one party in contrast
to her customary behavior.

155
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,000
And then sandwiched between
chapter one and chapter three,

156
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,570
both of which have the accounts of these
relationships that are metaphors for

157
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:30,840
God.

158
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,550
And Israel's relationship sandwiched
between them is the almost schizophrenia a

159
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:40,080
chapter two. It contains
again, this sustained violent,

160
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:44,430
very violent account on the
faithless wife on faithless Israel.

161
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,430
Um,
and God's formal declaration of divorce.

162
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,630
She is not my wife and I am not her
husband. This would affect a divorce,

163
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,350
the statement uttered by a husband.
Um, we have that in verse four,

164
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,970
and yet this is also,

165
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:01,971
this chapter also contains a very
gentle and very loving portrait of

166
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:03,270
reconciliation.

167
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,290
And it's in that portrait of
reconciliation that we see.

168
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:11,760
Another aspect of the covenant concept
emerge and aspect that was again,

169
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:16,620
most pronounced in the book of
Deuteronomy as Israel's covenant partner.

170
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:21,360
God loves Israel and he actually
longs for her faithfulness,

171
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,060
this steadfast covenantal love.

172
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:26,540
One of the words that's
used repeatedly is crested,

173
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,100
but it refers to a special kind
of steadfast love, loyal love, um,

174
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,670
this covenantal love.

175
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,670
We'll reconcile God to wayward Israel
just as Hosea is reunited or reconciled

176
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:42,810
with his faithless wife. And
then the profit imagines a, uh,

177
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,650
a return to the wilderness.
And you know,

178
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,210
God is imagining what it
would be wonderful if we
could return to the Wilderness

179
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,650
and covenant again.

180
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,430
And this time it would even be a
permanent and eternal marriage.

181
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,340
And the three children who
were cast off at birth,

182
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,400
they will be redeemed and
accepted by their father.

183
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,710
Those are some of the ideas
contained in this passage.

184
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:06,240
This is Hosea to verses 16
to 25 the reconciliation.

185
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,101
Assuredly,

186
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:12,720
I will speak coaxing Lee to her and lead
her through the wilderness and speak to

187
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:13,554
her tenderly.

188
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,640
I will give her vineyards from there
and the valley of a whore as a plow,

189
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,510
land of hope.

190
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,380
And there she shall respond as in the
days of her youth when she came up from

191
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,370
the land of Egypt.

192
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,240
So the period of the exodus and
wandering as it is romantically imagined,

193
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:30,960
and as this time of a very good and close
relationship between God and Israel.

194
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,230
And in that day you will call me,
he,

195
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:38,010
she and no more will you call me by Ali?
This is a pun.

196
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,690
Both of these words can mean my
husband. He, she is my man, a male.

197
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,630
And Bali is my Lord. Women would have
used both for their husbands, but,

198
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,100
but I'll obviously has
connotations with the god by Baal.

199
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,650
So instead of calling me Bali, my
bottle, you will call me. He, she,

200
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:58,651
my husband using a word that's free of
connotations for I will remove the names

201
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:03,130
of the by Aleem from her mouth and they
shall never more be mentioned by name.

202
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,331
In that day,

203
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:07,690
I will make a covenant for them with
the beasts of the field and the birds of

204
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:11,310
the air and the creeping things of the
ground and I will banish bow and sword

205
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:12,430
and war from the land.

206
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,380
Thus I will let them lie down and
safety and I will espouse you forever.

207
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,730
Back to the marriage metaphor,

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,170
I will espouse you with righteousness
and justice and with goodness and mercy

209
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,860
and I will espouse you with faithfulness
and then you shall be devoted to the

210
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:29,860
Lord. In that day I will
respond, declares the Lord.

211
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:33,790
I will respond to the sky and it shall
respond to the earth and the Earth shall

212
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:38,791
respond with new grain and wine and
oil and they shall respond to Jezreel.

213
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,030
The first of the children.

214
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,290
I will sew her in the land as my
own gesture was a fertile valley,

215
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,820
not just a place of war and death.
And I will take Lu, low rue,

216
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:52,420
c'mon not loved back in favor
and I will say to low Ami,

217
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,740
not my people. You are my people and
he will respond to you are my God.

218
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,600
So Hosea isn't unrelatedly
gloomy and grim.

219
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,630
It does provide these images,

220
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:08,020
these very stirring images of hope
and consolation and reconciliation.

221
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,300
Us who,
uh,

222
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,010
almost also held out hope in the form
of a remnant that would survive the

223
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:16,210
inevitable destruction.

224
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,080
So we need to think about
the two traditions that
prophets like Amos and Hosea

225
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,840
are drawing on in this
combined message of doom.

226
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:28,270
On the one hand and hope on the other.

227
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,490
Really what the profits are doing is
drawing on to conceptions of covenant.

228
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:37,780
The two conceptions that we saw in our
study of the pen attukal material and on

229
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:41,200
into a Samuel.
On the one hand,

230
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:46,000
they recognize the unconditional and
eternal irrevocable covenant, right?

231
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:51,040
That God established with the Patriarchs
as well as the eternal covenant with

232
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,540
David,
with the house of David.

233
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,490
Those covenants were the basis for the
belief that God would never forsake his

234
00:13:57,491 --> 00:14:00,100
people. But on the other hand, of course,

235
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,640
they placed emphasis on the covenant
at Sinai. It's a conditional covenant.

236
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:08,350
It requires the people's obedience to
moral, religious and civil laws, uh,

237
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:12,670
in the Covenant Code. And it threatens
punishment for their violation.

238
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,670
So the profits are playing
with both of these themes.

239
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,480
Israel has violated the
Senate edit covenant and the
curses that are stipulated

240
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:24,070
by the Covenant Must Follow National
Destruction and even exile they will

241
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,540
follow.
They have to,

242
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,810
but alienation from God is not and
never will be complete and irreparable

243
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,210
because of the unconditional covenant,
the Covenant With the Patriarchs,

244
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:38,920
the covenant with the House of David.
So Israel will be God's people forever,

245
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,040
despite temporary alienations alienation,

246
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,790
the notion of election and active,

247
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,710
purely undeserved or unmerited favor.
And Love on God's part,

248
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,960
not do in any way to a special merit
of the people undergirds the prophetic

249
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,620
message of consolation.

250
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,750
And Hosea Paints a very poignant
and moving portrait of this special,

251
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:07,820
um, and indissoluble love that God
bears for Israel. And in doing so,

252
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:12,470
he draws on a second metaphors.
So, um, we've had the
metaphor of husband and wife,

253
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:14,780
which is a kind of
covenantal relationship.

254
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,120
We also have the metaphor of parents' son,

255
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:21,440
which can also be understood in terms of
a covenant with obligations. All right.

256
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,200
The, the parent's son, um,

257
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,880
relationship entails loyalty and love,
but also obligation.

258
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,960
Um, one of the obligations that is
understood to fall on the parent is the

259
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:37,670
obligation of disciplining I rebellious
or ungrateful child while never

260
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:38,810
forsaking that child.

261
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,200
So that's a model that works very
well with the prophetic message.

262
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:47,330
Hosea 11 one through four. And then
skipping to verses eight through nine,

263
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:53,060
I fell in love with Israel when he was
still a child and I have called him my

264
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:57,620
son ever since Egypt, thus where they
called, but they went their own way.

265
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,370
They sacrificed about Aleem
and offered a carved images.

266
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,120
I have pampered f fry him, another
name for Israel, right? If Ryan,

267
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,240
I have pampered efrein
taking them in my arms,

268
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,530
but they have ignored my healing care.
I drew them with human ties,

269
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:13,640
with cords of love,

270
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,050
but I seem to them as one who imposed a
yoke on their jaws though I was offering

271
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:22,490
them food. How can I give you up?
Oh, if Ryan, how surrender you.

272
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:27,170
Oh Israel, how can I make you like
admire or render you like Zavala, Iem,

273
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,560
other foreign places?
I have had a change of heart.

274
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,100
All my tenderness is stirred.
I will not act on my wrath,

275
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,000
will not turn to destroy a fry
them for I am God, not man,

276
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:39,410
the holy one in your midst.

277
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,620
I will not come and fury if
these alternating passages
of violent rejection and

278
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:49,790
tender,
tender love and reconciliation,

279
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:56,060
and with these alternating passages,
the profit is able to capture or convey.

280
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,070
I'm a passionate struggle taking
place in the heart of God, right?

281
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,950
They're giving us that passionate
emotional portrait of God.

282
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,360
It's the struggle of a lover who's
torn between his jealous wrath and his

283
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,360
undying love.
And it's a struggle that is one,

284
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,870
ultimately by love because
God cannot let Israel go.

285
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,340
We're going to see that each of the
profits we look at holds these two, um,

286
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,770
covenantal ideas,
intention,

287
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,810
and they will emphasize one or the other
depending on the particular situation,

288
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:29,690
the particular historical situation.
Sometimes in a,

289
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,690
when it's a time of
relative ease or comfort,

290
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,740
then the prophet emphasizes
the violations of the Senate.

291
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,800
It covenant the punishment that will
inevitably come, uh, for these violations.

292
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:43,250
And they'll downplay God's
eternal commitment to his people.

293
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,380
But in times of despair and suffering
and destruction than the profit may point

294
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:52,170
out that violations of the covenant
where the cause of the distress,

295
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:56,520
but they will emphasize God's undying
love for Israel and hold out hope.

296
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:58,290
Therefore for a better future.

297
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,840
Now we're going to leave the northern
profits and move to southern prophets.

298
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:08,280
Isaiah is a, well, Isaiah is
the longest prophetic book. Um,

299
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:13,470
the interpretation of many passages in
the book of Isaiah as symbolic references

300
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:18,210
to Jesus make it one of the most quoted
books of the Bible by Christians.

301
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,870
Um, Isaiah was a contemporary
of Amos and Hosea, right?

302
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:23,940
Second half of the eighth century.

303
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,030
He was active for a
little bit longer period.

304
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:30,300
He was active into about the six nineties,
somewhere in there,

305
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,950
but he prophesied in the southern
Kingdom of Judah when the Assyrian Empire

306
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:37,620
threatened and destroyed
the northern kingdom, right?

307
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,540
Northern Kingdom falls seven 22. Uh, and
then of course was threatening Judah.

308
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,680
So he's active for over 50 years
and he counsels Judas Kings,

309
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,140
he counsels them through to sieges.

310
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:54,000
I've listed these for you to see just
seven 34 where he counsels King Ahaz and

311
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:58,680
then the siege of seven Oh one
where he counsels his son, um,

312
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,620
has a kia or he's Kia Hezekiah.
Okay.

313
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,130
Give you a little bit of a historical
background to these sieges so you

314
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:05,731
understand them.

315
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:09,360
But those are the main dates that can
help orient your approach to Isaiah.

316
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,320
We have excellent evidence, by the
way, for, for all of these events.

317
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:14,610
In the Assyrian sources.

318
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:18,960
And also archeological finds
the archeological fines
show destruction by the

319
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:22,560
Assyrians at the places that we believe
were destroyed at the times they were

320
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:26,910
destroyed.
But this is what happened in seven 34.

321
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,810
You have the Assyrians who at this time
or undertake lot Palliser and they're

322
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:32,910
extending their control
through the region region.

323
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:34,650
So they're coming from the north east.

324
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,200
So first they're going to hit a rum in
Syria and then advanced on the northern

325
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:45,030
kingdom of Israel. So a rum and
Israel joined together in an alliance.

326
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:47,820
They're trying to resist
the advancing Assyrians.

327
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,380
Judah refuse to join the alliance. All
right. The southern kingdom refused.

328
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,540
So in anger or Ramen, Israel moves
out and lay siege to Jerusalem.

329
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,880
So the first stage of the sea,
just seven 34,

330
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:04,410
is actually a siege of Jerusalem by the
northern Kingdom of Israel in alliance

331
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,760
with Aaron Mans.

332
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,710
They were trying to force Judas
cooperation in standing against to Syria.

333
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,610
King Ahaz of Jerusalem of Judah,
um,

334
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,810
decided to appeal to a Syria
for help to tig. Left the pie.

335
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,520
Pi Leazar for help. He submits to the
Assyrians. Have a vet as a vassal.

336
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:24,480
He pays tribute.

337
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:27,810
We have a record of the tribute that was
paid and the Assyrian records and seven

338
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:31,440
34 and this action is condemned
by the biblical writers.

339
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:35,860
The Deuteronomistic historian in second
kings 16 condemns this action. Um,

340
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:40,730
Isaiah also condemns it. So Judah
has made itself vassal to, uh,

341
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,583
Syria.

342
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,680
And this is the case until
has his son has a Kaia,

343
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,290
decides that he will assert
the nation's independence.

344
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,660
The Assyrians are angry about this.

345
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:55,150
This is now after the fall of
the northern kingdom of Israel.

346
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:59,080
These Syrians are angry
and under, um, Sinica ribs.

347
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:04,180
They attack, they devastate many of the
cities and the countryside. And again,

348
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:08,050
archaeology confirms what we know from
the Assyrian records and they advance on

349
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:10,750
Jerusalem and lay siege to
Jerusalem and seven oh one.

350
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:16,120
And just as he had counseled, uh, King
Ahaz Israel, now councils has a Kia.

351
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,210
In the end,
Jerusalem wasn't destroyed.

352
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,880
Heavy tribute was paid to these Syrians,

353
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,830
but eventually the Assyrians did withdraw.

354
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:26,500
They were overextended to a large degree.
All right.

355
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:28,110
That's the general historical background.

356
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,280
We'll come back to some of
the details in a minute,

357
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,120
but let me first give you a sense of
the general structure of this very large

358
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:38,770
book of the claim that the
prophetic books are anthologies,

359
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,180
anthologies of oracles and other materials
compiled by the prophet or by his

360
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:48,060
disciples. That is to say
schools, um, that, uh, kept, uh,

361
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,910
set of prophecies and then added to those
core prophecies because of their firm

362
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:54,590
belief in their continuing relevance.
Um,

363
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,440
that portrait of the anthological
nature of prophetic books is really a

364
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,110
demonstrate demonstrable
in the book of Isaiah.

365
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,140
I've put the basic
structure up there for you.

366
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:08,560
The first 11 chapters contain memoirs.

367
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:12,340
Chapter one sets out some of the
basic themes of Isaiah, but, uh,

368
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:14,890
we have a lot of first person narrative.

369
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,710
Then we have various
Oracle's against Israel. Um,

370
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,850
some of this material refers
to the attacks on Jerusalem,

371
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:23,920
especially the siege of seven oh one.

372
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,390
And there seems to be a kind of
concluding him in chapter 12.

373
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,100
We then have about 11 chapters of
Oracle's against foreign nations.

374
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,760
If that's a form that we also saw an
almost and Jose and denouncing foreign

375
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:40,080
nations from chapters 13 to 23.
Um,

376
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,270
I'm skipping over chapters 24 to 27.

377
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,280
They are a little apocalypse,

378
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:49,600
the sort of mythological vision of the
end of days and that probably dates to a

379
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,340
much later time.
The sixth century,

380
00:22:51,341 --> 00:22:55,600
that was the time in which the
apocalyptic genre was really developing.

381
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,100
So we skip over that.

382
00:22:57,101 --> 00:23:00,960
We don't think of that as associated
with the historical Isaiah and move on to

383
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,850
chapters 28 to 33 here.

384
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:08,350
We turned from Oracle's against foreign
nations to Oracle's against Judah and

385
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:11,590
Israel and the relationship with Egypt,
right?

386
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:15,520
This is a time where caught between
these two powers, Egypt and Assyria. Um,

387
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,840
Judah is, is trying to figure out
with whom to make alliances, right?

388
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:22,710
Should she cast her lot
with Egypt and so on. Um,

389
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,650
and these are from a slightly later
period down towards the siege of seven oh

390
00:23:26,651 --> 00:23:29,140
one.
And they include accounts of um,

391
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:34,150
Isaiah's council to two has a Kia in
seven oh one 34 and 35 we'll kind of skip

392
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:35,560
over for now.

393
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,560
These also are post Zelig insertions
and then chapters 36 to 39.

394
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:45,470
This is third person historical
narrative and it is in fact, um,

395
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,780
second kings chapters 18 to 20.

396
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:50,630
That material has simply
been inserted here.

397
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:53,690
So those three chapters
appear here in Isaiah.

398
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:56,420
It's the story of the
invasion of snuff a rib,

399
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,740
the interactions of Isaiah and Hezekiah
during the siege and seven oh one.

400
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:06,260
So I'm stopping at chapter 39 even though
there are 66 chapters in the book of

401
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:09,380
Isaiah because most scholars agree,
I think this is,

402
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,940
this is really a very strong consensus
that the remaining material is not the

403
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:15,560
work of Isaiah of Jerusalem.

404
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,700
It dates to a period long
after Isaiah's lifetime.

405
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,890
I've already mentioned the apocalypse,

406
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:23,960
which we think was probably
from the sixth century.

407
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:28,490
That's embedded in their
chapters 24 to 27. But the other,

408
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,060
the remaining material we
speak of in two main sections,

409
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,400
we refer to these as second Isaiah.
And third,

410
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:37,850
Isaiah chapters 40 to 55,

411
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,230
which we refer to as second
Isaiah, assume a, um,

412
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:47,090
a historical setting,
which is in which Babylon is dominating,

413
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:51,770
not Assyria. Um, and so we see that
as coming at a much later time,

414
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,600
chapters 56 to 66 re
referred to as Third Isaiah.

415
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,080
This material contains oracles that
are spread throughout the eighth to the

416
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,030
fifth centuries.
Um,

417
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:06,500
so we will consider those
on another occasion in their
proper historical context.

418
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:11,530
Right now we're looking at the material
that is most likely a attributable to

419
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:13,970
first Isaiah to Isaiah of Jerusalem.

420
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:19,850
The book also contains material that is
a repetition of material found elsewhere.

421
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,980
Um, we've, I've already noted second kings
18 to 20 appears here, but in addition,

422
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:27,500
you have snatches of verses
that appear in other places.

423
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:32,390
So Isaiah two verses two to four I
founded Micah and the book of Micah four

424
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:33,320
verses one to four.

425
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:38,570
Jeremiah 48 is essentially
equivalent to Isaiah 15 and 16.

426
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:43,810
So this kind of repetition among or
between different books illustrates again,

427
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:47,810
the anthological nature of
the prophetic corpuses right,

428
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:49,250
that these prophetic corpus,

429
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:53,420
that these were works that were compiled
from material that sometimes circulated

430
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:58,190
in more than one school. So if we turn
now to the major themes of Isaiah,

431
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,510
let's note first the common ground
between Isaiah and the prophets.

432
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:04,490
Amos and Hosea that
we've already discussed.

433
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,860
Isaiah is consistent with Amos and Hosea
and Hosea and denouncing again with

434
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:12,230
social injustice and moral decay,

435
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,910
which is the cause of God's
just an inevitable punishment.

436
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:22,160
Isaiah five I'm extracting from
verses eight through 24, uh,

437
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:25,400
those who add house to house
and join field to field.

438
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,420
So there was room for none but you to
dwell in the land are those who chase

439
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:33,680
liquor from early in the morning until
late in the evening are inflamed by Wine.

440
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,840
Uh, those who vindicate who him who was
in the wrong in return for a bribe and

441
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:43,400
withhold vindication from him who
is in the right. He joins Amos.

442
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:48,430
And the assertion that cultic practice
without just behavior is anathema to God.

443
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:54,150
Isaiah one verses 10 to 17
here are the word of the Lord.

444
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:58,470
You chieftains of Sodom give ear to our
God's instruction. You folk of Gomorrah,

445
00:26:58,471 --> 00:27:02,010
right? So he's referring to his
fellow countrymen. Has Sodomites,

446
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:03,270
are people of Sodom and Gomorrah.

447
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:06,750
Who of course were the paragons
of of immoral behavior.

448
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,890
What need have I have?
All Your sacrifices says the Lord.

449
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,920
I am sated with burnt offerings of Rams
and suit of fat lanes and blood of Bulls

450
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,870
and I have no delight
in lambs and he goats.

451
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,290
You're new moons and fixed
seasons fill me with low thing.

452
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,170
They are become a burden to me.
I cannot endure them.

453
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,120
And when you lift up your hands,

454
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,350
I will turn my eyes away from you though
you pray at length, I will not listen.

455
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,160
You're hands are stained with crime.
Wash yourselves clean.

456
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:39,780
Put your evil doings away from my site.
Cease to do evil. Learn to do good.

457
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:44,460
Devote yourselves to justice. Aid the
wronged. Uphold the rights of the orphan.

458
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:48,120
Defend the cause of the widow. I think
these are harsh and shocking words.

459
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:49,680
I'm sick of sacrifices.

460
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:53,460
I'm thick of your festivals and
holidays as long as you are,

461
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,420
or it's committing these terrible
acts and like Amos and Hosea.

462
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,380
Isaiah asserts that morality is a
decisive factor in the fate of the nation.

463
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,020
Again,
um,

464
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,000
the phrase that the passage that begins
are those who add house to house and

465
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:12,840
join field to field. In my
hearing said, the Lord of hosts,

466
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,330
surely great houses shall lie for Lauren,

467
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,810
spacious and splendid ones
without occupants. Assuredly,

468
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:23,811
my people will suffer exile for not giving
heed its multitude victims of hunger,

469
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:29,280
and it's massive, parched with thirst. So
there are of course some commonalities,

470
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,750
but Isaiah differs from
Amos and Hosea in this,

471
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:38,930
he places far greater emphasis on the
Davidic covenant than on the mosaic.

472
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,730
Covenant is a key feature of,
of Isaiah,

473
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:47,160
the wilderness tradition, the exodus
tradition, the covenant at Sinai.

474
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:51,510
These are so important to Amos and Hosea
and are referred to by Amos and Hosea,

475
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,680
but they have less of an explicit
influence on Isaiah's prophecy.

476
00:28:55,681 --> 00:29:00,180
They're not not there, but they have
less of an explicit influence. Instead,

477
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,930
Isaiah has an overriding
interest in Davidic theology,

478
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:07,160
the Royal Ideology that centers on Zion,
um,

479
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,180
an ideology that we discussed earlier.

480
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,080
So we see this in his
read his covenant lawsuit,

481
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,580
which focuses a little less
on the violations of the
nation than it does on the

482
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:21,660
failure of the kings and the leaders who
have misled the nation and who will now

483
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:25,140
have to be punished as a,
as was stipulated in the Davidic covenant.

484
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,920
We also see it in his firm belief
in the inviolability of Zion.

485
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,660
This is a clear doctrine with Isaiah.
The inviolability of Zion, yeah,

486
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,260
way has a special relationship with
the Davidic royal line and the Davidic

487
00:29:41,261 --> 00:29:43,570
capital,
Jerusalem or Zion,

488
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,780
and he will not let either parish.

489
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,320
And that belief undergirds and informs
his consistent advice to the kings of

490
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:55,540
Judah.
Times of great danger,

491
00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:00,870
our opportunities to demonstrate absolute
trust in young boys covenant with the

492
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,620
Line of David with the House of David,

493
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,630
the king must rely exclusively on your
weight and you always promises to David

494
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:11,950
and his city and not on military
might or diplomatic strategies.

495
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,420
So if we look at Isaiah,

496
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,300
dealings with King has right
the first siege in a seven 34.

497
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,260
This is described in Isaiah
Chapter Seven and eight.

498
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:28,510
Isaiah who also has children with
portentous names. This is a fad,

499
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:30,380
I guess among the profits.
Um,

500
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,520
his children's names are only a remnant
will survive and he sinned for spoil.

501
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:39,430
Hurry for plunder, um, which
indicates the destruction and exile.

502
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,700
So he goes to visit the king and his
advice to the king is be quiet and do not

503
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:49,840
fear. Chapter Seven, verse four, the
crisis will pass seven verse nine,

504
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,560
if you will not believe,
surely you shall not be established.

505
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,910
This is an evocation of Zion theology.
God is in the midst of the city.

506
00:30:57,911 --> 00:31:02,410
That means the Lord of hosts is with
the people. Um, Isaiah then offers a,

507
00:31:02,411 --> 00:31:05,530
has a sign of the truth of his prophecy.

508
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:11,010
And that is namely that a young woman who
has conceived will bear a son and will

509
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:13,330
call him Emmanuel.

510
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:23,290
That's Hebrew. Manu l God is
with us. Humano is with us.

511
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,020
So this woman who has conceived will
bear a son and we'll call him Emmanuel.

512
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,160
This is in seven verse 14.
Now in the New Testament,

513
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,130
Matthew in chapter one,
verses 22 to 23, um,

514
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,600
takes this verse as a prophecy
of the birth of Jesus.

515
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:44,890
This is based on a Greek mistranslation
translation of the word young woman as

516
00:31:44,891 --> 00:31:48,790
virgin. The Hebrew term that's used
is not in fact the term for virgin,

517
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:52,960
but it was translated into the Greek
with the term that can mean virgin. Um,

518
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,080
and more over the verb that's used
in the Hebrew is in the past tense.

519
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,220
Like a woman has already conceived.
The birth is pending, it is imminent.

520
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:02,680
This child will be born,
God will be with us.

521
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,840
The identity of the woman that Isaiah
speaking about is a matter of some

522
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:11,920
dispute. So some scholars take the verse
as a reference to Isaiah, his own wife.

523
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:15,700
She's already had two children
with portentous names and
now she's pregnant with

524
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:16,820
the third.
Um,

525
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:21,930
but the others take the verse as a
reference to the king's own wife who will

526
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:25,810
bear. His son has a Kaia king, has a Kia.

527
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,270
There are some problems with chronology.

528
00:32:28,271 --> 00:32:32,050
It doesn't quite work out that he would
be the right age, but the fact is,

529
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:34,150
has a Kaia was a celebrated king.

530
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:39,151
He did in fact manage to keep Judah intact
against the Assyrian threat and kept

531
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,150
Jerusalem from falling in the sea.
Just seven Oh one and second kings,

532
00:32:44,151 --> 00:32:48,830
right. The book of Second Kings,
chapter 18 verse seven says of Hezekiah,

533
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:53,930
the Lord was with him, right? God was with
him connecting it to the name Emmanuel.

534
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,640
God is with us. God is with
him. Uh, very similar, very,

535
00:32:58,641 --> 00:33:01,220
very similar in the Hebrew
in fact sounds the same.

536
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,290
So in keeping with this interpretation,
the idea that,

537
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,580
um, the child who he says, uh,

538
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,220
we'll be able to in a sense saved Judah
is, is the child of the king to be born,

539
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:15,800
has a kayak.
And keeping with that scholar.

540
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:19,610
See the famous verses in Isaiah Nine,
uh,

541
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:21,590
as praise of king has a Kaia.

542
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,150
These verses are verses that announced
for unto us a child is born a wonderful

543
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:30,230
counselor, mighty God, everlasting
father, Prince of peace,

544
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,760
referring then to an unending piece in
which David's throne and kingdom are

545
00:33:34,761 --> 00:33:36,650
firmly established.
And again,

546
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:40,610
these verses have also
been decontextualized and
are utilized in Christian

547
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:44,930
liturgies to this day. Again, as if
they refer to the future birth of Jesus.

548
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:50,240
Uh, in any event, a cause doesn't heat
Isaiah's call for inaction, right?

549
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,410
He says he should be doing nothing.

550
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:56,090
How could any king really follows such
advice to seek no political or military

551
00:33:56,091 --> 00:34:00,200
solution? And so he appeals
to a Syria for help against,

552
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,740
around them and the northern kingdom
of Israel who are laying siege to him.

553
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,430
And this is a disastrous
development in Isaiah. His eyes,

554
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,070
we move to the second season seven Oh one,

555
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:13,880
we see that Isaiah really takes
a similar stance, has a Kaia,

556
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:18,320
tries to form an alliance with Egypt
now to stave off the Assyrian threat.

557
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:23,450
And Isaiah castigates the king and he
castigates the king's men for abandoning

558
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,990
yeah. Halfway and relying
on the frail read of Egypt.

559
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:32,620
And we find here an example of this
bizarre and demonstrative behavior of um,

560
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,681
of the profit.

561
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:36,950
We will see this in many of the profits
will sleep particularly in the Prophet

562
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,550
Ezekiel, but we see it with others, um,

563
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:42,200
where they would engage in these symbolic
acts that were meant to shock and

564
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:43,100
attract attention.

565
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:48,530
Isaiah paraded naked through the streets
of Jerusalem to illustrate the exile

566
00:34:48,531 --> 00:34:52,310
and the slavery that will follow
from this mistaken reliance on Egypt.

567
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:56,600
He denounces the political advisers who
counsel the king to form an alliance

568
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:57,680
with Egypt,
um,

569
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:01,880
because they are simply trusting in
horses and chariots rather than God's,

570
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:06,500
and I'd say a council's differently.
He says, for the Egyptians are man,

571
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:09,590
not God, and their horses
are flesh, not spirit.

572
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,940
Chapter 31 verse three,
the King should simply trust in God

573
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,480
in the narrative account that we have of
the siege of seven oh one that's found

574
00:35:20,481 --> 00:35:24,350
in chapter 36 and 38.
It's also duplicated in second kings.

575
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,010
Isaiah councils has a kayak
when the siege is underway,

576
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,170
not to capitulate to the Assyrians.

577
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:35,590
This might seem to contradict his earlier
message that a Syria was the rod of

578
00:35:35,931 --> 00:35:39,030
God's anger. Um, and that, um,

579
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,490
and that has a Kaia should not resist.

580
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,760
But in fact there's a basic consistency
to Isaiah's council just as his earlier

581
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:52,860
counsel to trust in God rather than
Egypt was based on his trust in God's

582
00:35:52,861 --> 00:35:56,640
promises to David and the
inviolability of the royal city.

583
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:02,060
So now his counsel to resist not to open
the doors of the city to the Assyrians

584
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,820
is based on his belief that y'all,

585
00:36:03,821 --> 00:36:06,870
we could not possibly intend
to destroy his royal city.

586
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:12,410
Isaiah 37 versus 33 to 35 assuredly thus
said the Lord concerning the King of

587
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:15,390
Assyria.
He shall not enter this city.

588
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,440
He shall not shoot an Arrow
at it or advanced upon it
with a shield or a pile up,

589
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:24,060
a siege mount against it. He shall go back
by the way he came. He shall not enter.

590
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:28,800
This city declares the Lord. I will
protect and save the city for my sake.

591
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,170
And for the sake of my servant David,
right again,

592
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,820
for the sake of the Davidic covenant.

593
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,500
And the fact that Jerusalem did in
fact escaped destruction after this

594
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,560
terrifying siege by the Assyrians only
fueled the belief fueled the belief in

595
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:45,490
the inviolability of David's city.
Zion.

596
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:52,020
Isaiah six contains a striking
account of the call of Isaiah.

597
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,650
Many of the prophetic books
we'll feature some, um,

598
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,650
some passage which refers to the profits
initial call and it's something we

599
00:36:58,651 --> 00:37:01,090
might expect to find at the
beginning of the book. Uh,

600
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:04,620
so obviously chronology is
not the organizing principle
in the book of Isaiah.

601
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,340
Um,

602
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:10,340
but I want to draw your attention to
God's extraordinary message to Isaiah at

603
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:12,810
the time of his call or commission.

604
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,840
Go and say to that people here,
indeed, but do not understand.

605
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,520
See indeed,

606
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:25,550
but do not grasp dull that people's mind
stop its ears and seal it's eyes lest

607
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,790
singing with his eyes and
hearing with its ears.

608
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:33,420
It also grasped with its mind
and repent and save itself.

609
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:34,951
Well.

610
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:38,710
There's a nice literary kayaks and before
we get to the substance in have it in

611
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:42,210
the last line you have heart, ears
and eyes. And then these are repeated.

612
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:44,700
But in reverse order,
eyes, ears and heart.

613
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,130
But in this passage we returned to the
kind of bleakness that we saw in um,

614
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,400
Hosea destruction is inevitable.

615
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:58,610
God's message by His prophet will not
be understood and indeed God will see to

616
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:02,160
it that the people do not
understand the message.

617
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,060
They do not heed the call to repent,
do not save themselves,

618
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:11,160
and so do not escape God's just
punishment. It's a fascinating,

619
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:13,410
if theologically difficult passage,

620
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,730
God tells Isaiah to prevent the people
from understanding lest through their

621
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:21,210
understanding they turned back to
God and save themselves. And again,

622
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:25,830
we see God or perhaps as profit caught
in the tension between God's justice and

623
00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:28,680
God's mercy as a god of justice.

624
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,740
He must punish the sins of
Israel with destruction.

625
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:35,410
He indicated he would do
so in the covenant. He must
be faithful to those terms.

626
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,680
But as a god of mercy,
he wishes to bring his people back.

627
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,640
He wishes to send them a profit to warn
them of the impending doom and urge them

628
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:46,960
to repent so that he can forgive them and
renounced his plan of destruction. Yet,

629
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:49,980
how can he both punish Israel
and so fulfill the man,

630
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:55,020
the demands of justice and yet save
Israel and so fulfill the demands of mercy

631
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,253
and love.

632
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,990
Verses 12 and 13 in chapter six answer
this question with an idea that we've

633
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,300
seen a little in Amos and Hosea.

634
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:08,860
When Isaiah asks how long
the people will fail to hear,

635
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,850
failed to understand,
to turn back to God and save themselves.

636
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,520
God replies till towns lie,

637
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:19,930
waste without inhabitance and houses
without people and the ground lies,

638
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:24,280
waste and desolate for the Lord will
banish the population and deserted sites

639
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:29,170
are many in the midst of the land,
but while a 10th part yet remains in it,

640
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,550
it shall repent.

641
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:35,470
It shall be ravaged like the terrapins
and the oak of which stumps are left even

642
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:39,160
when they are felled and it
stump shall be a holy seed.

643
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,510
So God will punish God,
cannot not punish Israel,

644
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,460
and so the demands of justice will be
met and God will have upheld the terms of

645
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:50,170
the conditional mosaic covenant,

646
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:54,280
but God will at the same time affect the
salvation of his people in the future.

647
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,640
He has sent a prophet with the call to
return and in due time a remnant of the

648
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:03,850
people at 10th Isaiah says,
we'll understand and heed that call.

649
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:09,040
They will receive God's mercy and the
Covenant will be reestablished and in this

650
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:09,191
way,

651
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:13,630
the demands of love and mercy will be met
and God will have been faithful to his

652
00:40:13,631 --> 00:40:16,990
covenantal promise to the Patriarchs
and the royal house of David.

653
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:22,590
The people's delayed comprehension
of the profits message guarantees the

654
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:27,700
operation of God's just punishment
now and his merciful salvation later.

655
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:34,480
While the notion of a remnant
leads to the idea of a future hope,

656
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:38,770
it wasn't a very consoling message
at the time because of profits were

657
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:43,240
essentially saying that the current
generation would all but ceased to exist.

658
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:48,570
Isaiah 10 verses 21 to 23 only a remnant
shall return only a remnant of Jacob to

659
00:40:49,391 --> 00:40:53,530
mighty God. Even if your people o Israel
should be as the sands of the sea,

660
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,800
only a remnant of it shall return.
Destruction has decreed.

661
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,530
Retribution comes like
a flood for my Lord.

662
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:03,100
God of hosts is carrying out a decree
of destruction upon all the land.

663
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,180
Well,
we've seen that the profits,

664
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:12,070
message of destruction and punishment
and doom is very often accompanied by

665
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:17,020
often alternates with a message of
consolation and a promise of restoration,

666
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:20,470
restoration of a purged or purified
remnant in the land of Israel.

667
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,770
This is where the profits differ from
the Deuteronomistic historian. Um,

668
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:28,840
the Deuteronomistic historian is more
concerned with the justification of God's

669
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:31,690
actions against Israel
then with a painting,

670
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:34,970
a vivid portrait of the time
of a future restoration.

671
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:40,130
But this period of restoration is
elaborately envisioned in some prophetic

672
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:40,940
writings,

673
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,990
and it even takes on an eschatological
10 or the word eschatology means an

674
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:48,680
account of the end.
Uh, so in some of them,

675
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:52,370
this becomes an eschatological vision
that this is what will the restoration

676
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:54,730
will happen at the end
of days. And we will, um,

677
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,090
the restoration will bring about
some sort of perfect end time.

678
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,090
So in Isaiah,
for example,

679
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,840
the return will be a genuine,

680
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,370
wholehearted and permanent return to God.
It will be the end of sin.

681
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,020
It will be the end of idolatry.

682
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:15,560
All the nations of the earth will
recognize the Lord of history.

683
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:20,690
A new epoch will open in world history.
It's an enormous transformation.

684
00:42:20,691 --> 00:42:23,120
And I say it is the first to envisage,

685
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,790
envisage this kind of transformation,

686
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:28,970
the end of the dominion
of idolatrous nations.

687
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:34,250
When God comes to Jerusalem to save
the remnant of Israel and gathering the

688
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:39,140
dispersed exiles, it will be a
theophany, a self revelation of God,

689
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:42,620
of worldwide scope.
Isaiah two,

690
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:45,530
verses two to four in the days to come,

691
00:42:45,531 --> 00:42:49,430
the Mount of the Lord's House shall
stand from above the mountains and tower

692
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:52,370
above the hills. So this little
hill, um, if you've ever been there,

693
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:54,710
it's really not very big
that the temple stood on.

694
00:42:54,711 --> 00:42:59,240
We'll tower like some large impregnable
mountain over all other hills and

695
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:02,030
mountains and all the nations
shall gaze on it with joy.

696
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:06,200
And the many people shall go and say, come
let us go up to the mount of the Lord,

697
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:07,700
to the House of the God of Jacob.

698
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,990
That he may instruct us in his ways
and that we may walk in his paths for

699
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:14,630
instruction.
Torah shall come forth from Zion.

700
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,520
The word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

701
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,960
And thus he will judge among the nations
and arbitrate for the many peoples and

702
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:24,950
they shall beat their swords
into plowshares and their
spears into pruning hooks.

703
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,510
Nation shall not take up sword against
nation. They shall never again, no war.

704
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:31,363
Note this,

705
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:36,430
the direction that Israelite thought is
taking the j source in genesis assumed

706
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:43,330
that all humans had knowledge of Yahweh
from the time of creation and remember

707
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:48,530
that that was one of the distinctive
traits of Jay as opposed to p for example,

708
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,150
they assumed,
however,

709
00:43:50,151 --> 00:43:55,130
that humans turned from Galloway so
halfway selected one nation to know him in

710
00:43:55,131 --> 00:43:59,840
covenant with him. The book of Deuteronomy
accepts that Yahweh is Israel's God.

711
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,410
Other nations have been assigned to the
worship of other gods and that's just

712
00:44:03,411 --> 00:44:06,200
fine.
But in classical prophecy,

713
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:11,060
universal claims are made on behalf of
Galloway. According to the prophets,

714
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:15,350
God will make himself known to all
the nations as he once did to Israel.

715
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:20,360
And the universal worship or recognition
of Yahweh will be established at the

716
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,800
end of days. This is a very
different idea. And so as
a consequence of this idea,

717
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:30,160
the very notion of Israel's election is
transformed by the profits in the Torah

718
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:31,441
books.

719
00:44:31,441 --> 00:44:35,850
The election of Israel means simply
God's undeserved choice of Israel as the

720
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:40,851
nation to know him and bind himself in
Covenant Bind itself in Covenant to him.

721
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:46,380
But in the prophetic literature, Israel's
election is an election to a mission.

722
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:53,030
Israel was chosen so as to be the
instrument of universal redemption,

723
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:56,520
universal recognition of your way.

724
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:00,330
When God comes finally
to rescue the Israelites,

725
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,260
he will simultaneously reveal
himself to all of humankind.

726
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:07,470
They'll abandon their idols,
they'll return to him.

727
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,470
A messianic period of peace will follow,

728
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:15,480
and eventually we're going to see the
idea that the mission for which Israel was

729
00:45:15,481 --> 00:45:18,420
elected was to become a
light unto the nations.

730
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:21,600
This is a phrase that we're going
to see in other parts of Isaiah,

731
00:45:21,601 --> 00:45:24,060
Isaiah 49 as they have 51 later,

732
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,380
but royal ideology of Judah
plays an important role in
the eschatological vision

733
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,480
of Isaiah because this new peaceful,

734
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:36,600
righteous kingdom is going
to be restored by David died.

735
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:40,360
It's going to be restored by a king
from the branch of Jesse Davids.

736
00:45:40,361 --> 00:45:42,300
Father's name was Jessie. So, uh,

737
00:45:42,301 --> 00:45:44,520
when you say the branch of
from the stump of Jesse,

738
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:45,870
then you're referring to a David died.

739
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,440
Isaiah 11 refers to the
restoration of the Davidic line,

740
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,290
which implies that it had
been temporarily interrupted.

741
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:56,280
So Isaiah 11 may be posting silicate
may date from a time when people were

742
00:45:56,281 --> 00:45:59,070
hoping for a Messiah to arise
and restore the line of David.

743
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,860
Isaiah 11 verses one to 12 and 16.

744
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,130
But a shoot shall grow
out of the stump of Jesse.

745
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,260
A twig shall sprout from his stock.

746
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,640
The spirit of the Lord shall a light
upon him, a spirit of wisdom and insight,

747
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:15,810
a spirit of counsel and valor, a spirit
of devotion and reverence for the Lord.

748
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,960
He shall since the truth,
by his reverence for the Lord.

749
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,990
He shall not judge by what
his ears perceive. Thus,

750
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:25,470
he shall judge the poor with equity and
decide with justice for the lowly of the

751
00:46:25,471 --> 00:46:29,070
land. He shall strike down a law,
a land with the rod of his mouth,

752
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:32,360
and slay the wicked with the
breath of his lips. Justice Shelby,

753
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,340
the girdle of his loins and
faithfulness the girdle of his lips.

754
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:40,410
The wolf shall dwell with the lamb. The
leopard lie down with the kid, the calf,

755
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,950
the beast of prey and the fat link
together, and a little boy to herd them.

756
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:48,090
The cow and the bear shall graze.
The bear is vegetarian. Now, not,

757
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:50,400
not killing the cow,
but eating the grass with the cow.

758
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:55,290
They're young shall lie down together.
And the lion like the ox shall eat straw.

759
00:46:55,620 --> 00:47:00,620
A Babe shut play over a viper's hole
and an infant passed his hand over and

760
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:02,490
adders den, right? The hostility,

761
00:47:02,491 --> 00:47:05,730
the animosity between between
humans and serpents are snakes,

762
00:47:05,731 --> 00:47:08,900
which was decreed a at the fall.
Um,

763
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:12,150
and the expulsion from Eden is
reversed in this end time, right?

764
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:16,680
This is a return to the situation in
paradise. In all of my sacred mountain,

765
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:20,400
nothing evil or viral shall be done for
the land shall be filled with devotion

766
00:47:20,401 --> 00:47:23,280
to the Lord as water covers the sea.
And in that day,

767
00:47:23,281 --> 00:47:27,390
the stock of Jesse that
has remained standing shall
become a standard to peoples.

768
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:32,140
Nations shall seek his counsel and his
abode shall be honored. In that day,

769
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:36,130
my Lord will apply his hand again to
redeeming the other part of his peoples

770
00:47:36,131 --> 00:47:39,930
from a Syria as also from
Egypt path rose Nubia, a alarm.

771
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,040
She now Hamas and the and the coastlands.

772
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,880
Thus there shall be a highway for the
other part of his people out of Syria,

773
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,670
such as there was for Israel
when it left the land of Egypt.

774
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,470
So this new ideal Davidic king will rule
by wisdom and insight in the spirit of

775
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:54,670
the Lord will a light on him.

776
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:57,550
That's a phrase that we saw it
being used in the case of judges.

777
00:47:57,551 --> 00:48:01,990
In the case of salt or David, it doesn't
refer to a military might and strength.

778
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:06,400
Here it refers to counsel and
a spirit of devotion to God.

779
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:10,960
And this king's reign will begin an in
gathering of the exiles of the nation and

780
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:14,650
a transformed world order.
So to conclude,

781
00:48:14,651 --> 00:48:19,420
Isaiah is typical of the prophetic
re-interpretation of the ancient covenant

782
00:48:19,421 --> 00:48:23,320
promises, giving Israel a hope
for a better ideal future.

783
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:26,920
And like the other prophets, he declared
that the nation was in distress,

784
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:30,130
not because of promises weren't true,
but because they hadn't been believed.

785
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:34,720
The nation's punishment was just a chest
ties meant it wasn't a revocation of

786
00:48:34,721 --> 00:48:35,554
the promises.

787
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:39,910
The profits pushed the fulfillment of
the promises beyond the existing nation.

788
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:44,020
However, it's only after suffering the
punishment for the present failure.

789
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:48,310
Would a future redemption be possible?
So the national hope was maintained,

790
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:50,680
but pushed off to a future day.
Right?

791
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:52,900
We'll deal with some more
prophetic books when we come back.

792
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,650
Please be sure to take the handouts
in the box at the side of the room.
