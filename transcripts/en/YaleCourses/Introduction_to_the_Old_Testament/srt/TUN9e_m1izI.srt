1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,520
Okay. Um, an interesting counterpoint
to the apocalyptic literature. Um,

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,580
and the apocalyptic reliance on God's
cataclysmic consummation of history in

3
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:13,380
order to dole out
justice to the righteous.

4
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:17,850
And the wicked is found in the book of
Esther. And this is a short novella.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,140
It's set in fifth century. Persian was
probably written in the fourth century,

6
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:22,920
we think,

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,390
but it's set during the reign of Xerxes
and there's no x in the Hebrew alphabet.

8
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:30,610
This is a hush hush,
which is Cirque sees. Um,

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,490
and he was a fifth century Persian
emperor from about 46 to four 65,

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,770
and it's another heroic fiction that
features a Jew in the court of a gentile

11
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:41,101
king.

12
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:46,101
So it's like Daniel and the Jews of Persia
are threatened with genocide and they

13
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:51,270
are saved not by divine intervention,
but entirely through their own efforts.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,261
Uh,
indeed,

15
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:57,261
the book of Esther does not mention
God once and the story revolves around

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,580
Mordecai.
Mordecai is a pious Jew.

17
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,960
He sits at the gate of the Persian
king, Akash Bay, Rocher Xerxes.

18
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,840
And his beautiful niece is
also central to the story.

19
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:10,200
Of course it's Esther and
he's adopted her as his own.

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,470
There's a lot of comic irony in this
story. It really is a fun read. Um,

21
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,510
time is not going to permit me to go into
the various sub plots and the dramatic

22
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:22,230
reversals, the, the
ironies and twists. Um,

23
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,530
but I will just highlight a few of the
most salient points that are relevant to

24
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:27,030
the conversation we've been having.

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,470
So when the Persian king
divorces his wife Vashti,

26
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:36,471
because she refuses to appear in the
Royal Diadem before the his mail courtiers

27
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,070
presumably, and nothing but the
royal diadem a esters, great beauty,

28
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,220
commend her to the king
and she becomes queen.

29
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:49,080
Now her uncle Mordecai advises her to be
discreet about her Jewish identity for

30
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:52,770
safety sake. He says in two
verses 10 and 11, it says,

31
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,510
Esther did not reveal her people or her
kindred for Mordecai had told her not to

32
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:59,310
reveal it every single day,

33
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,730
more to high would walk about in front
of the court of the Harem to learn how

34
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:06,930
Esther was fairing and what was happening
to her. So a little while later,

35
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:08,970
the king promotes a certain Haman.
Haman,

36
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:13,971
the aggregate to the post
of chief administrator and
everyone in the palace gate

37
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,720
kneels down to Haman as the king has
ordered everyone that is except for a

38
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:23,550
mortified. And Day after day he refuses.
And finally the matter is told to Haman,

39
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,530
this is chapter three,
verses four to six.

40
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,770
And when they spoke to him day after day,
and he would not listen to them,

41
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:30,900
they tell speaking to Mordecai
and he won't listen to them.

42
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,490
They told Haman in order to see whether
Mordecai's resolve would prevail for he

43
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:37,350
had explained to them that he was a Jew.

44
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,430
When Haman saw that Mordecai
would not kneel or bow low to him,

45
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:43,110
Haman was filled with rage,

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,500
but he disdains to lay
hands on more to high alone,

47
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,060
having been told who Mordecai's people
were Haman plotted to do away with all

48
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:54,880
the Jews, Mordecai's people throughout
the Kingdom of [inaudible] Roche.

49
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:59,830
So Haman cast lots a lot.
The word for lots is Purim.

50
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,940
So he casts lots in order to
determine the date of the massacre

51
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,870
Purim.
Uh,

52
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,010
and then he offers the king a handsome
bribe in return for permission to kill

53
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,970
the Jews of the kingdom. This is
chapter three, verses eight through 11.

54
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:19,810
And listen to the rationale that's
proposed. He says to the king,

55
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,370
there was a certain people scattered
and dispersed among the other peoples in

56
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,510
all the provinces of your realm whose
laws are different from those of any other

57
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:30,670
people and who do not
obey the king's laws.

58
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,520
And it is not in Your Majesty's
interest to tolerate them.

59
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,480
If it please Your Majesty, Let an edict
to be drawn for their destruction.

60
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:42,430
And I will pay 10,000 talents of silver
to the stewards for deposit in the Royal

61
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,140
Treasury there upon the king,

62
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:48,340
removed his signet ring from his hand
and gave it to Haman, the son of Hamata,

63
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:52,720
they aggregate the foe of the Jews and
the king said the money and the people

64
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:54,850
are yours to do with as you see fit.

65
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,930
So He provides a rationale and it also
provides a good bribe along with it to

66
00:03:58,931 --> 00:03:59,764
get this edict.

67
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,860
So this edict goes out to every province
to destroy massacre and exterminate all

68
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:08,560
the Jews, young and old children
and women on a single day.

69
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:11,260
This is to be the 13th
of the month of Adar.

70
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,340
Jews everywhere began to fast
and weep and wail. They mourn.

71
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,340
They wear sack cloth and ashes and Esther
sends to Mordecai for an explanation

72
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,360
of the, of the commotion, right?

73
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:25,540
She's somewhat sealed off here in the
Harem and doesn't quite know what's going

74
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,050
on.

75
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,050
So he sends a message informing her of
the decree and the urges her to appeal to

76
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:34,150
the king and to plead for her people.

77
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,520
And Esther hesitates partly because it,
uh,

78
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,280
to appear unbidden before the King
carries a penalty of death and modify

79
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:46,210
responds with this message.
It's as Esther four 13 being 16.

80
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,910
Do not imagine that you have all the Jews
will escape with your life by being in

81
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:56,200
the king's palace. On the contrary,
if you keep silent in this crisis,

82
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,070
relief and deliverance will come to the
Jews from another quarter while you and

83
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:02,620
your father's house will perish.
And who knows,

84
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:05,740
perhaps you have attained royal
position for just such a crisis.

85
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,400
And then Esther sent back
this answer to Mordecai.

86
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,610
Go assemble all the Jews who live in shoe,

87
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:14,050
Sean and Susa and Persia
and fast in my behalf.

88
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:16,780
Do not eat or drink for three days,
night or day.

89
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,980
I and my maidens will observe the same
fast and then I shall go to the king,

90
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:24,610
though it is contrary to the law. And
if I am to perish, I shall perish.

91
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,480
So Mordecai went about the city and
did justice. Esther had commanded him.

92
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,700
It's a very tense scene. Esther
approaches the king and he has, you know,

93
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:37,420
you get a signal, he raises
his stepdaughter or not and
uh, to accept you or not.

94
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,340
And then this tense moment,
you know,

95
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:42,940
he permits her entry and he
offers to grant her every request.

96
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:47,590
And so she asks that the king and Haman
attend a banquet that she's preparing

97
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,390
and at Esther's request,
um, at Esther's banquet, uh,

98
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:56,560
the king offers to grant Esther any
request that she might wish to make.

99
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,110
And so her request is stated
in the following terms,

100
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:04,820
terms that show her loyalty to her people.
Esther seven three B through six.

101
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,740
If your majesty will do me the favor
and if it pleases Your Majesty,

102
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,950
Let my life be granted me as my wish
and my people as my request for we have

103
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:19,310
been sold my people and I to be
destroyed, massacred, and exterminated.

104
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,060
Had we only been sold as
bondmen and bondwomen as slaves,

105
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,930
I would have kept silent. For the
adversary is not worth the king's trouble.

106
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,560
And there upon King Alqosh Vevo, Roche
demanded of Queen Esther, who is he?

107
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:34,700
And where is he? Who dared to do
this? The adversary and enemy replied,

108
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:39,110
Esther is this evil Haman
and Haman cringed in terror
before the king and Queen.

109
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,790
So Esther boldly reveals her
Jewish identity before the king.

110
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,200
She expresses her solidarity in her
speech with phrases like we and my people

111
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:52,100
and I. And in the, there's a real
comedy of errors that follows a,

112
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,020
the king leaves a room in a rage and
Haman falls prostrate on Esther's couch to

113
00:06:57,021 --> 00:07:01,310
beg for his life. And so when the
king reentered enters the room,

114
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:03,590
he sees Haman in this
compromising position,

115
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,160
and he declares does he mean to
ravish the queen in my own palace?

116
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,280
So he orders Haman to
be impaled on the very,

117
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,170
a steak that a Haman had set up for
Mordecai. Uh, and Mordecai in fact,

118
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:17,960
is then elevated in Hayman's
stead within the court.

119
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,910
But the Jews are still in danger because
an edict of the kings cannot be revoked.

120
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:27,020
Once a word has gone forth from the
king, it his law. So the solution is,

121
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,080
is second edict in which a Vedros charges
the Jews to arm and defend themselves.

122
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,380
And so then we have another of
many reversals in this story.

123
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,020
What was to be a day of
defeat and massive curve.

124
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:42,290
The Jews becomes a day of triumph as the
Jews who would now have permission to

125
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:46,250
arm themselves and fight, slay those
who were bent on murdering them.

126
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,420
The victory celebration,
which is the festival of Purim,

127
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:55,190
is commemorated by Jews to this
day. Um, the very melodramatic,

128
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,040
a story, uh, of this luxurious
Persian court life, uh,

129
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:03,110
and all of the attendant political
intrigue that goes on in the story.

130
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,110
It's recreated in annual per,
I'm celebrations,

131
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,970
very Rawkus carnival like dramatizations.
Um,

132
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,840
according to the Talmud on Purim,

133
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:15,920
it's a Mitzvah which can be in the
commandment or a good deed to get so drunk

134
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:19,660
that you can't distinguish between
more to high and Haman. Uh,

135
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,690
but for all of that,

136
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:25,340
there are some very important and
striking themes in this story. First,

137
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:30,080
there's the ethnic element of Jewish
identity rather than religious that comes

138
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:34,010
to the fore. In the book of Esther,
the presentation is secular.

139
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:36,470
The Jews are described as a people,
an ethnos.

140
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,950
Esther is fully assimilated
to her gentile environment.

141
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,230
Unlike Daniel who prays towards Jews,

142
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,070
Jerusalem daily in the court of the king
and observes the dietary laws in the

143
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:49,960
court of the king, we hear nothing
like this about Esther at all. Um,

144
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:54,020
there's also a very human and very
anti apocalyptic message in this story.

145
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,440
It gives expression to the conviction
that solidarity and heroic resistance are

146
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:04,740
necessary in the face of overwhelming
anti-Jewish aggression to ensure Jewish

147
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:07,530
survival. This, according
to the book of Esther,

148
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:11,340
so different from the book of Daniel is
the lesson to be learned from Israel's

149
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:16,020
history.
And if the book of Esther presents one,

150
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,160
a alternative to the post [inaudible]
eschatology in which you always enemies

151
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,690
are afflicted and consumed
for their wickedness,

152
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,980
then the book of Jonah
offers another perspective.

153
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,570
The book of Jonah is actually found
among the section of the Bible called the

154
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:38,280
profits. The second, the second section,
the prophetic books of the Bible. Um,

155
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,450
and that's because in the book
of Kings Second Kings 1425,

156
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,070
we have someone identified as Jonah,
the son of Amittai, um, the profit.

157
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:50,490
And so Jonah, this is this considered,
this is the same Jonah. And so it's,

158
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,130
the book is considered to be
among the books of the prophets,

159
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:57,060
but it differs insignificant ways
from the other prophetic books.

160
00:09:57,061 --> 00:10:01,050
It is not in fact a collection of
Oracle's, it's actually a story,

161
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,880
somewhat comic story, a comic tale
about a reluctant prophet named Jonah.

162
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,410
I'm the second interesting or unusual
thing about this book is that Jonah is

163
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:15,411
commissioned by Yaffe way to carry
a message to the people of Nineveh,

164
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,900
the capital of Assyria,
not to the people of Israel.

165
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,790
These are light concept of divine
mercy receives its full expression.

166
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,760
In the book of Jonah,
in the first chapter,

167
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:34,530
Jonah receives a call from Yahweh
who instructs him to go to Nineveh,

168
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,610
who's wickedness is great and to
proclaim God's judgment. Chapter one,

169
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:41,700
the first three verses the
word of the Lord came to Jonah,

170
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:44,730
son of Amittai go at once to Nineveh,

171
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,540
that great city and proclaim judgment
upon it for their wickedness has come

172
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:53,130
before me. Jonah, however, started out to
flee to Tarshish from the Lord's service.

173
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:56,700
That's like saying he got up and went to
Timbuktu Tar. She, she was the extent,

174
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:59,910
the farthest extent of the known world
navigable through the Mediterranean.

175
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:03,330
So it's rather comic go to Nineveh
and he got up and went in the opposite

176
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:08,070
direction as far as he could. Uh, he, he
tried to flee from the Lord's service.

177
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,660
He went down to Joppa.
Yeah. Um, Jaffa. Yeah.

178
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:15,870
AAFA and found a ship going to Tarshish
and he paid the fare and went to board

179
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:19,170
to sail with the others to Tarshish
away from the service of the Lord.

180
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,580
So he does this immediate about,

181
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,110
about face in a very comic
touch and set sail for Spain,

182
00:11:25,111 --> 00:11:27,660
the other end of the Mediterranean.
But of course,

183
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:31,260
Jonah cannot escape from
God and God sends a storm,

184
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:35,310
which threatens to destroy the
ship. The non Israelites, soldier,

185
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,890
sailors onboard,
prayed to their gods.

186
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:42,090
And then finally they cast lots
in order to discover who it is,

187
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:46,170
who's brought this danger to the ship.
And the lot falls to Jonah.

188
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,620
So Jonah confesses that he's a
Hebrew who worships the Lord,

189
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:53,650
who as he now realizes,
made both land and sea.

190
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,370
And that is a fact that strikes great
terror in the heart of the sailors when

191
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:59,230
they hear this, that
his god is, yeah, way.

192
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,400
And Jonah further adds that he's
trying to flee from God's service.

193
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,030
And the clear implication is that he
is the cause of this terrible storm.

194
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,800
So Jonah proposes that he'd be
thrown overboard to save the ship.

195
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:17,230
The sailors strive mightily to battle
the storm. But finally in despair,

196
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,620
they pray to God.
Yeah,

197
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,360
way to forgive them for
killing an innocent man,

198
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:25,480
and they heave Jonah
overboard and save the ship.

199
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,470
Now the sailors are said by
the narrator to revere God.

200
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:32,830
They offer a sacrifice to him.
They make a vows.

201
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,510
Now in the meantime,

202
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,590
God has appointed a huge
fish to swallow Jonah.

203
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,700
And so preserve his life and
from the belly of this fish,

204
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,260
Jonah prays to God.

205
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:49,710
The prayer or the psalm is not entirely
appropriate to the narrative context.

206
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,860
It's probably an insertion in
the story by a leader writer.

207
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,280
It's an insertion that
was probably suggested by
references within the prayer to

208
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,970
drowning in the deep,

209
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,590
to crying out to God from the belly of
Shea all and Jonah's in the belly of the

210
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:09,310
fish. So that linguistic resonance
may very well have been what, um,

211
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,030
prompted someone to insert this
prayer here. And in any event,

212
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:14,710
in response to Jonah's prayer,

213
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,480
God orders the fish to spew Jonah
out onto dry land. In chapter three,

214
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:22,480
Johnny gets his second chance.
God calls him again.

215
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:25,480
And in contrast to his
first response this time,

216
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,950
Jonah sets out for Nineveh at once
and he proclaims God's message.

217
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:31,030
In 40 days,

218
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:36,070
Nineveh will be overthrown and then comes
the the shocking element in the story.

219
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,770
Chapter three verses five to 10
the people of Nineveh believed God.

220
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,910
They proclaimed a fast and great
and smaller, like put on sackcloth.

221
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,150
And when the news reached the king
of Nineveh, he rose from his throne,

222
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:49,961
took off his robe,

223
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:54,520
put on sackcloth and sat in ashes and
he had the word cried through Nineveh by

224
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:56,110
decree of the king and his nobles.

225
00:13:56,111 --> 00:14:01,060
No Man or beast of flock or herd shall
taste anything they shall not graze and

226
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:03,970
they shall not drink water.
They shall be covered with sackcloth,

227
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:06,310
man and beast and shall
cry mightily to God.

228
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,420
Let everyone turned back from his evil
ways and from the injustice of which he

229
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:13,570
is guilty. Who knows, but
that God may turn and relent.

230
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:18,550
He may turn back from his wrath so that
we do not perish. God saw what they did,

231
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,800
how they were turning
back from their evil ways,

232
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,700
and God renounced the punishment he had
planned to bring upon them and did not

233
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:25,534
carry it out.

234
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:31,210
So idolatrous Nineveh believes God and
humbles itself before God hoping to

235
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:35,050
arouse his mercy.
And in another humorous touch,

236
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:37,600
we read that even the animals
are wearing sackcloth, right?

237
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:42,280
They're fasting and crying out to God.
So from the greatest, to the very least,

238
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,480
the inhabitants of Nineveh turn back from
their evil ways and God's mercy is in

239
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:50,980
fact aroused. The Assyrians are
spared and Jonah is furious.

240
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,940
Chapter four verses one through four
this displeased Jonah greatly and he was

241
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:58,400
grieved. He prayed to
the Lord saying, oh Lord,

242
00:14:58,401 --> 00:15:01,430
isn't this just what I said when
I was still in my own country.

243
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,660
That is why I fled beforehand to
Tarshish for I know that you are a

244
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:09,530
compassionate and gracious God. Slow
to anger, abounding in kindness,

245
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,520
renouncing punishment. Please Lord, take
my life. I would rather die than live.

246
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:19,010
The Lord replied, are you that deeply
grieved? Jonah doesn't respond.

247
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:23,870
He just leaves the city to Sulk.
And his complaint seems to be two fold.

248
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,080
If you're going to punish the wicked,
then just punish them.

249
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:29,930
They deserve it and if you're
planning to spare them,

250
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:33,830
then just spare them and don't waste
my time with messages and oracles,

251
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,120
but the stronger problem for Jonah's
seems to be the lack of punishment for the

252
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:38,950
wicked.

253
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,190
Joan is indignant that the Syrians didn't
get what they so richly deserved and

254
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:46,970
didn't I say this would happen.
You always forgive your this slowed anger,

255
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:50,690
compassionate guy. You'll always
repent. The wicked are never punished.

256
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,580
I'm fed up with the way you do things.
God,

257
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,260
your mercy perverts your justice and
some things ought not to be forgiven.

258
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,080
People must be held to account
for their evil actions.

259
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,330
How can God not do justice?

260
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,790
Jonah sits in a little booth that he
has constructed and God causes a leafy

261
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,070
plant to grow over him.

262
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:15,370
Providing shade and saving him from a
good deal of discomfort and the plant is

263
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:18,590
to be the source of a
final lesson for Jonah.

264
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,600
Jonah four six through 11 Jonah
was very happy about the plant,

265
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,430
but the next day at dawn,

266
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,090
God provided a worm which attacked
the plant so that it withered.

267
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,530
And when the sun rose,

268
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:34,670
God provided a sultry east wind and the
sun beat down on Jonah's head and he

269
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:38,210
became faint and he begged for death
saying I would rather die than live.

270
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,120
And then God said to Jonah, are you
deeply grieved about the plant? Yes,

271
00:16:43,121 --> 00:16:46,700
he replied so deeply that I want to die.
Then the Lord said,

272
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,020
you cared about the plant which you did
not work for, and which you did not grow,

273
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,910
which appeared overnight and
perished overnight and should not.

274
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,300
I care about Nineveh,

275
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:01,010
that great city in which there are more
than 120,000 persons who do not yet know

276
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:04,010
their right hand from their
left and many beasts as well.

277
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:09,910
How can you halfway not be compassionate
for even the most evil of peoples are

278
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:15,440
no less his creation and he has
cared for then precious Israel.

279
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:20,090
And if they will only turn to him and
humility, he'll wipe the slate clean.

280
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,730
He'll show compassion and forgive.

281
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,030
It is only human to long for
the punishment of the wicked.

282
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,480
But God longs for their re formation.
They're turning.

283
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,010
The date of the book of Jonah
really can't be ascertained.

284
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,490
And you will hear arguments in both
directions. Many scholars data at late,

285
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,140
others suppose that the story is at
least at base and old, old story,

286
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,490
Nineveh appears as another Saddam.
Basically,

287
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,520
it's a story that is in keeping with
that older Torah tradition in which,

288
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:51,841
uh,

289
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:56,841
it's assumed that God
punishes non Israelites or
other nations for immorality,

290
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,560
but not necessarily for
idolatry. Um, you know, the,

291
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,040
the gentile sailors even who worship
others are not necessarily punished.

292
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,910
And in fact,
it's said that they revere God and,

293
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:09,030
and they're reluctant to
throw this man overboard.

294
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,620
Other nations are not obligated
in the view of this book, um,

295
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,080
as in the early traditions of
genesis to accept monotheism,

296
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,170
but they're bound by a
certain basic moral law.

297
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,510
Maybe the moral law of
the Noaa Hide Covenant.

298
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:25,260
And it's for this that God
has decreed punishment.

299
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,060
So the theme where the basic problem in
this short book is the problem of God's

300
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:34,770
justice versus his mercy.
And Jonah is a champion of divine justice.

301
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,030
He believes that since should be punished,
he's outraged at God's forgiveness.

302
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,470
But Jonah learns that a change of heart
is enough to obtain mercy and that the

303
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:48,471
true role of the prophet is perhaps to
move people to reformation and turning.

304
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,360
What must have been the reception of
this book in the Post exhilarate period.

305
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:57,600
Again, not knowing exactly when it
was written. We can imagine, however,

306
00:18:57,601 --> 00:18:59,730
and the way in the manner
of a canonical critic,

307
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,660
how it might've been perceived by people
in the post exhilarate period for whom

308
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:05,550
it would have become canonical.

309
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:10,110
The very idea of a profit
being sent to Nineveh,

310
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,740
Nineveh,
the capital of the hated Assyrian Empire,

311
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,130
the home of the people who had destroyed
the northern Kingdom of Israel and the

312
00:19:17,131 --> 00:19:21,480
10 tribes of Israel and seven 22
dispersing those 10 tribes forever.

313
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,561
The,
uh,

314
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:26,910
the nation that had then laid siege to
Jerusalem and exact attribute from Judah

315
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:29,670
for many years.
This must have been startling.

316
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,240
And ultimately then this
book would represent a strand
of thought in post exilic

317
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,340
Judah that differed very much from the
eschatological fervor that delighted in

318
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:43,830
fantasies of the destruction
of Israel's enemies,

319
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,420
such as we found in Joel and as would
be featured later in Daniel and in post

320
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:52,740
biblical apocalyptic literature, most
notably the Christian book of revelation,

321
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:58,730
the book of Jonah reminded Israel that
the Universal God is desirous of the

322
00:19:58,861 --> 00:20:02,520
reformation and the turning of all
his creation, human and animal,

323
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,380
and proposes that the Israelite Prophet
is called upon to carry a message of

324
00:20:07,381 --> 00:20:10,620
divine forgiveness to other nations,
not just judgment,

325
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,540
even those that have humiliated
and despised God's chosen.

326
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,610
So wittingly or unwittingly,
we may never know, uh,

327
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,570
the author of this little satire fostered
the post Zelig sense of Israel as a

328
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:25,770
light unto the nations.

329
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:29,340
This is an idea that we've already
seen in some of the late, um,

330
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,380
prophetic writings.
Just a few words of conclusion.

331
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,700
The literature of the Hebrew Bible
relates the Odyssey of Israel from its

332
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,530
earliest beginnings in the stories
of Individual Patriarchs worshiping a

333
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:48,060
Canaanite,
uh,

334
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,160
to its maturity as a nation forced by
history to look beyond its own horizons

335
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:55,000
and concerns.

336
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,870
The Israelites were lifted up to become
something greater than they could ever

337
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:00,190
have planned,

338
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,870
and they came to see themselves as God's
servants to the world at the same time

339
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:09,370
that they struggled and argued with their
God and criticize themselves for their

340
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:14,350
very human weaknesses and failings.
And from another vantage point,

341
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,380
the Bible can be seen also as an anthology
that struggles against great odds to

342
00:21:20,591 --> 00:21:24,040
sustain a people's covenantal
relationship with God.

343
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,240
The contrast between reality and the
religious moral ideal that good prospers

344
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:36,030
and evil is defeated was a distressing
and perplexing problem that occupied the

345
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:41,560
biblical writers, the existence of
evil, the suffering of the righteous,

346
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,330
the defeat of God's chosen.

347
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,640
All this seemed basically incompatible
with certain fundamental monotheistic

348
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:52,210
intuitions that God holds
supreme power in the universe,

349
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,910
that God is essentially good and just,

350
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,910
and his providential care
extends throughout creation.

351
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:03,010
How can faith in such a god be upheld
in the face of evil and suffering?

352
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:08,790
Although all ancient cultures and modern
cultures struggle with the problem of

353
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,723
evil,

354
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,820
it had particular poignancy for ancient
Israel in other ancient near eastern

355
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:18,880
literatures. We find out about the
existence of a moral order, certainly,

356
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,360
but only in Israel does the question of
evil touch on the very essence of God

357
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,770
and the very foundation
of religious faith.

358
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,110
Paganism posits the existence of
primordial evil demons or gods,

359
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,490
and thus the existence of evil and
suffering does not impugn the good God's

360
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:37,450
themselves.

361
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,890
Later religious systems that grow out
of the Bible will in fact increasingly

362
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:45,220
posit demons or a devil,
right? Second Temple,

363
00:22:45,221 --> 00:22:49,600
Judaism later Rabbinic Judaism, and most
especially Christianity. We'll pause it,

364
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:54,400
some devil to account for evil in
the world, undeserved, suffering,

365
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,830
outrageous and frustrating as it might be,

366
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,630
can then be explained at least by the
jealousy or the caprice of the evil angels

367
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:06,460
or Gods or the demons or devil
who are indifferent to man's fate.

368
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,350
But in biblical religion,

369
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:13,380
there is no independent eval principle
and so undeserved suffering and rampant

370
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,990
evil impugn the goodness and justice of
God himself and Biblical persons have no

371
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:24,661
refuge from evil and suffering other
than faith and God's justice and if that

372
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:29,290
justice is slow in coming than
despair and doubt threatened.

373
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,061
For this reason,

374
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:35,170
Israelite theodicy I think is charged
with great pathos because the stakes are

375
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:39,520
so high. If one loses faith in
an essentially moral universe,

376
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:42,940
one loses God or at least as
we saw in the book of job,

377
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,000
one loses a god who governs the
world to a clear moral standard,

378
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,130
but the biblical writers don't
approach the problem as philosophers or

379
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:55,640
theologians might.
For the philosopher Theodicy,

380
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:59,600
the problem of evil is primarily a
logical problem. It's a contradiction.

381
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:04,540
How can adjust and good God allow evil
and suffering to exist in the world and

382
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,050
like any other logical problem,

383
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,400
it's best to solved according to the
philosophers and theologians through the

384
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:13,040
careful construction of
a systematic argument.

385
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:18,200
This is not the message or the approach
of the biblical writers. For them,

386
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,270
the problem is not philosophical,
it is personal. It is psychological.

387
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,930
It is spiritual.
The burning question is really this.

388
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:31,910
How can one sustain a commitment to
Israel's God in the face of national

389
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:34,280
catastrophe and personal suffering?

390
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,270
How can one have the strength to embrace,
to trust,

391
00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:43,271
to love this God knowing
that unpredictable suffering
and chaos have struck and

392
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:48,410
may again strike at any moment and
various writers from various periods add

393
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:49,500
their voices to Israel,

394
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:54,140
struggle to come to terms with the problem
of sustaining faith in the midst of

395
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:55,190
evil and suffering.

396
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:00,910
The Bible's aim is not to
solve the philosophical
problem of theodicy so much as

397
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:05,660
it is to enable the relationship
with God to survive all shocks,

398
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,820
to make life in covenant with God,

399
00:25:07,821 --> 00:25:12,260
a viable option despite the evil and the
suffering that are experienced by the

400
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,094
faithful.

401
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,960
The Bible doesn't offer one single
model of how to cope with this problem.

402
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,860
A dynamic relationship with what
is perceived to be a living,

403
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:26,861
personal god rather than the static God
of the philosophers is too complex to be

404
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:29,690
captured in a single dimensional theology.

405
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:35,020
Systematic theology could not do justice
to the very gated experiences of the

406
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:37,580
nation and of an individual,
a life.

407
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,880
And that's not the mode or genre
chosen by the biblical writers.

408
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,380
And so various models are presented,
not all consistent with one another,

409
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:49,820
but each serving a particular segment of
the community coping with a particular

410
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:54,710
challenge at a particular time and
each is an attempt to sustain Israel's

411
00:25:54,711 --> 00:25:59,000
relationship with God in the face of
challenges to that continued relationship.

412
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:04,250
Biblical writers tell stories and they
interpret history in order to illustrate

413
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:09,140
the many ways in which various
individuals and the nation as a whole have

414
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:12,830
managed to make sense of the
covenantal relationship with God.

415
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,290
And there's room for multiple models,

416
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:19,070
multiple images of God and
his relationship to Israel.

417
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,050
And as modern readers of the Bible,

418
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,260
we can only marvel at this unresolved
polyphony in this ancient and theology.

419
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:31,460
It's as if the rabbis who were later to
canonize this collection saw the truth

420
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:32,880
and the words of Co Helen,

421
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,500
that to everything there is a season and
a time for every purpose under heaven.

422
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,710
And so they included books
with very different approaches.

423
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:43,500
To the fundamental problems that face
the ancient Israelites as Israelites and

424
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:44,520
as human beings.

425
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,900
So after 58065807586 BCE,

426
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:51,130
the deuteronomist salvaged.
Yeah.

427
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:55,860
Wisdom from going the way
of other defeated national
religions by arguing that

428
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:58,860
Israel had suffered,
not because God's promises weren't true,

429
00:26:58,861 --> 00:27:00,360
but because they weren't believed.

430
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,110
And this enabled the Israelites
to continue faithful to their god.

431
00:27:04,111 --> 00:27:07,890
Despite the destruction of his
sanctuary has chosen city and his ruler.

432
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:13,140
The profits emphasize the moral and
communal aspects of the covenant without

433
00:27:13,141 --> 00:27:15,690
which all sacrificial
worship was anathema.

434
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:20,430
And so they unwittingly prepared the way
for a worship without sacrifice in the

435
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,620
diaspora.
And in later Judaism,

436
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,210
the psalms give expression to the deepest
emotions of the worship are struggling

437
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,950
with personal despair and anger or
brimming over with joy and faith.

438
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:36,870
Job gives vent to the outrage
we feel over unjust suffering.

439
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,140
While Ecclesiastes preaches existential
pleasures as a solace for the vanity of

440
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:43,320
all human endeavor,

441
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,970
Ezra and Nehemiah can confront the
very real problem of assimilation and

442
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:52,971
identity with a call to Israel to close
ranks while Jonah and Ruth remind Jews

443
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:57,990
of the universal providence of their
God and the power of repentance.

444
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,760
Esther and Daniel provide encouragement
of radically different types for Jews

445
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:05,510
under threat of persecution and massacre.
One,

446
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:08,520
a plea for self reliance in
solidarity and the other,

447
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,370
a promise of divine
intervention and an apocalypse.

448
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,890
Do all these books contradict each other?

449
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,090
No more than I contradict myself
when I say that today I feel happy,

450
00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:19,620
but yesterday I felt anxious.

451
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,870
Israel's relationship with God has always
been a dynamic and a complex one and

452
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:25,860
two,
each of these books,

453
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:30,540
there was a time and a purpose in the
past and as countless readers of the Bible

454
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:35,040
have discovered over the centuries these
books offered continued teaching and

455
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:38,250
inspiration in the shifting
moments of every age.

456
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,130
Thank you very much for your
attention this semester.

457
00:28:41,131 --> 00:28:45,840
Don't forget the review session that will
be held here with me next week from 10

458
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:49,410
30 to 1230 and you're early,
you get to go home

459
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,370
10 [inaudible].
