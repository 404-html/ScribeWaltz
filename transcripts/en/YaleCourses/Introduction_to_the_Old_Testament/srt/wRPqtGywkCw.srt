1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,980
I mentioned in the opening lecture that
this course is going to be examined the

2
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:08,970
biblical Corpus from a variety of
different viewpoints and take a variety of

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,290
approaches, historical,
literary, religious, cultural,

4
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:18,240
and today we're going to
begin our appraisal of the
first portion of the Bible

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,150
as the product of a religious
and cultural revolution.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,800
The Bible is the product of mines that
were exposed to and influenced by and

7
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,870
reacting to the ideas and
cultures of their day.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,820
And as I suggested in the opening lecture
of Comparative Study of the literature

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,380
of the ancient Near East,

10
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:42,381
and the Bible reveals the shared cultural
and literary heritage at the same time

11
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:46,350
that it reveals great
differences between the two.

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,850
In the literature of the Bible,
some members of Israelite Society,

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,800
probably a cultural,

14
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:57,801
religious and literary elite broke
radically with the prevailing norms of the

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,050
day. They mounted a critique
of prevailing norms,

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,090
the persons responsible for the final
editing and shaping of the Bible somewhere

17
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:09,690
from the seventh to the fifth
or fourth century BCE, right?

18
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,330
We're not totally sure,
and we'll talk more about that,

19
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,050
but those final editors
were members of this group.

20
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:20,550
And they had a specific worldview and
they impose that worldview on the older

21
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:23,100
traditions and stories that
are found in the Bible.

22
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,320
That radical new world view
in the Bible was monotheism.

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,220
But why you might ask should the idea of
one God instead of many be so radical,

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,980
what is so different? What's different
about having the one God, um,

25
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,230
from having a pantheon of
gods headed by a superior God?

26
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:48,030
What is so new and revolutionary
about monotheism? Well,

27
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:49,080
according to one school of thought,

28
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:52,020
there isn't anything particularly
revolutionary about monotheism.

29
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,280
And the classical account of the rise
of monotheism that has prevailed for a

30
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:58,830
very long time runs as follows.

31
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:02,370
And I have a little flowchart
here to illustrate it for you.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,870
The argument goes that in every society
there's a natural progression and

33
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:11,220
natural progression from polytheism,
which is the belief in many gods.

34
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,460
Usually these are personifications of
natural forces to Henno theism and no one

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,130
God or modality,

36
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,580
which is really the worship of one
God as supreme over other gods.

37
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:28,100
So not denying the existence of the other
gods, ascribing reality to them, but um,

38
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,140
isolating one as the Supreme God and
onto monotheism where essentially one

39
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:37,950
believes only in the reality of one God.
And in the 18th and 19th centuries,

40
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,300
this progression was viewed as an
advanced, which has an advance,

41
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,980
which is not very surprising because
the whole theory was put forward by,

42
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,400
um, scholars who were
basically western monotheists.

43
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,480
And these scholars maintain that
certain elements of biblical religion

44
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:58,800
represented pure religion,
religion evolve to its highest form,

45
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:01,260
no longer tainted by pagan and,

46
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:05,140
and polytheistic elements of
Canaanite religion generally.

47
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,530
So applying an evolutionary
model to religion carried
with it a very clear value

48
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:15,700
judgment. Polytheism was understood
as clearly inferior and primitive.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,480
Manal tree was an improvement, right? It
was getting better, it was getting closer,

50
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:23,530
but monotheism was judged to be the
best and purest form of religion.

51
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,420
And that first,

52
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:29,470
the great archeological discoveries that
I talked about last time in the 19th

53
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:34,471
century seemed to support this claim that
Israelite monotheism had evolved from

54
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,820
Ancient Near Eastern Policy Ism cuneiform
tablets that were inscribed with the

55
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:44,110
great literature of
Mesopotamian civilizations were
uncovered and when they were

56
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:47,860
deciphered, they shed astonishing
light on biblical religion.

57
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,400
And these discoveries led to
a kind of parallel Romania.

58
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,380
That's how it's referred
to in the literature.

59
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,940
Scholars delighted in pointing out all
of the parallels in theme and language

60
00:03:57,941 --> 00:04:02,260
and plot and structure between biblical
stories and ancient near eastern stories.

61
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,190
So more than a thousand years before the
Israelite legend of Noah and the Ark,

62
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,970
you have Mesopotamians
telling the story of Zeus,

63
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:13,971
Soulja or in some versions [inaudible]
who also survived a great flood by

64
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:18,310
building an arc on the instruction of
a deity and the flood destroys all life

65
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,790
and he sends out birds to scout
out the dry land and so on.

66
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,910
So with parallels like these,
it was argued,

67
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,470
it was clear that the religion of the
Israelites was not so different from the

68
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:32,380
religions have their,
they're polytheistic are pagan neighbors.

69
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,710
They also had a creation story.
They had a flood story.

70
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,740
They did animal sacrifices,
they observed purity.

71
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:42,790
Taboos is sort of like religion was
another ancient near eastern religion.

72
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:46,270
And they differed from their neighbors
only over the number of gods they

73
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:50,410
worshiped, one or many. It
was just a more refined,

74
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:55,270
more highly evolved version of
ancient near eastern religion. Well,

75
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,740
this a view,

76
00:04:56,741 --> 00:05:01,110
this evolutionary viewer evolutionary
model was challenged by Amanda and has

77
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,120
killed Koufman Calvin in the 1930s.

78
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,570
And Kausmann argued that monotheism does
not and cannot evolve from polytheism

79
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,200
because the two are based on
radically divergent worldviews,

80
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:17,320
radically divergent
intuitions about reality.

81
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,510
And in a multivolume work, um, which
was later translated and abridged.

82
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,650
And you've got a selection of reading
from the translated abridgment.

83
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:31,000
So it's translated by Moshe Greenberg
and abridged version of his massive work.

84
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:36,001
The religion of Israel Koufman asserted
that the monotheism of Israel wasn't,

85
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,770
it couldn't be the natural outgrowth
of the polytheism of an earlier age.

86
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,180
It was a radical break with it.

87
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:45,790
It was a total cultural and
religious discontinuity.

88
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,780
It was a polemic against polytheism and
the pagan worldview that's implicit.

89
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:53,980
He says throughout the biblical text,

90
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,460
it's been said that Koufman replaces the
evolutionary model with a revolutionary

91
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:04,190
model. This was a revolution,
not an evolution. Now,

92
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:08,930
one advantage of Calvin's model is
that we avoid some of this pejorative.

93
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,460
We can avoid,

94
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,410
avoid some of the pejorative
evaluations of polytheism as primitive,

95
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,190
right? It's necessarily earlier in
primitive and [inaudible] and inferior.

96
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,230
There's simply positing the existence of
two distinct orientations to divergent

97
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:24,951
worldviews.

98
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:28,490
They each have their explanatory merits
and they each have their specific

99
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:32,510
problems and difficulties. It's not to
say that Calvin wasn't clearly judgmental,

100
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,540
but at least what the potential is
there for us to understand these as two

101
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:40,130
distinct systems. Um, each, again, as
I say with it's explanatory merits,

102
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:45,110
but as we'll see, some of the things
that monotheism, um, solves, um,

103
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,800
only invite other sorts of problems that
it has to wrestle with throughout it's

104
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:53,210
long life. Now in Calvin's
view, the similarities,

105
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:54,020
therefore,

106
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,860
between the Israelites and ancient
near eastern religion and cultures that

107
00:06:57,861 --> 00:07:00,440
everyone was so busily
finding and celebrating,

108
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,830
these were in the end similarities in
form an external structure appearance.

109
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,730
They weren't essential similarities.
They different in content? Sure.

110
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:14,330
They both have animal sacrifice. Sure.
They both have ritual purity laws.

111
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,610
Sure they share certain
stories and legends.

112
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,390
But these have been adopted by
the Israelites and transformed,

113
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,010
transformed into vehicles that convey
the basic ideas of the monotheistic

114
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,450
worldview.
Uh,

115
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,460
so as similarity and form doesn't
mean a similarity in function.

116
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:35,810
And in this Calvin's anticipating
arguments made by anthropologists,

117
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,530
the ritual cult of the Israelites may
look like that of their neighbors,

118
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:41,240
but it functioned very differently.

119
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:45,530
It's purpose was drastically different
from that of Israel's neighbors.

120
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,920
The Israelites, like their neighbors
may have set up a king over themselves,

121
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,330
but Israelite monarchy differed from
Canaanite monarchy insignificant ways

122
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,900
because of their monotheism. These are
all things we will test and explore.

123
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:02,170
So the meaning and function of Israel's
cult of Israel's king of its creation

124
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:04,160
stories or any of its other narratives,

125
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,520
they derive from the place of those items
within the larger cultural framework

126
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,820
or worldview of Israel.

127
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,260
And that larger framework or
worldview is one of basic monotheism.

128
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,130
So let's turn then to cal [inaudible]
description of the fundamental distinction

129
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:23,180
between the policy is stick worldview.

130
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,490
And the revolutionary
monotheistic worldview that
took root in Israel. And, um,

131
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,080
I am going to be rehearsing and then
critiquing the arguments that are in that

132
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,840
hundred page reading that
I signed for you this week.

133
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,510
This is the only time something
like this will happen in the course.

134
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,040
And I do that because these ideas are
so fundamental and we are going to be

135
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,510
wrestling with them throughout the course.

136
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:47,630
So it's important to me that you absorbed
this stuff right from the beginning

137
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:51,410
and think about it and be
critical of it and engage it. Um,

138
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,130
Calvin's ideas are very important.
They're also overstated in some ways,

139
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,020
and that's why we're going to be wrestling
with some of these ideas throughout

140
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:58,854
the course.

141
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,340
So let's begin with Calvin's
characterization of what
he calls pagan religion,

142
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,940
right?
That's the term that he uses,

143
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,430
the fundamental idea of pagan
religion. He says, and I quote,

144
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,760
the idea that there exists a realm of
being prior to the gods and above them

145
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,150
upon which they depend
and who's decrees even,

146
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,480
they must obey the Metta divine realm.

147
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,720
This is the realm of supreme and ultimate
power. And it transcends the deities.

148
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,141
All right?

149
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:36,141
The DD are the deities emerged from and
are therefore subject to the laws of the

150
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:37,620
Metta divine realm,

151
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:41,560
the forces and powers of the Metta
divine realm and the nature of this realm

152
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:45,960
very from pagan tradition to pagan
tradition. It might be water,

153
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,400
it might be darkness,

154
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,930
it might be spirit or in
ancient Greek religion,

155
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,170
I'm a more sort of philosophical
polytheism. It might be fate.

156
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,910
Even the gods are subject to the decrees
of fate. They have no control over that.

157
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,400
Kauffman asserts, therefore this, this
belief, once you posit a primordial realm,

158
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:09,990
some realm that is beside or beyond
the gods that's independent of them,

159
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:14,280
and primary,
you have automatically limited the gods.

160
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,100
So what I've done is I've spelled
out here for you consequences,

161
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,180
logical consequences of, of positing
a Meta divine realm. You know,

162
00:10:21,181 --> 00:10:24,030
once you have a a divine realm,
all of these things are going to follow.

163
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,150
The gods are going to be limited,
right?

164
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,670
They are not the source of all.

165
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:33,090
They are bound by their subservient
to this Metta divine realm.

166
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:39,020
There can therefore be no notion of
a supreme divine will and absolute or

167
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,530
sovereign divine will,

168
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,330
the will of any one God ultimately
can be countered by the decrees of the

169
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:47,520
primordial realm and the will,

170
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,390
the will of all the gods can be afforded
by the decrease of the primordial realm,

171
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:55,620
the will of any one God can be afforded
by perhaps another God. All right,

172
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,630
so the gods are limited in power.

173
00:10:57,631 --> 00:11:01,470
They're also limited in their wisdom
that falls under this as well.

174
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,150
They're not going to be all knowing or or,

175
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,880
or all wise because of the existence of
this realm that's beyond them and which

176
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:12,660
is in many ways mysterious to them as
well. It's unpredictable to them too.

177
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:17,340
It's not in their control or in their
power. Individual gods might be very wise.

178
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:21,660
They might be wise in particular crafts.
Um, they might be a god of healing very,

179
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:25,710
very wise and healing or God or some
other craft or area of knowledge.

180
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,690
But they possess wisdom as an attribute,
not as an essential characteristic.

181
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,780
Koufman asserts that mythology
is basic to pagan religions.

182
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,740
Mythologies.

183
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,330
Mythologies are the lives or tales of
the lives of gods tales of the lives of

184
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:44,550
the gods.
In Pagan religions,

185
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,780
the gods are born and they live
lives very similar to human lives,

186
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:51,240
but on a grand scale and then they die.

187
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:58,050
They might be reborn to pagan
religions contain the agonies,

188
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,570
the birth of a god,
the Organi accounts of the births of gods.

189
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,470
Now, this impersonal, primordial realm,

190
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:09,610
Kaufman declares contains
the seeds of all beings.

191
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:11,290
Very often in these creation stories,

192
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:15,160
there is some sense of some realm
from which life begins to emerge,

193
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:17,410
usually beginning with God's.
Um,

194
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:21,580
so these come on cause my agonies and
Thiago [inaudible] will describe the

195
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:25,240
generation of sexually
differentiated divine beings.

196
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,630
Also the generation of the natural world,

197
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,930
also the generation of human
beings and animals. In other words,

198
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:36,040
this is the primordial womb
for all that is divine,

199
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,450
human and natural. It is a source
of everything, mundane and divine.

200
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,160
What that means,
Koufman asserts as that in pagan religion,

201
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:48,370
there's very often a fluid
boundary between the divine,

202
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,740
the human and the natural worlds.

203
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,420
They blur into one another because they
all emerge ultimately from this same

204
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,450
primordial world stuff,
right?

205
00:12:58,451 --> 00:13:00,880
The distinctions between them are soft.

206
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,350
We see this in the fact that God's
are very often associated with natural

207
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:09,940
powerful forces, right? The,
the, the sky is a god. Um,

208
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,770
the fire is a god, a fertility
and natural processes that God,

209
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,430
so there's no real distinction between
the worship of gods and the worship of

210
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,440
nature. Second, he says,

211
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:24,790
because humans also emerge ultimately
from this primordial realm,

212
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,510
there's a confusion of the boundary
between the divine and the human.

213
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:31,910
That's common. He says he
chooses the word confusion. Um,

214
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,030
that's common in pagan religion.

215
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,070
And so we often have in pagan religions
unions between divine beings and human

216
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:41,680
beings. Kaufman argues, and I quote,

217
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,180
that the continuity between the divine
and human realm is that the basis of the

218
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:51,181
pagan belief in apotheosis humans
becoming gods perhaps after death,

219
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:54,340
for example,
becoming immortal or um,

220
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,690
very often kings when they
ascend to the throne become gods.

221
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,370
Whatever power the gods have Kaufman says
is not due to the fact that there will

222
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,420
is absolute or their spirit is absolute.

223
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,610
The realm that transcends the gods.
This met a divine realm is,

224
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,180
is that which has ultimate power and the
stuff of which it is made is what has

225
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:26,260
ultimate power.
So power is materially conceived.

226
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,040
It's it inheres in certain
things and certain substances,

227
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:34,990
particularly substances or materials that
are deeply connected to whatever this

228
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:37,870
primordial world stuff is.
So if it's blood,

229
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,190
then blood that courses through the
veins of living creatures as seem to have

230
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:44,920
some deep and powerful connection
with the Metta divine realm,

231
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,490
and that is where power resides. If it
is water, then water will be articulate,

232
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,330
will be viewed as particularly and
materially powerful in that particular

233
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:54,740
system.
Um,

234
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:59,741
so gods have power only in so far as
they are connected with that primordial

235
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,720
world stuff, technical term that I
use throughout this, this lecture.

236
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,560
That means that magic is possible in
such a system because power is materially

237
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:14,720
conceived.
In other words,

238
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:19,430
since it is believed to in here in certain
natural substances that resemble or

239
00:15:19,431 --> 00:15:24,290
are connected to the primordial world
stuff, that's the source of all power.

240
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,100
Then magic is possible by
manipulating those materials.

241
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:31,910
Substances in certain ways. Might be clay,
it might be water, it might be blood.

242
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:37,420
Then whatever is believed to hold the
power of this primordial life force,

243
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
humans can tap into and influence the
activities of the Metta divine realm.

244
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,980
Um,
so through manipulation,

245
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:48,950
magical manipulations of certain
substances they can harness.

246
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,880
Kaufman says they can
harness these forces,

247
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:55,130
these independent self operating forces,

248
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:00,340
and so the human magician is really a
technician and he can make these forces

249
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,630
come to bear on even the gods to coerce
the gods to do his will and so on.

250
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,380
So magic in a pagan system,

251
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:12,500
Katherin claims is a way
of getting around the gods,

252
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:16,280
circumventing the capricious
will of the gods and the demons.

253
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,930
Because magic is directed at the Metta
divine realm trying to tap into its

254
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:22,580
powers.
It's not directed at the gods.

255
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,390
It's trying to tap into the ultimate
source of power to use that power to

256
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:30,710
influence the gods in a particular way
or protect oneself against the gods.

257
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,500
Similarly,
divination.

258
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,700
Divination is an attempt to discern
the future. That's once again,

259
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,170
heads right to the source of power.

260
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:42,800
It's not directed at the gods unless
you're hoping to use them as a medium

261
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,720
through which to get access
to the Metta divine realm.

262
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:49,700
But ultimately most of the nation is aimed
at and tapping the secrets and um, uh,

263
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:52,040
of the Metta divine
realm and not the gods.

264
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,920
Discerning the will of the gods
is really of little use, right?

265
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:58,640
Because even there will can be forwarded
or overthrown by other gods or by the

266
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:00,230
decrees of the Metta divine realm.

267
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,840
The Pagan cult calcium
claims is a system of rights.

268
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:08,240
I use the word cult and every
year people look at me and say,

269
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:10,220
you know what it's called?
I don't even understand what that means.

270
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:15,110
We'll learn more about cult, but it
refers to a system of rights. Okay.

271
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:18,170
A system of rights and we'll, we'll be
looking at the Israelite coat later.

272
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,090
So the pagan cult,
he says,

273
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:25,091
is a system of rights that involves
the manipulation of substances.

274
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,090
Again, blood, animal, flesh,
human flesh, precious metals,

275
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:32,780
and so on that are believed to have
some kind of inherent power, again,

276
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:37,760
because of their connection to whatever
the primer mortal world stuff may be in

277
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:40,460
that tradition.
So according to Kauffman,

278
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:43,670
there's always an element
of magic in the pagan cult.

279
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,780
It's seeking through these rituals and
manipulations of certain substances to

280
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,380
again,
let loose certain powers set into motion,

281
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:57,000
certain forces that will coerce a
god to be propitiated, for example,

282
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,560
or calmed or to act favorably
or to vindicate the devotees.

283
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,543
And so on.

284
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,290
Some of these cultic acts might be
defensive or protective so that the God

285
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,450
cannot harm. Um, the worshiper.

286
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,250
Many of the Celtic festivals
are keyed in to mythology,

287
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,110
the stories of the lives of the gods.

288
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,370
Many of the Celtic festivals will be
reenactments of events in the life of the

289
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:23,580
god of battle,
that the God had the death of the God.

290
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:27,450
Usually in the winter occultic rituals,
we'll reenact the death of the God,

291
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,150
and then in spring,
the rising or resurrection of the God.

292
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,480
These are all reenactment
festivals that occur very often.

293
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,440
And it's believed that by reenacting
these festivals in this cultic way,

294
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,910
one brings magical powers into play and,

295
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:45,540
and Ken in fact ensure and maintain
the reemergence of life in the spring.

296
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,650
And so it's essential for the maintenance
and preservation of, of world.

297
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,640
Um,
one final and very important point,

298
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,190
and we're going to wrestle with
this quite a bit during the year.

299
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:01,730
Koufman claims again in the primordial
in the polytheistic worldview,

300
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,520
the primordial realm contains
the seeds of all being.

301
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:12,390
Everything is generated from that realm,
good and bad.

302
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,220
So just as there are good gods who,
um,

303
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,260
might protect human beings,

304
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:24,261
there are also evil gods who seek to
destroy both humans and other gods.

305
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:30,650
Death and disease are consigned to the
realm of these evil demons or these

306
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:35,130
impure, evil spirits, but they
are siblings with the good.

307
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:39,390
God's human beings are
basically powerless.

308
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:44,420
He says in the continual cosmic struggle
between the good gods and the evil

309
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:49,200
demons,
unless they can utilize magic divination,

310
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,760
tap into the powers of
the Metta divine realm,

311
00:19:51,761 --> 00:19:55,950
circumvent the gods who might be
making their lives rather miserable.

312
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,990
But what's important is that councilman
insists that in the Pagan view,

313
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,620
evil is an autonomous demonic realm.

314
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:08,160
It is as primary and real as
the realm of the holier good.

315
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,430
God's evil is a metaphysical reality.

316
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,100
It is built into the
structure of the universe.

317
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,570
That's the way the universe was made.
The primordial stuff that's spawned,

318
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:22,830
all that is spawned it,
good and bad and exactly as it is.

319
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:24,420
And it's there and it's real

320
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,990
salvation.

321
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,220
He says is the concern of humans.

322
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,020
The gods aren't interested in
human salvation there, uh, from,

323
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,170
from the capricious forces and powers in
the world because they're trying to say

324
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:44,110
themselves. You know, the good guys are
being attacked by the evil gods. Um, the,

325
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:48,700
the powers and decrease with the Metta
divine realm are hassling them as well as

326
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:52,180
anybody else. So, um, he, they
can't be worried about humans.

327
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:53,410
They're worried about themselves.

328
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,790
Salvation is a team as a
team through magic or, um,

329
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,810
gnostic means,

330
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,310
gnostic means gnosticism refers to
knowledge of secrets that can in some way

331
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:06,070
liberate one from the regular rules.
Um,

332
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,120
and so as long as one can
somehow circumvent the God,

333
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,380
God's Taiwan self into the powers of
the Metta divine realm to be beyond the

334
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:18,490
reach of the demons and the capricious
gods who make life on earth and misery,

335
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,230
that is the path for salvation.

336
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:26,070
So Kaufman says that the
pagan worldview is one of an,

337
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,490
a moral universe. Somewhere
around here. There we go.

338
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:34,240
A moral universe, not a moral universe,
not an immoral moral universe,

339
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:37,780
but in a moral universe,
it is morally neutral.

340
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:43,120
There are gods who are legislators and
guardians of social order and justice,

341
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,100
but their laws aren't absolute.

342
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:49,960
They can be leveled by the decrease of
this supreme met a divine realm. Um,

343
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,710
and since the knowledge and
wisdom of each God is limited,

344
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,120
morality can be defined as what a
particular God likes or desires.

345
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:01,390
And that may be different from
what another God likes her desires.

346
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,910
And there's no absolute morality then.

347
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,910
And it's that picture of the universe.

348
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:12,030
Calvin wants to argue that is challenged
by the monotheistic revolution again,

349
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:14,710
right? He sees this as a
revolution of ancient Israel.

350
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,350
So according to Koufman,

351
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,460
the fundamental idea of
ancient Israelite writing,

352
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,450
which receives no systematic formulation
but permeates the entire Bible,

353
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,660
and his view is a radically new
idea of a god who is himself.

354
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,080
The source of all being not
subject to a Meta divine realm.

355
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,220
There's no transcendent
cosmic order or power.

356
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,790
He does not emerge from
some preexisting realm,

357
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,420
and therefore he is free of
all of the limitations of myth.

358
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,840
And magic will go
through these one by one,

359
00:22:55,841 --> 00:23:00,280
but a god whose will is absolute
and sovereign. All right,

360
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,560
so what then are the implications of the
elimination of this Metta divine realm?

361
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,090
All right?
They're just,

362
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:10,840
as these points flowed logically
from positing a Meta divine realm,

363
00:23:10,841 --> 00:23:15,260
what flows logically from eliminating a
Metta divine realm and positing simply a

364
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:19,990
god that does not emerge from any
preexisting power or order or realm? Well,

365
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:22,420
first of all, there's no Thiago
any or mythology in the Bible.

366
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,370
God isn't born from some primordial wound.
We doesn't have a life story.

367
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:28,990
There's no,
um,

368
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:34,030
realm that is primary to him
were a prior to him and it's,

369
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,090
and there was no round. That is
the source of his power and wisdom.

370
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,460
So in the opening chapters of Genesis,
God simply is, he doesn't grow.

371
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:45,410
We doesn't age, he doesn't mature.
He doesn't have in the Bible,

372
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,220
a female consort. Um, God doesn't die.

373
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,840
So in the Hebrew Bible Koufman
claims for the first time in history,

374
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,110
we meet an unlimited God was timeless
and ageless and nonphysical and eternal.

375
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,030
That means that this
God transcends nature,

376
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,100
which means we're going to get rid
of number three as well, right?

377
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,110
As the sovereign of all realms.

378
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:15,500
God isn't by nature of bound
to any particular realm.

379
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:20,500
He's not identifiable as a force of nature
or identified with a force of nature.

380
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:26,150
Nature certainly becomes the stage
of God's expression of his will.

381
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:31,070
Um, he expresses his will and purpose
through forces of nature in the Bible,

382
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,520
but nature isn't God
himself is not identified.

383
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,380
He is wholly other.

384
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,340
He isn't kin to humans in any way either.

385
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,340
So there is no,
um,

386
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,120
blurring those soft boundary between
humans and the divine according to

387
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:53,210
[inaudible] in the Bible there.
And there's no apotheosis in the Bible,

388
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,190
no life after death in the Bible either.

389
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:59,480
Did you know that have to wait a few
centuries for that idea to come along,

390
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,410
but certainly not in, in the Hebrew
Bible, people live 70 years and that's it.

391
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:08,000
So there's no process by which humans
become gods and certainly no process in

392
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:08,990
the reverse as well.

393
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,400
Magic in the Hebrew Bible
is represented as useless.

394
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,710
It's pointless.
There's no Mehta divine realm to tap into.

395
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:22,520
Power doesn't adhere on any
stuff in the natural world.

396
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,150
So the world is sort of de divinized,
right?

397
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:30,950
D mythologized power isn't understood
as a material thing or something that

398
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:32,840
adheres and materials substances.

399
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,320
God can't be manipulated or coerced
by charms or words or rituals.

400
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:41,900
They have no power and
cannot be used in that way.

401
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:44,660
And so magic or is sin is sin.

402
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:49,200
Magic is sin or rebellion against God
because it's predicated on a whole mistake

403
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:53,090
in notion, um, of of God
having limited power.

404
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,170
There are magical conceptions
throughout the Bible,

405
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,020
you're going to run into them.
But interestingly enough,

406
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:01,880
the editors of the stories
in which they appear,

407
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:06,680
we'll very often hammer home the
conclusion that I'm actually what happened

408
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:08,540
happened because God willed it to happen.

409
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,360
The event occurred because
God wanted it to occur.

410
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,680
It didn't occur independently of his
will or by virtue of some power that's

411
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:18,230
inherent in the magicians.
Artifices.

412
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:23,530
So Koufman argues that magic in the
Bible is recast as a witness to God's

413
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,400
sovereignty. God's power,
um, and is stripped.

414
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:32,210
Magical actions are stripped of
their, uh, autonomous potency.

415
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,010
Again, they're serving as vehicles then
for the manifestation of the will of God.

416
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:42,850
Divination is also a unassimilatable
to the monotheistic idea according to

417
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:47,640
Koufman, because it also presupposes the
existence of some Metta divine realm,

418
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:52,500
some source of power,
knowledge or information that
transcends God. And again,

419
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:55,740
it's an attempt to reveal God's
secrets in an ungodly way,

420
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:57,300
predicated on a mistake.

421
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:02,470
It is permitted to make
inquiries of God through, um,

422
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,380
or regular devices,

423
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,950
but God only conveys
information at his own will.

424
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:10,680
There's no ritual or incantation.
Kauffman says,

425
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:15,990
or material substance that can
coerce of revelation from God.

426
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:21,240
So we will see things that looked like
magic and divination and oracles and

427
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:25,680
dreams and prophecy in the pagan
world and an ancient Israel.

428
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,410
But Koufman says the similarities,

429
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,810
a similarity in form only
and it's a superficial,

430
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,090
formal external similarity.

431
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,620
Each of these phenomena he says is
transformed by the Basic Israelite idea of

432
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:41,880
one supreme transcendent God,
um, whose will is absolute.

433
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,990
And all of these things relate to
the direct word and will of God.

434
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:50,160
They aren't recourse to a separate
science or law or body of knowledge or

435
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:55,161
interpretive craft that calls upon forces
are powers that transcend or God or

436
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:58,620
independent of God.
By the same token,

437
00:27:58,621 --> 00:28:01,610
the cult Koufman says is,
um,

438
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,990
has no automatic or material power.

439
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:07,380
It's not just sort of a place where
certain kinds of magical coercive acts

440
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:12,270
happen. The cult isn't designed to
service the material needs of God either.

441
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:16,050
Um, it doesn't affect his life and
vitality. By enacting certain rituals,

442
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:18,510
you don't ensure that God
doesn't die and so on.

443
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:22,440
No events in God's life are celebrated,
right?

444
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,950
The festivals that are carried out
in the Celtic contacts context.

445
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:31,250
So the mythological rationales for cult
that you find amongst Israel's neighbors

446
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,670
are replaced and they're replaced
very often by historical rationales.

447
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,840
This action is done to commemorate such
and such event in the history of the

448
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:44,490
nation. Uh, so pagan festivals in Israel,

449
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,840
uh,
Koufman says,

450
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:51,020
are historicized commemorating events
in the life of the people and not in the

451
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:55,350
story of the God's life since
we have no mythology. So, um,

452
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,580
but we are going to be spending
a fair amount of time, uh,

453
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,940
talking actually about the
meaning and the function of,

454
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:03,690
of Israel's purity laws and Celtic
laws in a, in a later lecture.

455
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,251
Now,

456
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:10,251
since God is himself the
transcendent source of all being,

457
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,840
and since he is good

458
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,930
in a monotheistic system,

459
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,610
there are no evil agents
that constitute around,

460
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,400
that opposes God as an equal rival,

461
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:28,830
no divine evil agents. Again,
in the pagan world view,

462
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,340
the primordial womb spawns,
um, all sorts of beings.

463
00:29:32,341 --> 00:29:35,310
All kinds of divinity is good and
evil that are in equal strength.

464
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:37,620
They're sort of locked
in this cosmic struggle.

465
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,890
But in the Israelite worldview of
God is the source of all being.

466
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:45,490
And there can't be around of supernatural
beings that do battle with him.

467
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:50,491
There's no room for divine antagonist of
the one Supreme God is leading us down

468
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:57,181
here to this point that sin and evil
are d mythologized in the Hebrew Bible.

469
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,870
And that's very interesting. It's going
to lead to a lot of interesting things.

470
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:04,570
It's also going to create
a really huge problem, um,

471
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,330
for monotheistic thought they're going
to struggle with for centuries and

472
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:11,260
actually still do struggle with today.
But again,

473
00:30:11,261 --> 00:30:12,400
in the Pagan Worldview,

474
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:17,490
sin is understood very often as the work
of a demon or an evil God that might

475
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:22,741
possess a person might have
to be exercised from that
person by means of magic.

476
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,160
You know, if you tap into some of these
substances and you can use the magical,

477
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,430
the powers in those substances to
coerce the demon to be expelled from the

478
00:30:30,431 --> 00:30:31,300
person's body,

479
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,750
these are things that are very common
and in polytheistic pagan practices.

480
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:39,730
But in Israel we have no metta divine
realm to spawn. These evil beings, these,

481
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,960
these various gods,

482
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:46,310
so Israelite religion did not conceive
of sin as caused by an independent evil

483
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:52,111
power that exists out there in the
universe and as defined the will of God.

484
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:53,763
Instead,

485
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,950
evil comes about as a result of the
clash of the will of God and the will of

486
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:01,870
humans who happened to
have the freedom to rebel.

487
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:06,940
There's nothing inherently
supernatural about sin.

488
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,170
It's not a force or a power
built into the universe.

489
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,630
Koufman is claiming therefore it that
an Israel evil is transferred from the

490
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,200
metaphysical realm built into the
physical structure of the universe to the

491
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,060
moral realm.
I've put it up here for you,

492
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:25,870
evil is a moral and that
a metaphysical reality.

493
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:31,720
It doesn't have a concrete independent
existence and that means that human

494
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:36,220
beings and only human beings are the
potential source of evil in the world.

495
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,450
Responsibility for evil lies
in the hands of human beings.

496
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,020
In the Hebrew Bible, no one will
ever say, the devil made me do it.

497
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,850
There is no devil in the Hebrew Bible.

498
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,400
That's also the invention
of a much later age.

499
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:52,600
And that is an important and
critical ethical revolution.

500
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:55,930
Evil is a moral and that a
metaphysical reality. You had a

501
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,560
great, that's what you get to
talk about. Wonderful question.

502
00:32:02,561 --> 00:32:06,260
But what about when eve is tempted
by the serpent? Who is the serpent?

503
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:10,160
What is they doing? What's going on? What
does calcium and claiming? Okay, that's,

504
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,740
that's exactly the kind of stuff that
should be popping into your head.

505
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,440
What about what about,
okay.

506
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:20,270
And in section you're going
to be discussing exactly
that story. Okay. And that's,

507
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,610
that's, that's one of those
texts. And in a minute,

508
00:32:22,611 --> 00:32:24,020
if I haven't at the end of the lecture,

509
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:27,530
ask again if I haven't kind of gotten
to a part of an answer to your question.

510
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:31,280
Okay. Um, but uh, again,

511
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,770
this emphasis on evil as a moral
choice. Think of Genesis for where, uh,

512
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:40,970
God warns Cain who's filled with anger
and jealousy and is thinking about doing

513
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:45,740
all kinds of horrible things. His brother
and God says, Sin Crouches at the door.

514
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,240
It's urges toward you, yet
you can be its master. Right.

515
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,980
This is a question of moral choice.

516
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,960
Final point then is it didn't, we're not
gonna talk about salvation right now,

517
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,690
but we're going to talk about
the fact that the supreme,

518
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:04,900
the only supreme law is the will of God
because God is a creator God rather than

519
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:06,830
a created God.

520
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,520
He's imposed order an
order upon the cosmos.

521
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:15,950
And so the pagan picture of an a moral
universe of just competing powers,

522
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,680
good and evil,
Kaufman says,

523
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:22,640
is transformed into a
picture of a moral cosmos.

524
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,570
The highest law is a will of God,
and that imposes on morality upon the,

525
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,540
the, the structure of the universe.
So in some Calvin's argument,

526
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:33,374
is this,

527
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,640
Israel conceived of the
divine in an entirely new way.

528
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:43,310
Israel's God differed from the pagan
gods in it's in his essential nature,

529
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,410
the pagan gods were natural gods.

530
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:49,610
They were very often associated with
line forces of nature with no intrinsic

531
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,900
moral character.
He says,

532
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,080
and the God of Israel was understood to
transcend nature and his will was not

533
00:33:56,331 --> 00:34:01,040
only absolute, it was absolutely good and
more. A lot of people say, well, in a way,

534
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,830
didn't we just renamed them
at a divine realm? God, no.

535
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,700
Because the difference
here is that it's positive.

536
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,550
Not only that this God is the only power,
but that he is only good,

537
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,250
and that was not the case with
the at a divine realm, right?

538
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,480
That was a morally neutral,

539
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:18,320
but there's a moral claim that's being
made by the writers of the Hebrew Bible

540
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:19,910
about this supreme power.

541
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:24,140
This god God is depicted
as just compassionate.

542
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,270
Morality, therefore is perceived
as conforming to the will of God,

543
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:34,690
and there are absolute standards then
of justice and reverence for life.

544
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,960
Now,
Koufman says God is d mythologized,

545
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,000
but even though he's deemed mythologized,

546
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:42,950
he's not rendered completely impersonal.

547
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:48,170
He's spoken up anthropomorphically his
so that we can capture his interaction

548
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:49,040
with human beings.

549
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:53,300
This is the only way Goffman says you
can write in any meaningful sense about

550
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:56,810
the interaction between God and humanity.
So he has to be anthropomorphized,

551
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,120
but the interaction between
God and humans, he says
happens not through nature,

552
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:06,470
but through history. God is not
known through natural manifestations.

553
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:10,880
He's known by his action in the world
in historical time and his relationship

554
00:35:10,881 --> 00:35:15,881
with a historical people just want to
read you a few sentences from an article.

555
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:19,010
Calvin wrote a different one
from the one that you read,

556
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,810
but it sums up his idea that there's
an abyss that separates monotheism and

557
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:28,811
polytheism and he says that it would be
a mistake to think that the difference

558
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:30,590
between the two is arithmetic,

559
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:35,810
that a polytheistic tradition in which
there are 10 gods is a lot more like

560
00:35:35,811 --> 00:35:39,960
monotheism than a tradition in which
there are 40 gods because as you get

561
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:43,260
smaller number,
it gets closer to being monotheistic.

562
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,720
He says the pagan idea,
and I quote,

563
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:50,790
does not approach Israelite monotheism
as it diminishes the number of it's gods.

564
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,290
The Israelite conception of God's unity
entails his sovereign transcendence

565
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,760
overall.
That's the real issue.

566
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,910
It rejects the pagan idea
of around beyond the deity,

567
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:01,740
the source of mythology and magic.

568
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:06,350
The affirmation that the will of God is
supreme and absolutely free is a new and

569
00:36:06,351 --> 00:36:08,370
non pagan category of thought.

570
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:11,820
That's an an article in the great
ages and ideas of the Jewish people.

571
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:17,160
And he goes on again to say that this
affirmation isn't stated dogmatically

572
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:21,870
anywhere, but it pervades Israelite
creativity, biblical texts.

573
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,310
He also asserts that the idea
is kind of developed over time,

574
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:30,750
but that basically there was a fundamental
revolution and break and then more

575
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:32,900
within that there was some development of,

576
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:37,230
of some of the latent
potential of that idea. So,

577
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:42,030
which is it? Right, which is part of
the question that came from over here.

578
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,100
You have on the one hand,

579
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:48,540
the claim that Israelite religion is
essentially continuous with ancient near

580
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:50,220
eastern, uh, polytheism. It,

581
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,860
it's merely limiting the number
of gods were shipped to one,

582
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:57,630
but it houses that God in a temple,
it offers him sacrifices and so on.

583
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,461
And then on the other hand,

584
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:03,660
we have Kaufman's claim that Israelite
religion is a radical break from the

585
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:06,660
religions of the ancient Near East.
Well,

586
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,970
the value of Calvin's work,

587
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:14,190
I think lies in the insight that
monotheism and polytheism in the abstract.

588
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,780
I'm not sure they exist
anywhere in the world,

589
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:24,410
but in the abstract are predicated on
divergent intuitions as systems they they,

590
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:31,700
they do seem to describe very different
worlds and therefore as a system,

591
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:38,300
the difference between Israel's God and
the Gods of Israel's neighbors was not

592
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,030
merely quantitative it with qualitative.
There's a qualitative difference here.

593
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,490
However,
when you read his work,

594
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:49,491
it's clear that he often has to force
his evidence and it rather badly,

595
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:54,860
and it's simply a fact that practices
and ideas that are not strictly or even

596
00:37:55,861 --> 00:37:59,760
strongly monotheistic
do appear in the Bible.

597
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,990
So perhaps so scholars who stressed
the continuity between Israel and her

598
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:06,030
environment are right after all,

599
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:12,020
and this impasse I think can be resolved
to a large degree when we realize that

600
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:14,910
there we have to make
a distinction between,

601
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,850
well,
let's do it this way.

602
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:21,330
First we're going to talk about
a distinction between the actual,

603
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:25,200
I hate to say that as if I can somehow
show you a snapshot of what people did

604
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:26,250
3000 years ago,

605
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:31,020
but between the actual religious practices
and beliefs of the actual inhabitants

606
00:38:31,021 --> 00:38:34,230
of Israel and Judah were going to
call that Israelite Judy and religion.

607
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,460
You know what,
somebody back in the year,

608
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:40,920
900 BCE might've done when they went
to the temple and what they might've

609
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,300
thought they were doing when
they went to the temple.

610
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,620
Cause I'm not sure it was necessarily
what the author of the book of Deuteronomy

611
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,820
says they're doing when they
go to the temple. All right,

612
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:52,720
so there's a difference between what
actual people live inhabitants of Israel

613
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:54,220
and Judah did.

614
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:58,180
We'll call that Israelite
Judy and religion and the
religion that's promoted or

615
00:38:58,181 --> 00:39:02,320
the world view prefer that term as
being promoted by the later writers and

616
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:05,200
editors of Biblical stories who
are telling the story of these.

617
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:07,270
People will call that biblical religion,

618
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:12,271
the religion or the worldview
that we can see emerging from,

619
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,110
from any biblical texts.

620
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,300
That distinction is found in an article
and you're Jewish Study Bible and

621
00:39:18,301 --> 00:39:22,150
article by Steven Geller. You're going to
be reading that later on in the course,

622
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,790
but be aware of that
distinction and that article,

623
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:30,360
what second Millennium Hebrews and early
first millennium Israelites or Judeans

624
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,990
Jude Heights actually believed or did,

625
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:39,790
is not always retrievable. In fact,
probably not retrievable to us.

626
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:44,440
We have some clues, but in all
likelihood, Hebrews of an older time,

627
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:47,290
the patriarchal period,
the second millennium BCE,

628
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,860
they probably weren't markedly different
from many of their polytheistic

629
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:54,100
neighbors. Archeology would suggest
that in some ways that's true.

630
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:59,490
We do find evidence in the Bible as
well as in the archaeological record of

631
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:03,130
popular practices that are
not strictly monotheistic,

632
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,730
the worst a little
household idols, right? Um,

633
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:10,360
local fertility deities,
for example,

634
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:15,870
most scholars conjecture that
ancient Israelite UDN religion,

635
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,390
that the practices of the people in the
kingdoms of Israel and Judah and the

636
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:23,090
first millennium BCE was,
it was maybe trust.

637
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,490
They might have promoted the
worship of one God. Yeah,

638
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,280
way without denying the existence
of other gods and still kept their,

639
00:40:29,281 --> 00:40:33,190
their a little idols and fertility
gods are gauged in various syncretistic

640
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:34,024
practices.

641
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:39,160
It was probably monologist rather than
monotheistic really asserting the reality

642
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:41,740
of only one God.
Moreover,

643
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,640
our evidence suggests that
Yahweh was in many respects,

644
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:49,780
very similar to many of the gods
of Canaanite religion. And we'll,

645
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,060
we'll be talking about some of
those at the appropriate time.

646
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:56,560
But continuity's with Canaanite and
ancient near eastern religions are,

647
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,340
um,

648
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:02,340
apparent in the worship practices and
the cult objects of ancient Israel and

649
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:06,220
Judah as they're described in the
biblical stories. And as we find them in,

650
00:41:06,221 --> 00:41:07,990
in archeological discoveries,

651
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,450
the Hebrew Bible also contains sources
that exhibit features of what Calvin has

652
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:16,840
described as contemporary polytheism.
And Genesis six,

653
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,270
I mean that the texts you pointed
out as a good one, but even better,

654
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:22,480
go look at Genesis six where
you have these Nuffield, Liam,

655
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:25,750
these divine beings who descend to
earth and they mate with female humans.

656
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:30,730
That's a real fluid boundary between the
divine and human realms if you ask me,

657
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:35,330
but it only happens there in one
spot in many passages to y'all.

658
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:39,290
Why is represented as presiding
over a council of Gods, right?

659
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:41,990
Certainly in the psalms we have these
sort of poetic and metaphoric descriptions

660
00:41:41,991 --> 00:41:44,420
are gone. It's okay guys,
what do you think providing,

661
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:46,400
or he's one of them actually in one psalm,
it's great.

662
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:48,650
He's one of the guys and
he says, you know, you guys
don't know what you're doing.

663
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:52,150
Let me take over. He stands up in
the council and takes over. So there,

664
00:41:52,151 --> 00:41:55,790
and there are other passages in the Bible
too that assume the existence of gods,

665
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,070
other gods worshiped by other nations,

666
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,850
so there's certainly stuff like that in
there. You don't have to think about now.

667
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,630
Nevertheless,

668
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:07,130
the most strongly monotheistic sources
of the Bible do positive God that is

669
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:11,660
qualitatively different from the gods
that populated the mythology of Israel's

670
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:16,661
neighbors and probably also Israelite
Judean religion in these sources.

671
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:20,150
Israelites,
deity is clearly the source of all being.

672
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,840
He doesn't emerge from a
preexisting realm. He has no
divine siblings. His will,

673
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:29,390
his absolute, his will is sovereign. He's
not affected by magical coercion. Um,

674
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,340
and biblical monotheism.

675
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:35,420
Biblical religion assumes that this
God is inherently good. He's just,

676
00:42:35,421 --> 00:42:40,421
he's compassionate and human morality is
conformity to his will because certain

677
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:46,640
texts of the Bible posit this absolutely
good God who places absolute moral

678
00:42:46,641 --> 00:42:48,410
demands on humankind.

679
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:51,860
Biblical monotheism is often
referred to as ethical monotheism.

680
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,320
So it's a term that you'll see quite a bit

681
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,250
ethical monotheism,

682
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:04,300
beginning perhaps as early as the eighth
century and continuing for several

683
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:09,860
centuries literate and
decidedly monotheistic circles
within Israelite society

684
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:15,290
put a monotheistic framework
on the ancient stories and
traditions of the nation.

685
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:20,470
They molded them into a foundation myth
that would shape Israelite and Jewish

686
00:43:20,691 --> 00:43:24,980
self identity and understanding in
a profound way they projected their

687
00:43:24,981 --> 00:43:29,540
monotheism onto an earlier time onto
the nation's most ancient ancestors.

688
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,710
Israelite monotheism is represented in
the Bible as beginning with Abraham.

689
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,510
Historically speaking,

690
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,840
it most likely began much
later and probably as a
minority movement that grew to

691
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:42,590
prominence over centuries.

692
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:47,570
But that later monotheism is projected
back over Israel's history by the final

693
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:48,710
editors of the Bible.

694
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,300
And that creates the impression of the
biblical religion that Calton describes

695
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:57,320
so well, right? But the
biblical text itself,

696
00:43:57,321 --> 00:44:01,130
the Biblical record is very conflicted.
Um,

697
00:44:01,131 --> 00:44:02,840
and that's part of the fun of reading it.

698
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,860
And you will see the biblical record
pointing to two different and conflicting

699
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:07,730
realities.

700
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,230
You will find religious practices and
views that aren't strictly monotheistic

701
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:15,170
and you'll find later religious
practices and views that are,

702
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,510
and the later sources, which we might
best call biblical religion, are breaking,

703
00:44:20,511 --> 00:44:24,590
therefore, not only with
ancient near eastern practices,

704
00:44:24,591 --> 00:44:28,910
but also with Israelite Judy and practices
with other elements within their own

705
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:29,744
society.

706
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:34,990
So biblical religion Koufman describes
it isn't I think just a revolution of

707
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:36,270
Israel against the nations.

708
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:39,690
I think it's also a civil
war of Israel against itself.

709
00:44:39,691 --> 00:44:43,770
And that's an aspect that is really,
um, not entertained by Calvin.

710
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:47,580
And I think it's an important one for
us to entertain so that we can allow the

711
00:44:47,581 --> 00:44:52,170
biblical text to speak to us in all of
its polyphony and not try to force it all

712
00:44:52,171 --> 00:44:57,000
into one model. Right. Well, I know
this is a monotheistic text, so gosh,

713
00:44:57,001 --> 00:45:00,330
I better come up with an explanation of
genesis six that works with monotheism,

714
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:03,090
you know? Okay, you're going to
be freed of having to do that.

715
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,280
I'm going to be freed
of having to do that.

716
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:09,840
Let the text be contradictory
and inconsistent and difficult.

717
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:11,700
Let it be difficult.
Don't homogenize it off.

718
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:17,250
So the differences between the god of
the monetizing sources of the Bible and

719
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:21,630
the gods of surrounding Mesopotamian
literature and older Israelite ideas,

720
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:26,190
perhaps, um, they're apparent from
the very first chapters of genesis.

721
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,140
That's a creation story.
In genesis one,

722
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:31,710
we're going to see a creation story
that's added to the pentitude pentitude,

723
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,930
the first five books of the Bible,
genesis through Deuteronomy.

724
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,260
This creation story is
added to the Pentateuch,

725
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,480
probably in one of the
last rounds of editing,

726
00:45:39,481 --> 00:45:42,840
probably sixth century
perhaps we don't really know,

727
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:48,420
but genesis one is a very strongly
monotheistic opening to the primeval myths

728
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,740
that are then contained in the
next 10 chapters of genesis.

729
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,310
So next time we're going to start with
a close reading and examination of

730
00:45:56,311 --> 00:45:57,690
genesis one through four.

731
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:02,460
We're going to read these stories with
an eye to Israel's adaptation of near

732
00:46:02,461 --> 00:46:06,600
eastern motifs and themes to sort of
monitor the eyes, those motifs and themes,

733
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:10,530
and express a new conception of
God and the world and humankind.
