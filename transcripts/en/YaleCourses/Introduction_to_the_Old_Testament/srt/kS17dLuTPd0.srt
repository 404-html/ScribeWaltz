1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,150
So following the theophany
at the burning Bush,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,520
Moses returns to Egypt and he initiate
what will become ultimately a battle of

3
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:11,130
wills between Pharaoh and God.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,440
And the story in exodus has high
drama and lots of a folkloric elements

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,800
including this contest between Moses and
Aaron on the one hand and the magicians

6
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:23,310
of Egypt.
On the other hand,

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,270
and this kind of contest is a very
common literary device. It's a kind of,

8
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:29,940
you know,
our boys are better than your boys device.

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,390
The Egyptian magicians who are initially
able to mimic some of the plagues that

10
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:38,850
are brought on by God.
They are quickly bested and uh,

11
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:43,110
y'all always defeat of the magicians is
tantamount to the defeat of the gods of

12
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:47,920
Egypt. There are 10 plagues.
These include a bloody pulp,

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,110
a pollution of the Nile,
swarms of frogs, lice,

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,080
insects,
affliction of livestock,

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,300
boils that afflict humans and animals,
lightning and hail locusts,

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,590
total darkness.

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,150
And all of this climax is in the death
of the firstborn males of Egypt in one

18
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:10,510
night. And source critics looking
at this material discern, um,

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,190
numerous diverse sources that
are interwoven throughout.

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,930
And these sources preserve different
traditions on the number and the nature of

21
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:23,460
the plagues as well as the principal
actors in the drama, God, Moses, Aaron,

22
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,450
so according to the
source critical analysis,

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,660
no source contains 10 plagues and Jay
has eight and he has three and p has five

24
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,510
and some of them are the same as one
another and some of them are different and

25
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:39,510
so on. Some of them are unique
to one source, some are not,

26
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,100
but ultimately the claim is that these
have all been merged and have left us.

27
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:48,990
Then with an overall total of 10 this
may in fact be true. Nevertheless,

28
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:52,530
as much as we like to engage sometimes
in this kind of analysis about the

29
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:54,780
sources that have gone into
the composition of the text,

30
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,260
it's also always important to keep your
eye on the final form of the Texas.

31
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,260
We've received it literary analysis that
is sensitive to the larger contours of

32
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:08,310
the account will reveal the
artistic hand of the final editor.

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,610
I've charted this at the
top of the board here.

34
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,470
Some scholars have noticed
that the plagues are organized
in three sets of three

35
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,490
and there are literary links that connect
them and make it clear that these are

36
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:25,020
three sets of three followed by the
climactic 10th plague. And again,

37
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:29,100
three and 10 are ideal
numbers in our biblical texts.

38
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,630
Each set of three shares,
certain structural and literary features.

39
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,590
So in each set, the first and
second plague our four warrants.

40
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:41,640
That's what the FW is on the side, whereas
the third plague is not. So a warning,

41
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:44,640
a warning, and then a third
plague, a warning, a warning,
and then a third plague,

42
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,180
a warning, a warning, and
then a third play in each set.

43
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,680
The first plague is accompanied by a
notation of the time in the morning.

44
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,370
It's also introduced by
God's speech and God says,

45
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,010
present yourself before Pharaoh.
And to do this in the morning,

46
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:03,460
so each of the first plagues in the
sets of three is introduced this way.

47
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,420
And the second plague in each set of
three is introduced with the divine

48
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,190
instruction.
Go to Pharaoh.

49
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,870
The third plague in each set has
no forewarning and no introduction.

50
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,120
So this sort of structural repetition
creates a crescendo that leads then to the

51
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:21,250
final and most devastating plague,

52
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:24,850
which is the slaughter of
the Egyptian firstborn sons.

53
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,440
The slaughter may be understood as
measure for measure punishment for the

54
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:32,830
Egyptians earlier killing
of Hebrew infants in the um,

55
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,890
but it's represented in the biblical
text as retaliation for Egypt's treatment

56
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:42,460
of Israel. And Israel is referred to
as the first born son if you halfway.

57
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,740
So in exodus four verse 22,
now he tells Moses to say to Pharaoh,

58
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,780
thus says the Lord, Israel is my
firstborn son. I have said to you,

59
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:57,010
let my son go that he may worship me,
yet you refuse to let him go.

60
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,210
Now I will slay your firstborn son.
So it's seen as retaliation.

61
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,850
In this last plague,

62
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:09,210
God or his angel of death passes over
Egypt at midnight slaying every Egyptian

63
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:15,751
firstborn male Moses orders each
Israelite to perform a ritual action,

64
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,350
and this action will protect
them from the slaughter.

65
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,120
And the ritual consists of two parts.
Each family is told to sacrifice a lamb.

66
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,210
The lamb will then be eaten as a family
meal and it's blood will be smeared on

67
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:34,120
the doorposts, um, to mark the house.

68
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:38,080
So the angel of death knows to pass over
that house and the pen works in Hebrew

69
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:41,320
as well as an English, which
is kind of handy. In addition,

70
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:44,440
each family is to eat unleavened bread.

71
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,750
So according to exodus,

72
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,610
this Passover ritual was established on
Israel's last night of slavery while the

73
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:55,660
angel of death passed over the
dwellings that were marked with blood.

74
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,640
The story of tests to a phenomenon
that's long been observed by biblical

75
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:02,140
commentators and scholars,

76
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,470
and that is the Israelite
historic preservation of
preexisting ritual practices.

77
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,670
In other words,

78
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:14,670
what we probably have here are two
older separate springtime rituals.

79
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,030
One would be characteristic
of semi nomadic pastoralists,

80
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,350
the sacrifice of the first land born
in the spring to the deity in order to

81
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:27,250
procure a favor and
continued blessing on the,

82
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,960
the flux for the spring.

83
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,160
The other would be characteristic
of agriculturalists.

84
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:37,360
It would be an offering of the very first
barley that would be harvested in the

85
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,920
spring. It would be quickly ground into
flour and used before it even has time to

86
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:42,341
ferment,

87
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:46,270
to quickly offer something to the dd
again to procure favor for the rest of the

88
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:47,104
crop.

89
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:52,170
It's supposed by many that Israel was
formed in from the merger or the merging

90
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:58,520
of diverse groups including
farmers and in Canaan.

91
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,960
The rituals of these older
groups were then linked,

92
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,310
retained and then linked to the story
of the Enslavement and liberation of the

93
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:08,144
Hebrews.

94
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,170
So you have older nature festivals and
observances that have been historicized.

95
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,700
They're associated now with events in
the life of the new nation rather than

96
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:19,220
being grounded in the cycles of nature.

97
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,990
This may in fact be then part of the
process of differentiation from the

98
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:28,040
practices of Israel's neighbors who would
have celebrated the springtime rituals.

99
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,330
So now the blood of the sacrificial lamb
is said to have protected the Hebrews

100
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:36,830
from the angel of death and the
bread now is said to have been eaten,

101
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:41,831
consumed in unleavened form because the
Hebrews left Egypt in in such a hurry.

102
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,010
They had no time to allow the
dough to rise historic cessation.

103
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,570
And we'll see the sister organization of
rituals, um, recurring again and again.

104
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,450
Now following the last plague,

105
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:57,830
pharaoh finally allows the Israelites to
go into the desert to worship their god,

106
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,090
but he quickly changes his mind and he
sends his infantry and his chariots in

107
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:03,710
hot pursuit of the Israelites.

108
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,730
And they soon find themselves trapped
between the Egyptians and something

109
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:11,590
referred to as yum sufe
meaning read c it doesn't, uh,

110
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,430
it isn't the Red Sea.
That's a mistranslation that
occurred very, very early on.

111
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,450
So it's led to the notion that they were
at the Gulf of Aqaba or somewhere near

112
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:23,460
the actual big, big ocean water. Um,

113
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,920
and some of the Israelites despair
and they want to, um, surrender.

114
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,780
Was it for want of graves in Egypt that
you brought us to die in the wilderness?

115
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,570
What have, what have you done
to us taking us out of Egypt?

116
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,690
Is this not the very thing we told
you in Egypt saying, let us be,

117
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,840
we will serve the Egyptians
for it's better for us to
serve the Egyptians and to

118
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:46,460
die in the wilderness. But Moses rallies
them. And then in the moment of crisis,

119
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,240
God intervenes on Israel's behalf.
And once again,

120
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,510
SARS critics see in the account of the
parting of the Reed Sea in exodus 14 and

121
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:57,254
15,

122
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,100
three different versions of the events
of the event that have been interwoven.

123
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,840
I have to stress though that scholars
differ very much on where the seams and

124
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:10,070
the tech star, what parts of the
story belonged to j or e or p.

125
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:13,520
So you'll read very, very different
accounts. There's some, some consensus,

126
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:14,870
but that a lot of disagreement.

127
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,610
One thing that most people do in fact
agree on is that the oldest account of the

128
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:24,611
event is a poetic fragment that's
found in Exodus 15 verses one to 12 in

129
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:28,460
particular. Um, this is often
referred to as the song of the sea.

130
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,090
And here the image is one of thinking
and drowning in the Sea of reeds.

131
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,940
You have a wind that
blasts from God's nostrils,

132
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,480
the water's stand straight like a wall.

133
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,220
And at a second blast,

134
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:48,170
the sea then covers the Egyptians and
they sink like a stone in the majestic

135
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:49,004
waters.

136
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,960
The him doesn't anywhere refer to
people crossing over on dry land.

137
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,370
It seems to depict a storm at sea
almost as if the Egyptians are in boats.

138
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,120
And a bid when makes a giant wave and
another one that makes it crashed down on

139
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:06,240
them. So they're swamped
by these roiling waters.

140
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,690
But the name yum soup read see implies a
more marsh like setting rather than the

141
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:17,070
open sea. Uh, John Collins, who's a
professor here at the divinity school.

142
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,930
Now he points out that this image,
particularly in poetic passages,

143
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:24,860
this image of sinking in deep waters,
um,

144
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,150
it occurs often in Hebrew poetry.

145
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:30,930
It occurs particularly in the book of
Psalms and where it's a metaphor for

146
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:31,860
distress.

147
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,310
And Psalm 69 the psalmist asks God to
save him for waters have come up to my

148
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:40,870
neck, I think in deep Meyer
where there is no foothold.

149
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,420
I have come into deep waters and floods
sweeps over me. But a few verses later,

150
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:47,280
it's clear that the poet
isn't really drowning.

151
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:52,281
This is a metaphor for his difficult
situation more in number than the hairs of

152
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:56,280
my head are those who hate
me without cause. Many are
those who would destroy me,

153
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:58,260
My enemies who accused me falsely.

154
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,890
So Collins suggests that the poem in
Exodus 15 is celebrating and preserving a

155
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:09,711
historical memory of an escape from or
defeat of Pharaoh and that the drowning

156
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:15,270
image is used metaphorically as it is
elsewhere in Hebrew poetry to describe the

157
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:17,340
Egyptians humiliation and defeat.

158
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,060
Later writers take this poetic image
and fill out the illusion to drowning in

159
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:28,701
this ancient song and compose the pros
accounts in exodus 14 in which the

160
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:33,960
metaphor is literalized.
According to these pros accounts.

161
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:36,870
Now Pharaoh's army was
literally drowned in water,

162
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,060
but even in the pros
accounts. Um, in exodus 14,

163
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,310
we can see a composite of two intertwined
versions in the material that's

164
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:49,380
usually associated with p.

165
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,740
Moses is depicted as stretching out
his staff first to divide the waters,

166
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:59,580
which stand like a wall so that the
Israelites can cross over on dry land.

167
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,410
And then he holds out his staff to
bring the waters crashing down on the

168
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:07,470
Egyptians.
But according to one little section,

169
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:12,471
this is just a verses 24 and 25 in
exodus 14 some attribute this to Jay,

170
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,370
it seems that the Egyptians were
stymied by their own chariots.

171
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,030
The image we get there is that the
Israelites are sort of working their way

172
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:23,430
through the marsh on
foot and the Egyptians,

173
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,500
chariot wheels can't make
it through the marsh.

174
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:28,890
They get stuck in the mud and this
forces them to give up the chase.

175
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,080
So the final narrative that emerges
from this long process of transmission,

176
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:39,360
perhaps a core image of, of escape
on foot where chariots are bogged.

177
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,800
Um,
a poem that describes the defeat in,

178
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:46,290
in metaphorical terms using a drowning
and sinking image and then pros

179
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:51,291
elaboration on these previous traditions
that that have had very dramatic

180
00:11:51,601 --> 00:11:54,280
element of the sea being parted
and crashing down on the Egyptians.

181
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,190
A long process of
transmission interweaving.

182
00:11:57,191 --> 00:12:01,810
Literary embellishment has gone into the
creation of this account and exodus 14

183
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:04,750
and 15 but the story as it stands,

184
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:09,751
reiterate a motif that we've seen before
that of the threatened destruction of

185
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:15,601
God's creation or God's people by chaotic
waters and of divine salvation from

186
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:21,070
that threat. What's interesting
about the song of the sea,

187
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:26,071
this poetic fragment and Exodus 15 is
that here the Hebrews adopt the language

188
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:29,560
of Canaanite Myth and
apply it to your pathway.

189
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,800
If you still have that sheet that was
handed out before listing different

190
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:35,290
epithets for bowel and listing
epithets for Yaffe way,

191
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,530
it would be handy to have that or
to take a look at it later. Again,

192
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,270
because of the description of
yeah way is that of a storm. God.

193
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:48,450
In Exodus 15 he heaps up the waters with
a blast of wind like a storm at sea,

194
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,450
and this is reminiscent of
the Canaanites Storm. God Bow,

195
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,600
as you see on your handout by
Allah said to ride on the clouds.

196
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:59,740
He's a storm God and he's accompanied
by wind and rain at the beginning of the

197
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:00,521
rainy season.

198
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:05,521
But I'll opens a slit or makes a slit
in the clouds and funders and shakes the

199
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:10,000
earth. In one important legend that
we have from the Canaanite texts,

200
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,080
Ugaritic texts,

201
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:16,260
he defeats an adversary who's
known as prince see or judge river.

202
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,080
And after he vanquishes this watery foe,

203
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,500
he is a claimed the king of
the gods and the king of men.

204
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,430
And he is housed in a home,
not a tent as El was,

205
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:31,750
l was housed in a tent, but now this
bile is housed in a permanent structure,

206
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:36,520
a home that is on top of a mountain
and has built a cedar. Now,

207
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:38,320
ancient Hebrew descriptions of,
yeah,

208
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:43,270
white employed Barry's similar language
in the poetic passage here in Exodus 15

209
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:46,720
but also in other poetic passages.
So for example,

210
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,840
Psalm Psalm 68 verse five
extol him who rides the clouds.

211
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,650
The Lord is his name. Yeah, he is his
name. So extol him who rides the clouds.

212
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,900
Y'All way is his name as if
to say not val. So yeah, wait,

213
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:02,320
is described like bow
as riding on the clouds.

214
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:04,990
Psalm 29 also employs
the language of a storm.

215
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:07,690
Got The voice of the
Lord is over the waters.

216
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:10,720
The God of Glory thunders the
Lord over the mighty waters.

217
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,230
Some scholars think this actually was
originally a psalm about bow that was

218
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:16,930
simply adopted and referred to Yak way.

219
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:22,470
Images of God engaged in a battle with
some kind of watery fo also appear in the

220
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,390
psalms.
Psalm 74 Oh God,

221
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:28,750
my king from of old who brings
deliverance throughout the land.

222
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,080
It was you who drove back the sea with
your mind who smashed the heads of the

223
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:33,820
monsters in the waters and so on.

224
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:39,050
Judges five is also another ancient song
fragment verses four to five that uses

225
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,760
the same kind of imagery
imagery. Now, Michael Colgan,

226
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:47,030
who's a very important biblical scholar,
um, and an expert in the Canaanite texts,

227
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,130
yoga Riddick materials,

228
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,940
he's made some intriguing observations
in connection with the biblical

229
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:57,470
representation of your way in terms
that are so reminiscent of the storm God

230
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,483
bow.

231
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,830
He notes that bow was the
key figure in a change,

232
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:09,190
a change in the religion of Canaan that
happens somewhere between 1500 and 1200

233
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:10,730
BCE.

234
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,110
And that is also the traditional time for
what we think of as the exodus and the

235
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:18,520
introduction of Ya'll wisdom
or the differentiation of yeah.

236
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:20,330
Wisdom at this time.

237
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:25,040
Somewhere in this period
there was a transfer of power
in the Canaanite Pantheon

238
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,360
so that um, the, from a transfer power
from the older gods to the younger gods,

239
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:33,620
the older got l the sky,
God was replaced by the younger storm,

240
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:38,510
God by aisle, and he was replaced
by virtue of his defeat of France.

241
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:42,500
See, or whoever this watery
pho is. So l is replaced by,

242
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:47,501
by aisle after a defeat of some watery
fo Kogan notes that at about the same

243
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:49,394
time,

244
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,140
there seems to have been a similar change
in many of the world's traditions or

245
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:57,290
as many of the traditions of the region.
If a younger storm,

246
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:02,291
God who usurps power from an older God
by virtue of a victory over a water God.

247
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,370
Remember Enuma Elish, which we read
at the very beginning of the semester,

248
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,960
you have the young storm
God Marduk who defeats Tmr,

249
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,591
the watery,

250
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:17,591
ferocious deep monster and does
so by blasting a wind into her.

251
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:23,010
And so establishes his claim to rule
instead of the Old Sky God honor,

252
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,610
honor in India,
the storm God,

253
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Indra about this time assumes the place
of a previous God dials and in Greece,

254
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,790
Zeus who is associated with a storm,

255
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:38,210
right thunder lightening bolts
you think of in the hands of Zeus,

256
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,230
he replaces Kronos who had
been the head of the Pantheon.

257
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,820
And so here in exodus we find that just
as the nation of Israel is coming into

258
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:51,410
existence, just as the Israelites
are making the transition from, um,

259
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,170
a nomadic existence to a
more settled way of life,

260
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,600
ultimately in their own land,

261
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:01,430
there seems to be a collective memory
of a similar change in her religion,

262
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:06,400
like the storm. God's in the myths
of Israel's neighbors, Yahweh,

263
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,820
heaps up the waters with a blast of wind.
He wins a stunning victory.

264
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,880
He establishes himself as the god of
the Israelites in place of l who was

265
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:21,100
worshiped by Israel's
Patriarchs, remember, and like
the Canaanite God by Isle.

266
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,110
Yeah. Way as we will see, as
we continue to read the text,

267
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,670
he will eventually want a house for
himself, a top of a Mountain Mount Zion,

268
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,920
and it will be lined with Cedar.

269
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,420
There are of course,
important ways in which Israel,

270
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:41,120
his use of the storm God motif diverges
from that of other ancient near eastern

271
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:41,954
stories.

272
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,230
The most important is that yaquis battle
is a historic battle rather than a

273
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:50,660
mythic battle,
right?

274
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:56,370
The Sea is not y'all always opponent,
right, nor is he always enemy.

275
00:17:56,371 --> 00:18:00,960
Another God, Yahweh. He is doing
battle here with a human fo,

276
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:06,000
the Egyptian Pharaoh and his army.
The sea is a weapon deployed. It's a,

277
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:10,050
it's a weapon in the divine arsenal
and it's deployed on behalf of Israel.

278
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,600
But again,
yeah.

279
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:16,290
Whitey is depicted by the biblical
writer as transcending nature,

280
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:20,130
using forces of nature
for a historical purpose,

281
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,780
acting in history to deliver his
people and create a new nation, Israel.

282
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,090
So just as in genesis one,

283
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:32,190
the universe is created when the wind
of God parts the prime evil waters.

284
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:37,380
So in exodus 14 and 15 a new nation is
created when the wind of God parts the

285
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:39,210
waters of the Reed Sea.

286
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:44,100
But to describe what was understood to
be a historic event, a onetime event,

287
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:46,590
not a recurring mythical event,
but a historic event.

288
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:52,010
The ancient Israelites employed language
and images drawn naturally from the

289
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:54,870
traditions and myths of their
broader cultural context.

290
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:59,220
Or I should say that word, the cultural
context in which they themselves existed,

291
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:04,380
while at the same time differentiating
themselves to some degree. Now,

292
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:06,120
as has long been noted,

293
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:11,190
the Exodus Event became the paradigm
of God's salvation of his people.

294
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,660
And when I say salvation,

295
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:17,220
I don't mean that in the later Christian
sense of personal salvation from sin.

296
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,900
That's a notion that's anachronistically
read back into the by built into the

297
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:22,650
Hebrew Bible.

298
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:27,650
It's not their salvation in the Hebrew
Bible does not refer to an individual's

299
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:29,850
deliverance from a sinful nature.

300
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,250
This is not a concept we
find in the Hebrew Bible.

301
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,730
It refers instead to the
concrete collective communal
salvation from national

302
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:39,750
suffering and impression,

303
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,350
particularly in the form of
foreign rule or enslavement.

304
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:48,650
When biblical writers speak of Galloway
as Israel's redeemer and Savior,

305
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,340
they are referring to,
yeah,

306
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:54,780
always physical deliverance of the nation
from the hands of her foes and we're

307
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:57,750
going to see this increasingly as
we move to the prophetic material.

308
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,500
So the exodus is a paradigm for salvation,

309
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:06,530
but it would be a mistake I think to
view the exodus as the climax of the

310
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:08,250
preceding narrative.

311
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:13,110
We've gotten to this point now and we
have this big dramatic scene at the Reed

312
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,960
Sea, but the physical redemption
of the Israelites is not,

313
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:17,790
in fact the end of our story.

314
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:22,820
It's a dramatic way station in a story
that's going to reach its climax in the

315
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,380
covenant that will be concluded at Sinai.

316
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,860
And as many sensitive readers
of the Bible have noted,

317
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:34,140
the road from Egypt leads not to the other
side of the Reed Sea, but onto Sinai.

318
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,980
God's redemption of the Israelites
is a redemption for a purpose,

319
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,900
a purpose that doesn't become clear
until we get to Sinai. For at Sinai,

320
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,500
the Israelites will become God's
people bound by a covenant.

321
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,190
And so the story continues.
In the third month after the exodus,

322
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:56,050
the Israelites arrive at the wilderness
of Sinai and they in camp at the

323
00:20:56,051 --> 00:20:59,230
mountain where Moses was first
called by God, the text says,

324
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,980
the Covenant concluded at Sinai is
referred to as the Mosaic Covenant.

325
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,430
So this is now our third covenant
that we have encountered.

326
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:10,970
We will have one more coming.
Um,

327
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:15,610
and the mosaic covenant differs radically
from the Noaa hide and the Abrahamic

328
00:21:15,611 --> 00:21:19,090
or patriarchal covenants that
we've already seen. Because here,

329
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,480
God makes no promises beyond being
the patron or protector of Israel.

330
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,070
And also in this covenant,

331
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:31,900
he sets terms that require obedience
to a variety of laws and commandments.

332
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,160
So the Mosaic Covenant
is neither unilateral.

333
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,480
This is now a bilateral covenant
mutual reciprocal obligations,

334
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,960
nor is it unconditional like the
other two. It is conditional,

335
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:47,920
so this is our first bilateral
conditional covenant.

336
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:54,220
If Israel doesn't fulfill her
obligations by obeying God's Torah,

337
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:55,240
his instructions,

338
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,120
and living in accordance with his
will as expressed in the laws and

339
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,000
instructions,

340
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,620
then God will not fulfill his obligation
of protection and blessing towards

341
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:07,540
Israel.
Now,

342
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:12,541
the biblical scholar Jon Levenson here
maintains that historical critical

343
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:19,771
scholarship has been unkind to biblical
Israel because of a pervasive bias

344
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,700
between the two main focus of
the religion of ancient Israel.

345
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,910
Those are the Torah or the law is it's,
it's an understood as the law,

346
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,010
not a great translation.
I prefer instruction,

347
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:38,050
but Tara taken to me in the law on
the one hand and temple on the other.

348
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,530
He says that on the one hand,

349
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:46,560
negative stereotypes rooted in Paul's
condemnation of mosaic law as a deadening

350
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,690
curse from which belief in
Jesus offers liberation.

351
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,830
That account colors, scholarly
accounts of the giving of the Torah.

352
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,690
On the other hand,

353
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,430
a Protestant distaste for priest
centered cultic ritual colors,

354
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:08,450
scholarly accounts of the temple and its
meaning for ancient Israelites so that

355
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:12,190
these biases are so much
embedded in our culture.

356
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:16,240
He says they permeate the work of
even secular scholars of the Bible,

357
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:21,870
so that a negative view of the law affects
interpretation of the book of Exodus.

358
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:28,590
Scholars tend to place great emphasis on
the deliverance from Egypt as the high

359
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:33,871
point and the exodus narrative rather
than the more natural literary climax,

360
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,170
which is the conclusion of the Covenant
at Mount Sinai and the delivery of the

361
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:42,250
Torah. So Levenson in
his book, Sinai and Zion,

362
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,440
he tries to correct this prejudice,
prejudicial treatment.

363
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,730
He says he seeks to give the two central
institutions of Torah on the one hand

364
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:51,920
in temple on the other a fair hearing.

365
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:57,450
So when his book Sinai and Zion
Levinson Explores these, um,

366
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,430
the two great,

367
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:02,120
when he calls the two great mountain
traditions that express these central

368
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:04,820
concepts,
the tradition of Mount Sinai,

369
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,350
that's where Israel received the Torah
and entered into this defining covenantal

370
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:11,990
relationship with God.
And then on the other hand,

371
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:16,280
the tradition of Mount Zion Zion will
be the future site of the nation's holy

372
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:18,440
temple in Jerusalem.
Mount Zion is in Jerusalem.

373
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:22,100
It's the Temple Mount today where
the, the, the mosque now is,

374
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,680
um, today, uh,

375
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:29,681
we'll consider Levinson's analysis of
the Sinai tradition as an entree into the

376
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,930
Israelite concept of the
Torah and the Covenant Bond,

377
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,670
its meaning and its implications.

378
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,500
So 11th and stresses the importance
of the Covenant formulary.

379
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,180
There are ancient near eastern parallels
to the Sinai covenant of the Bible,

380
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:49,070
especially Hittite treaties had tight
treaties that date to 1500 to 1200 or so,

381
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:52,130
also as Syrian treaties in
about the eighth century.

382
00:24:52,131 --> 00:24:55,340
But they are in many ways continuous
continuous with what you find in the

383
00:24:55,341 --> 00:24:58,880
Hittite treaties, treaties between
a [inaudible] and a vassal.

384
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,860
You remember we talked
about two types of treaties,

385
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,400
suzerainty treaties and parody treaties,
parody treaties between equals,

386
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,420
but suzerainty treaties are between a
Suzanne who has a position obviously of

387
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:12,890
power and authority and a vassal and
he details the following six elements,

388
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:16,790
which I hope you can all see and um,
especially in the Hittite treaties,

389
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,320
not all found in every treaty,

390
00:25:18,321 --> 00:25:22,610
but they're often enough found that we
can speak of these six elements. First,

391
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:26,660
there is a preamble that's
found in everyone. This is
a rant, identifies himself.

392
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:27,801
Second of all,

393
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:31,280
there's generally an account
of the historical circumstances
that are leading to

394
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,740
the treaty,
so some kind of historical prologue.

395
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:39,370
Then we usually have some sort of set of
stipulations and requirements upon the

396
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:42,290
vassal.
Generally a force.

397
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,320
There's generally some arrangement either
for the publication of the treaty or

398
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:51,350
its deposition.
It's safekeeping and some sort of shrine.

399
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,790
There is generally a concluding
invocation of witnesses.

400
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:59,270
Usually the gods are invoked
as witnesses to a binding oath,

401
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:03,290
some kind of covenantal oath
that brings the cup, the,

402
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:07,910
the treaty into effect and it's
witnessed by God's. Lastly,

403
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:12,290
there will be very often a
list of blessings for the
party who obeys and curses

404
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,870
for the party that violates the pact.

405
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,930
And the curses are particularly
emphasized in the Assyrian treaties.

406
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:18,920
They are really fun reading.

407
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,870
So Levinson then identifies
these elements, uh,

408
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,790
many of these elements in the ways very
first speech to Moses and Moses and the

409
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:33,791
Israelites arrive at Sinai in Exodus
19 and God says the following,

410
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,160
a in x in verses three,
three B two eight,

411
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,270
the Lord called to him
from the mountain saying,

412
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,640
thus shall you say to the House of
Jacob and declare it to the children of

413
00:26:44,641 --> 00:26:49,320
Israel, you have, sorry. You have
seen what I did to the Egyptians,

414
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:53,910
how I bore you on Eagle's
wings and brought you to me
now then if you will obey

415
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:55,830
me faithfully and keep my covenant,

416
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,790
you shall be my treasured possession among
all the peoples and did all the earth

417
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:04,020
is mine, but you shall be to me a
kingdom of priests and a holy nation.

418
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,260
These are the words that you shall
speak to the children of Israel.

419
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,070
Moses came and some of the elders of the
people and put before them all that the

420
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:14,640
Lord had commanded him and all the people
answered this one saying all that the

421
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:15,990
Lord has spoken,
we will do.

422
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,190
And Moses brought back the people's
words to the Lord. So 11 son who,

423
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,150
who draws actually on long standing work
by other scholars and earlier in the

424
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:25,590
19th century even,
um,

425
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:30,720
Levinson find several of the main elements
of the Hittite suzerainty treaties in

426
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:35,640
this speech. So verse four, you've
seen what I did to the Egyptians.

427
00:27:35,641 --> 00:27:40,290
How I bore you on Eagle's Eagle's wings
is the historical prologue, right?

428
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,320
That's the reason that we're in the
situation we're in now and making this

429
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:46,830
covenant.
Verse five contains Gods stipulations.

430
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,530
It's a very general
conditional if you obey,

431
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:52,320
my law is basically keep my
covenant obeyed me faithfully.

432
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:56,490
That's the conditional that's going to
be filled out and articulated at great

433
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:59,430
length in the file in the following
chapters in the subsequent chapters.

434
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:01,260
But all of the laws they
have to obey or spelled out.

435
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,680
The second half of verse five
and six gives the reward.

436
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,800
God is conferring on the Israelites.
This elevated status of,

437
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:11,670
of royalty of priesthood. You'll be to be
a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.

438
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,081
And in verse eight,

439
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:16,350
the people solomnly undertake to
fulfill the terms of the covenant.

440
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:18,630
So we have at least three of the steps,
um,

441
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,030
that we find in the
Hittite treaty as well.

442
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:26,460
If we take a broader view of the full
biblical account of Israel's covenant with

443
00:28:26,461 --> 00:28:30,240
God, all six elements can be
identified in the biblical narrative.

444
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,190
They're scattered throughout the text.
However,

445
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:37,140
we have the preamble and the historical
background to the covenant in Gods'

446
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:37,681
summary.

447
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:41,790
Introduction to the people in Exodus 20
I am Yahweh who brought you out of the

448
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:43,560
land of Egypt,
sums it all up.

449
00:28:43,561 --> 00:28:48,090
Introduction who I am and why we are
historically connected. So this fact,

450
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,800
God's bringing Israel out of Egypt,

451
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,680
presumably establishes
God's claim to sovereignty.

452
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,880
The terms of the treaty are
then stipulated at great
length in the instructions

453
00:28:56,881 --> 00:29:01,881
that are found in Exodus Chapter 23
Chapter 23 Moses reads the book of the

454
00:29:02,671 --> 00:29:05,280
Covenant. It's called the scroll
of the Covenant. Publicly.

455
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:09,120
This is said in exodus 24
verse seven and Deuteronomy,

456
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:12,690
we read that it will be deposited
for safe keeping and a special arc.

457
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,390
The Israelites vow that they will obey.

458
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,480
Exodus 24 verse three also seven be
a covenant is then sealed by a formal

459
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:24,810
ritual. In this case it's a
sacrifice in exodus 24 verse eight.

460
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,970
In a monotheistic system,

461
00:29:26,971 --> 00:29:30,120
you can't really call upon other
gods to be witnesses to the,

462
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:32,180
to the ceiling of the oath.
Um,

463
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:35,610
so we have heaven in earth
being invoked as witnesses.

464
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:37,590
Deuteronomy four verse 26.

465
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:42,550
Deuteronomy 30 verse 1931 verse 28,
Heaven and earth.

466
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:46,690
The idea of being perhaps the
inhabitants thereof should witness as for

467
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:48,010
blessings and curses.

468
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:53,190
We have a long list of each found in
Leviticus 26 and Deuteronomy 28 also

469
00:29:53,471 --> 00:29:55,840
interesting reading and
some of these curses,

470
00:29:55,841 --> 00:30:00,400
particularly the ones in Deuteronomy bear
a very striking resemblance to curses

471
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,391
in um,

472
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:06,190
an a theory and treaty that we have that
was found dates to about six 77 BCE.

473
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:07,690
The Assyrian King asked or hadn't.

474
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,840
And many of the courses are
really almost word for word.

475
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:16,230
So while no one passage contains all of
the elements of the Hittite treaty form,

476
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,500
um, there are enough of them scattered
around to suggest it as a model as well as

477
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:23,440
its later instantiation
in is in a Syrian culture.

478
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,020
So what's the meaning of this?

479
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,960
Why does it matter that Israel
understands its relationship with God and,

480
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:35,270
and uses the covenant as a vehicle for
expressing its relationship with God? Um,

481
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:40,180
the vehicle of the Suzerainty Treaty
Treaty Levinson according to 11 sin,

482
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:45,270
the use of a suzerainty treaty as the
model for Israel's relationship to

483
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:50,020
Callaway expresses several key ideas
that captures several key ideas.

484
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,363
First,

485
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:56,670
the historical prologue that's so central
to the scissor anti-treaty grounds the

486
00:30:57,221 --> 00:31:02,221
obligations of Israel to halfway in
the history of his acts on her behalf.

487
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,920
And so it was granted
in historical moment.

488
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,130
We'll come back to this and what that
might mean about her perception of God.

489
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:15,280
Second, the historical prologue
bridges the gap between generations,

490
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,820
Israel's past and present and future
generations form a collective entity

491
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:22,450
Israel.

492
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:27,450
That collectively a sense to the covenant
and even today at Passover ceremonies

493
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:29,134
everywhere,

494
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:34,140
Jews are reminded to see
themselves reminded of the
obligation to see themselves

495
00:31:34,781 --> 00:31:39,370
as if they personally came out of Egypt
and personally covenanted with God.

496
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:45,570
The historical prologue thirdly explains
why Israel accepts her place in the

497
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,790
Susan Vassal relationship.

498
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:54,570
Israel's acceptance of a relationship
with God doesn't stem from a mystical

499
00:31:55,061 --> 00:31:58,360
introspection or
philosophical speculation.

500
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,370
Levenson says instead,

501
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:03,880
the Israelites are affirming
their identity and their
relationship with God by

502
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:04,810
telling a story,

503
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,240
a story whose moral can only
be that God is reliable.

504
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,110
Israel can rely on God just as
a vassal can rely on his Susan.

505
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:20,130
The goal is not Levenson says ultimately
the affirmation of God's suzerainty in

506
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:25,400
a purely verbal sense then right.
The point is not mere verbal.

507
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:29,440
A claim of God as Susan
Levinson points out,

508
00:32:29,441 --> 00:32:34,330
that the affirmation of God's suzerainty
is rendered in the form of obedience to

509
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:36,850
commandments,
not mere verbal acclamation.

510
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:42,170
Observance of God's commandments
is as Levinson puts it,

511
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:46,040
the teleological end of history.
Why is that important?

512
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:52,030
Unless we recognize that the road from
Egypt leads an extra bleach to Sinai,

513
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,380
but the story of national liberation
issues in and as subordinate to is

514
00:32:57,381 --> 00:33:02,381
ultimately subordinate to the obligation
to God's covenant stipulations and

515
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:03,920
observance of his laws.

516
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,180
Then we run the risk of doing what has
been done for some centuries now of

517
00:33:08,181 --> 00:33:08,961
reading exodus.

518
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:13,550
That's first and foremost a story of a
miraculous delivery rather than the story

519
00:33:13,551 --> 00:33:18,230
of a relationship which is expressed
through obligations to the observance of

520
00:33:18,231 --> 00:33:20,840
specific laws,
commandments and instructions.

521
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:26,330
So the Souza and vassal model has
further implications. Other scholars,

522
00:33:26,331 --> 00:33:30,020
Levinson and other scholars point many
of these out just as the ancient near

523
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:35,021
eastern suzerainty treaties specify that
vassals of a Susan are to treat other

524
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:39,010
vassals of the Susan well.
Um,

525
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:43,790
Israelites are bound to one another then
as vassals of the same Susan and are to

526
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:44,900
treat one another.
Well.

527
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:50,050
And so covenant in Israel becomes
the basis of social ethics, right?

528
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:54,500
It's the reason that God
gives instructions regarding
the treatment of one's

529
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:59,270
fellow Israelites, right? So the
Susan Vassal relationship grounds,

530
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:04,420
the social ethic within Israel also just
as a vassal cannot serve two Susan's

531
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:10,010
that's pretty explicit in all the treaties
you oh exclusive service two years

532
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:10,844
Susan.

533
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:16,090
So the covenant with God entails the
notion of Israel's exclusive service of

534
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,063
Yahweh.

535
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,720
The assertion is not that there is no
other God but that Israel will have no

536
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:24,470
other God before cafe.

537
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:31,250
The jealousy of the Susan
is the motivation for
prohibitions against certain

538
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:36,140
intimate contact with non outweigh peoples
because these alliances will end up

539
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,560
entailing recognition of
the gods of these peoples,

540
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,310
the covenant with Yahweh Way.
We'll also,

541
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:48,130
we shall see soon preclude alliances
with other human competitors.

542
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,160
If Israel serves a divine king,
she can't for example,

543
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:57,161
serve a human king and that's an idea
that will express itself in Biblical texts

544
00:34:57,411 --> 00:35:02,411
as we see that are clearly opposed to
the creation of a monarchy in Israel.

545
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:08,020
Not everyone was on board with the idea
that Israel should be ruled by king.

546
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,170
So there are texts that will object
to the creation of the monarchy,

547
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,120
King Saul and King David and so on.

548
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:19,250
They're also texts that are going to
object to alliances with any foreign king

549
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:23,020
or subservience to any foreign king,
whether it's Egypt or Syria, or Babylonia.

550
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,790
So subservience to human king,

551
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
native or foreign is in these texts
considered a rejection of the divine

552
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:32,410
kingship,
which is the ideal,

553
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,930
the exclusive kingship of Yahweh and
the scene as a breach of the covenant.

554
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:37,801
Now,

555
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:42,801
ancient near eastern suzerainty models
also speak repeatedly of the vassals love

556
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,270
for the service for the Susan,
right?

557
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,330
Vassal So-and-so will love
the Assyrian Lord. So and so.

558
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,620
And that's an element that is not absent
at all in the biblical texts that deal

559
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:56,810
with the covenant bond the Israelites
promised to serve and to love. Yeah,

560
00:35:56,811 --> 00:35:57,644
halfway.

561
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,200
That's an additional theme that's
associated regularly with the covenant.

562
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,270
It's one that will take
up in greater detail,

563
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:06,660
though when we get to the
book of Deuteronomy where
it is stressed to a greater

564
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:09,240
degree than it is in exodus.
But for now,

565
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,420
we can accept Levinson's claim that Sinai
represents an intersection of law and

566
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:17,970
love because of the use
of the suzerainty model.

567
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:24,230
So the covenant concept is critical to
the Bible's portrayal and understanding

568
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,970
of the relationship
between God and Israel.

569
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,780
The entire history of Israel as portrayed
by biblical writers is going to be

570
00:36:33,421 --> 00:36:38,000
governed by this one.
Outstanding Reality of covenant Israel.

571
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:42,900
Fortunes will be seen to ride on the
degree of it's faithfulness to this

572
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:43,734
covenant.

573
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:49,110
Exodus closes the book of exodus closes
with the construction of the sanctuary.

574
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,020
Um,
and when the sanctuary is completed,

575
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:55,290
the tech says the presence of
the Lord filled the tabernacle.

576
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:58,870
This is a sign of divine approval,
but um,

577
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,730
the long section where we have the receipt
of the instructions for the building

578
00:37:02,731 --> 00:37:05,390
of the temple and then we
have an actual account of,

579
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:09,150
of those instructions being fulfilled.
And the end, the not sample tabernacle,

580
00:37:09,151 --> 00:37:12,060
excuse me,
it's just a tent structure at this stage.

581
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:16,260
So receiving the instructions and then
the actual construction of the Tabernacle

582
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,340
that extends from exodus 25 to
the end of the book, exodus 40,

583
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,520
but it's interrupted in exodus 32 by the
account of the Israelites apostasy with

584
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,470
the golden calf. It's just a
great and very ambiguous story.

585
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:37,200
But the moment of Israel's greatest
glory is to be the moment of her greatest

586
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:38,034
shame.

587
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:42,450
As Moses Receives God's
Covenant on Mount Sinai,

588
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:47,430
he's there at the top of Sinai communing
with God the Israelites who are

589
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:51,210
encamped at the foot of the mountain,
grow, restless and rebellious.

590
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,080
And they demand of Aaron a God because
they don't know what's become of this

591
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:57,980
fellow Moses. They said, what
about this? This guy, Moses,

592
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,390
they use a very colloquial
kind of term to dismiss him.

593
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:05,750
So Aaron feeling the heat makes a golden
calf and the people down bow down to it

594
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:09,150
and someone declares, this
is your God, o Israel,

595
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:13,230
who brought you out of the land
of Egypt. Well, and enraged.

596
00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:15,840
God tells Moses,
you know what's going on down there.

597
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,950
And he tells them to descend from
the mountain. The people are sitting,

598
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,250
they've already gone astray, a
stray, and he says, I'm through.

599
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,100
I want to destroy the nation and I'm going
to start a new nation again from you.

600
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:30,990
Moses. Moses manages to play
Kate God momentarily. Um,

601
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,630
and then he turns around to face the
people. He comes down from the mountain.

602
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:36,010
He approaches the camp,
you stunned by what he sees.

603
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,850
He's carrying the tablets and all of the
instruction and he smashes them at the

604
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:44,830
foot of the mountain and fury.
He manages to halt the activities.

605
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:47,980
He punishes the perpetrators.
He has a few choice words for Erin.

606
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:53,610
This temporary alienation from God is
ultimately repaired through Moses's

607
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,100
intense prayer and intercession and it
actually takes several chapters to reach

608
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:02,560
a resolution and God
pelts for quite awhile.

609
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:07,720
But a renewal of the covenant does occur
and another set of stone tablets is

610
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:10,030
given,
given and according to one biblical texts,

611
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:14,110
the broken tablets as well as the, the
new tablets are both placed in the Ark.

612
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,540
Um,
and this is embarrassing.

613
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:21,541
Episode is just the beginning of a
sequence of embarrassing events that will

614
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:27,490
occur as the Israelites move from Egypt
towards the land that's been promised to

615
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:28,324
them.

616
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:32,140
Most of these episodes will occur in
the book of numbers and they involve the

617
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:34,000
rebellion of the people in some way.

618
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,570
Generally God's fury in
reaction to that rebellion.

619
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:43,050
Moses's intervention usually on behalf
of the people and God's appeasement.

620
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:49,720
So the book of numbers recounts the
itinerary of the Israelites throughout the

621
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:54,500
40 years of their wanderings and
encampments around the sacred Tabernacle.

622
00:39:54,501 --> 00:39:57,190
The Tabernacle always moves in
the center of the of the tribes,

623
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,300
and they're positioned in certain specific
positions around the tabernacle as

624
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:03,880
they, as they move. They
stay at Sinai for a year,

625
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:05,680
I believe in the text before they begin.

626
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:10,600
Their movement and numbers contains
some law and much narrative material.

627
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,620
The material tells of God's provision
for the people in the desert,

628
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:18,370
but it also tells the Israelites
constant complaining and rebellion.

629
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:23,050
The Israelites rebelled against Moses
and God and they long for Egypt.

630
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:27,490
There are several times when God
threatens to exterminate them,

631
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,630
but Moses manages to dissuade in
numbers 14 for example, the Israelites.

632
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,330
When the Israelites Complain Again,

633
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,710
God is determined to destroy them and
Moses intervenes and the intervention

634
00:40:38,711 --> 00:40:40,060
leads to a compromise.

635
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:44,470
God swears that none of the
adults who witnessed the exodus,

636
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:48,670
with the exception of Joshua and Caleb,
who did not join in the rebellion,

637
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,930
but none of the adults who witnessed
the exodus would see the fulfillment of

638
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,300
God's salvation and
enter the promised land.

639
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:59,890
This means the Israelites will have to
wander for 40 years in the desert until

640
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:03,010
all of those who left
Egypt as adults pass away,

641
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:07,800
leaving a new generation that
hasn't really tasted slavery, uh,

642
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,490
to enter the land and form a new nation.

643
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:15,580
The book of numbers I think is most
remarkable for the relationship that it

644
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:17,230
describes between Moses and God.

645
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:20,950
I love reading these particular stories
and just hearing the dialogue between

646
00:41:20,951 --> 00:41:25,690
them and imagining it because the two of
them alternate in losing patients with

647
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,110
the Israelites and wishing
to throw them over. Um,

648
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:32,920
but each time the one convinces the
other to be forbearing the relationship

649
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:35,300
between Moses and God
is a very intimate one.

650
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:39,410
Very much like a husband and wife are
sort of working as together as partners in

651
00:41:39,411 --> 00:41:41,730
parenting a difficult child.
Um,

652
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,350
but they're trying to prepare their
partners in the preparation of Israel for

653
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:50,210
their new life readying Israel for life
in God's land as a nation, as a people.

654
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,900
I'm going to just give you two examples
of the way Moses and God act as a check

655
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,513
upon each other.

656
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:03,070
The first excerpt is from numbers 14 and
it shows Moses his ability to placate

657
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:07,350
the wrath of God. Now in this
story, the Israelites, um,

658
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:11,720
express great fear. They've just heard
a report from a reconnaissance team, um,

659
00:42:11,721 --> 00:42:14,720
that scoped out the land and they
come back and say, oh boy, you know,

660
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:15,501
it looks really bad.

661
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:18,410
And then they think that the chances of
conquering the promised land are very,

662
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:19,244
very slim.

663
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:23,930
The whole community broken to loud
cries and the people wept that night.

664
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,540
All the Israelites railed
against Moses and Aaron.

665
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,320
If only we had died in the land of Egypt,
the whole community shouted at them.

666
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,630
Or if only we might
die in this wilderness,

667
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:36,170
why has the Lord taking us to
that land to fall by the sword?

668
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,210
Our wives and children
will be carried off.

669
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:41,840
It would be better for us to go back
to Egypt and they said to one another,

670
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,100
let's head back for Egypt.

671
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:46,760
The presence of the Lord appeared in the
tent of meeting to all the Israelites,

672
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:50,030
and the Lord said to Moses,
how long would this people spurned me?

673
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,800
How long will they have no faith in me?

674
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:54,140
Despite all the signs that
I've performed in their midst,

675
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,530
I will strike them with pestilence and
disown them and I will make of you a

676
00:42:57,531 --> 00:43:01,730
nation far more numerous than they.
But Moses said to the Lord,

677
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,480
and when the Egyptians from
WHO's midst you brought up this,

678
00:43:05,481 --> 00:43:07,910
people in your might hear the news,

679
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,370
they will tell it to the
inhabitants of that land.

680
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,890
If then you slay this people to a man,

681
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:15,500
the nations who have heard
your fame will say, oh,

682
00:43:15,501 --> 00:43:18,830
it must be because the lord was powerless
to bring the people into the land.

683
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:22,130
He had promised them on oath that he
slaughtered them in the wilderness.

684
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:25,640
Therefore, I pray, let my lords for
Barron's be a bounding and kindness,

685
00:43:25,641 --> 00:43:28,130
forgiving iniquity and transgression.
Pardon?

686
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:32,270
I pray the iniquity of this
people according to your
great kindness as you have

687
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:35,300
forgiven these people ever since Egypt.
And the Lord said,

688
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,390
I pardon as you have asked.
So nope.

689
00:43:38,391 --> 00:43:41,810
God's offer to start all over again
with Moses. This is that. This is a,

690
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,110
this is a pattern with this God,
you know,

691
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,700
create good subset of
flood wipes them out.

692
00:43:46,701 --> 00:43:49,730
Let's start again and it's still not too
good. Let's choose one person, Abraham,

693
00:43:49,731 --> 00:43:52,400
see how that goes up?
Disappointed. Let's go with Moses.

694
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,050
So this is a bit of a pattern,

695
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,420
but Moses refuses to accept the offer
and instead he defends the Israelites and

696
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:02,570
he averts their destruction.
He appeals primarily to God's vanity.

697
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,360
What will the neighbors think?
If you destroy them,

698
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,610
they'll think you couldn't
fulfill your promise.

699
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,220
They'll think you're not the
universal God of history.

700
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:14,640
But the roles are reversed
in the following passage.
And this is where, you know,

701
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,980
the text is blows hot and cold. In fact,
that's there's a rabbinic image that, um,

702
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,970
there's a rabbinic tradition that talks
about this period of time and has gotten

703
00:44:22,971 --> 00:44:27,140
most of talking. And God
says, listen, between the two
of us, whenever I blow hot,

704
00:44:27,141 --> 00:44:30,230
you blow cold. Or when you, when
I pour hot water, you pour cold.

705
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:33,120
And when you pour hot, I'll
pour cold. And you know,

706
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:35,910
together we'll muddle through and get
through here and the Israelites won't be

707
00:44:35,911 --> 00:44:39,420
wiped out. But in this next
passage, which is a numbers 11,

708
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:42,030
Moses is the one who's
impatient with the Israelites,

709
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:45,240
constant complaints and lack of faith.
And he's ready to throw in the towel.

710
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,800
I'll just read this last passage.

711
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,320
The riff Raff in their midst
felt a gluttonous craving.

712
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,280
And then the Israelites wept and
said, Oh, if only we had meat to eat.

713
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:01,050
We remembered the fish that we used to
eat free in Egypt. Okay, we were slaves,

714
00:45:01,051 --> 00:45:03,570
but the food was free. You know,
as there's love that line we use,

715
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:08,310
eat this fish free in Egypt,
the cucumbers, the melons,
the Leeks, the onions,

716
00:45:08,311 --> 00:45:11,790
and the garlic. Now our gullets are
shriveled. There's nothing at all.

717
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:14,040
Nothing but this manner to look at.

718
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:18,110
Moses heard the people weeping,
every clan apart,

719
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,630
each person at the entrance of his tent
and the Lord was very angry and Moses

720
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:26,310
was distressed and Moses said to the Lord,
why have you dealt with your servant?

721
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:30,890
Me? Why have I not enjoyed your favor
that you have laid the burden of all this

722
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,820
people on me?
Did I conceived all this people?

723
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,760
Did I bear them that you should say to me,

724
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,930
carry them in your bosom as
a nurse carries an infant
to the land that you have

725
00:45:39,931 --> 00:45:41,700
promised on oath to their fathers.

726
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,750
Where am I to get meat to give to all
this people when they wind before me and

727
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:49,110
say, give us meat to eat. I cannot
carry all this people by myself.

728
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:51,690
It's too much for me.
If you would deal thus with me,

729
00:45:51,691 --> 00:45:55,380
kill me rather I beg you and let me see.
No more of my wretchedness.

730
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:58,140
And the Lord said to Moses,
gather for me,

731
00:45:58,141 --> 00:46:02,790
70 of Israel's elders of whom you have
experienced as elders and officers of the

732
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:03,600
people,

733
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,750
and bring them to the tent of meeting
and let them take their place there with

734
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:07,400
you.

735
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,220
And I will come down and speak with you
there and I will draw upon the spirit

736
00:46:11,221 --> 00:46:15,000
that is on you and put it upon them
and they shall share the burden of the

737
00:46:15,001 --> 00:46:19,440
people with you and you shall not
bear it alone. So again, hot and cold.

738
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:23,880
And in many ways, Moses sets the
paradigm for the classical prophet.

739
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,860
He performs this double duty.

740
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,910
He chastises and upgrades the Israelites
for their rebellion and failures,

741
00:46:29,911 --> 00:46:33,360
right when he's turning and facing
the people he's, he's on their case.

742
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:37,440
But at the same time he consoles the
people when they fear they've driven God

743
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:40,710
away irreparably.
And when he turns to face God,

744
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,570
he defends the people before God.

745
00:46:42,571 --> 00:46:46,200
He pleads for mercy when they do in fact
deserve punishment and he knows they

746
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:50,490
deserve punishment. He even says as
much, but please have mercy at times.

747
00:46:50,491 --> 00:46:55,020
He expresses his frustration with the
difficulty of his task and resentment that

748
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,220
it's been assigned to him,

749
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:00,210
but we'll consider the character and
the role of Moses in much greater detail

750
00:47:00,211 --> 00:47:02,740
when we reached the book of Deuteronomy.
Uh,

751
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,850
next Monday for the coming week,

752
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,580
I would like you to please
pay particular attention.

753
00:47:08,581 --> 00:47:12,840
We're dealing with two topics that will
be, I think perhaps for some of you,

754
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,150
a little different.
New Alien.

755
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:18,750
We're going to be dealing with biblical
law on Monday and biblical ritual,

756
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:22,230
purity tech's holiness
temple on Wednesday.

757
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:25,290
These are worlds apart from many
of the things we know. So please,

758
00:47:25,291 --> 00:47:29,220
there's a lot of of textual reading
to do for Monday and Wednesday.

759
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:32,940
Please do it carefully and I might even
hand out a little bit of a study guide

760
00:47:32,941 --> 00:47:33,660
to help you with that.
