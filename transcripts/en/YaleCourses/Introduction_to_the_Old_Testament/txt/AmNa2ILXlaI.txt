Speaker 1:          00:00          We were talking last time about the establishment of the monarchy or kingship, um, in Israel. And I want to say a little bit about some of the features of Israelite kingship. And today I'll be coming back frequently to the Israelite notions of kingship and, and royal ideology. But to start off, uh, one of the most important things to realize is that the king in Israel was not divine, uh, as he was in Egypt or even semi divine. Occasionally he offered sacrifice, but he didn't play a regular role in the cult. Israelite Royal Ideology was heavily indebted to Canaanite Royal Ideology. You have similar language that's applied to the kings of Israel. The king is said to be appointed by the, by the deity or deities to end wickedness to enlighten the land. He's the channel of press, prosperity and divine blessing for the nation. All of this is true of Canaanite kings as well.

Speaker 1:          00:52          And the king, as we've seen is spoken of as God's son. That doesn't imply divinity. It's a metaphor. The metaphor of son ship. It was used for the Canaanite gods as well. And it expressed the special relationship between the king and the deity. It was the same relationship as was found between that of as Susan and a vassal Lennar suzerainty treaties. Also the vessel is the son of, of the Susan. It's a kind of adoption and what it means is that the, the one who is metaphorically the sun is to serve, uh, the father loyally faithfully, but is also susceptible to chastisement from him. And that's what we saw in Nathan's statement or pronouncement of prophecy to David last time. Michael Coogan points out that the notion of the sun ship of the king was revolutionary. It was a deliberate effort to replace an earlier understanding according to which the entire nation of Israel was God's son.

Speaker 1:          01:50          You'll be remembered during the plagues in Egypt and God refers to Pharaoh as having a pressed his son Israel, his first born as, yeah, for his son. The king now is standing between God and the people as a whole. And we're going to be turned to a moment in a moment to this new royal ideology and, and what's really going to be a very tense juxtaposition with the Covenant Theology. But first I want to say a little bit more about the characters of David and Solomon before going into the way royal ideology was, was later developed in the Bible. David is second only in importance and in textual space to Moses write, the amount of space is devoted to him. Um, it's second only to Moses. There are three characteristics of David, which stand out. And the first is that he's described as being quite proficient in music and poetry.

Speaker 1:          02:40          And so we'll see that later. Tradition is going to attribute to him, uh, not only the invention of various instruments, but also the composition of the book of Psalms. It seems to make sense that he would be the composer of the Book of Psalms if he has a reputation for, for poetry and music. He's also credited with great military and tactical skill and confidence. He deploys his army on behalf of Israel, but he also once he is king, deploys a his army within Israel against his rivals. Third, he's depicted as a very shrewd politician and it was David who created permanent symbols of God's election of Israel. God's election of David himself, God's election of David's house or line or dynasty to rule over Israel in perpetuity. It has said that he conceived the idea of a royal capital. He captured the city of Jay Boosie gay boosts. It was a border town, so it's free of any tribal association, right?

Speaker 1:          03:35          It's sort of like a Washington DC. It's not located really within any one tribe and he captured this and built it up as the city of David. The city was going to be renamed Jerusalem and it would become understood as the chosen city, the place where God caused his name to dwell. As Deuteronomy said, there would be a place where God would choose to cause his name to dwell, and so Jerusalem becomes a symbol of God's presence. It becomes a symbol of Israel's kingdom, a monarchy. It becomes a symbol of the dynasty of David. It is referred to as the city of David. David transfers the arc to this city. And so he makes it the home to the ancient witness of the Covenant, the Sinai Covenant. The added implication is that the Davidic dynasty has inherited the blessings of the covenant is Somehow Fulfilling The promise to the Patriarchs, which, which is also associated with the nation of Israel.

Speaker 1:          04:28          At Sinai, he planned a temple that would become the permanent resting place for the arc and a cultic center for all Israel. But the building of this temple was left to Solomon. So we'll discuss it and it's symbolism when we get to Solomon. But according to the biblical record, it was still David who made the Choson Dynasty, the chosen city, what would eventually be the temple into permanent and deeply interconnected symbols of the religion of Israel. And it's really with David that the history of Jerusalem as the holy city, uh, begins. Now. The Biblical assessment of David is initially a relatively positive and this changes, uh, shortly after his ascension to the throne, beginning in Second Samuel from about chapter nine through 20. And then on into the first couple of chapters of kings, you have a stretch of texts, which is often referred to as the court history or the succession narrative of David.

Speaker 1:          05:24          The critical question that drives this particular historical fiction is the question of fixed session. Who will succeed? David, he has many children, but one by one his sons are um, killed or this they're displaced or disqualified in one way or another. Until finally there is Solomon. There are lots of wonderful, major and minor characters in this drama. It's a very complex drama, lots of intrigue and passion. But the passages of the material in this section also presents a rather unusual portrait of David. He's weak, he's indecisive, he's something of an Antihero. He stays home and the palace, while other people are off leading battles and, and then fighting the wars. He enters into a knee, illicit relationship with a married woman, but Shev or Bathsheba, uh, he sees to it that her husband is killed in battle to cover up his affair. Um, it's this combined act of adultery and murder that earns him, um, of sounds scolding from Nathan the Prophet Nathan.

Speaker 1:          06:27          We'll, we'll come to that when we talk about profits next week. But God punishes him, uh, with the death of his son. And it's really from this point on in the story that we see David, I'm losing control over events around him. His control declines. Um, he is, he's indecisive on the whole question of succession and that leads to all kinds of resentment and conflict as well as result revolts. There's one revolt which is a revolt in support of his son Absalom. That's a revolt that the Deuteronomistic historian also indicates was a punishment for his affair with date for David's affair with Bathsheba. But during this revolt, uh, David flees from his enemies. He stripped of his crown, he's degraded, um, when Absalom is killed, David weeps for his son uncontrollably. And this only angers his own supporters who, who fought so earnestly against Absalom and his defense.

Speaker 1:          07:25          It's very pointed moment, but by the end of the story, David is, um, almost completely impotent and, and senile even the Prophet Nathan. And Best Sheba plot to have, um, Bashiva's son Solomon a named the successor of David. And there really is no point at which there's any divine indication that Solomon has has one divine approval, no divine indication that he is the one it happens through palace intrigue, particularly with Bathsheba and Nathan, but the northern tribes. Um, there are signs throughout the story of the hostility of the northern tribes. And that's a warning sign. That's a warning sign of future disunity. This whole court history is just a wonderful, masterful work of prose. You're going to be reading, um, uh, something from a book by a Fella named Mayor Sternberg, which is I think just a wonderful study of the bus Shiva story. Um, some speak about all of this unit as being authored by the net, by, by the j source.

Speaker 1:          08:24          Um, you need to know that source theory has undergone so many permutations. There really isn't any standard view, but I think the idea that the sources jep and d extend beyond the pentitude cause now generally not no longer accepted. So you will sometimes see people talking about the j source is going all the way through the end of second kings and being, in fact the J is the author of the, of the court history. But for the most part I think most people think of the source theory is applying to the Pentateuch. And beyond that we talk about the Deuteronomistic historian redacting older earlier sources. We'll talk a little bit more about some of those sources as we move through the later books. The books of the form of profits, the whore, the court history has an array of very richly drawn characters. Um, they act out all sorts of scenes of, of um, power and lust and, and courage and struggle.

Speaker 1:          09:16          There's, there's crime, there's tender love. It's a very realistic sort of, of psychological drama. Um, it's also striking for its uncompromising honesty. We don't see anything like that really in the work of any contemporary historian. David is depicted in very, very human terms. The flattery and the white washing that you find in other ancient near Eastern, um, dynastic histories is lacking here. The flattery and white washing that we get. For example, in in chronicles, I write the books of chronicles are really just a retelling of the material here in the form of profits. And they clean up the picture of David that you know, there's no mention of Bathsheba in there. So you do have that kind of whitewashing as part of the historiography of the book of chronicles. But it's lacking here. All of the flaws, all of the weaknesses of David a national hero, they're all laid bare implicitly.

Speaker 1:          10:09          Perhaps that is a critique of kingship. It's perhaps a critique of the claim of kings to rule by divine right. The author here seems to be stressing that David, and as we shall see, Solomon, um, he's quite human, Solomon's quite human. They're not at all divine. They're subject to the errors and flaws that characterize all humans. As we move out of Samuel now and into first and second kings, we see that these books, kings contained the history of Israel from the death of King David until the fall of Judah in five 80 75 86 and the exile to Babylonia. These books also appeared to be based on older sources. Some of them are explicitly identify, they will refer sometimes to these works, which evidently were subsequently lost, but they'll say they'll refer to the book of the acts of Solomon or the book of the annals of the kings of Israel or the book of the annals of the kings of Judah.

Speaker 1:          11:03          Animals and chronicles were regularly maintained in royal courts throughout the ancient Near East. There's no reason to think that this wasn't also done in a royal setting in Israel. These animals generally listed events, important events in the reign of a given king. They tended not to have much narrative to them. And the beginning of the first 16 chapters of first kings has that kind of feel, not a lot of narrative and really reportage of events. Beginning in first king 1717 through 22, the first nine chapters of seven kings, there's a departure from that analyst analytic, not an analytic ana Anil style animals genre, um, the reporting of events, uh, in the reign of a king. And you have more developed narratives in those sources. And these narratives generally feature profits. So it's going to lead very nicely into our study of profits beginning on Monday. Some of the narratives evidently would have circulated independently.

Speaker 1:          11:58          Um, particularly the stories probably about Elijah and Elisha. These zealous Yahweh only profits. They were probably local heroes and these stories circulate it independently, but they've come to be embedded in a framework that conforms those sources to um, the ideology and religious perspective of the Deuteronomistic historian. Uh, first kings chapter two is, is the death scene. Um, it has, um, David's death bed instructions to his son Solomon and he tells Solomon to kill all of his rivals and opponents. And in verse 12, we read and Solomon sat upon the throne of his father David. And his rule was firmly established and it seems that at this point, the three crises that we noted in the book of Samuel at the opening of first Samuel, the three crises we noted are resolved. The crisis in succession is, is resolved. David is succeeded by his son, Solomon and all of the kings of Judah for the next 400 years.

Speaker 1:          12:55          In fact, until the destruction in five 86, um, all of these kings will be of the Line of David. The military crises seem for now to have been resolved. We've had lots of military and diplomatic successes and Israel seems to be secure. And also the religious crisis that we mentioned is resolved. The Ark was taken from the Philistines. It's been brought to Jerusalem, it's been installed in Jerusalem, and now a magnificent temple is planned, um, that will, how's the arc and be a site for the central worship of all Israel. But the resolution of these crises came at a cost and they produced fundamental changes in Israelite Society from a loose confederation of tribes. However idealistic that picture was. But from a loose confederation of tribes are United by a covenant. We've now got a nation with a strong central administration. It's headed by a king. And that king seems to enjoy a special covenant with God rather than charismatic leaders who rise as the need, um, itself arises and then fade away.

Speaker 1:          14:00          We now have permanent kings from a single family and preserved in the biblical sources is attention, attention between the old ideas of the Covenant Confederation, What We Might Call Covenant Theology, and the new ideology of the monarchy. This new royal ideology combines loyalty to God and loyalty to the throne so that treason or rebellion against God's anointed is also apostasy. It's also rebellion against God himself, the to become conflated. A as a scholar named Jon Levenson, I've talked about him before and connection with the Covenant at Sinai, but in this wonderful book called Sinai in Zion, he really juxtaposes these two ideologies and he points to this deep tension between the Covenant Theology and the Royal Ideology in Covenant Theology. Yahweh, he alone is the king. He's got a direct suzerain vassal relationship with the people. So Israel is the subject of Covenant Theology. Um, the Covenant Theology therefore implies, implies almost automatically as somewhat negative view of the monarchy.

Speaker 1:          15:08          And that's what we've seen here and there in a, in the book of judges and in Samuel monarchy is at best, unnecessary, and at worst it's a rejection of God. Nevertheless, despite that resistance or that critique monarchy, kingship is established in Israel, and 11 cents sees the royal ideology that developed to support this institution as a major revolution in the structure of the religion of Israel, where the Synetic covenant was contracted between God and the nation. The davidic covenant is contracted between God and a single individual. The king, the Covenant with David. Um, another scholar, Moshe Weinfeld, who I've mentioned before as well. Um, he describes the Covenant With David as a covenant of grant. This is a form that we find in the ancient near eastern, in the ancient near east. Also, it's a, it's a grant of a reward for loyal service and deeds. And so God rewards David with the gift of an unending dynasty.

Speaker 1:          16:07          It's a covenant of grantee grants him this unending dynasty in exchange for his loyalty. And the contrast with the Covenant at Sinai is very clear where Israel's covenant with God at Sinai had been conditional. It's premised on the observance of God's Torah. If there's violation, then God will uproot the Israelites and throw them out of the land. All right. The covenant with David. By contrast with his dynastic house and by implication with David City and and, and the Temple of Top Mountain Zion, that covenant will be maintained under all conditions. Remember the passage that we read, if Nathan's prophecy last time? So the royal ideology fostered a belief in some quarters, and we'll see this in the next few weeks, a belief in the inviolability, the impregnable nature of David's house dynasty, the city itself, the chosen city, the sacred mountain, the temple. We'll return to this idea in later lectures. So you have this deep tension lining up Israel's covenant at Mount Sinai, which is conditional on the one hand with God's covenant with David, which is centered on the temple and Palace Complex at Mount Zion and which is unconditional and permanent.

Speaker 1:          17:20          Scholars have tried to account for these two strands of tradition in biblical literature in different ways. The Covenant Theology with its emphasis on the conditional covenant with Moses, I'm contracted at Sinai, the royal ideology and its emphasis on the unconditional covenant with David focused on Mount Sinai on one explanation is chronological. That early traditions were centered around the Sinai Event and the Covenant Theology. They emphasize that aspect of the relationship with God. And later traditions under the monarchy emphasize royal ideology. Another explanation is geographical. The northern kingdom, which if you'll recall, and we'll talk about in a moment, the northern kingdom is going to break away from the southern kingdom. David [inaudible] will not rule in the northern kingdom. So the assumption is that the northern kingdom, which rejected the house of David, they de emphasize, um, royal ideology that end, it's focused on Zion and the house of David.

Speaker 1:          18:15          And they emphasize cut the Old Covenant Theology and the Sinai Theology by contrast, the southern kingdom, uh, in which a member of the House of David, uh, you know, range, right? Until the destruction. The Southern Kingdom emphasized Zion and its attendant royal ideology. Well, Levenson rejects both of these explanations. He says the difference isn't that one is early in, one is late. It isn't that one is northern and one is southern. We find, um, the Sinai and the Xi'an Traditions in early texts and late texts. We find them in northern tech sentence. Southern texts in the south. David's house was criticized just as roundly. It was as it was criticized in the north and emphasis was placed on the Sinai Covenant over against the Royal Ideology in the south as well as in the north. So the two traditions he said coexisted side by side. They stood in a dialectic tension with one another in Israel and eventually they would come to be coordinated and work together.

Speaker 1:          19:07          We'll see that more towards the end of the lecture, but he says the Xeon ideology will take on some of the aspects of the legacy of Sinai. Mount Zion will soon be associated with the site of God's [inaudible] or self revelation. It will become a kind of Sinai now permanently in Jerusalem. It would become the site of Covenant Renewal. It will be seen as the place where Torah goes forth. And that's an idea of course, originally associated with Sinai. That's where it God's instruction or Torah went first. But all of these features will be collapsed or telescoped are brought into a Mount Zion and the temple complex. But eventually he says it's not simply that the Sinai Covenant Theology was absorbed into Royal Ideology and Mount Zion because the entitlement of the house of David will eventually be made contingent on the observant on the observance of God's Torah. The king himself we will see is not exempt from the Covenant Conditions Set at Sinai and even though he would never be completely deposed for violating the Synetic covenant, he will be punished for his violations.

Speaker 1:          20:14          The two will work in tandem. It's an idea that will return to, we'll see it more clearly as we get towards the end of this lecture, but for now, keep in mind that the two are going to be held intention and work together to check one another. Now, David's son Solomon is given mixed reviews by the Deuteronomistic historian. He ascends to the throne through entry cause I said there's really no indication of a divine choice or approval, but he said to reign over a golden age. His kingdom is said to stretch from Egypt to the Euphrates. He made political alliances and economical economic alliances throughout the region. He would seal these alliances with marriages. He married the daughter of Pharaoh. He married the daughter of the king of tire and Phoenicia and so on. The text claims that he built a daunting military establishment. He put a wall around Jerusalem.

Speaker 1:          21:00          They were fortified cities. Um, Hud sore, McGee doe guesser. These were basis for his professional army. It's said that the army featured a very expensive chariot force. Um, he also had accomplishments in the realms of industry and trade. He exploited Israel's natural position, straddling the north south, uh, trade routes and, uh, was able to bring great wealth to the state in that way. The daily supplies that were needed to maintain Solomon's very lavish court are detailed in first kings. So it seems to have been an extraordinarily elaborate court. He developed a merchant fleet. He seemed to work closely with the Phoenicians and the Phoenician King Hiram and developing a merchant fleet and exploited trade routes through the Red Sea. All sorts of exotic products are listed as coming in to Jerusalem from Arabia and the African coast. We have the famous story of the visit of the Queen of Sheba.

Speaker 1:          21:56          This could possibly be a subbie and territory and South Arabia and there may be some basis, in fact, given these trade routes and how well traveled they were at this time. And of course he's known for his magnificent building operations. Um, many scholars assume that given this tremendous wealth, um, this would have been a time for the flowering, a flowering of the arts. And so it's often been maintained that this would have been the time for the early traditions, biblical traditions, early traditions of the nation to be recorded. Perhaps the J source people date it to the 10th century, the time of Solomon. But we should be a little skeptical of this grand picture because archeologists have found that Jerusalem was a small town. It was a very small town, really until the end of the eighth century. Suddenly it absorbed many refugees from the fall of the northern kingdom.

Speaker 1:          22:47          Remember, Israel is going to be, uh, destroyed and seven 22. So refugees fleeing southward will greatly expand your Islam. We have our archeological evidence of that, but there are very few material remains that a tests to a fabulous empire on the scale that's suggested by the biblical text had sore Mojito and guest. They're the three places that are mentioned as fortified military basis. These have been excavated. They do show some great gateways and some large chambers, even some stables, but archeologists differ radically over the d the dating of um, of these layers. Some date them to the time of Solomon. Some see it as later. Um, most concur that Israel was probably at this time the most important power in its region, but still it would have been small and relatively insignificant compared to the Egypt or Mesopotamia. Some of the great civilizations at either end of the Fertile Crescent, but it would have been the most important state in that area and probably was able to have some dominance over some neighboring areas as well.

Speaker 1:          23:51          I just want to mention three things about Solomon thinks that he's noted for, uh, one is that he's praised for his wisdom and because again, the digital texts praises him for his wisdom. Later tradition will find it convenient to attribute the book of proverbs to him as well as the book of Ecclesiastes. These, uh, these are two works that belonged to the genre of wisdom literature we'll be talking about later in the semester. Second, in addition to being praised for his wisdom, he's praised for constructing the temple. And in fact, the primary focus of, of all of the biblical material with the Biblical story of Solomon is the building of the temple of the dedication of this temple for the Ark of the Covenant in Jerusalem. He continued the close association of, of um, of the cult and the monarchy, the religious and political leadership by constructing this magnificent new Tampa within the palace, the palace complex.

Speaker 1:          24:45          Um, and he himself appointed to high priest. So the juxtaposition of the house of the king and the house of the Deity on Mount Scion was quite deliberate. And this hill, even though geographically it's very small, becomes in the mythic imagination of Israel. This towering and Impregnable Mountain, uh, 11 sin again, um, argues that Xi'an came eventually to take on the features of the cosmic mountain on the cosmic mountain is a mythic symbol that we find in the ancient near east. Um, the cosmic mountain has these, these powers are potencies that are universal and infinite and we find it in the religion of Israel as well. Specifically in connection with Mount Zion. The cosmic mountain in ancient tradition was understood to be the meeting place of the gods, like a Mount Olympus, for example, as a cosmic mountain. But it was also understood to be the axis Mundi. That is to say the juncture or the point of junction between heaven and earth, the meeting place of heaven and earth, right.

Speaker 1:          25:49          The access around which these worlds met or were conjoined in Canaan, um, in Canaanite religion, the mountain of bow, which is known as Mount soft phone, was conceived precisely in this manner. And Levinson points out tremendous commonalities of language and concept, um, in, um, in connection with the mountain of bowel, the mountain of El and the mountain of yogic way. In fact, the word soft phone mounts, a phone is used to describe God's mountain in the Bible in one particular, in one particular passage. So the temple on Mount Zion came to be understood as sacred space, much like the cosmic mountains of other traditions. It's described as a kind of paradise, sometimes almost a garden of Eden. It's described as the place from which the entire world was created. It's also viewed as a kind of epitome of the world, a kind of microcosm entirely an entire microcosm of the world.

Speaker 1:          26:42          It's also seen as the earthly manifestation of a heavenly temple. The temple came to represent an ideal and sacred realm, and we also see it as the object of intense longing. Many of the psalms will express intense longing. If I could just sit in the temple, if I could just be in that, that space, that sacred space. We see it in the psalms in a passage describing the dedication of the temples is in first kings eight Salomon explains that the temple is a place where people have access to God. They can petition to him and they can atone for their sins. It is a house of prayer he says, and it remained the central focal point of Israelite worship per centuries. So his great wisdom, his great virtue in constructing the temple, not withstanding Solomon, is very sharply criticized for, among other things, his foreign worship.

Speaker 1:          27:38          Um, his new palace complex had a tremendous amount of room for his Harem, which is said to have included 700 wives. Many of them were foreign princesses. Many of them would have been acquired to seel political alliances or business alliances, noble, noble women, 700 wives and 300 concubines, as well as various officials and servants. Now of course these numbers are likely exaggerated, but Solomon's diplomatic alliances likely necessitated unions that would of course have been condemned by the Deuteronomistic historian. He is said to have loved women from foreign women, from the nations that God had forbid, and he succumb to the worship of their gods and goddesses, which is really the key point. I mean the whole fear of, of uh, foreign spouses, that one will be led to or we'll support the worship of foreign deities. And so Solomon is said to have built temples for Moabite gods and ammonite gods.

Speaker 1:          28:35          Um, this all may point to a general tolerance for different cults in Jerusalem in the 10th century. And in the ninth century. This may not have been an issue in Jerusalem in the 10th and ninth century, but it's an issue for the later Deuteronomistic editor. They have no tolerance before this. So Solomon's primary flaw in the Deuteronomistic historian's view is his syncretism, which is prompted by his marriages to these foreign women who brought their native cults to Jerusalem. His religious infidelity is, is um, the cause is said to be the cause of the severe problems and ultimately the division of the kingdom that will follow upon his death in order to support this tremendous court. Um, and, and Harem as well as the army and the bureaucracy. Solomon did introduced heavy taxation as well as the core VA, which is, uh, forced labor or required labor on state projects.

Speaker 1:          29:33          So you have this developing urban structure complex, developing bureaucratic urban structure that's now being super imposed, the agricultural life. Um, and that leads to all sorts of class distinctions and class divisions between officials, bureaucrats, um, merchants, large scale land owners who were prospering, perhaps smaller farmers and shepherds who are living at more of a subsistence level. So you have divisions between town and country, between rich and poor. And this is a great change from the ideals of the tribal democracy. Uh, some of the ideals that some of you looked at when we were talking about legal texts where there seem to be these economic blueprints for bringing about economic, um, equivalents through sabbatical, years and jubilee years and so on. In short, the list of social and economic ills that were enumerated by Samuel in first Samuel Chapter Eight, when he was trying to persuade the people from establishing a monarchy, that list of ills, you'll have a standing army, military, a standing army, you'll have to support, you'll have to do labor for this date.

Speaker 1:          30:38          You're going to have all kinds of taxes and special levies. You're going to be virtually and slaved. Many of these things seem to have been realized. The Deuteronomistic historian would like us to believe in the reign of Solomon. Moreover, as we've already seen, um, the very institution of monarchy itself didn't sit well in some quarters because centralized leadership under a human king seem to go against the older traditions of Hebrew Tribal Society, United by Covenant with God, guided by priests, profits, a occasional judges inspired charismatically. So already before Solomon's death, the northern tribes were, uh, feeling some alienation from the house of David. They're resenting what they perceive to be Salomons tyranny. So let me give you a brief timeline of what happens from the death of Solomon down to the destruction. And I'm one of the earlier handouts I gave you. There is a list of the king's north and south.

Speaker 1:          31:29          This is not something you need to memorize and I'm certainly not going to stress it, but if you kind of want to keep score, that's, that's a list that you can refer to. So when Solomon died in nine 22, the structure that had been erected by David and Solomon fell into these two rival states, and neither of them, of course, it's going to be very strong. You have the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom referred to as Judah, each with its own king, right? Jeroboam in the north, Rehoboam in the south. Sometimes they're going to be at war with one another, sometimes they're going to work in alliance with one another. Um, but 200 years later, right from nine 22 down to seven, 20 to 200 years later, the northern kingdom of Israel will fall to the Assyrian Empire. The Assyrians come down to the border of the southern kingdom to Judah and Judah remains viable, but it is reduced to a vassal status.

Speaker 1:          32:21          It is tributary to this new world power. Finally, Judah will be destroyed about 150 years later. Okay, about five [inaudible] seven, five 86 the Babylonians, right? The Neo Babylonian Empire, they have conquered the Assyrians and they assume control over the ancient near east and take the southern kingdom. Now, the story of the northern kingdom, Israel that's presented in kings is colored by a Judy and perspective, and it is highly negative and highly polemical. So Solomon was succeeded by his son Rehoboam, but the 10 tribes of the north, um, revolted. When he refused to relieve their tax burden, they came to him and asked if they could have some relief and he answered them very harshly. So they revolted. And a separate kingdom was set up under the rule of the Israelite Jeroboam towards it just till the end of the 10th century. So divided now into these two kingdoms, they began to lose power, probably losing any control they may have had over outlying territories.

Speaker 1:          33:20          So let's focus first on the northern kingdom of Israel. The area was more divided by tribal rivalries and religious traditions. Then Judah, you have 10 tribes in that region. Gera bomb didn't seem to be able to establish a very stable rule. First Kings 12 tells us of Jeroboam effort to break the connection with the traditional religious center of Jerusalem in the south. He establishes his own government at chef come. And that was a place that was already revered in Hebrew tradition. This is where we have the Covenant Renewal Ceremony by Joshua. So it's already a somewhat sacred site. So he establishes his capital and check them. And then he establishes Royal Shrines, one in the southern part of, of Israel and one in the northern part of Israel, right on each of the borders, north and south of the kingdom in Dan and Bethel, Bethel on the south and Dan and the north, a golden calf is placed in each shrine according to the text.

Speaker 1:          34:14          And this is viewed by the Deuteronomistic historian as a terrible sin. Indeed, the story is written in a manner that deliberately echoes the story of the golden calf that was made by Aaron and Exodus 32. There are linguistic echoes, um, uh, that make it very clear that we are supposed to view this as a sin, as great as the sin of Aaron. It may well be that if Jeroboam did in fact do this, that he was a good ya'll list and was just trying to establish alternate sanctuaries for Galloway Way, um, that would rival Jerusalem's. But the Deuteronomistic historian wants to see this, um, in as, as another instance of, of idolatry and therefore deliberately echoes the primordial cultic sin of the golden calves when talking about Jarrow bombs activity. It brands his cultic center as illegitimate idolatry. Jeroboam is represented by the biblical writer as having made unacceptable concessions to Canaanite practices of worship.

Speaker 1:          35:12          And so he is criticized for this despite his best efforts, his kingship is a fairly unstable and in fact, in the 200 year history of the kingdom, the northern Kingdom of Israel, we will have seven different dynasties occupying the throne. There was great miss material, prosperity in the northern kingdom. Um, I've just picked out a few kings to highlight. So these are not to be understood to be necessarily in order. I've just picked out a few highlights, but I'm, the rule of armory was a time of some much material prosperity and his son Ahab Ahab was sort of the first part of the ninth century. Amari is an interesting person because he's the first king from either kingdom to be mentioned in sources outside the Bible. We have, um, a large stone referred to as the Moabite stone and this stone, which boasts of a military defeat, um, there's the boast that, um, uh, Omri of Israel was defeated.

Speaker 1:          36:07          Omri bought and fortified Samarria as the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel. And archeology does reveal that this was in fact quite a magnificent city at this time. But again, the Deuteronomistic editors are going to judge him as evil. He's disobeyed God. His son Ahab also comes in for bad press. Ahab is also mentioned outside the Bible. We have an inscription of an Assyrian king who describes, um, a coalition of Israelites and Aramaeans who fought against the Assyrians. And Ahab is mentioned in that inscription. Omri and Ahab were clearly very powerful and influential and the region, they're even mentioned outside the Bible. Ahab and his Phoenician wife Jezza bell seem to have established a very extravagant court life in the capital of area. And for this, they're also going to be condemned by the Deuteronomistic editors. Jessebelle what's Phoenician? And when Jezza bail tried to establish the worship of her Phoenecian Baal as the official cult of Israel and she built a temple to buy.

Speaker 1:          37:09          I'll in some area the prophets, Elijah and Elisha preach a kind of holy war against the monarchy. And we're going to come back to these very zealous Yahweh only profits of the north. When we talk about prophecy next time, um, it had been Jessebelle meet a very tragic end and there will be a military coup, military coup led by an army general Jay who in about eight 42. These are all kind of approximate year as you know, that you'll different books we'll give them, they'll defer by five years, one way or the other. But it's our best effort at reconstructing things based on some of these outside extra biblical references that give us a firm date and then we can kind of work around those. So the army general Jay, who in about eight 42 led a military coup. He was anointed king by the Prophet Elijah, and he had a very bloody revenge on decibel decibel.

Speaker 1:          37:59          And the priests of Baal were all slaughtered. The text says, as was as well as every worshiper of bowel in some area, they were all slaughtered by the eighth century. You have the newest Syrian empire on the rise. And in seven, 22 of the Assyrian King Sargon reduced Israel to the status of a province. And we have an inscription by Sargon that confirms the Biblical report that this defeat. And in this inscription, Sargon says, I besieged and conquered Sumeria led away as booty 27,290 inhabitance of it. The town I rebuilt better than it was before and settled there in people from countries which I myself had conquered. So population trends transplanting, I placed an officer of mine, has governor over them and imposed upon them. Tribute as is customary for a Syrian citizens. So there's a basic agreement between this and the biblical account. Uh, many of the governing class, the wealthy merchants, many tens of thousands in all were carried off to northern Mesopotamia and they were lost to history.

Speaker 1:          39:04          These are the 10 lost tribes of Israel. There would have remained behind some Hebrew farmers and shepherds. They would have continued their old ways, but as was consistent with their policy, the in Syria, the Assyrians imported new peoples to repopulate this area and to break up any local resistance to their rule. Um, and this would then become the province of Symeria. And this ethnically mixed group would practice a form of Israelite religion, but the Deuteronomistic editor does not view it as legitimate. And ultimately these Samaritans were going to be despised by the Jews of the southern kingdom, the Jews of Judah. They were seen as foreign corruptors of the faith. They were always ready to assist Judah's enemies against Judah. So they felt very little kinship. And, and very often the Samaritans would join against those attacking Judah. So there was tremendous rivalry between the Jews of Judah and, um, the Samaritans, hence the New Testament story.

Speaker 1:          39:59          Makes Sense, right? This is a hated person. This good Samaritan. So if we turn our attention now to the southern Kingdom of Judah, Judah comprised the two was comprised of the two remaining tribes of Judah and Benjamin. And it enjoyed internal stability. For the most part, it remained loyal to the house of David ruling in Jerusalem. Shortly after Israel fail fell and seven 22 to the Assyrians, the Judah Heights, who's king at that time was king, has a Kia, right? So the king king has a Kia, had to agree to terms with a Syria. They became sort of subject allies or, or vassals of Assyria. But Hezekiah began to prepare for rebellion, began to make alliances with neighbors. And this prompted the Assyrians to march in and lay siege to Jerusalem. This would have happened about 701. And this siege is described in a Syrian sources. So we have independent, um, uh, records of this from a Syrian sources.

Speaker 1:          41:00          We read there as to Hezekiah, the Jew of you, of you who'd write the Jew. He did not submit to my yoke. I laid siege to 46 of his strong cities, walled forts, et cetera. I drove out 200,150 people himself. I made prisoner in Jerusalem, his royal residence, like a bird in a cage, but eventually these Syrians actually withdrew the siege. Judah was able to withstand the siege to preserve their own kingship. The Assyrian Empire is going to fall in six 12 this is the fall of Nineveh you may have heard of at some point, and they will fall to the rising Babylonians, the neo Babylonian Empire. It's the neo Babylonian Empire that will succeed in felling Judah under new book had Red Sir of Babylon in five 87 or five 86 the walls of Jerusalem are dismantled. Many members of the governing classes, wealthier classes are going to be carried off into exile in Babylonia, and that the Hebrews didn't fade into oblivion after the loss of political independence and their geographical base is due in large part to the interpretation of events provided by the Deuteronomistic school.

Speaker 1:          42:10          So we need to talk a little bit about that ideology and why it had historical effect that it had. As I mentioned before, Deuteronomy isn't just the capstone of the pentose doot Pentatonix narrative. It's also the first part of a longer literary history. Martin note was a German scholar who first argued for this, argued that the composition and authorship of Deuteronomy has great, um, has more in common with what follows in some sense then what precedes it. Uh, and he argued that we should understand this to be a unit, the product of a particular school. Um, since this Deuteronomistic school is looking back at the history of Israel up to and including the defeat and exile of the Israelites and five 87 or five 86, the final form of the work of the Deuteronomistic school, the final form must, must be posting silly post five 86.

Speaker 1:          43:04          Um, but there are of course, various layers within that larger work that we can't really date with precision. I just want to say something about the scholarly methodology that led to the conclusion that there is such a thing as the Deuteronomistic school. And that method is redaction criticism. And we've already discussed the goals and the methods of other types of criticism, source criticism or historical criticism. We've talked a little bit about form criticism and tradition criticism, but redaction criticism grew out of a kind of weariness with some of these other forms of biblical criticism. And they're constant fragmentation of the biblical text into older sources or into older genres or into older units of tradition. In order to map out a history of Israelite religion. And these other methods seem to pay very little attention to the text in its final form and the process by which the texts reached its final form.

Speaker 1:          44:03          So redaction criticism rejects the idea that the person or the persons who compiled the texts from earlier sources, um, did a somewhat mechanical scissors and paste job didn't really think too much about the effect. Um, they were creating by putting things together, redaction criticism assumes and focuses on identifying, um, the purpose and the plan behind the final form of the assembled sources. They want to uncover. It's a method that wants to uncover the intention of the person or the persons who produced the biblical texts in roughly the shape that we have at and what was intended by they're producing it in the shape that we have. So redaction criticism proceeds along these lines. And this is how at first developed first you can usually identify linking passages. That is to say passages that kind of join narrative to narrative or unit to unit in an attempt to make the text read more smoothly or just to ease the transition from one source to another.

Speaker 1:          45:01          And these linking passages are assigned to our for redactor, right? Um, also assigned to our are any interpretive passages that means passages that stand back to comment on the text or interpret the text in Sunway. Any place where the narrator turns to direct the, to directly address the audience. So for example, when you have a burst in which the narrator turns and says that was when the Canaanites were still in the land, that would seem to be from the hand of a redactor putting the sources together. When you have an ed illogical comment that is to say a comment of the type that, and that is why the Israelites do such and such a ritual observance to this day, right? That also seems to be written from the perspective of a compiler of sources. Someone who's putting the text together. There are also some passages that indicate or justify or otherwise comment on what's about to occur or passages that summarize and offer an interpretation or justification of what has just happened.

Speaker 1:          46:01          We'll see that in second kings 17. We also saw that in the book of judges, we had this perspective summary saying this is what's going to happen. There's going to be sin. They're going to cry out. There'll be, you know, God will raise up someone, they'll deliver them and then they're going to fall back into sin again. So these are comments that are um, looking forward to tell us what it is we're about to read. And if you join all of all such passages together and assign them to are, you very often find that there are tremendous stylistic similarities in these passages. They use the same rhetoric over and over again or you'll see the same point of view. Um, and it's very often a point of view that isn't in the source materials that they're, that they're linking together. And this is how one arrives at some understanding of the role of the redactor in the final production of the text, how the redactor has framed our understanding of the source materials that he has gathered and the Deuteronomistic historian who's responsible for the reduction of Deuteronomy, Joshua judges.

Speaker 1:          46:56          And so first and second Samuel First and second kings provides not just a history in the sense of documenting events as they occur, as if there's ever documentation without interpretation, but provides a strong interpretation of history, of philosophy, of history is trying to ascertain the meaning of events, the largest, the larger purpose and design something we've called a historiography. And we find the Deuteronomistic interpretation of Israel's history in the preface to the book of Deuteronomy. We find it in editorial comments that are sort of peppered throughout Joshua through kings. And we especially find it in the summary of the entire unit that is contained in second kings 17 before we read that passage, we need to think about what it was that prompted the deuteronomist to adopt a particular interpretation of Israel's historical record. The Deuteronomistic historian was attempting to respond to the first major historical challenge to confront the Israelite people and the Hebrew religion.

Speaker 1:          47:56          And that was the complete collapse of the Israelite nation, the destruction of God's sanctuary and the defeat and exile of the people of the Lord and God in history. The calamitous events of seven 22 but especially five 87 raised a critical theological dilemma. God had promised the Patriarchs and their descendants that they would live in his land. He had promised that the house of David would stand forever, but here at the monarchy had collapsed. The people were defeated and they were in exile. So the challenge presented by this twist of history was really twofold. Is God the God of history? Is he omnipotent? Is He capable of all? Can he in fact impose an effect his will? And if so, then what about his covenant? With the Patriarchs and his covenant with David. Had He facelessly abandoned it. Well, that was unthinkable then. If he hadn't facelessly abandoned his covenant with his people and with David, he must not be the god of history, the universal Lord of all.

Speaker 1:          48:54          He wasn't able to save his people. Neither of these ideas was acceptable to the Deuteronomistic school. It was a fundamental tenant of Israelite monotheism that God is at once the god of history, capable of all whose will is absolute, whose promises are true, and at the same time a god of faithfulness who does not abandon his people. He is both good and powerful. So how could the disasters of seven 22 and five 86 be reconciled with the conviction that God controlled history and that he had an Eternal Covenant with the Patriarchs and with David? The histories, the history ossify of the Deuteronomistic school is the response of one segment of the Israelite community. We'll see another response when we turn to the profits. But the basic idea of the Deuteronomistic school is that God's unconditional and eternal covenants with the Patriarchs and with David do not preclude the possibility of punishment or chastisement for sin as specified in the conditional mosaic covenant.

Speaker 1:          49:55          So you see how both ideas are going to be important to hold and dialectic tension, both theologies, the Covenant Theology as well as the patriarchal and royal theology. So this is because although God is omnipotent, humans do have free will, they can corrupt the divine plan. So in the Deuteronomistic history, the leaders of Israel are depicted as having the choice of accepting God's way or rejecting it. God tries to help them. He's constantly sending them profits who yell at the kings and tell them what it is God wants of them, but they continue to make the wrong choice. They sin. And ultimately that brings about fall first of Israel and then of Judah. And it's the idolatrous sins of the kings that does it with the deposition and the execution of the last Davidic King Zedekiah, the Deuteronomistic school reinterpreted the Davidic Covenant in conditional terms on the model of the Sinai Covenant, the Mosaic Covenant according to which God's favor toward the king, depends on the king's loyalty to God.

Speaker 1:          50:52          And in this way, the fall of the house of David could be seen as justifiable punishment for disobedient kings and rulers like Monash Shay. We'll come back to him. Remember the Davidic covenant that Nathan, uh, proclaimed in second Samuel seven, explicitly said that God would punish and chastises anointed. That's what it means to be a son, to receive correction, discipline, and punishment. I have to finish this, these thoughts on, um, on Monday and see if specifically how they interpret it and understand the history of what happened in a way that enabled certain segments of the population to see this as in fact, proof of God's strength and faith faithfulness. Um, and then we'll turn to prophesy on Monday.
