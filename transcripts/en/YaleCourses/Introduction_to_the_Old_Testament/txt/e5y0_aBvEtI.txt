Speaker 1:          00:01          You may have heard that posts Biblical tradition hails Moses as anxious. Israel's a first and greatest law giver, and certainly the Bible depicts Moses as receiving law from God and conveying it to the Israelites. But clearly Moses isn't the author or compiler of the legal traditions contained in the Bible. Some of the individual laws we know, um, are found in very, very, very ancient near eastern laws. They're part of an ancient near eastern legal tradition, the collections as a whole clearly date to a much later period of time. And we're going to see that clearly when we talk about Deuteronomy today. And they had been retroed [inaudible] back to the time of Moses. But nevertheless, Moses is the central figure in the biblical narrative from exodus all the way through numbers and into Deuteronomy. And he's going to serve as a paradigm for Israel's leaders to follow in the biblical view.

Speaker 1:          00:54          No one can look upon the face of God and live. And yet Moses who spoke with God, mouth to mouth the text says, was an exception to this rule. So why wasn't he permitted to see the fulfillment of his labors? Why was he not permitted to enter the promised land? This is a question that plagued ancient Israel, and the Bible contains the effort of tradition to explain this great mystery or tragedy. When Moses asked God if he can enter the land that's in Deuteronomy three 25 God refuses and he gives his reason. In Deuteronomy 32 versus 49 to 52 you shall die on the mountain. The two are about to ascend and shall be gathered to your kin as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hoar and was gathered to his kin for you, Bro, for you both broke faith with me among the Israelite people at the waters of Mary Fatca dish in the Wilderness of sin.

Speaker 1:          01:50          By failing to uphold my sanctity among the Israelite people, you may view the land from a distance, but you shall not enter it the land that I am giving to the Israelite people. So what happened at Maryville at Kadesh that made God so angry? Well, you can read the story. It's in numbers 20 the incident is described there, but the answer is still not entirely clear. It's not clear what Moses did that was so bad as to deserve this punishment. Perhaps it's Moses. His failure to follow God's instructions to the letter when he is producing water, uh, for the Israelites were demanding water. Perhaps that's what angers got, but one gets the impression that the story in numbers 20 and Deuteronomy subsequent claim that it was something about that story that earned Moses God's disapproval. You get the impression that these are an attempt to explain what was probably a longstanding tradition about a great leader who died on the east side of the river.

Speaker 1:          02:45          For that to have happened, for that desk to have happened, the writers seem to surmise he must've sinned. There must've been some punishment for some sin. After a very poignant scene in which God shows Moses the promised land from a lookout point on the east side of the Jordan River, we then read about the death of Moses in Deuteronomy 34 God spoke to Moses on that same day, ascend this mount every team, the peak Nivo in the land of Moab opposite Jericho. And look at the land of Canaan, which I'm giving Israel for a holding. So Moses went up from the plains of Moab to mount Nebo to the top of peace, Pisco opposite Jericho. And God showed him all the land from Gad to done, which is in the north and all of Naphtali and the land of a fry, em and Menasha and all of Judah in the south to the outer Mediterranean Sea and the negative, the southern wilderness and the plane of the valley of Jericho, the palm city as far as so are the end of the Dead Sea.

Speaker 1:          03:40          And then Moses, the servant of God, died there in the land of Moab, has God had said, and he buried him in the valley, in the land of moth. But no man knows the place of his burial to this day. And the people of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab for 30 days. And they're never again a rose in Israel, such a profit as Moses whom God knew face to face, none like him, for all the signs and wonders which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, to his household, and to all his land. None like him. And respect of all the mighty power and all the great and terrible deeds which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel. There's no other human being in the Bible who earns such a tribute. This is unusual for the biblical writer, uh, to speak in such glowing terms of a human character.

Speaker 1:          04:28          And I've said that Moses becomes a paradigmatic leader in the biblical tradition and the force of Moses as paradigmatic leader of Israel is apparent in the very first leader to succeed him. And that is Joshua. Deuteronomy closes with a transfer of authority from Moses to Joshua. So in Deuteronomy 34, nine, we read now Joshua son of nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands upon him and the Israelites heated him doing as the Lord had commanded Moses. And in several ways, Joshua's going to turn out to be a kind of carbon copy of Moses. Moses crosses the Reed Sea. The waters stand in a heap and the children of Israel cross over on dry land. We'll see in connection with Joshua that he crosses the Jordan river into the promised land. The water stand in a heap. The children of Israel Cross on dry land.

Speaker 1:          05:19          That's in Joshua three, verse 13. After crossing, um, the Israelites then celebrate the Passover and that makes us strong link then to the exodus led by Moses. Also at the time of the first Passover, Moses had a vision of God at the burning Bush. She was told to remove his shoes, his sandals, because he was on holy ground. Josh was also going to have a theophany. It's a vision. After he crosses the Jordan, he'll see a man with a drawn sword, um, who's the captain of the Lord's host and he tells him to remove his shoes. He is on holy ground. Moses is the one to mediate a covenant between God and Israel. At Sinai. Joshua will mediate every new. We'll have the covenant at a place called chef him. Moses sent out spies to scout out the land. Joshua also set out spies to scout out the land.

Speaker 1:          06:09          Moses holds out a rod during battle in order that Israel prevail over her enemies. And Joshua will do the same with a javelin. So these are all important literary parallels and they signal the importance of Moses in Israelite tradition as the parodic Madec leaders. So other leaders who are praise will be modeled on Moses. It said of Joshua after these rights enter the promise land. It said on that day, the Lord Exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel so that they revered him all his days as they had revered Moses. So no greater praise can be given to an Israelite leader then to be compared to Moses. But now we're going to take a close look at Deuteronomy and we'll pick up with Joshua on, um, on Wednesday. So Israel's wanderings in the wilderness end on the plains of Moab, which is on the east bank of the Jordan River. And it's there that the book of Deuteronomy Opens. They are most, this is going to deliver three long speeches prior to the Israelites entry into the promise land. And these three speeches constitute the bulk of the book of Deuteronomy.

Speaker 1:          07:14          Deuteronomy differs very much from the other four books of the pentitude because in those books, you'd have an anonymous narrator who is describing, um, describes y'all way as directing his words to Moses to then be conveyed to Israel. Moses will speak to Israel on God's behalf, but in Deuteronomy Eight, Moses is going to speak speaking directly to the Israelites so that the book is written almost entirely in the first person, right? Whereas the first four books of the Pentateuch or not, they're third person anonymous narrative narration. Here we have the bulk of the book in the first person direct speech. Now, Moshe Weinfeld, I put his name on the board. There's someone who you should associate always with the book of Deuteronomy, but motion Weinfeld, he's one of the leading scholars of Deuteronomy. And he describes the book as expressing ideology by means of a programmatic speech put into the mouth of a great leader.

Speaker 1:          08:09          That's a very common practice and later Israelite historiography. And he says it's happening here already. And I'll be referring quite a bit to wind fields work. Um, as we talk about Deuteronomy, Deuteronomy differs from the other books of the Pentateuch in other significant ways. So for example, according to the priestly writer, Israel received its laws, its Torah from God at Mount Sinai. But in Deuteronomy, the laws were given here on the plains of morph 40 years after Sinai, before the Israelites crossed the Jordan, I'm at Sinai, the Israelites heard the decalogue, but the remainder of the laws, it would seem, are delivered on the plains of Moab. We can look at the basic structure of Deuteronomy and a couple of ways we can do a kind of literary division, which I have on this side of the board according to the speeches. So to begin, we have the first speech, which is a sort of introductory speech, and the first four chapters going through four verse 43 there's an introduction that gives us the location where the Israelites are, and also then Moses, his first sermon, Moses in this sermon is giving a historical review.

Speaker 1:          09:14          And the purpose of this historical review is didactic. He wants, he wants the Israelites to learn something, to infer something from this review of their history from Sinai to the present day. And in that review, as he retells the story, um, which we've just been reading about in the previous books, we see his, his selective choice of events. We see how he's describing things in a way that underscores God's faithful, loyal fulfillment of the covenantal promise. And he's using this to urge the Israelites to do their part by obeying God's laws. The second speech extends from four verses 44 through 28 verse six. And this also contains a bit of a historical review, again, retelling some of the narrative of the earlier books of the Torah. And again, giving us the insight into this phenomenon of inner biblical interpretation. We're parts of the Bible that review parts elsewhere are already beginning to interpret and present that material in a particular light.

Speaker 1:          10:08          But then we have a central section of laws being presented beginning at about 12, so this is still part of Moses, his second speech, but stretching from Deuteronomy 12 through 26. We have laws and this is a in many ways of repetition of much of the revealed legislation. We've already encountered that central portion of laws 12 through 26 is thought to be the earliest core of the book. We're going to come back and talk about that in a moment. Now, the Greek title for this book, which is Deuteronomy Deuteros due to row Namos, um, a second law of repetition of the law and that name derives from the fact that the bulk of the book contains this legal core of material which reviews the law in chapters 27. We have a covenant renewal ceremony. It takes place at a mountain near Schechem. Um, after the Israelites have crossed the Jordan that describes the ceremony that will take place, excuse me, after they have crossed the Jordan and from ancient Greece, we know that in the ancient world, settlers who would colonize a place, particularly if they colonized a place at divine instigation, they would perform certain ceremonies that would be accompanied by blessings and accompanied by curses.

Speaker 1:          11:17          They would write the laws on stone pillars. They would erect an altar for sacrifices. They would proclaim blessings and cursing purses for those who obey and disobey. Very similar to what happens in chapter 27. All of these elements appear in Chapter 27 Chapter 28 lists the material rewards that will accrue to Israel if he is faithful to God's law and the punishments if she should disobey in some of these are very creative, but the importance of the Deuteronomistic view of history in which Israel fate is totally conditioned on her obedience to the covenant. This is something that will occupy us repeatedly at a future date. I mentioned it here, but it's something we will need to come back to. The third speech of Moses is in chapters 29 and 30. This speech emphasizes the degree to which evil fortune is the responsibility of the community.

Speaker 1:          12:11          Um, Moses in enumerates additional misfortunes and sufferings that will be fall Israel if she sins, but he emphasizes the choice is Israel's, you know, God has been clear regarding what's required and it's not beyond Israel's reach to attain life and prosperity. She needs to only choose, and this is all set out and a speech in chapter 30 I'll read from verses 11 to 20. Surely this instruction which I enjoy and upon you this day is not too baffling for you, nor is it beyond reach. It is not in the heavens that you should say, who among us can go up to heavens and the heavens and get it for us and impart it to us that we may observe it. Neither is it beyond the sea that you should say, who among us can cross to the other side of the sea and get it for us and impart it to us that we may observe it now the thing is very close to you.

Speaker 1:          13:00          It's in your mouth and in your heart to observe it. See, I set before you this day, life and prosperity, death and adversity. For I command you this day, to love the Lord your God, to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments, his laws and his rules that you may thrive and increase and that the Lord your God may bless you in the land that you are about to enter and possess. Listen to the cadences of of this kind of language in Deuteronomy, we haven't heard language like this before, but it's what people often think of when they think of Biblical language starts here in Deuteronomy. But if your heart turns away and you give no heat and are lured into the worship and the service of other gods, I declare to you this day that you shall certainly perish. You shall not long and do or on the soil that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.

Speaker 1:          13:40          I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day. I have put before you life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life if you and your offspring would live by loving the Lord your God, hating his commandments and holding fast to him. For thereby you shall have life and shall long and your upon the soil that you're, that the Lord your God swore to your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to give to them. So all has been given, right. It's simply Israel choice to take it or not. The last section of the book, chapters 31 to 34 is a sort of miscellany of appendices. Um, there's some ancient poetry that's found in chapter 32, which is referred to as the song of Moses. Scholars refer to it as a song of Moses. Um, we have the blessings of Moses recorded in chapter 33 and then chapter 34 is the story of Moses, his death.

Speaker 1:          14:29          I read part of that to you now centuries ago already. Scholars of the Bible noted that Deuteronomy opens with the verse. These are the words that Moses addressed to all Israel on the other side of the Jordan. That is to say the Trans Jordan on the other side of the Jordan. So that line is obviously written from the perspective of someone who is inside the land saying Moses said that when he was over there outside the land on the other side of the Jordan. So he's looking eastward. And so that's aligned, that one would think, could not be written by Moses because Moses did not ever enter the land. It would not be in a position to talk about something being on the other side of the Jordan. Likewise, the last chapter, which describes Moses, his death and burial probably was not written by him.

Speaker 1:          15:17          So as we shall see these and many other textual features point to the period of composition for Deuteronomy, which was many centuries after the time that Moses would have been supposed to have lived, um, are if we are to assume he was a historical character. And so through careful analysis, you have scholars like Moesha, widefield, and Weinfeld. And many others. I think Bernard Levinson is the one who has written about Deuteronomy in your Jewish Study Bible and that's a wonderful introduction to read there. So I encourage you to please make sure you look at that. But analysis of scholars like these have led them to draw the conclusion that the original core of Deuteronomy emerged in the eighth century. And this is now where my, my interesting little mountain shape diagram is going to come into play. It was probably known as a scroll of, it was probably a skull scroll of laws known as the book or the scroll of the Torah.

Speaker 1:          16:10          Um, Deuteronomy refers to itself that way and Deuteronomy 17 verses 19 and 20 and so we think it was probably something roughly equivalent to chapters 12 to 26 maybe there was a little introduction, a little conclusion. And eventually these laws were put into the framework of a speech by Moses, maybe chapters five through 11 and maybe 28 maybe that would have been in the eighth, seventh century. And then at some later point, several things happened and I will say them in in the following order, but that doesn't mean they happened in this order. We really aren't sure at some point several things happen. You have framing chapters, Deuteronomy one through four, this sort of introductory frame and historical review as well as the appendices at the end. Chapters 31 and 34 those get added. You also have laws being updated, passages being expanded to reflect the experience of exile.

Speaker 1:          17:04          You will remember that as a five 86 the Israelites, Jerusalem is destroyed and the Israelites were in exile in Babylonia. Additionally, at some point Deuteronomy is appended to the other four books of the Pentateuch. Genesis through numbers is made to proceed this, um, it's serving therefore as their conclusion and by being joined to them, it confers it's title as a book of Torah as a scroll of Torah to that material as well. They don't use the word Torah in that way. In those books only Deuteronomy, it uses the word Torah to speak of God's instruction or revelation overall. So by being upended now to genesis through numbers, all of this perhaps comes to be known as Tara as well. And then finally during the exile, or I'm sorry, probably during the period after the exile, um, no during the exile, but down to the end of the sixth century, Deuteronomy was incorporated into a larger narrative history that runs from Joshua through judges first and second Samuel First and second kings.

Speaker 1:          18:06          That's all a unit as we'll come to see in the next lecture. And so Deuteronomy in a way served as an introduction to that material looking forward. So I conclusion to the previous four books, but also an introduction to a long narrative history that's going to run through to the end of second kings. Now there's a lot of debate over the precise timing of these events in this process by which this material grew and was expanded. But in the post exit period, at some point, the entire unit, the genesis through numbers material, Deuteronomy, um, and then the lengthy historical narrative all the way through second kings was solidified. The Deuteronomistic history is sort of an odd conclusion to the genesis through numbers material because it doesn't really have the expected narrative climax. You sort of expect the story to end with the entry of the Israelites into the land and hopefully under Moses, and that doesn't occur.

Speaker 1:          19:00          Some scholars have suggested that differing Israel's possession of the land to the future may have reflected the historical experience of exile and experience, which challenged the very idea of the possession of the land as central to the maintenance of the covenant. So if you are in an exile, then perhaps the more satisfying ending is to have Israel not in fact entering the land. The complex process by which Deuteronomy was formed underscores the fact that modern notions of authorship cannot be applied to biblical texts. We think of an author. We tend to think of an author as a discrete individual who composes a text at a specific time, but this isn't the way that texts came into being in the ancient world, particularly important communal texts. As Weinfeld points out, the biblical authors were what we would call collectors, compilers, revisers editors and interpreters of ancient tradition, ancient texts for generally the product of many hands over the stretch of many long centuries.

Speaker 1:          20:09          And during that time modifications and recontextualization occurred. And so we refer to those who transmit and develop a text in this way as a school. But you need to understand that we are using that in a relatively informal way. So when we talk about the Deuterenomic school or the Deuteronomistic school, we're really talking about the fact that we have a set of texts that all seem to share a certain sort of ideology or orientation. And yet we know that parts of them seem to date from very, very different times. And so we think of that text is being preserved, transmitted and developed by many hands, um, who share certain commonalities, common ideology. So we call it a school. It's not that we know of the existence of the Deuteronomistic school and we say, Oh, well then they must have produced this text. It's the other way around.

Speaker 1:          20:56          We have a text and it's features suggest to us a longstanding tradition of scholarship, right, that preserved and transmitted the texts in that way. Same with the priestly school. We're speaking about the priests, the materials which clearly have evidence of originating from the eighth, seventh, sixth and fifth centuries. And so there must have been a common, um, uh, uh, uh, stretch of scholarship that would have preserved and transmitted in a developed those traditions. And we call that the priestly school, the legal corps of Deuteronomy. So really from five to 26, because five is where some of the legal material begins, contains first of all, a somewhat expanded version of the 10 Commandments. You have that in Deuteronomy five and then other laws really from 12 to 26 that resemble the legal material that's found in exodus, the, the collection of material we've called the Covenant Code. And they also seem to bear some relationship to the laws in Leviticus and numbers.

Speaker 1:          21:52          But the question is what is the relationship between the different versions of the legal material? Some of these laws will parallel each other's each other quite closely and others do not. So our Deuteronomy is legal traditions, a direct response to or modification of the laws and exodus and numbers or are they best understood as um, just different independent formulations of a common legal tradition. Um, Weinfeld has argued that Deuteronomy is dependent on the previous traditions of the pentitude tuk that Deuteronomy revises and reforms them according to new ideas. It's new notion of a centralized cultic worship. And secondly, it's a humanitarian spirit. Those are too controlling ideologies. He says its shape, its revision of preexisting material. He's specifically argues that Deuteronomy is dependent on the e source. The source at some scholars think is pretty hard to isolate or find in the biblical text, but in East Sinai's referred to as Horeb and, and Deuteronomy Sinai is also horrible.

Speaker 1:          22:53          So the author of Deuteronomy limits the revelation at Sinai to the deck log and seems to assert that the full law was given to Moses for the Israelites on the plains of Moab and Weinfeld view. This means that Deuteronomy, with its revisions, what have been seen would have been presented as and would've been seen as an updated replacement of the old book of the Covenant rather than its compliment. It exists side by side in our text now. But I think in his view, those who promulgated it, we're understanding it as the updated replacement of the laws of the, of the book of the Covenant. For the most part, Deuteronomy doesn't really contain much in the way of civil law. It tends to focus on the moral religious prescriptions, kind of the APP, addictive law in Israel. And the few civil laws that are there tend to be reworked in line with Deuteronomy humanity.

Speaker 1:          23:43          So for example, the laws of the ties, the laws or the seventh year release of debts, the rules for the release of slaves, the rules for the three festivals, these are all ancient laws. They occur an exodus, but they appear. And Deuteronomy with modifications, modifications about things that concern the Deuteronomistic. And some of you have discussed some of these in section. So in Deuteronomy, the Israelite debt slave comes out of his or her servitude. Um, with generous gifts from the owner. This is not something that appears in exodus or as another example. Deuteronomy extends the Covenant Codes, Prohibition Against Afflicting and resident alien. In Deuteronomy, there's the insistence at these are lights must not just refrain from afflicting them but must love the resident alien. It goes so far as to provide concrete legal benefits, um, food and so on for the resident alien. So while the relationship of d to some of the laws and the Covenant Code is often not always, but often one of revision, the relationship between d and the laws and the priestly source is more difficult to characterize.

Speaker 1:          24:50          The priestly source seems to represent an equally early set of laws, a legal traditions that just emanated from a very different circle and had different concerns. It tends to deal with sacral topics or if it's dealing with other topics that we'll deal with. The sacral implications of those topics like d p often updates and revises laws of the Covenant Code. We can see that in the fact that the priestly source abolishes is relight dates, debt slavery altogether and insists that slaves must be acquired only from the nations around Israel. And that was where like Ken and enslave another Israelite. Nevertheless, Weinfeld argues that on occasion Deuteronomy contains laws that are also found in p but presents them in a more rational manner is the word he uses or d sacralizing manner. So Ds treatment and Deuteronomy is treatment of sacrifice. We'll see in a moment is going to be different.

Speaker 1:          25:43          For example, from peas, they have different concerns and different Fokai in their presentation of that material. In any event, many scholars through their analysis of these texts have been led to conclude that the Deuteronomistic school updated and revised earlier laws, particularly laws in the Covenant Code, but sometimes also in the older legal straight of of p. And they did so in keeping with the circumstances of the eighth to sixth century. So Deuteronomy exemplifies a phenomenon that occurs at several critical junctures in Israel's history and we're going to see this as we move forward through the biblical text. And that is the modification. And rewriting of earlier laws and traditions in the light of new circumstances and ideas. So don't. Deuteronomy is itself and implicit authorization of the process of interpretation and the notion of Canon or sacred Canon that's exemplified then by biblical texts is one that allows for continued unfolding and development of the sacred tradition.

Speaker 1:          26:49          And that's an idea that I think differs very much from modern intuitions about the nature of secret cannons. I think a lot of people have the intuition that a sacred Canon means that the text is fixed, static and authoritative because it is fixed and static. We're unchanging. That's not the biblical view or ancient view of sacred Canon texts represents representing sacred revelation were modified, they were revised, they were rephrased, they were updated, and they were interpreted in the process of transmission and preservation. It was precisely because a text or a tradition was sacred and authoritative that it was important that it adapt and speak to new circumstances. Otherwise it would appear to be irrelevant. So it's a very different notion of what it means for something to be canonical and sacred from what I think some moderns have come to understand those terms to mean.

Speaker 1:          27:48          So what are the special circumstances and concerns that guide Deuteronomy is revisions, uh, of tradition. One of the primary changes you've probably heard in section as well by now is the emphasis on worship at a single central shrine that's going to represent a great change in Israel's religious practice. According to Deuteronomy, the central sanctuary will be located in a place that God himself will choose. It's not named and Deuteronomy or in a place where he will cause his name to dwell. That's the other phrase that's used. Jerusalem has never explicitly mentioned as the site in question, but Jerusalem will later in fact fulfill this function according to other biblical texts. Now there are striking similarities between Deuteronomy is religious program and the major religious reforms that were carried out in the eighth century by King Hezekiah. But even more so, I'm in the seventh century by the King Josiah around six 22 king Josiah.

Speaker 1:          28:47          This is a reform that's reported in the book of Second Kings and second kings 22. Um, this reform, um, has long been noticed and provides scholars with the basis for dating the core materials of Deuteronomy, dating them to the late seventh century. According to the story in second kings during temple repairs that were being done in the time of King Josiah, the scroll of the Torah. That's how it's phrased. The scroll of the Torah was found and when it was read, the king was distressed because its requirements were not being upheld. Now this term, the scroll of the Torah, as I said, does not occur in genesis through number. It is a phrase that occurs in Deuteronomy, Deuteronomy 17. Um, then continuing the content, the account in second kings, Josiah said to take action. He assembles the people. He publicly reads the scroll, the people agree to its terms and then Josiah's reforms begin.

Speaker 1:          29:45          We hear that he purges the temple of vessels that had been made for bow and ashy Ra that were in the temple of Yahweh. He removes all foreign elements from the cult. He prohibits sacrifice to Yahweh anywhere, but in the central sanctuary, he destroys all of the high places. This refers to sort of rural shrines that were scattered throughout the countryside were local priests and Levites might offer sacrifices for people, ritual, shrines and pillars being used in the worship of your way. These are deemed to be quite legitimate in theJ and e's sources. The patriarchs are doing this sort of thing all the time, building altars all around the country, but it's Deuteronomy that contains commandments to destroy the worship. First of all, the worship of other gods, but I'll should also the worship of Yahweh in high places or in rural shrines. So this is evidence again that what Josiah found a basis reforms on was something like the book of Deuteronomy.

Speaker 1:          30:39          It's Deuteronomy that contains the prohibitions of of high places and so on. After these reforms, it's reported that the Passover was celebrated. It was celebrated not as a family observance in individual homes. It was celebrated as a national pilgrimage. Festivals celebrated by everyone in Jerusalem. That's how its celebration has described in the book of Deuteronomy is described as a family celebration and an individual homes and the other books of the Bible. So again, this is another basis for the conclusion that the scroll of the law found by Josiah and guiding has reforms, was something like the legal corps of Deuteronomy. Scholars now think that that legal corps of Deuteronomy was produced in the northern kingdom, the northern kingdom of Israel, which fell and seven 22 you'll recall it was probably produced there in the eighth century. And that is supported by the fact that Deuteronomy has affinities with some profits, with the writings of some profits we'll be looking at later from the northern Kingdom of the eighth century, such as the Prophet Hosea.

Speaker 1:          31:37          And we'll see this when we look at Jose, his writings. Um, it also has affinities with the source, which is also connected with the northern kingdom. In the ninth and eighth century, the northern kingdom was the site of a struggle, a struggle against Baal worship. It was also home to certain profits such as Elijah and Elisha who are known for their zealotry. And they're exclusive. Yeah. Wisdom. So some scholars think that was going on in the ninth, eighth century, in the north. This sort of Ya'll way only party. Um, that was, um, uh, you know, working hard and struggling against Baal worship. And they think that those Yahweh only traditions were brought south after the fall of the northern Kingdom and seven 22, yet refugees coming south. They brought these traditions with them. Um, some of these written materials were put into the temple. And then about a century later during design as time when the temple is being refurbished, they were found, um, possibly this material was then worked into a larger scroll, um, given it's mosaic introductions and so on.

Speaker 1:          32:38          And uh, that all contributed to, um, Josiah's reform. So the centralization of the cult also needs to be understood against the larger political backdrop of the late seventh century. The Assyrian threat loomed large. You have to remember that the northern kingdom has already been completely destroyed. 10 tribes, exile, deported and essentially lost the southern kingdom, managed to escape destruction, but only by paying tribute as a vassal to a, so Judah, the southern kingdom is a tribute paying vassal state to the Assyrian overlord. And of course there's a great deal of a Syrian cultural influence and religious influence in Judah as a result. So second kings tells us that there were foreign forms of worship being introduced right into the temple. Josiah's reforms have been interpreted by some, as an attempt to assert the political and the cultural and religious autonomy of Judah. Unregulated worship throughout the land was no longer going to be an acceptable, the people we're going to be United around a central standardized, yeah way cult, which would be purged them, any Syrian influence or foreign influence, um, and this was deemed as necessary to stand up against or to survive the Assyrian threat.

Speaker 1:          33:54          So it's in that context that we can look at the very strong parallels that exist between the book of Deuteronomy and certain a Syrian treaties from the seventh century. We already talked about, um, the Hittite a vassal treaties as a model for the Israelite Covenant when we were talking about exodus. But Deuteronomy is clearly dependent on another model and that is the Assyrian Vassal Treaty. The best exemplars of these treaties

Speaker 1:          34:31          are the treaties of the Assyrian. Emperor Esther hadn't, he was a seventh century, um, ruler of a Syria down to about six 69. These treaties were discovered about 50 years ago. Um, and Moshe Weinfeld is one of the people who has done a tremendous amount of work with these treaties and he's argued at great length that Deuteronomy reworks the second millennium Hittite model in accordance with the covenantal patterns that are evident in the first millennium vassal treaties of Esarhaddon. We see history being used as a motivational tool and we see laws being reinforced by curses. Um, and it's fascinating if you line up some of the curses in Esarhaddon, it's treaties with the curses and Deuteronomy. There's an amazing correspondence. Um, Deuteronomy also includes blessings. The Assyrians didn't do that. Um, Weinfeld notes that the Assyrian treaties are really loyalty oaths that are imposed upon vassals rather than true covenants.

Speaker 1:          35:27          And Deuteronomy is also something of a low loyalty oath, except that the people are pledging their loyalty to a god rather than to a human king. So you have the x rotation to love the Lord your God. I mean, think back to some of that language that we heard is I read Deuteronomy 30 the exhortation to love the Lord your God, to go after God, to fear God, to listen to the voice of God. These are all typical of pledges of loyalty and they're paralleled in the Assyrian treaties where the vassal has to love the crown prince. He has to listen to the voice of the crown prince. The same phrasiology are used. So it is a political literary form, but it's borrowed and it's referred to God the Assyrian Gds. Also, we'll warn against profits or ecstatics or dream interpreters who will try to foment sedition.

Speaker 1:          36:15          If you'll notice in Deuteronomy 13, we have something quite similar, a warning against false prophets who will try to foment sedition, lead the people to the worship of other gods. Some scholars refer to Deuteronomy as a kind of counter treaty if you will, right? A subversive document that's trying to shift the people's loyalty from the Assyrian overlord, right to God, the true sovereign right and it's part of a national movement. Deuteronomy differs in style, in terminology, in outlook and in theological assumptions from the other books of the Torah as a series of public speeches. It adopts a highly rhetorical tone, very, um, sometimes on almost artificial style. It's the style of a very skilled, um, preacher almost. Um, he, it employs direct address you use sometimes in a singular, sometimes in the plural, but Moses is constantly speaking in a very personal tone, direct address.

Speaker 1:          37:12          And there are all sorts of hortatory phrases, phrases that x hort you, um, to do this with all your heart and soul. Do this in order that it may go well with you. I'm, the land is described as a land where milk and honey flow. And if only you will obey the voice of Yahweh, your God. And this is the kind of language that's used here and not so much in the other books. So let's isolate now some of the major themes of Deuteronomy before we close our study of the pentitude. First of all, if I, as I've mentioned, the centralization of the cult, that's a key theme in the book of Deuteronomy. And I had very important effects. It brought Judy and religion closer to monotheism because you have the insistence of I'm worshiping one God in his one central sanctuary sacrifice was offered only on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, which meant that slaughter of animals for meat in the countryside no longer has a sacred component to it.

Speaker 1:          38:08          It's just ordinary, common profane slaughter. Um, there's evidence that that wasn't true before this reform that if you wanted to kill an animal for me, you kind of kind of a make shift alter out there in the, in the field. Um, and you would pour out the blood and, and give it back to God and so on. You might still pour out the blood obviously, but there was previously a more sacred element to it. Now slaughter in the countryside was simply common profane slaughter. As a result, you have a lot of rural Levi's were out of business. Now a lot of people who would have officiated at local shrines and they are out of business, that probably explains the fact that Deuteronomy makes special provision for the Levi's send includes them in it's uh, in legislation, um, sort of social welfare legislation. There are provisions that are made for the Levi's who are not going to be able to earn their income anymore.

Speaker 1:          38:57          These local shrines. So many of them would have gone up to Jerusalem and real tensions going to develop between the Jerusalem priests and this class of Levi's, um, who are newcomers and we'll see some of that tension played out in some other texts. So centralization of the cult and that has some social ramifications. We also have the, a sort of a greater abstraction of the deity. Is this something many people pointed to in the book of Deuteronomy because Deuteronomy and books that are related to it, those that are going to follow consistently refer to the sanctuary as the place where Yahweh chose to cause his name to dwell. God isn't said to God himself, isn't said to dwell in the temple, nor is the temple described as a house of God. The temple is always the dwelling of his name. The house is built for his name.

Speaker 1:          39:45          Weinfeld asserts that this is in order to combat the ancient to popular belief that God actually dwells in the sanctuary. Likewise to eradicate or guard against the idea which is implicit in earlier sources that God sits enthroned on the the, on the crew team, on the chair of beam who guard has arc. Deuteronomy emphasizes that the function of the arc is exclusively to how's the tablets, the tablets of the covenant. That's its purpose. They are, cover isn't mentioned. The Cherubim aren't mentioned. We don't have the image of this as a throne with the archis God's footstool. Um, so it seems to be a greater abstraction of the deity. Um, some abstraction is also apparent in the shift from visual to oral imagery in describing God's self manifestations or theophanous. One hears God but one doesn't see God in Deuteronomy. And that's very different from earlier texts where we're seeing a sort of a cloud in case fire and so on.

Speaker 1:          40:40          So the sanctuary is understood to be a house of worship as much as it is how a a cultic center in which is what lights and foreigners alike may deliver prayers to God who dwells in heaven. So he is in heaven. This is a place of worship. That's not to say that sacrifices abolished, it's not to say the sacrifice isn't important to Deuteronomy very far from it. It's an essential part of God's service for Deuteronomy. But Deuteronomy is less interested in cultic matters. And in any event, it focuses on when it focuses on sacrifices, it focuses on a different aspect of those sacrifices. The sacrifices it talks about consists primarily of offerings that are consumed by the offer in the sanctuary or are shared with the disenfranchised in some way. The leave Eit, uh, the alien resident, the orphan, the widow portions are given to them.

Speaker 1:          41:31          So by emphasizing the obligation to share the sacrificial meal with disadvantaged members of society, Deuteronomy, uh, almost gives the impression that the primary purpose of the sacrifices is humanitarian or at least personal, the fulfillment of a religious obligation or the expression of gratitude to God and so on. These are aspects of the sacrifices that are emphasized in Deuteronomy. Deuteronomy also emphasizes social justice and personal ethics and neighborly responsibility. God's own righteous behavior on behalf of the week. And the oppressed is a model for Israel's righteous behavior. God assists the orphan, the widow and the stranger, and that's the basis of Israel's a injunction to assist them. Also, it's the basis for the humanitarianism that I mentioned earlier that seems to run through the laws of Deuteronomy 12 through 26. Uh, further theme. And Deuteronomy is the fact that the covenant concept entails the idea that each generation of Israelites understand itself as having been bound with God in the original covenant.

Speaker 1:          42:36          So in Deuteronomy five versus two to three, the Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb Sinai. It was not with our fathers that the Lord made this covenant, but with us, the living, every one of us who is here today. Now this is interesting because remember this is a generation. The generation has died off that saw the exodus and Sinai, right? So these are the children now and they're saying, no, it was with us. Every one of us who is here today. So every generation of Israel is to view itself as standing at the Sacred Mountain to conclude a covenant with God. And that decisive moment has to be made ever present. That's a process that's facilitated by the obligation to study, to study the laws, to recite them daily, to teach them to your children. These are instructions that are contained in Deuteronomy. Moreover, Deuteronomy 31 proclaims that every seventh year the Tara is to be read publicly the entire thing.

Speaker 1:          43:24          And Weinfeld argues that, uh, where many ancient near eastern cultures direct the king to write the laws for himself to read them. It's only in Israel. He's yet to find a parallel is only in Israel that the law is a manual for both the king and the people is to be proclaimed and metal out to the people on a regular basis every seven years. Further theme of Deuteronomy is the emphasis on love. Weinfeld points out that the Assyrian treaties stress the vassals love for the crown prince, but there's never a reciprocal love by the crown prince for the vassal and Deuteronomy differs in this respect. Deuteronomy emphasizes God's gracious and undeserved love of Israel and that's expressed in his mighty acts on Israel's behalf. The deuteronomist makes it clear that God's great love should awaken a reciprocal love on Israel's part love of God, love of God.

Speaker 1:          44:14          Here it really means a loyalty. The word that is used as a word that stresses loyalty, love, and loyalty are mere abstractions. However, without some sort of vehicle for their expression and the vehicle for the expression then is God's Torah, the sum total of God's and instructions and laws and guidelines which are supposed to ensure long life and prosperity in the land. That idea is found in a very important passage known as the Schema. This is a passage that's really a central expression of the love of God in Israel, and it's been singled out as an essential part of the Jewish liturgy at a very early, early stage and continues to this day. It's a so-called because of the first word of the passage. It's in Deuteronomy six it begins in verse four and the first word is here. Shema, hear, oh, Israel. Yeah. Hawaii is our God.

Speaker 1:          45:08          Yahweh alone. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might take to heart these instructions with which I charge you this day. Impress them upon your children. Recite them when you stay at home and when you are away, when you lie down, and when you get up, buying them as a sign on your hand and let them serve as a symbol on your forehead and scribe them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates. So love and loyalty is to, God is the foundation of the Tara. But Tara is the fulfillment of this love and loyalty, studying it and observing it and teaching it and transmitting it. Another key idea that occurs in Deuteronomy is the idea of Israel as the chosen people. This is what we've, we find it here for the first time.

Speaker 1:          45:49          Um, it's an expression of the particularity of Israel and its unique relationship with God and that uniqueness is expressed by this term [inaudible] which means to elect or to choose. This is the first time we encounter this. Yahweh has chosen Israel in an act of freely bestowed grace and love to be his special property. Deuteronomy 10 verse 14 Mark The heavens to their utter most reaches belong to the Lord, your God, the earth and all of that is on it. Yet it was to your fathers that the Lord was drawn in his love for them so that he chose you are lineal descendants from among all peoples as is now the case. This idea may be rooted in the ancient, near each in ancient near eastern political sphere in which sovereigns would single out vassals for the status of special property. In effect, the word used is a word we do find an exodus, but Deuteronomy contains statements of National Pride, um, national exaltation.

Speaker 1:          46:45          And unlike the priestly materials which portray holiness as a future goal to be attained through the observance of God's Torah, you shall be holy to me by doing the following things. Deuteronomy speaks of Israel as holy now and thus bound to the observance of God's Torah because of their holiness. You are a holy people to me. Therefore you should do so to put it, and this is perhaps to put it too crudely for p for the priestly source, holiness is a goal to be attained through obedience to God's Torah. For Deuteronomy, holiness is a status to be lost through disobedience to God's Torah. When we come back, I just want to finish up with one or two last comments about a couple of key ideas or themes. And before we move on to the beginning of the Deuteronomistic history that starts in Joshua, this coming week you'll be having, um, midterms as part of your section meeting. And in addition, at 6:00 PM tonight, I'll be making the essay question available online and if it gets to six oh one and there's nothing online, somebody called me real fast. Okay. All right, good. Thanks. Then good luck with the, with the exams.
