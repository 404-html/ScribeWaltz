Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm going to go ahead now and get started with some sixth century material, which really a prophetic literature which confronts the issues that were raised by the destruction that's the final destruction of Jerusalem. What was the meaning of this event and how could it be reconciled with the concept of Israel as God's elect? How could such tremendous evil and suffering be reconciled with the nature of God himself? This is going to be a a question that will return in the next lecture on when we look at the wisdom literature and the book of job and some other texts as well as we proceed through the rest of the course. In classical terms, if God is God, then he's not good. If all these terrible things happened and if God is good, then he mustn't be all powerful because he failed to prevent this evil. So that tends to be the dilemma.

Speaker 1:          00:47          The way it's phrased now, a Zico was a priest and he was deported in the first deportation. You already remember there was a deportation of exiles and five 97. And then the final siege and destruction and exile, deportation of exiles and five 87 is Nico was among the deportees of five 97. He was therefore in exile in Babylon during the final destruction and the fall of Jerusalem in five 87. But his priestly background in his priestly interests are clearly reflected in his prophecies. He accuses the Israelites of failing to observe cultic laws, ritual laws, uh, and his promises for the future. In his vision of a restoration, we'll see center around a new temple and a restored a Jerusalem and temple complex. There's a striking correspondence between his ego and, um, and the priestly sources in terms of language and theme, particularly h the holiness code.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Now, the prophecies in Ezekiel conveniently and unlike many of the other prophetic books actually follow a fairly chronological order. So the First Section of the book consists of prophecies that were before the final destruction between five 97, five 87. And then beginning in 33. It seems that we have prophecies that followed the destruction. We here, you know, he, he gets the report of the destruction and then we see how his tone and his message changes. So in those first 24 chapters where you have prophecies that are delivered in Babylon before the destruction, we have three chapters that are devoted to his call and his commission. As a prophet, we see his inaugural vision. I'll come back and talk about that in a minute as well as many other visions and symbols. Then you have from chapters four to 24 oracles that are condemning Judah and Israel.

Speaker 1:          02:30          There's some interesting elements within this. We have, um, the depiction of the coveted, which represents God. I'm departing, we'll talk about that text in a minute. We also have in chapter 18, a very interesting, uh, emphasis on individual responsibility for sin will come back and touch on that as well. Chapters 25 to 32 contain Oracle's against foreign nations just as we have in Jeremiah and Isaiah. Um, throughout, uh, is eco refers to these nations as the uncircumcised. The tone here is vengeful and, and very gloating. And these oracles have exerted a very strong influence. On the New Testament, particularly the book of revelation after five 87 um, Ezekiel prophesied and those prophecies are contained in the latter part of his book from chapter 33 to 48. So in 33 we hear of the fall of Jerusalem and then after that Oracle's of promise and hope for the future.

Speaker 1:          03:27          The last chapters from chapter 40 to 48 our visions is equals visions of the restoration, his vision of a rebuilt temple and to rebuilt Jerusalem. So the book opens with a narrative account of a z keels call and about five 93 or so in a Jewish community that's on the river Tebar, which is a large irrigation canal off of the Euphrates in Babylon. And this is the first time that we hear of a call of a profit outside the land of Israel. It's a remarkable vision, like many of the visions and the book of Ezekiel, it has a sort of see realistic, almost hallucinatory quality. The vision itself is very reminiscent of descriptions of by all the Canaanites Storm God. So there's a stormy wind and a huge cloud and a flashing fire. God is writing on a kind of throne, chariot. He's enthroned above four magnificent creatures.

Speaker 1:          04:18          Each of these has a human body and then four faces the face of a human in the face of Elian, the face of an ox and the face of an eagle. There are four huge wheels under this throne chariot. And they are said to gleam like barrel beneath a vast and awe inspiring expanse or dome which gleams like crystal. Above that is the semblance of a throne that is like Sapphire. And on the throne was the semblance of a human form or a gleaming like amber and its fire in cased in a, um, a frame which is radiant all about. So this Cavo, this cloud that contains or hides the fire that is Yahweh's presence. That is also the term that's used in the Torah in exodus and the priestly sources to describe the presence of God among his people. This fire that's encased in a cloud, the cuff vote in exodus 24, we read that this coveted had settled on Mount Sinai representing God's presence in exodus 40.

Speaker 1:          05:19          This cloud covers the tent of meeting. It fills the tabernacle. So many [inaudible] sees it now. He says that it was the appearance of the semblance of the presence of the Lord. When I be held it, I flung myself down on my face and I heard the voice of someone speaking. Notice this language. It was the assemblance of the appearance of the presence is CQO wants to emphasize the transcendent nature of the deity. Uh, he's having a vision of something which cannot in fact be seen or perceived, uh, which is a kind of paradox of all of his visions. The profits, humanity is emphasized in contrast to this transcendent divinity, right? And that's something that happens throughout his ego. He emphasizes his humanity with this phrase, son of man been a dumb son of man. It's simply as the Hebrew term for a mortal being as opposed to a divine being.

Speaker 1:          06:11          Son of man's simply means a human, a mortal Benedum dumb one who was like a dumb. Now the call of his Cqo is reminiscent of the call of Jeremiah and Isaiah. He is sent to a nation of rebels, rebels who will not be listening to him. And his commission is symbolized by a scroll that's handed to him. Um, and we hear on the end, at the end of chapter two that inscribed on this scroll are limitations and Durgin is and woes and he's commanded to eat of this scroll and then go to speak to the house of Israel. So he swallows his scroll and all of it's dreadful contents. It tastes to him as sweet as honey. And then his task is spelled out in chapter three. He is to be a watchmen one who gives warning of danger and people will either hate him or not, but each one of them is ultimately responsible for his or her own fate in a vision in chapter eight and Angel transports is EQL to Jerusalem and into the temple courts.

Speaker 1:          07:10          And there he sees and gives a very vivid description of the shocking abominations. Um, these are represented as justifying or explaining the destruction of the city and these, um, this do, these descriptions are characterized by more than the usual amount of prophetic hyperbole as he watches the slaughter and the destruction that's going on there is Zeke sees the cover vode that is the presence of Yat way arise from the temple and move to the east chapter 10. Then verses 18 and 19, the presence of the Lord left the platform of the house and stopped above the cherubs. And I saw the cherubs lift their wings and rise from the earth with the wheels beside them as they departed. And they stopped at the entrance of the eastern gate of the House of the Lord with the presence of the god of Israel above them. And then Chapter 11, verses 23 to 25 then the presence of the Lord ascended from the midst of the city and stood on the hill east of the city.

Speaker 1:          08:11          A spirit carried me away and brought me in a vision by the spirit of God to the exile community in cal Dhea. So now he's back to Babylon. And then the vision that I had seen left me and I told the exiles all the things that the Lord had shown me. So this image draws on ancient near eastern traditions of God's abandoning their, their cities and anger, leaving them to destruction by another God. The primary difference here is that God rather than another God is himself also bringing the destruction. Moreover, God doesn't retire to the heavens. He doesn't abandon his people. He doesn't remain behind with those left in Judah, but he moves into exile in the book of Ezekiel. Those left behind are guilty. God does stay with them. God moves east with the righteous exiles. Then at the end of the book of Ezekiel, um, we're going to see a vision of a restored temple.

Speaker 1:          09:05          This happens in Ezekiel 43 and here is [inaudible]. We'll see the coveted returning from the east and back to the temple and they are coming from the east with a roar like the roar of mighty waters was the presence of the god of Israel. And the earth was lit up by his presence. The presence of the Lord entered the temple by the gate that faced eastward and low. The presence of the Lord filled the temple. It was 43 verses one through six. So just as the presence of divine presence went eastward with the exile, so the exiles, so it will return with the reestablishment of Israel in her home. What is significant here is the idea that God is not linked to a particular place, but to a particular people. And the implication then is that God is with his people even when they are in exile.

Speaker 1:          09:53          So Ezekiel preached a message of doom and judgment like his prophetic predecessors and his contemporaries, but his condemnations tend to emphasize the people's idolatry and their moral impurity. And this of course, makes sense of his priestly heritage. His denunciations of Jerusalem are among the most lurid and violent that you'll find in the Bible. Again, these prophecies were likely delivered between the two deportations, between five 97 and then the final destruction and deportation, and five 87 five 86 and his ego warns that Jerusalem will fall, deservedly. He says that rebellion against Babylon would be treason against God. He employs all kinds of very vivid metaphors to describe Israel situation. Jerusalem, he says is [inaudible] sister, except even more vile. Jerusalem is a vine, but a wild one or I burned one. She produces nothing of use. Purity language, uh, is employed metaphorically throughout Ezekiel. Jerusalem has been utterly defiled and there are all sorts of images that inspire revulsion in these chapters.

Speaker 1:          10:58          So destruction is the only possible remedy. There are metaphors of sexual promiscuity throughout the book. Gods destruction of Israel is figured as the abuse doled out by an insanely jealous husband who is violent. And the images are disturbing. They're haunting, they're quite nightmarish. Ezekiel also engages in various, um, dramatic, um, signs, prophetic signs or actions to convey his message. It's something that we've seen in some of the other profits, but his are so bizarre and so extreme sometimes, uh, that he was accused of insanity. He cooks his food over a fire of human excrement as a symbol of the fact that those besieged by Nobel book nets, Netzer will be forced to eat unclean food. He doesn't. More. And when his wife dies in order to illustrate the fact that yeah, we will not mourn the loss of his temple, he binds himself in ropes.

Speaker 1:          11:49          He lies on his left side, 390 days to symbolize the hundred 90 years of exile of Israel. And then he lies on his right side for 40 days to symbolize the length of Judas captivity, which he says will be 40 years. Neither of these terms of captivity turn out to be correct, but finally he shaves his beard and his hair and he burns a third of it. He strikes a third of it with his sword and he scatters a third of it to the winds. He just keeps a few hairs bound up in his robe. And this is to symbolize the destruction of a third of the people by pestilence and famine, a third of the people by violence and the exile of a third to Babylon. A only a few will God allow to escape. And CQO makes it clear that those who ignore the warnings are doomed.

Speaker 1:          12:37          Those who he'd will be spared. And in this, he sounds the theme of individual responsibility that is so characteristic of Ezekiel. Want you to listen to the following passage and compare it to our think about other verses or terms in the Torah that you've studied that may relate to the same topic. How is he, uh, modifying those earlier ideas? This is all from chapter 18, various versus throughout. The word of the Lord came to me. What do you mean by quoting this proverb upon the soil of Israel, the parents eat sour grapes and their children's teeth are blunted as I live, declares the Lord God. This proverb shall no longer be current among you in Israel. Consider all lives are mine. The life of the parent and the life of the child are both mine. The person who sins only he shall die. A child shall not share the burden of a parent's guilt, nor shall a parent share the burden of a child's guilt.

Speaker 1:          13:32          The righteousness of the righteous shall be accounted to him alone, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be accounted to him alone. Moreover, if the wicked one repents of all the sins that he committed and keeps all my laws and does what is Justin Wright, he shall live. I shall not die. Is it my desire that a wicked person shall die, says the Lord God? It is rather that he shall turn back from his ways and live so to if a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and does wrong practicing the very abominations that the wicked person practice shall he live. None of the righteous deeds that he did shall be remembered because of his treachery he has practiced and the sins he has committed because of these, he shall die. Be assured o house of Israel. I will judge each one of you according to his ways, declares the Lord God.

Speaker 1:          14:18          Repent and turn back from all your transgressions. Let them not be a stumbling block of guilt for you. Cast away all the transgressions by which you have offended and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit that you may not die. O House of Israel for it is not my desire that anyone shall die, declares the Lord God. Repent. Therefore and live, it's an important Torah idea that is EQL is rejecting or contradicting here. And that's the Torah principle of collective or even intergenerational punishment. It's found most famously in the second commandment, the declaration that God punish his children for the sins of their fathers under the fourth generation. Now we need to note that we're talking about divine justice here and not human justice. As we saw in our study of Biblical law in the sphere of human justice only the guilty or punished in Israelite law, um, you don't have, um, uh, you know, literal punishment.

Speaker 1:          15:12          Someone kills someone's son, then their son is put to death. That idea is rejected in biblical law, but God operates according to a different principal, a principal of collective responsibility. And that principle is understood in the early sources quite positively, that the sins of the fathers are visited, visited upon the children is an expression of God's mercy. Exodus 34 verses six and seven describes God as merciful and Gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness and that and thus tolerating sin, though not completely clearing the guilty as a mercy. He spreads out the punishment over three or four generations. Right? So this notion is tied up with the aspect of God's mercy. But evidently there are some who found this idea, unjust and other biblical passages try to bring a different sense of justice to this picture. And they emphasize that the third and fourth generations themselves must be wicked.

Speaker 1:          16:08          Um, that seems to be the case in exodus 20 verse five, the Book of chronicles, which is a rewrite of the historical material, the historical narrative in the book of Kings, rewrites that material in a manner that never explains a catastrophe on the basis of guilt incurred by someone other than the one experiencing the catastrophe. In other words, it rejects the Deuteronomistic historians device of delayed punishment, which you already remember, we discussed. It changes the narrative account so that no one suffers for a crime committed by someone else. It isn't the sin of an earlier generation that's finally visited upon, you know, a grandson or a king of a later generation. So it seems that after five 86 or certainly in [inaudible] case, uh, some accepted the idea that the nation was suffering because of the accumulated guilt of previous generations, notably the deuteronomist, but for others like is [inaudible] the idea of accumulated guilt and intergenerational punishment seemed to lose some of its explanatory power perhaps because the, the destruction and the exile seem to devastating least severe punishments that didn't fit the individual crimes.

Speaker 1:          17:23          So as [inaudible] is one who rejects the doctrine of collective responsibility in the operation of divine justice in chapter 18, he responds to the idea of suffering for the sins of one's ancestors by declaring that God isn't going to work that way anymore, God will no longer punish people. Collectively, each one will be judged individually only this center will be punished and that's a major departure from exodus 34 and even from the contemporaneous Deuteronomistic view. And at this point I think we would do well to remind ourselves of the nature of the biblical text. And they, in the opening lecture I asked you to set aside certain presuppositions about the biblical text. One of them is that it is a uniform or unified text with a single doctrine or theology. I asked you to remember that the Bible isn't a book, it's a library. It's a library of works that originate in vastly different historical periods, vastly different historical situations and responds to a variety of shifting needs and events and reflects a range of perceptions about God and his relation to creation and to Israel.

Speaker 1:          18:31          It isn't a book of theology that is to say rational argumentation in supportive certain doctrines about God. And it most certainly doesn't speak with a single voice on points of theology or matters that are of traditional concern to the discipline of theology. Doctrine isn't it's concern, understanding and making sense of the historical odyssey of the nation, of Israel in covenant with God. That is its concern. And so we're going to find many different interpretations of the meaning of that history and the nature of that God and the meaning of that covenant. And certainly there are some basic points of agreement, but even some of the most basic points of agreement do not pass without some contest station. So, for example, the basic point that humans are free moral agents. This seems to be clearly assumed throughout most of the books of this little library, but there are some isolated episodes that would appear to contradict even that most basic assumption.

Speaker 1:          19:30          God Hardens Pharaoh's heart, God's seals, the people's ears sometimes so that they will not hear the message of the profits or will not understand them until a later day. To be sure there are only a few of these contradictory passages, but they do exist. And so here we find also a major shift in the exotic period away from the tendency to see divine justice working through collective or intergenerational punishment to the idea of the individual, the individual's culpability before God. I shouldn't say a shift away. We see a rising a dialectic, right? This isn't a linear progression. These are different ideas coming out at different times and receiving emphasis at different times. But this kind of polyphony then didn't impinge upon the authority of the Hebrew Bible for the nation of Israel because the Bible's authority doesn't arrive from some suppose it consistency or universal quality. That's a modern notion.

Speaker 1:          20:26          And it's based on Hellenistic ideals of truth as singular western culture influenced by Greek philosophical traditions defines truth, truth in monistic terms only that which contains no contradiction is true. And only that which is true is authoritative. Those notions are somewhat alien to the ancient non hellenized world. The Bible doesn't strive to present philosophical truth. It presents the best efforts of sages and profits and scribes and visionaries to respond to and to explain the crises of the nation over a period of centuries. And it's authority derives from the explanatory power of its insights into and understanding of God's governance of the world and his plans for Israel. So those insights and those understandings may shift and even stand in contradiction with one another, but they're not mutually exclusive and they're contradictions don't affect their authority, their ability to explain, to console their ability to nourish the faith of a people, convinced that God would never desert them, no matter how difficult it may be to understand his interactions with them back to a Zico.

Speaker 1:          21:40          Now. And in chapter 33, we learned that a fugitive from Jerusalem brings news of the fall of Jerusalem. So it's a about five 80, 75, 86 and when he hears this is the Keel exchanges, his message of doom for a message of hope before the fall of the city, his task had been to shatter the people's illusions. You wanted to shake them out of their complacency, but now reduced to despair. Um, and remorse. The people are reduced to despair and remorse. And his task is to offer reassurance and hope God is going to initiate a new beginning. Though Israel's punishment was deserved. It was not according to his own [inaudible], a sign of the end of the relationship between you halfway and his people. And a new Israel would rise from the remnant of Judah and Israel. And he expresses this restoration by means of many metaphors and visions.

Speaker 1:          22:40          So chapter 34 condemns the shepherds. This is a very common ancient near eastern metaphor for the leadership of the people at King is always a shepherd and so on. So chapter 34 condemns the shepherds of the people and promise this, this promises to set up in the future, one shepherd of the house of David to be prince among the people. Chapter 36 uses metaphors of purity and cleansing. Israel will be cleansed from the impurities of the past. She'll be given a new covenant of the heart. This is verses 24 and 25 and chapter 36 I will take you from among the nations and gather you from all the countries and I will bring you back to your own land and I will sprinkle clean water upon you, right pure water upon you and you shall be clean, pure. I will cleanse you from all your uncleanness and from all your fetishes and I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit into you.

Speaker 1:          23:32          I will remove the heart of stone from your body and give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit into you. Thus I will cause you to follow my laws and faithfully to observe my rules. Those echoes here of Jeremiah also. And then you shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers and you shall be my people and I will be your God. So we have again, this almost utopian, a redesign of human nature that we heard in Jeremiah. One in which the problems that are associated with the exercise of free will maybe obviated. Another metaphor that's used for the restoration of a new Israel out of the remnant of the old, um, is the metaphor of revival from death. And this is found in chapter 37 very, very famous passage is equals vision of the valley of dry bones.

Speaker 1:          24:22          The hand of the Lord came upon me. He took me out by the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the valley and it was full of bones. He led me all around them. There were very many of them spread over the valley and they were very dry. And he said to me, Oh, mortal, can these bones live again? Have you applied? Oh Lord God only, you know, very diplomatic answer. And he said to me, prophesy over these bones and say to them, oh, dry bones. Hear the word of the Lord and thus said, the Lord God to these bones, I will cause breath to enter you and you shall live again. I will lay sinews upon you and cover you with flesh and formed skin over you and I will put breath into you and you shall live again and you shall know that I am the Lord.

Speaker 1:          25:00          I prophesied as I had been commanded. And while I was prophesying, suddenly there was a sound of rattling and the bones came together, bone to matching bone. I looked and there were sinews on them and flesh had grown and skin and formed over them. The breath entered them and they came to life and stood up on their feet, a vast multitude. And he said to me, oh, mortal, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say, our bones are dried up, our house is gone. We are doomed. Prophesied therefore, and say to them, thus said the Lord God, I am going to open your graves and lift you out of the graves of my people and bring you to the land of Israel. You shall know my people, that I am the Lord. When I have opened your graves and lifted you out of your graves, I will put my breath into you and you shall live again and I will set you upon your own soil.

Speaker 1:          25:44          Then you shall know that I, the Lord have spoken and have acted, declares the Lord. So in the interpretation that follows the vision, we're told that the bones symbolize Israel. Now in this state, in exile, in their despair, they're crying, our bones are dried up, were dead, our hope is lost and God promises to raise Israel from the grave, which is the metaphor for exile and restore her to her own land as one people north and south with one prince to rule over her. This text is often been decontextualized and cited as a, as a old testament or Hebrew Bible source for the doctrine of literal resurrection after death as if it's speaking about literal resurrection. But I think in its context it's, it's quite clear that it is one of many metaphors that is equal uses throughout this section for the redemption of the egg of the community from exile, the restoration of the people back in their own land at the center of the restored community that is Eko.

Speaker 1:          26:40          Envisions is a new Jerusalem at at its center is a rebuilt temple and it's described in great detail in the last nine chapters of the book is he kills Utopian Vision. The land is equally allotted. It's divided up in equally a lot of among all 12 tribes now who will be brought back and Jerusalem lies in the center with 12 get great gates, one for each tribe surrounding it. Um, it's the, uh, this temple is the source of a never ending river that gushes forth from it. A river that will make the Dead Sea flow with freshwater again, uh, is the Keel, sees Satta kite priests presiding in the temple. They are assisted by [inaudible] who are just meals or sort of demoted in his vision and he insists no foreigners will be permitted entry. And we're going to see that that's a view that wasn't shared by others in the post destruction era.

Speaker 1:          27:33          While [inaudible] believed that God would restore a purified Israel to its land under a Davidic monarchy and he prophesied to this effect, he like Jeremiah also maintained that our relationship with God was possible. In the meantime, a relationship outside the chosen land and the Jewish diaspora, right diaspora refers to a community living outside of its home land. The Jewish diaspora was a new thing. It was a religious, national body of a type that had not been seen before. You had a people remaining loyal to their god while in exile from their own land and what was believed to be that God's land without worshiping him cultic Lee or by means of sacrifice. Remember, the only legitimate site for an alter or for sacrifice to God is Jerusalem and in time slowly a new worship will be fashioned one without sacrifice. One that consists of prayer and confession and fasts and other kinds of ritual observances.

Speaker 1:          28:38          Three times a day Jews will pray and they'll pray in the direction of Jerusalem. Worship in synagogues eventually will come into being. And the importance of the Sabbath will grow the sabbath as a memorial of the covenant and a symbol of Jewish faith. And so you also find beginning shortly after this period for the first time, non Jews are joining themselves too. Yeah, way adopting this religion of Israel out of religious conviction. Not simply because they may be residing in the land and have to follow the God's laws. This is outside the land. You have people choosing to opt into this community. So again, we see that as the history of the nation of Israel came to an end, the history of Judaism and religion, Judaism begins. So in a Cqo we've seen um, one response to the national disaster and the exile. The idea that while suffering and punishment are fully deserved, a relationship with God remains possible.

Speaker 1:          29:35          God is with his people. Even in exile. A second response to the destruction and exile can be found in the anonymous writings that are appended to the book of Isaiah mentioned these writings briefly. We'll be able to look now at what's been called second. Does Isaiah. So there are two discrete units of material that are appended to Isaiah. Chapters 40 to 55 or referred to a second Isaiah. And, uh, chapters 56 to 66 are referred to us. Third Isaiah. And these chapters differ from Isaiah proper in the eighth century prophet. Uh, in several ways, it's clear first of all that, um, these parts of Isaiah were written after the, um, after the exile to a large parts of Isaiah. Third, Isaiah were written after the exile. All of Second Isaiah and Isaiah proper was clearly written in the eighth century on, into the early seventh century.

Speaker 1:          30:30          Um, Jerusalem is referred to as destroyed. The audience that's addressed is living in exile. Babylon is the oppressor, not Assyria. Assyria was the oppressor and the time of Isaiah proper. So the upended materials, uh, even seem to know of the overthrow of the Babylonians. That's going to happen in about five 39 when Cyrus of Persia will destroy a will, will conquer the Babylonians. Um, we have passages that express some euphoria over this. Um, because Cyrus of course authorized the Jews to return from Babylon to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple. There are also all kinds of stylistic differences between first, Isaiah and second and third Isaiah. Um, second and third. Isaiah for example, I have no biographical data and first Isaiah has quite a bit, these materials also have a different theology of history, different understanding of history at different attitude towards foreign nations and a very strong and renewed emphasis on monotheism.

Speaker 1:          31:28          And these also market as different, um, in the, among the scrolls that were found in the caves of Qumran near the Dead Sea. Uh, we have a very large and very famous Isaiah Scroll, which is now in a museum in Jerusalem. And on the scroll there's a gap after Isaiah 39 and a new column starts with Isaiah 40. So it seems to signal some sort of implicit recognition that there's a difference between these two sections. They are not the same. They're not the same units, not the same author perhaps. So we're going to talk right now about second Isaiah because this is a holy post destruction work. The opening or inaugural oracle that happens in, in that occurs in chapter 40 is an oracle of constellation. It's an oracle of comfort and the profits sees a straight and level highway prepared in the wilderness for a dramatic procession of Yak way.

Speaker 1:          32:18          The shepherd who will lead his people back to Jerusalem, very, very famous, made very famous by Handel's Messiah actually. So chapter 40 taking from various verses in this chapter, Comfort, Oh, comfort my people, says your God, speak tenderly to Jerusalem and declare to her that her term of services over that her iniquity is expiated for she has received at the hand of the Lord double for all her sins of voice rings out clear in the desert, a road for the Lord level in the wilderness, a highway for our God. Let every valley be raised. Every hill and mount made low. Let the rugged ground become level and the ridges become a plane. The presence of the Lord shall appear and all flesh as one shall behold, for the Lord himself has spoken. A voice rings out, proclaim another asks, what shall I proclaim? All flesh is grass, all its goodness like flowers of the field.

Speaker 1:          33:11          But the word of our God is always fulfilled. Behold the Lord God comes in, might like a shepherd. He pastors his flock, he gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them in his bosom gently. He drives the mother sheep. So this highway will appear leading the exiles straight to Jerusalem. All of the topography will be flattened and God will lead them as a shepherd leads the lamb. Why? Because the word of the Lord is always fulfilled. So what this voice is proclaiming is a literal return from exile. God's opening a highway. He's leading his flock home like a shepherd in a new exodus. And this is an idea that's so important that it recurs at the end of the unit as well. In chapter 55 the idea of a new exodus, a second key theme that sounded at the beginning and end of the unit again.

Speaker 1:          33:59          So it happens in chapter 40 and again in chapter 55 is this idea that the word of our God is always fulfilled or in some translations, the word of our God stands forever. This idea is the essence of the Israelites hope during the period of captivity and exile and it appears in the first oracle. It's beautifully restated in the last Oracle and chapter 55 verses 10 through 12 for as the rain or snow drops from heaven and returns not there but soaks the earth and makes it bring forth vegetation, yielding seed for sowing and bred for eating. So is the word that issues from my mouth, it doesn't come back to me unfulfilled but performs what I propose achieves what I sent it to do. The AAU shall leave and joy and be led home secure before you mount and Hill shall shout aloud and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. So the everlasting word of the Lord, it's guaranteed fulfillment specifically to bring his people home in a new exodus. These are ideas, they form an envelope or an inclusio, that kind of literary structure where something has mentioned at the beginning and again at the end to form an inclusio or an envelope around the entire unit of Second Isaiah.

Speaker 1:          35:16          We see awesome in second Isaiah and extreme monotheism. The monotheism is explicit of course in Isaiah, implicit, I'm sorry, implicit in Isaiah, but it becomes quite explicit. And Second Isaiah, um, as we've seen, uh, to come to terms with the destruction of five 87 entails the acceptance of the idea that Israel is punishment was deserved and that, yeah, he controls, um, and you always control of history means he controls not only Israel, but all other nations as well and can use them for his purpose, including punishing Israel. There's no power other than Yaffe way. So referring then to the rise and fall of nations, um, Isaiah 41 verse four states who has wrought and achieved this, he who announced the generations from the start. I The Lord who was first and we'll be with the last as well. The first and the last, which is a way of saying everything right, all inclusive.

Speaker 1:          36:12          There is nothing but me and Isaiah 44 satirizes those nations who make and worship idols and ridicules the folly and stupidity of ascribing divinity to that which one has created with one's own hands. And Isaiah 41 God's states, his case against these vane and useless idols. He summons them to answer for themselves, show that they are gods by announcing something that will occur, announcing what will occur and seeing if it comes true. Chapter 41 2124 let them approach and tell us what will happen. Tell us what has occurred and we will take note of it or announced to us what will occur and we may know the outcome foretell what is yet to happen that we may know that you are gods. Do anything good or bad that we need maybe odd and see why you are less than nothing. Your effect is less than t one who chooses you is an abomination.

Speaker 1:          37:08          But this is only half the picture because not only are the gods of the nations, no gods, but yeah, white is the true God of all of these other nations. So who raised Cyrus of Persia from the north to sweep through the ancient near east and conquer the Babylonians? No one but yeah way. Isaiah 41 I have roused him from the north and he has come and he has trampled rulers like mud, like a potter treading clay. The things once predicted to Zion behold, here they are. So in these passages, the author of second Isaiah is drawing a the logical conclusion perhaps towards which Israelite religion has tended from its inception Yaffe way once the Canaanites Deity, then the God of Israel's Patriarchs, then the national God of Israel is here, the Lord of universal history, the only real God, second Isaiah is claiming is the god of Israel. Second Isaiah is also a quite well known for the servant songs that it contains the famous servant songs.

Speaker 1:          38:07          These occur, I'm scattered. And in chapter 42 chapter 49 chapter 50 and then most extensively 52 13 to 53 12 so much of 52 and 53 the identity of this sermon, I'll read some of these passages in a minute, but it refers to this servant God, God's servant, and the identity of the servant has been a puzzle to biblical interpreters for centuries. Sometimes the servant is referred to as a collective figure. Sometimes servant is referred to as an individual figure. And Chapter 49 the servant is referred to or described as a prophet with a universal message rather than a message for the Israelites alone. But then there's some ambiguity here. The Servant is first identified or the profit, the servant or profit is first identified as Israel, herself. So in chapter 49 verses one to three the Lord appointed me before I was born. He named me while I was in my mother's womb.

Speaker 1:          39:06          He made my mouth like a sharpened blade. He hit me in the shadow of his hand and he made me like a polished arrow. He concealed me in his quiver and he said to me, you are my servant Israel in whom I glory, and yet in verse five it would seem that this profit servant has a mission to Israel to bring her back to Yahweh and that would imply that the servant or profit is not Israel. Verse Five and now the Lord has resolved he who formed me in the womb to be his servant, to bring back Jacob to himself, that Israel may be restored to him. Right then the mission has expanded a little bit in verse six for he has said it is too little that you should be my servant. In that I raise up the tribes of Jacob and restore the survivors of Israel.

Speaker 1:          39:53          I will also make you a light unto the nations that my salvation may reach the ends of the earth. Chapter 50 quite famously refers to the servant as rebellious and as persecuted. Verse six I offered my back to the floggers and my cheeks to those who tore out my hair. I did not hide my face from insult and spittle, but it's the famous and difficult passage in Isaiah 53 that most movingly describes the suffering and sorrow of God's servant. 53 verses three to 11 he was despised. We held him, have no account, yet it was our sickness that he was bearing our suffering that he endured. We accounted him, played, smitten and afflicted by God, but he was wounded because of our sins crushed because of our iniquities. He bore the chastisement that made us whole and by his bruises we are healed. We all went astray like sheep, each going his own way, and the Lord visited upon him the guilt of all of us.

Speaker 1:          40:56          He was maltreated, yet he was submissive. He did not open his mouth like a sheep being led to slaughter like a you dumb before those who she or her, he did not open his mouth and his grave was said among the wicked and with the rich. In his death, though he had done no injustice and had spoken no false hood, but the Lord chose to crush him by disease. That if he made himself an offering for guilt, he might see offspring and have long life and that through him the Lord's purpose might prosper. There've been many attempts to equate this man of sorrows with all kinds of figures. Early on, Jesus's followers saw Jesus as a suffering servant of God. In Isaiah, the new testament writers specifically borrowed passages from Isaiah, particularly this chapter, chapter 33 when constructing their narratives of Jesus, taking those verses and using them in describing his story.

Speaker 1:          41:52          So he is depicted as the innocent and righteous servant who suffered for the sins of others. In the teachings of Paul. However, you have a different use of these versus Christians generally are identified as a servant who suffers with and for Jesus. Despite these later theological interpretations, the anonymous writer of Second Isaiah wasn't writing about a remote and as Urbi and teacher and charismatic healer who would live more than five centuries later examined in its original context, it appears most likely that the servant is Israel. Herself described metaphorically as an individual who's present suffering and humiliation is due to the sins of other nations, but whose future restoration and exaltation will cause astonishment among those nations who will then be humbled to halfway. But there are problems with even this interpretation and you should be aware of that this has never been solved satisfactorily. The main problem with interpreting Israel as the servant, uh, is the verse that describes the servant as having a mission to Israel.

Speaker 1:          42:57          It seems a little odd to say that Israel Bayer is a mission to Israel, but this problem can be solved if we remember that Israel was often divided and prophetic rhetoric. So perhaps the writer envisions emission of one part, the right shit, the righteous part to the other, the part that has gone astray. Leaving aside this difficulty, the more prominent Motif in the servant Song of Isaiah is that the servant has a mission to the world. That's the more prominent motif and that is a role that would suit Israel quite well for the, furthermore, you have the phrase Israel, my servant appearing in Second Isaiah about eight times. So the idea of Israel as God's servant to the nations is clearly a part of Isaiah's conceptual world. And since we're dealing with poetry rather than a rigorously consistent metaphysical treatise, uh, it shouldn't be too surprising that sometimes a servant is spoken of as a group collectively, sometimes as an individual.

Speaker 1:          43:55          The same holds true of Israel in general, by the way, throughout much of the literature, sometimes Israel is spoken of in plural terms and sometimes as a single individual. So in its original context, it's likely that the servant refers to Israel herself. If the servant is Israel, then we can see how second Isaiah is another response to the events of five 87 and it's ultimately a positive interpretation of positive response. The punishment that Israel suffered even if excessive. Remember Isaiah 40 claims that Israel has suffered double for her sins, right? So it's been an excessive punishment, but that punishment isn't meaningless. It will lead to redemption. Israel will be healed by her wounds. God's Word Will Not Return unfulfilled. And in addition, suffering leads to a new role for Israel among the nations. Second, Isaiah expresses a new self awareness that is taking hold in the exile Israel saw itself as the faithful servant of Yahweh way a servant whose loyalty to God in this dark time would serve to broadcast the knowledge of God throughout the nations.

Speaker 1:          45:03          So Israel was chosen from the womb to serve God's universal purpose. Israel suffered unobserved by others, but eventually this would make possible the recognition of God by those others. When once God, where once God covenanted with David to lead his people Israel, he now covenants with Israel to lead the nations of the world in God's way. It's an expansion of God's purpose. And this is an idea that appears in Isaiah 55 verses three to five incline your ear and come to me Harkin, and you shall be revived and I will make with you an everlasting covenant. The undoing loyalty promise to David at the Covenant and loyalty that was promised to David. I'm now transferring to you as I made him a leader of peoples, a prince and commander of peoples. So you shall summon a nation who you did not know and a nation that did not know you shall come running to you for the sake of the Lord, your God, the holy one of Israel who has glorified you.

Speaker 1:          46:04          So God makes an eternal covenant with Israel like that he wants concluded with David and the function of the institutions of the old order are transferred to the nation as a whole. What kings and priests and prophets did for Israel, Israel will now do for the whole world as the mediator between the only God and the nations of the world. She is a light unto them and all will ascend to her because from her we'll come Torah instruction in the divine will and salvation. This is the idea of universal mission that comes out of Second Isaiah. When we come back on Wednesday, we're going to take a look at what I think is probably the single most profound book in the Hebrew Bible, the book of Job, and again, I'll remind you that final paper information will be available on the classes server tonight. I want you to have it in time to be able to ask questions of your TF for myself about the assignment. It's pretty detailed, so sit and read through it carefully. Be there later tonight.
