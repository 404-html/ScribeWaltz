Speaker 1:          00:00          So we were talking last time about the Deuteronomistic historian and their interpretation of the events that befell Israel, a very special interpretation that would make it possible for Israel to remain intact after the destruction of the state, the temple in the national basis of, of their society. And according to the Deuteronomist, it's the sin of idolatry, specifically the sin of idolatry and particularly the idolatry of the king for which the nation is punished with exile and destruction. Punishments come for other sorts of sins, but the national punishment of exile and destruction follows upon the idolatry and particularly the idolatry of the king. So in the book of Second Kings, a king who permits sacrifice only at the Jerusalem temple is praise, no matter what other faults he may or may not have. Um, and one who does not is condemned no matter what other accomplishments he may have to his credit.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Now, the Deuteronomistic historian is aware that the historical record doesn't lend itself very easily to this kind of interpretation because there are some good kings who reigned very briefly and there are some very bad kings on their view who reigned for a very long time. And now she has a case in point. He reigned for over 50 years and is viewed as the most wicked of all kings. Sometimes disaster would strike right after the rule of the king that the deuteronomist would view as a good king because of their faithfulness to way. And sometimes, uh, uh, it, it would not strike after the rule of a, of a king that was viewed to be very wicked. So the Deuteronomistic sounds the theme of delayed punishment, delayed punishment, deferred punishment. So for example, Solomon's misdeeds in allowing the building of altars for the worship of foreign gods to please his, his many wives is foreign wives is blamed for the division of the kingdoms, but the punishment was deferred until after his death and the time of his sons.

Speaker 1:          01:52          And then you have the split between north and south with Jeroboam and Rehoboam, um, raining respectively in the north and south. The deuteronomist sees Israel's defeat at the hands of the Assyrians in seven 22 as deferred or delayed punishment for the sins of Jeroboam. The first Jeroboam, the first nine 22 or so, came to the throne and installed to cultic centers at Dan and Bethel erecting golden calves. Uh, this is seen as a sin for which the nation was punished 200 years later. As for the southern Kingdom of Judah, he had some good kings in the view of the deuteronomist in the south has a Kia. He's judged to be a good king. He instituted sweeping reforms and got rid of idolatrous altars and manage to maintain Judas independence against the Assyrians. But his son, Manasseh, who reigned for a large part of the seventh century is viewed as extraordinarily wicked.

Speaker 1:          02:44          He turned the Jerusalem temple into a, um, a pagan temple and, uh, it was a time of, of, uh, great misery for those who are loyal to, to Yaffe way time of great terror. And yet he reigned a long time. His eight year old grandson, Josiah, uh, came to the throne in a, upon his death sometime probably in the six thirties. And the Deuteronomistic views Josiah as a good king. We've already heard about the story which is reported in second kings chapter 22 of the refurbishing of the temple, which happens when he's about 25 or 26 years old, discovers a book of the law, reads it, and is distressed because it's terms are not being fulfilled. And so Josiah orders the abolition of outlying altars and Pagan Colts. He brings all of the priests to Jerusalem and centralizes all worship there in Jerusalem. Uh, so in the deuteronomist view, Josiah is believed to be very good king for purging the country of these idolatrous rights and centralizing worship.

Speaker 1:          03:43          But the thin of Monash IA was too great and it had to be punished. So I profit tests a profit tests named Holda tells desire that God plans to bring evil punishment on Judah for it, for these sins. But it will be after Josiah is lifetime as, as something of a mercy to him. And in fact, it's in the next generation that Judah falls in five 86, the walls of Jerusalem are breached and the temple is destroyed and the king at that time, King Zedekiah is blinded and, uh, taken in chains into exile with his court and only the poor are left behind. This is the deuteronomist attempt to account for these anomalies within their Historia sophic view, right? And the result of the Deuteronomistic interpretation was remarkable because if the defeat of the nation where to be seen as the defeat of the nations, God by the God of the conquering nation, then the Israelites would have turned from the worship of their god, Yahweh, and embraced the new ascendent God Marduk.

Speaker 1:          04:48          And undoubtedly there were Israelites who did do this, right? That would have been the argument of history in their view, but not all did for some defeat, did not lead to despair or apostasy because it could be explained by the likes of the Deuteronomistic, a historian or the Deuteronomistic school as fitting into the monotheistic scheme, right? This did not impugn God's kingship or Lordship over the universe. It was proof of it. God was punishing Israel for the sin of idolatry, which was in violation of his covenant and to punish Israel. He had raised the Babylonians. They were merely his tool. The historiography of the Deuteronomistic historian finds its classic expression in second kings chapter 17. Um, I'm going to skim through sections of it so you can see the argument that's laid out there. In the ninth year of Jose, the king of Assyria captured some area, the capital of the northern kingdom.

Speaker 1:          05:43          He deported the Israelites, the Israelites to Syria and settled them in various places. And this happened because the Israelites sinned against the Lord, their God who had freed them from the land of Egypt, from the hand of Pharaoh, King of Egypt. They worshiped other gods, followed the customs which the kings of Israel had practiced, putting again, the blame and the kings as the, as the head of this idolatry, the Israelites committed against the Lord their God acts which were not right. They built for themselves shrines and all their settlements from watchtowers to fortified cities. They set up pillars and sacred posts for themselves on every lofty hill and under every leafy tree, and they offered sacrifices there at all the shrines like the nation's whom the Lord had driven into exile before them. So now he's going to follow through since they behave the same way to drive them into exile.

Speaker 1:          06:27          Also, they committed wicked acts to vex the Lord and they worshiped fetishes concerning which the Lord had said to them, you must not do this thing. The Lord warned Israel and Judah by every profit in every sear. So God didn't just stand by idly. He was constantly sending profits, messengers to tell them to turn back to the covenant and we'll start talking about those profits today. He sent warnings by every prophet and every senior are saying, turn back from your wicked ways and observe my commandments and my laws according to all the teaching that I commanded your fathers and that I transmitted to you through my servants, the prophets. But they didn't obey. They stiffen their neck. It's like their fathers who did not have faith in the Lord their God. They spurned his laws and the covenant that he had made with their fathers and the warnings he had given them.

Speaker 1:          07:09          They went after delusion and we're diluted. They made Moulton idols for themselves. Two calves, the specifically now the sin of, of Jeroboam at Dan and Bethel, two calves, and they made a sacred post and they bowed down to all the hosts of heaven and they worshiped by aisle. We'll hear more about that today. They can sign their sons and daughters to the fire. They practiced augury and divination and gave themselves over to what was displeasing to the Lord and Vex Tim. The Lord was incensed it Israel, and he banished them from his presence. None was left with the tribe of Judah alone, but nor did Judah keep the commandments of the Lord their God. They followed the customs that Israel had practiced, so the Lord spurned all the offspring of Israel and he afflicted them and delivered them into the hands of plunderers and finally he cast them out from his presence.

Speaker 1:          07:53          It's a very depressing ending of things that started so auspiciously back in genesis one. But if the Deuteronomy, this laid the blame for the tragic history of the two kingdoms at the door of the sin of idolatry, in particularly the idolatry of the royal house, a different answer will be provided by Israel's classical profits. No less than answer, no lesson interpretation and the lesson interpretation that was intended to shore up faith in this God that one might think had abandoned his people. And we'll be turning to the prophetic answer to this, to this great crisis that face the Israelites. In the next lecture in this lecture, I first want to talk about the phenomenon of prophecy and some of the profits who appear in the historical narrative. So in the historical books that we've been looking at of the section of the Bible, we call the former prophets.

Speaker 1:          08:39          Remember this section called the profits. We divide into former prophets ladder profits. The section we call former profits as a historical narrative. It runs from Joshua through second kings. It reads like a narrative. And in that material, you have several prophets who appear and they play a very role in the national drama, the profits of the 10th century, the Ninth Century BCE. We're associated with religious shrines. On occasion they were associated with the royal court. But starting in about the eighth century, you have profits whose words were eventually sat down and writing, and they come to be in the books that now bear the names of the profits to whom they are attributed. Um, so these profits, the ones whose words get recorded in books that bear their name, these profits we call the literary profits or the classical prophets in contrast to the prophets who are characters in the stories that we read from Genesis through second kings, right?

Speaker 1:          09:38          So there are two kinds of profits. Um, the literary profits, those books are collected together. In the section we call the latter prophets. I hope this is making sense. So former profits is the historical narrative which happens to feature king's and profits as characters in the narrative, the latter profits. Those are the books of Prophetic oracles that bear the name of the person who gave the utterance or the Oracle. Okay. And as I just said, the literary profits just like the deuteronomist struggle to make sense of Israel suffering and defeat and to come up with an explanation and a message of constellation and we will get to that next time. Today we'll look at the phenomenon of prophecy in ancient Israel by comparing or examining narratives in Samuel and kings, particularly narratives that feature profits and that will provide very important background for the next lecture when we turn to the books of the literary or classical prophets and the themes of that literature.

Speaker 1:          10:37          Now prophecy is very widespread in the ancient near east. It took different forms in different societies, but ultimately very widespread. We know of ecstatic profits from second Millennium Bce, texts in Mesopotamia. Um, seventh century is Syria also have ecstatic profits. Their primary focus was on, um, delivering oracles for kings. Usually favorable was always wise to give a favorable oracle to your king. Um, and we have ecstatic prophecy in the Bible also among the earliest profits. In particular, the term ecstasy when it's used in this context refers to the state of being overcome with such powerful emotions. That reason seems to be suspended. Self control is suspended. What we might think of as, you know, normative behavior, these things, normal behavior, these are suspended. Ecstatics would employ music and dance. They would, um, they would induce a sort of emotional seizure or a frenzy and they would often be left riving and raving.

Speaker 1:          11:44          And the Bible attributes this kind of ecstatic state to the spirit of the Lord. The spirit of Galloway which falls upon a profit or Russia's upon a prophet comes upon a profit and transforms him then into some sort of carrier or instrument of the divine will or the divine message. We'll see that we have bizarre behavior among many of the profits. We even have bizarre behavior among many of the later literary profits. Um, Zko for example, we'll engage in all kinds of unusual, outrageous, dramatic behavior as a vehicle for the communication of his message. And I think this is the heritage of the ecstatic prophecy that was so much a part of ancient near east and prophecy. But not all. Biblical prophecy has this ecstatic character. The Hebrew word for profit is a Navi. And then the word [inaudible] seems to mean one who is called, or perhaps one who announces that's important because it signals to us that a prophet is someone who is called to proclaim a message, to announce something called by God to carry a message.

Speaker 1:          12:48          And so in the Bible we have this phenomenon of what we call epistolic prophecy. And Apostle is merely a messenger. The word apostle means messenger one sent with a message. So at Apostolic Prophecy, this refers to messenger profits. They are called by God and charged with a mission. They can even be elected against their will. They must bring the word of God to the world. This is very different from profits who are consulted by a client, right? And given a fee to divine something, this is different. This is the deity. Now charging a profit with a message, uh, to, to a people. So these epistolic profits are represented in the Bible as the instrument of God's desire to reveal himself and to reveal his will to his people. And many scholars have noted that in a way. Um, Moses is really the first in a long line of apostolic prophets in the Bible.

Speaker 1:          13:43          And in some ways his call and his response, our parodic matic for some of these later classical prophets, in many of the literary profits you will read, they will contain some account of their call, you know, have this sudden dramatic encounter with God. Usually the call consists of certain, um, uh, standard, uh, stages. You first have this unexpected encounter with God, maybe a vision of some kind or a voice, um, that issues in a summons or a calling. And then you have the reluctance of the individual. And that was also paradigmatic with Moses, wasn't it the, the reluctance of the individual concerned to answer this, but ultimately the individual is overwhelmed and eventually surrenders to, to God and his persuasiveness. That happens in many of the prophetic books. So in the Bible, this kind of epistolic prophecy is a little different from ecstatic prophecy. It's also distinct from divination.

Speaker 1:          14:41          Divination is an attempt to uncover the divine through some, um, technique or excuse me, the divine will through some technique, perhaps the manipulation of certain substances, perhaps inspecting the end trails of a sacrificed animal. Um, divination of this type as well as sorcery and spell casting and consulting with ghosts and spirits are all condemned by Deuteronomy. This is very important part of the Deuteronomistic diatribe against the practices of other nations, but the fact that Deuteronomy polemicizing so vehemently against these practices is a sure sign that they were practiced. You know, they were practiced at a popular level. This is probably what is related. Judy and religion consisted of to some degree and some of you will be looking in section, I know at the story of the witch of endor, right when Saul goes to a witch to conjure up the spirit of the ghost to Samuel to, to consult with him.

Speaker 1:          15:39          Um, moreover we do have divination in the outweigh cult itself, but this was performed by priests. They consulted some sort of divinely, um, designated or Rachid [inaudible] object or objects. We call these the RM and the term him, which should be familiar to all of you here at Yale, but [inaudible] are usually untranslated in your texts because actually we don't really know what they mean. They might be related to the word for light, which is, or, and the, the word for, um, you know, integrity perhaps or perfection, which is Tom. So it might be, it's probably something like Abracadabra, a little bit of a nonsense syllable that plays on words that did have meaning. We don't really know what the ORM and tuning word, but they are said to be assigned by God. We think they may have been colored stones that were manipulated in some way by the priest to give a yes or a no determination to a question.

Speaker 1:          16:29          But these are said to be assigned by God as a means that he himself authorizes for defining his will. And so the Deuteronomistic steps accepts these, but in general it's the view of the Deuteronomistic historian that divination sorcery and the like are not only prohibited, they're quite distinct from the activity of profits. That's not what the profits were about. According to the Deuteronomistic a representation, the Hebrew prophet wasn't primarily a fortune teller and I think this is a very common misconception. The Navi, the Prophet was addressing a very specific historical situation and was addressing it in very concrete terms. He was revealing God's immediate intentions as a response to the present circumstances. And the purpose of doing this was to inspire the people to change, to, to come back to faithful observance of the covenant. Any predictions that the profit might make had reference to the immediate future as a response to the present situation.

Speaker 1:          17:33          So in reality, the profits message was a message about the present. What is wrong now? What has to be done to avert the impending doom or two n to avert a future calamity. There were some women prophets in Israel, um, none of them are found among the literary profits. That is to say none of those books bearing the names of the prophets who uttered the oracles in them are named for women. So we have no women among the literary profits, but you do have prophetic or prophesizing women besides Miriam and the pen to Tuk. There's also Debra who was a tribal leader and a profit featured in judges four and five. I mentioned Holda. Her advice is sought during the reign of King Josiah and you also have no idea, no idea prophesied in the post exit periods. So this doesn't seem to be limited to two males.

Speaker 1:          18:22          Prophecy and kingship are closely connected in ancient Israel and this is going to be very important. You'll recall first of all, that the king is the anointed one of Yahweh and it's the prophet who's doing the anointing. And that makes the connection between kingship and prophecy quite strong. If you think about Israel's first two kings, you also see a strong link with the phenomenon of prophecy. The first King Saul who was anointed by the Prophet Samuel is in addition, said to have prophesied himself in the manner of the ecstatic profits. Um, when he is anointed king, he's then seized by the spirit of Yahweh. He joins a band of men. And this is in First Samuel 10, verse five, there playing Harp, tambourine, flute and liar. And he joins them. And this induces a, an ecstatic frenzy or religious frenzy that transforms him into another man according to the text.

Speaker 1:          19:14          And on another occasion, during his ecstatic prophesying, Saul strips himself naked. We have other accounts in the Bible of ecstatic prophets who would engage in self laceration. David, the second king is also said to prophesize himself. He also receives the Holy Spirit or charisma from time to time, in addition to being anointed by a prophet. Subsequent monarchs aren't said to prophesied themselves. So that ends really with David. It's only Saul and David who are among the prophets. But um, even so, those subsequent profits do not. The monarchs do not themselves prophesied. The connection with prophecy remains very, very close and it's exemplified in several ways. Again, profits not only anoint kings, but they also announced their fall from power, right? They are king makers and king breakers to some degree. Also, you have a remarkable motif that runs through so much of biblical narrative. And that's the Motif of prophetic opposition to kings.

Speaker 1:          20:12          Every king had his prophetic thorn in his side. So you have, uh, Samuel against saw, right? You have Nathan against King. David will talk about him a bit later. You have other prophets, Elijah, of course, against Ahab. My Kia against Ahab Have Alicia against the House of Ahab. Um, Jeremiah is going to a soup stand against the king, uh, quite the quite dramatically. So that prophetic opposition to the monarch, to the king, sort of God's watchdog over the king is an important theme throughout the stories of the form of profits, right? It sets and it sets a stage for us to understand the writings of the named profits that will come later. Those are very often given in opposition to official policy or royal policy. And very often you have this sort of literary motif that introduces the profits. Opposition. The word of the Lord came to x, profit x against why?

Speaker 1:          21:07          Against King, why? And then you get the content of it because you have sinned. I will destroy you. I will rest of the kingship from you and so on. So I want to take a quick look though at some of the roles that are played by profits in the stories and Samuel and kings and I have them listed over on the far side of the board. The first thing I want to consider is the notion of um, what I call yes men. Um, as opposed to true profits like the kings of Assyria, the kings of Israel and Judah found it politic to employ prophetic gilts. And in many cases, these court prophets who were in the king's employ were little more than endorsers of royal policy. So on numerous occasions we see these professional profits, these royal profits at odds with figures that the biblical writer will view as true profits.

Speaker 1:          22:00          They are truly for claiming the word of God and not just endorsing royal policy. And they proclaim it whether the king wants to hear it or not, whether the people want to hear it or not. And the classic example is my Kale, the son of Emma. My Kia prophesies the truth from your way, even though it displeases the king and ultimately is going to cost him his freedom. I'm not to be confused with Micah, my chaos. Uh, his story is told in first kings 22. Uh, this story is, um, uh, pointed critique of the prophetic. Yes men who are serving as court profits for and automatically endorse the policy of King Ahab. He's the king in the northern Kingdom of Israel in the ninth century. And during King Ahab Rain, the kingdoms of the north and the south of Israel and Judah have decided to form an alliance.

Speaker 1:          22:50          They want to try to recapture some of the territory that has been lost to the north territory in Syria. But you didn't undertake any military expedition without first obtaining a favorable word from the Lord. So King Ahab's profits and he has 400 of them and they're called and the king asks them, shall I? March upon remote Gilliad this is this region in the north for battle, or shall I not? March they said, and the Lord will deliver it into Your Majesty's hands. So we see that prophecy here is an institution, it's functioning as a source of royal advice, but the king of Judah Kings Jehoshaphat's, he had been perhaps hoping for an oracle against the campaign and he says, isn't there another prophet of the Lord here through whom we can inquire? And the king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat's there is one more man through whom we can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything about me.

Speaker 1:          23:45          Only disaster. My Kia son of [inaudible], well Jehoshaphat insists and my Kia is summit and he's worn by the Messenger who summons him that he better speak a favorable word like all the other prophets. The Messenger says the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king. Let your word be like the word of one of them and speak favorably. It's almost an open admission that the profits are in a little more than yes men. So my Kia answers the king's question when he asks about the advisability of marching to the north and he says, March and triumph, the Lord will deliver it into Your Majesty's hands. He's done what he's been told to do, give the same answer as the other prophets. But he doesn't use the prophetic formula. He doesn't say, thus says the Lord or some other indication that he's had a vision that he's prophesying that is actually conveying the word of the Lord.

Speaker 1:          24:37          And the king seems to sense this. And since this deception, and he says, how many times must die Jura you to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord. So my Kale, it's the king habit. And he tells of this vision that he received from God, a vision of Israel scattered among of, sorry, of, of, of, of uh, of Israel scattered over hills like sheep. So he's seeing sheep, right? Without a shepherd. The implication being that Israel's Sheppard who was the king is going to be killed in battle. And like the sheep spread on the hill, Israel will be scattered. So the king is very irritated by my k is prophecy. He says, didn't I tell you he would not prophesied good fortune for me, but only misfortune. What's interesting is in the section that follows my k, it gives an explanation for why he is the lone dissenter.

Speaker 1:          25:27          He doesn't accuse the other profits of being false prophets. He represents them instead as being misled and is being misled by God if you will. So for the second time my Kia utters the word of the Lord. He has a second vision and this vision is a vision of God who is seated on the throne and the host of heaven are gathered around him and God asks, who will entice Ahab so that he will march and fall at Ramos Gilliad and a certain one, uh, comes forward. He volunteers for this task and he tells me how he's going to do this. He says, I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. God says, you will entice and you will prevail. Go out and do it. So my Kia concludes this vision by saying, and so the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these profits of yours.

Speaker 1:          26:19          For the Lord has decreed disaster upon you. It's all part of God's plan. God is setting up a hub for disaster, presumably as punishment for his many sins. Justice. He set up pharaoh by hardening his heart so that he would be punished. Um, and uh, hardening his heart against Moses is pleased to let these are lights go. This is God's way of ensuring their demise, ensuring their punishment. Kings a little upset. He doesn't know whom to believe. So he doesn't kill my Kia on the spot. He imprisons him, he puts them on rations of bread and water. Um, just to see what the outcome of the battle will be first. And my k agrees to this. He says, if you ever come home safe and the Lord has not spoken through me, his prophecy proves accurate. Of course. Um, the king tries to disguise himself so that no one will know that he is king and no one will be able to target him in the battle.

Speaker 1:          27:10          So he disguises himself. Nevertheless, he's killed in the battle and his army scatters. The story of my Kia is polemicizing against what the biblical writer perceived to be the nationalization or the cooptation of the prophetic guild. And in the process it paints a portrait of what the true profit, uh, looks like. My Kia is someone who is determined to deliver God's word, even if it's opposed to, um, the, the wishes of the king or the view of the king and the view of the majority. He's going to proclaim God's judgment and it will be a judgment against the nation. It will be a message of doom. And interestingly enough, this will eventually become understood as the mark of a true prophet. The prophet of doom is the one who is the true profit. Um, as you can imagine, this kind of negativity, and it didn't sit well with established interests, but at a later point in time, looking back, the tradition would single out some of these profits as the ones who had spoken truly. So that's one role. The true profit stands up against the, the Prophetic Gilds, the prophets who are employed by the Kings, um, by the kings. A second role that we see profits playing in this section of historical narrative. We see profits as God's zealots.

Speaker 1:          28:30          And here again, there's a contrast between true prophets and false prophets. You find it particularly in those zealous, Yahweh's Elijah and Elijah. The Elijah stories are found in first kings chapter 17 through 19 and 21 first kings 17 through 19 and 21. The Elijah stories appear towards the beginning of second kings, chapters two through nine a little bit in a chapter 13. These materials are good examples, again of independent units of tradition, popular stories that were incorporated into the Deuteronomistic history. They're highly folkloristic. They have lots of drama and color, plenty of miracles. Animals who behave in interesting ways that this material began as a set of folk stories is also suggested by the fact that there's a great deal of overlap in the depiction of the activities of the two profits. So you have both of the profits. I'm multiplying food. Both of them predict the death of Ahab's, queen, Queen Jezza Bell, both of them part water and so on.

Speaker 1:          29:34          But in their final form, the stories have been interspersed with historical footnotes about two profits and then set into this framework, this larger framework of the history of the kings of the northern kingdom. So they've been appropriated by the Deuteronomistic school, which remember is a southern Judy and based Deuteronomistic school. Um, they've been appropriated for its purposes, which include, um, a strong condemnation of the northern kingdom of Israel and, and her kings as, as idolatrous. So Elijah, Elijah the Tishbite, which means that he comes from the city of Tish Bay in Gilliad, which is the other side of the Jordan. Elijah is a very dramatic character. He comes across the Jordan, he's dressed in a garment of hair and the leather girdle. At the end of his story, he's sort of whisked away. One of the king's servants, surmises by the wind of God. He does battle with the cult of Baal and Asherah.

Speaker 1:          30:33          We Associate Alijah most with the battle with the cult of bile and ashy raw. This had been introduced by King Ahab to please his bow. We're shipping queen, Queen Jezza bow. And as his first act, Alijah announces a draft. Yeah, announces a drought in the name of Yaffe way. Now this is a direct challenge to bow because bio is believed to control the rain. He's believed to control the general fertility of the land and and life itself. So ally just purpose is presumably to show that it is your way and not by all who controls fertility. We have very good evidence that bow was in fact worshiped in the northern kingdom, right down to the destruction. This is something we've touched on earlier as well. It's quite possible that Israelites in the northern kingdom saw no real conflict between the cult of bile and the cult of [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          31:26          But in the Elijah story, the Deuteronomistic historian represents these two cults as being championed by exclusivist. It's one or the other. Jessebelle Ahab's queen kept a retinue of 450 by all profits and was killing off the profits of Galloway, right? And by the same token, Elijah is equally zealous for Galloway. He refuses to tolerate the worship of any God but Yaffe way. Um, and he performs miracles constantly in the name of your way to show that it is yeah, halfway and not bow who gives life. For example, he, um, he raises a dead child. He multiplies oil and flour and so on all of this in the name of the Lord to show that it is your way and not by al who has true power. Um, but as I've mentioned before, there are some, um, some scholars who argue that biblical religion, again as opposed to Israelite, Judy and religion, what actual people were doing in Israel and Judea.

Speaker 1:          32:21          That's one thing. But Biblical religion, which is this exclusive, I'm yeah, wisdom or the tendency towards monotheism. There are some who believe that that biblical religion originated in the activity of zealous prophets like Elijah and Elisha in the north doing battle with the, with the bout with bile worship. Um, after the fall of the kingdom, those traditions, those Yahweh only traditions came south and were eventually absorbed in the Deuteronomistic school. So this in fact, maybe the origin of, of, of some of this is this Jaqui only party represented by figures like Elijah and Elisha. The conflict between the two cults, the outweigh cult and the bowel called reaches a climax in the story in first kings 18 is wonderful story in which, uh, Elijah challenges the prophets of Baal and Asherah to it contest. We have to remember that a severe drought has fallen on the land which Alijah attributes to God's punishment for Ahab's sin in introducing by worship on, on a broad scale.

Speaker 1:          33:23          Now, Elijah is hiding from the king who's very angry with him for declaring this drought in the name of God. After three years, he returns to Ahab. Ahab sees Elijah and he says, is that you, you troubler of Israel? And the profit responds. It is not I who have brought trouble on Israel, but you and your father's house by forsaking the commandments of the Lord. And going after the bowels now summoned all Israel to join me at Mount Carmel together with the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of our ra who eat at Jezza bells table that are supported by the royal house. Uh, when all of these people are gathered, Elijah challenges the Israelites, he says, how long will you keep hopping between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him. And if by I'll follow him, you're hopping between two opinions.

Speaker 1:          34:10          So it seems that at the popular level, there's no problem with integrating these two cults, but you have the profits of both that are demanding a certain exclusivism. He's met with silence. So Elijah prepares for a dramatic context contest. Two bowls are slaughtered and they are laid on altars. One, an altar to Baal and one an altar to [inaudible]. And the 450 prophets of Baal are to invoke their god. And Elijah will invoke his God to send a fire to consume the sacrifice. And the God who answers first, or the God who answers with fire is truly God. So the Baal prophets invoke their God a morning to noon and they're shouting, Oba, I'll answer us. And the description that follows is wonderfully satirical, but there was no sound and none who responded. So they performed a hopping dance about the alter that had been set up when noon came.

Speaker 1:          35:04          Alijah mocked them saying shout louder after all he is a god, but he may be in conversation or he may be relieving himself in the bathroom or he may be on a journey or perhaps he's asleep and we'll wake up. So they shouted louder and Gash themselves with knives and spears, uh, according to their practice until the blood streamed over them. And when noon past, they kept raving until the hour of presenting the meal offering. So more hours have gone by and still there's no sound and nun who responded are heated. And then it's Elijah's turn. Elijah sets up 12 stones to represent the 12 tribes. He lays the bull out on the altar. He then digs a trench around the alter, any orders, water to be poured over the whole thing so that it's completely saturated in the trenches, filled with water. This is going to highlight of course the miracle that's about to occur.

Speaker 1:          35:54          And then he calls upon the name of the Lord and instantly a fire descends from God and consumes everything. Offering Woodstone earth, water, everything and the people prostrate themselves and declare. Yeah, way alone is God. Yahweh alone is God. The prophets of Baal are all seized and slaughtered. Alijah expects an end to the drought and a servant comes to report to him that a cloud as small as a man's hand is rising in the west and the sky grows black and there's a strong wind and a heavy storm and the drought is finally over. The language that's used to describe this storm is the language that's typically employed for the storm God bow. Um, it drives home the point of the whole satire that yeah, way is the real god of the storm, not by Ollie. Galloway controls nature, not by aisle. It's God who's effective by all is silent and powerless.

Speaker 1:          36:47          And Israel's choice should be clear. Yeah. We should be the only God for Israel just as he is for Alijah whose name Eliyahu means. My God. Illy my God is Yahweh. So Jessebelle is pretty upset and she threatens Alijah with execution. So he flees into the desert and he will spend 40 days and 40 nights at a mountain called Horeb or Sinai. That of course is the site of God's revelation to Moses. Moses also spent 40 days and 40 nights there and many scholars have pointed out the numerous parallels between Elijah and Moses. It seems that I'm the writer. Um, there was a conscious literary shaping of the Elijah Traditions on the model of Moses and in more ways than just these two. We'll see a few coming up. Elijah is in great despair that Sinai, he wants to die. He feels that he has failed in his fight for God and so he hides himself in a, in a rocky cleft and this is also reminiscent of the cleft that Moses hides himself in in order to catch a glimpse of God has God passes by.

Speaker 1:          37:51          Um, similarly, Alijah hides in a cleft where he will encounter God as passages in first kings 19 verses nine through 12. Then the word of the Lord came to him. He said to him, why are you here Elijah? He replied, I am moved by zeal for the Lord. The God of hosts for the Israelites have forsaken your covenant, Torn Down Your Altars and put your prophets to the sword. I alone am left and they are out to take my life. Come out. He called and stand on the mountain before the Lord and low. The Lord passed by. There was a great and mighty wind splitting mountains and shattering rocks by the power of the Lord. But the Lord was not in the wind after the wind and earthquake, but the Lord was in the earthquake after the earthquake fire. But the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire, a soft murmuring sound or perhaps it's still small voice, a lot of translations use that phrase, which is very poetic.

Speaker 1:          38:48          And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his mantle about his face and went out. It stood and stood at the entrance of the cave, so I just seems to be renewed somehow. At Sinai, this was the mountain that was a source of Israel's covenant with God, but whereas the earlier theophanous there at Sinai had involved earthquake and wind and fire. The narrative here seems to be making a point of saying that God is not in the earthquake and the wind and the fire. He's in the lull after the storm. This might then be providing a kind of balance or corrective to the preceding story that we've just had of Mount Carmel. Elijah on Mount Carmel. God may be the master of the storm and Elijah dramatically demonstrated that, but he isn't to be identified with the storm in the same way that bow was. He's not a nature God and he's known only in silence, kind of awesome vocal silence in the theophany.

Speaker 1:          39:43          Then that follows to Elijah. God Instructs Elijah to return. He has to leave Sinai. He has to be turned to the people he has work to do. He has to foment rebellion or revolution, I should say in the royal house. This task is one that Elijah will not complete his disciple. Elisha will end up completing it. But the importance in this scene I think is its emphasis on God as the God of history rather than a nature God. Israel's God acts in history. He's been, he's made known to humans by his acts in history. His Prophet cannot withdraw to a mountain retreat. He has to return and he has to play his part in God's plans for the nation. So we've discussed the prophet as gods zealots. It's particularly as illustrated or exemplified by Elijah and Elisha. The Prophet, uh, also had other roles and we'll see this in Elijah.

Speaker 1:          40:33          Elijah succeeds Alijah. Um, the cycle of stories about Elijah ends with Elijah's ascent into heaven on a fiery chariot chariot and a whirlwind. Um, that's a detail in the story that has contributed to the longstanding belief that Elijah never died. And so Elijah will be the harbinger of the Messiah. He will come back to announce that the coming of the Messiah, um, Elijah left his prophetic cloak to his disciple and successor Elijah. Elijah's involvement in the political arena was also important and highlights, um, another prophetic role we've touched on before that of king maker and King Breaker. So just as Samuel Anointed Saul King and then David King in private meetings, you also have Elijah, he sends an associate to secretly anoint Jay who Jay, who is one of Ahab's x captains as King of Israel. This is going to initiate a very bloody civil war. Um, Jay who's going to massacre all of Ahab's family, all of his supporters, his retinue in Israel.

Speaker 1:          41:38          He also assembles all of the bowel worshipers and a great temple that was built by Ahab in some area. And then he orders all of them killed and the temple demolished. So it is a pitched battle, an all out war between the halfway only party, the [inaudible] party. We're not going to be looking at Elijah in great detail, but I will just point out one last aspect of his prophetic profile that I think is notable here in the book of Kings. And that is um, the characteristic of, of uh, profits as miracle workers like Elijah. Elijah performs miracles. He causes an iron ax to float. He raises a child from the dead. He feels jars of oil. He makes poison soup edible. He causes 20 loaves of barley to feed a hundred men and heals lepers. These legendary stories in which, um, divine intentions are effected by means of the supernatural powers of holy men.

Speaker 1:          42:38          This represents a popular religiosity. Um, people would turn to wonder, working holy men when they were sick or in crisis when they needed help. And this kind of religious activity, which was clearly widespread in the ancient near east in Israel. Um, this kind of popular belief, this fascination with wonder, working charismatics, it's also seen very prominently in the gospels of the New Testament. A final prophetic role is I'm very well illustrated by the Prophet Nathan. Nathan is a classic example of a prophet who serves as the conscience of the king. In Second Samuel Chapters 11 and 12, we have the dramatic story of David and Bathsheba King. David's elicit union with Bathsheba. As you know, she's the wife of Uriah. He was fighting in the king's army. Um, his illicit union with Bathsheba results in her pregnancy. And when David learns that Best Sheba is pregnant, he first tries to avoid the issue.

Speaker 1:          43:37          He grants Uriah, you know, a leave from, from the front lines. Um, he's come on home and have a conjugal visit with your wife and your Ryan's very pious leaves you to wonder who knew what when, um, it's a great story. It's told with a lot of subtlety and indirection, but your eyes very pious and he refuses. Know How could I enjoy myself when people are out there dying, which is an implicit criticism of the king who just did that very thing. Um, and so David has foiled there and he plans to then just dispose of Uriah. So he orders your eyes, commanders to place your idea in the front lines of the battle and then pull back so that your eye is basically left on his own and he will be killed. And indeed he is. So David ad's murder to adultery, but not even the king is above God's law and God sends his Prophet Nathan to tell the King of fable.

Speaker 1:          44:25          This is in Second Samuel 12 verses one through 14 there were two men in same city, one rich and one poor. And the rich man had very large flocks and herds, but the poor man had only one little Ewe lamb that he had bought. He tended it and it grew up together with him and his children. It used to share his morsel of bread and drink from his cup and Nessel in his bosom. It was like a daughter to him. One day a traveler came to the rich man, but he was loath to take anything from his own flocks or herds to prepare a meal for the guest who had come to him. So he took the poor man's land and prepared it for the man who had come to him. And David flew into a rage against the man and said to Nathan, as the Lord lives, the man who did this deserves to die.

Speaker 1:          45:09          He shall pay for the lamb four times over because he did such a thing and showed no pity. And Nathan said to David, that man is you. It's such a wonderful story and it's, and it's wonderful to think that Nathan wasn't struck down on the spot. Uh, he escaped with his life after this accusation, but it's symptomatic of the biblical narrators view of monarchy, the subjugation of the king to Ya'll way to highways, teachings to you always commandments to always true profits that we don't hear that a Nathan is carted off, but instead David acknowledges his guilt and he repents. He doesn't escape all punishment for this deed. The child of the Union does in fact die. Um, and there's a great deal of future strife and treachery in David's household as we know. And the writer does blame a good deal of that on the deeds.

Speaker 1:          46:01          These terrible sins of David's Alijah similarly is going to function as the conscience of King Ahab in First Kings 21. There you have a story of a vineyard, the king covets, this particular vineyard of, of a particular man. So the king's wife Jessebelle falsely accuses the man of blast for me. That is a capital crime and the man is stoned to death, even though these are trumped up charges and his property is transferred to the crown. Shortly after that Alijah appears and he pronounces doom upon a Ahab and his descendants, uh, for this terrible deed, Ahab admits the sin, he repents. Um, and so his punishment is delayed. But as we've seen, he is later killed in battle at remote Giliad. So in these stories, we see the prophets functioning as troubler of Israel. You know, certainly from the [inaudible], the royal point of view and their relationships with the royal house.

Speaker 1:          46:53          Um, these relationships are quite adversarial. So we're ready to move into what we call the, the period of classical prophecy and the literary profits. And that's a period that begins with two prophets, Amos and Hosea, who we'll be talking about next time. They, the last prophet of the classical prophets was Malakai. So you have about a 320 year period. If the prophets prophesied from about seven 50 down to about four 30 but 320 years, um, that's what's, that's the span of time covered by these books of the literary profits. And these profits were responding to urgent crises in the life of the nation. It's, it's easiest if we think of them as being grouped around four periods of crisis or four critical periods, which I've listed here. First we have profits of the Assyrian crisis, right? I remember the fall of a series of fall of Israel and seven 22.

Speaker 1:          47:42          So around that clustering, around that time, we have profits of the Babylonian crisis, the destruction of course there is five 86. So we have prophets who cluster around that time a little bit before. Um, then you have profits of the exile, the years that are spent in exile in Babylon, and that's primarily a Zeo. And then we have profits of the Post Zelig or restoration community when the Israelites are allowed to come back to restore their community. Uh, and we'll see certain profits there. So in the eighth century, the Assyrian Empire is threatening Israel. And Judah, you have to northern profits, Amos and Hosea, the n is for north. So Amos and Hosea are prophesying in the north. And then in the, uh, their warning of this doom, it's going to come as punishment for violations of the Mosaic Covenant. Israel fell in seven 22. You have a similar threat being posed by the Assyrians to the southern kingdom, Judah.

Speaker 1:          48:34          And so you have to Judy and prophets, Isaiah and Micah, they carry a similar message to the Judy. And so those four we associate with the Assyrian crisis with the fall of Nineveh, the capital of Assyria that falls in six 12. And that's something that the profit not home celebrates. Then Babylon is the master of the region. Judah becomes a vassal state, but tries to rebel and the profits. Habbakuk and Jeremiah, they prophesied in the southern kingdom in Judah. Um, Jeremiah, he urges political submission to Bab to Babylon because he sees Babylon as the agent of God's just punishment. But we'll come back and look at all these messages in great detail. Post exit like profit or exhibit Prophet Ezekiel, as I said, a prophet of the exile who's consoling the people in exile in Babylonia, but also asserting the justice of what has happened. Um, and then finally at the end of the sixth century, when the first exile is our returning to restore the community, returning to their homeland, they face a very harsh life. And you have had guys, Zechariah promising a better future. You have profits like Joel and Malakai who brings some ex eschatological hope into the mix. So that can help frame. Those are the ones we're gonna touch on. Mostly. We're not going to hit all of the prophetic books, but these are the main ones will hit and we'll start in with them. Aimless. Uh, next time.
