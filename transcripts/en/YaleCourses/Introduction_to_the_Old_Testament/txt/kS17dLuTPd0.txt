Speaker 1:          00:00          So following the theophany at the burning Bush, Moses returns to Egypt and he initiate what will become ultimately a battle of wills between Pharaoh and God. And the story in exodus has high drama and lots of a folkloric elements including this contest between Moses and Aaron on the one hand and the magicians of Egypt. On the other hand, and this kind of contest is a very common literary device. It's a kind of, you know, our boys are better than your boys device. The Egyptian magicians who are initially able to mimic some of the plagues that are brought on by God. They are quickly bested and uh, y'all always defeat of the magicians is tantamount to the defeat of the gods of Egypt. There are 10 plagues. These include a bloody pulp, a pollution of the Nile, swarms of frogs, lice, insects, affliction of livestock, boils that afflict humans and animals, lightning and hail locusts, total darkness.

Speaker 1:          01:01          And all of this climax is in the death of the firstborn males of Egypt in one night. And source critics looking at this material discern, um, numerous diverse sources that are interwoven throughout. And these sources preserve different traditions on the number and the nature of the plagues as well as the principal actors in the drama, God, Moses, Aaron, so according to the source critical analysis, no source contains 10 plagues and Jay has eight and he has three and p has five and some of them are the same as one another and some of them are different and so on. Some of them are unique to one source, some are not, but ultimately the claim is that these have all been merged and have left us. Then with an overall total of 10 this may in fact be true. Nevertheless, as much as we like to engage sometimes in this kind of analysis about the sources that have gone into the composition of the text, it's also always important to keep your eye on the final form of the Texas.

Speaker 1:          01:58          We've received it literary analysis that is sensitive to the larger contours of the account will reveal the artistic hand of the final editor. I've charted this at the top of the board here. Some scholars have noticed that the plagues are organized in three sets of three and there are literary links that connect them and make it clear that these are three sets of three followed by the climactic 10th plague. And again, three and 10 are ideal numbers in our biblical texts. Each set of three shares, certain structural and literary features. So in each set, the first and second plague our four warrants. That's what the FW is on the side, whereas the third plague is not. So a warning, a warning, and then a third plague, a warning, a warning, and then a third plague, a warning, a warning, and then a third play in each set.

Speaker 1:          02:48          The first plague is accompanied by a notation of the time in the morning. It's also introduced by God's speech and God says, present yourself before Pharaoh. And to do this in the morning, so each of the first plagues in the sets of three is introduced this way. And the second plague in each set of three is introduced with the divine instruction. Go to Pharaoh. The third plague in each set has no forewarning and no introduction. So this sort of structural repetition creates a crescendo that leads then to the final and most devastating plague, which is the slaughter of the Egyptian firstborn sons. The slaughter may be understood as measure for measure punishment for the Egyptians earlier killing of Hebrew infants in the um, but it's represented in the biblical text as retaliation for Egypt's treatment of Israel. And Israel is referred to as the first born son if you halfway.

Speaker 1:          03:43          So in exodus four verse 22, now he tells Moses to say to Pharaoh, thus says the Lord, Israel is my firstborn son. I have said to you, let my son go that he may worship me, yet you refuse to let him go. Now I will slay your firstborn son. So it's seen as retaliation. In this last plague, God or his angel of death passes over Egypt at midnight slaying every Egyptian firstborn male Moses orders each Israelite to perform a ritual action, and this action will protect them from the slaughter. And the ritual consists of two parts. Each family is told to sacrifice a lamb. The lamb will then be eaten as a family meal and it's blood will be smeared on the doorposts, um, to mark the house. So the angel of death knows to pass over that house and the pen works in Hebrew as well as an English, which is kind of handy.

Speaker 1:          04:40          In addition, each family is to eat unleavened bread. So according to exodus, this Passover ritual was established on Israel's last night of slavery while the angel of death passed over the dwellings that were marked with blood. The story of tests to a phenomenon that's long been observed by biblical commentators and scholars, and that is the Israelite historic preservation of preexisting ritual practices. In other words, what we probably have here are two older separate springtime rituals. One would be characteristic of semi nomadic pastoralists, the sacrifice of the first land born in the spring to the deity in order to procure a favor and continued blessing on the, the flux for the spring. The other would be characteristic of agriculturalists. It would be an offering of the very first barley that would be harvested in the spring. It would be quickly ground into flour and used before it even has time to ferment, to quickly offer something to the dd again to procure favor for the rest of the crop.

Speaker 1:          05:47          It's supposed by many that Israel was formed in from the merger or the merging of diverse groups including farmers and in Canaan. The rituals of these older groups were then linked, retained and then linked to the story of the Enslavement and liberation of the Hebrews. So you have older nature festivals and observances that have been historicized. They're associated now with events in the life of the new nation rather than being grounded in the cycles of nature. This may in fact be then part of the process of differentiation from the practices of Israel's neighbors who would have celebrated the springtime rituals. So now the blood of the sacrificial lamb is said to have protected the Hebrews from the angel of death and the bread now is said to have been eaten, consumed in unleavened form because the Hebrews left Egypt in in such a hurry. They had no time to allow the dough to rise historic cessation.

Speaker 1:          06:46          And we'll see the sister organization of rituals, um, recurring again and again. Now following the last plague, pharaoh finally allows the Israelites to go into the desert to worship their god, but he quickly changes his mind and he sends his infantry and his chariots in hot pursuit of the Israelites. And they soon find themselves trapped between the Egyptians and something referred to as yum sufe meaning read c it doesn't, uh, it isn't the Red Sea. That's a mistranslation that occurred very, very early on. So it's led to the notion that they were at the Gulf of Aqaba or somewhere near the actual big, big ocean water. Um, and some of the Israelites despair and they want to, um, surrender. Was it for want of graves in Egypt that you brought us to die in the wilderness? What have, what have you done to us taking us out of Egypt? Is this not the very thing we told you in Egypt saying, let us be, we will serve the Egyptians for it's better for us to serve the Egyptians and to die in the wilderness.

Speaker 1:          07:43          But Moses rallies them. And then in the moment of crisis, God intervenes on Israel's behalf. And once again, SARS critics see in the account of the parting of the Reed Sea in exodus 14 and 15, three different versions of the events of the event that have been interwoven. I have to stress though that scholars differ very much on where the seams and the tech star, what parts of the story belonged to j or e or p. So you'll read very, very different accounts. There's some, some consensus, but that a lot of disagreement. One thing that most people do in fact agree on is that the oldest account of the event is a poetic fragment that's found in Exodus 15 verses one to 12 in particular. Um, this is often referred to as the song of the sea. And here the image is one of thinking and drowning in the Sea of reeds.

Speaker 1:          08:34          You have a wind that blasts from God's nostrils, the water's stand straight like a wall. And at a second blast, the sea then covers the Egyptians and they sink like a stone in the majestic waters. The him doesn't anywhere refer to people crossing over on dry land. It seems to depict a storm at sea almost as if the Egyptians are in boats. And a bid when makes a giant wave and another one that makes it crashed down on them. So they're swamped by these roiling waters. But the name yum soup read see implies a more marsh like setting rather than the open sea. Uh, John Collins, who's a professor here at the divinity school. Now he points out that this image, particularly in poetic passages, this image of sinking in deep waters, um, it occurs often in Hebrew poetry. It occurs particularly in the book of Psalms and where it's a metaphor for distress.

Speaker 1:          09:32          And Psalm 69 the psalmist asks God to save him for waters have come up to my neck, I think in deep Meyer where there is no foothold. I have come into deep waters and floods sweeps over me. But a few verses later, it's clear that the poet isn't really drowning. This is a metaphor for his difficult situation more in number than the hairs of my head are those who hate me without cause. Many are those who would destroy me, My enemies who accused me falsely. So Collins suggests that the poem in Exodus 15 is celebrating and preserving a historical memory of an escape from or defeat of Pharaoh and that the drowning image is used metaphorically as it is elsewhere in Hebrew poetry to describe the Egyptians humiliation and defeat. Later writers take this poetic image and fill out the illusion to drowning in this ancient song and compose the pros accounts in exodus 14 in which the metaphor is literalized.

Speaker 1:          10:31          According to these pros accounts. Now Pharaoh's army was literally drowned in water, but even in the pros accounts. Um, in exodus 14, we can see a composite of two intertwined versions in the material that's usually associated with p. Moses is depicted as stretching out his staff first to divide the waters, which stand like a wall so that the Israelites can cross over on dry land. And then he holds out his staff to bring the waters crashing down on the Egyptians. But according to one little section, this is just a verses 24 and 25 in exodus 14 some attribute this to Jay, it seems that the Egyptians were stymied by their own chariots. The image we get there is that the Israelites are sort of working their way through the marsh on foot and the Egyptians, chariot wheels can't make it through the marsh. They get stuck in the mud and this forces them to give up the chase.

Speaker 1:          11:29          So the final narrative that emerges from this long process of transmission, perhaps a core image of, of escape on foot where chariots are bogged. Um, a poem that describes the defeat in, in metaphorical terms using a drowning and sinking image and then pros elaboration on these previous traditions that that have had very dramatic element of the sea being parted and crashing down on the Egyptians. A long process of transmission interweaving. Literary embellishment has gone into the creation of this account and exodus 14 and 15 but the story as it stands, reiterate a motif that we've seen before that of the threatened destruction of God's creation or God's people by chaotic waters and of divine salvation from that threat.

Speaker 1:          12:19          What's interesting about the song of the sea, this poetic fragment and Exodus 15 is that here the Hebrews adopt the language of Canaanite Myth and apply it to your pathway. If you still have that sheet that was handed out before listing different epithets for bowel and listing epithets for Yaffe way, it would be handy to have that or to take a look at it later. Again, because of the description of yeah way is that of a storm. God. In Exodus 15 he heaps up the waters with a blast of wind like a storm at sea, and this is reminiscent of the Canaanites Storm. God Bow, as you see on your handout by Allah said to ride on the clouds. He's a storm God and he's accompanied by wind and rain at the beginning of the rainy season. But I'll opens a slit or makes a slit in the clouds and funders and shakes the earth.

Speaker 1:          13:06          In one important legend that we have from the Canaanite texts, Ugaritic texts, he defeats an adversary who's known as prince see or judge river. And after he vanquishes this watery foe, he is a claimed the king of the gods and the king of men. And he is housed in a home, not a tent as El was, l was housed in a tent, but now this bile is housed in a permanent structure, a home that is on top of a mountain and has built a cedar. Now, ancient Hebrew descriptions of, yeah, white employed Barry's similar language in the poetic passage here in Exodus 15 but also in other poetic passages. So for example, Psalm Psalm 68 verse five extol him who rides the clouds. The Lord is his name. Yeah, he is his name. So extol him who rides the clouds. Y'All way is his name as if to say not val.

Speaker 1:          13:59          So yeah, wait, is described like bow as riding on the clouds. Psalm 29 also employs the language of a storm. Got The voice of the Lord is over the waters. The God of Glory thunders the Lord over the mighty waters. Some scholars think this actually was originally a psalm about bow that was simply adopted and referred to Yak way. Images of God engaged in a battle with some kind of watery fo also appear in the psalms. Psalm 74 Oh God, my king from of old who brings deliverance throughout the land. It was you who drove back the sea with your mind who smashed the heads of the monsters in the waters and so on. Judges five is also another ancient song fragment verses four to five that uses the same kind of imagery imagery. Now, Michael Colgan, who's a very important biblical scholar, um, and an expert in the Canaanite texts, yoga Riddick materials, he's made some intriguing observations in connection with the biblical representation of your way in terms that are so reminiscent of the storm God bow.

Speaker 1:          14:58          He notes that bow was the key figure in a change, a change in the religion of Canaan that happens somewhere between 1500 and 1200 BCE. And that is also the traditional time for what we think of as the exodus and the introduction of Ya'll wisdom or the differentiation of yeah. Wisdom at this time. Somewhere in this period there was a transfer of power in the Canaanite Pantheon so that um, the, from a transfer power from the older gods to the younger gods, the older got l the sky, God was replaced by the younger storm, God by aisle, and he was replaced by virtue of his defeat of France. See, or whoever this watery pho is. So l is replaced by, by aisle after a defeat of some watery fo Kogan notes that at about the same time, there seems to have been a similar change in many of the world's traditions or as many of the traditions of the region.

Speaker 1:          15:56          If a younger storm, God who usurps power from an older God by virtue of a victory over a water God. Remember Enuma Elish, which we read at the very beginning of the semester, you have the young storm God Marduk who defeats Tmr, the watery, ferocious deep monster and does so by blasting a wind into her. And so establishes his claim to rule instead of the Old Sky God honor, honor in India, the storm God, Indra about this time assumes the place of a previous God dials and in Greece, Zeus who is associated with a storm, right thunder lightening bolts you think of in the hands of Zeus, he replaces Kronos who had been the head of the Pantheon. And so here in exodus we find that just as the nation of Israel is coming into existence, just as the Israelites are making the transition from, um, a nomadic existence to a more settled way of life, ultimately in their own land, there seems to be a collective memory of a similar change in her religion, like the storm. God's in the myths of Israel's neighbors, Yahweh, heaps up the waters with a blast of wind. He wins a stunning victory. He establishes himself as the god of the Israelites in place of l who was worshiped by Israel's Patriarchs, remember, and like the Canaanite God by Isle. Yeah. Way as we will see, as we continue to read the text, he will eventually want a house for himself, a top of a Mountain Mount Zion, and it will be lined with Cedar.

Speaker 1:          17:32          There are of course, important ways in which Israel, his use of the storm God motif diverges from that of other ancient near eastern stories. The most important is that yaquis battle is a historic battle rather than a mythic battle, right? The Sea is not y'all always opponent, right, nor is he always enemy. Another God, Yahweh. He is doing battle here with a human fo, the Egyptian Pharaoh and his army. The sea is a weapon deployed. It's a, it's a weapon in the divine arsenal and it's deployed on behalf of Israel. But again, yeah. Whitey is depicted by the biblical writer as transcending nature, using forces of nature for a historical purpose, acting in history to deliver his people and create a new nation, Israel. So just as in genesis one, the universe is created when the wind of God parts the prime evil waters. So in exodus 14 and 15 a new nation is created when the wind of God parts the waters of the Reed Sea.

Speaker 1:          18:39          But to describe what was understood to be a historic event, a onetime event, not a recurring mythical event, but a historic event. The ancient Israelites employed language and images drawn naturally from the traditions and myths of their broader cultural context. Or I should say that word, the cultural context in which they themselves existed, while at the same time differentiating themselves to some degree. Now, as has long been noted, the Exodus Event became the paradigm of God's salvation of his people. And when I say salvation, I don't mean that in the later Christian sense of personal salvation from sin. That's a notion that's anachronistically read back into the by built into the Hebrew Bible. It's not their salvation in the Hebrew Bible does not refer to an individual's deliverance from a sinful nature. This is not a concept we find in the Hebrew Bible. It refers instead to the concrete collective communal salvation from national suffering and impression, particularly in the form of foreign rule or enslavement.

Speaker 1:          19:43          When biblical writers speak of Galloway as Israel's redeemer and Savior, they are referring to, yeah, always physical deliverance of the nation from the hands of her foes and we're going to see this increasingly as we move to the prophetic material. So the exodus is a paradigm for salvation, but it would be a mistake I think to view the exodus as the climax of the preceding narrative. We've gotten to this point now and we have this big dramatic scene at the Reed Sea, but the physical redemption of the Israelites is not, in fact the end of our story. It's a dramatic way station in a story that's going to reach its climax in the covenant that will be concluded at Sinai. And as many sensitive readers of the Bible have noted, the road from Egypt leads not to the other side of the Reed Sea, but onto Sinai. God's redemption of the Israelites is a redemption for a purpose, a purpose that doesn't become clear until we get to Sinai.

Speaker 1:          20:41          For at Sinai, the Israelites will become God's people bound by a covenant. And so the story continues. In the third month after the exodus, the Israelites arrive at the wilderness of Sinai and they in camp at the mountain where Moses was first called by God, the text says, the Covenant concluded at Sinai is referred to as the Mosaic Covenant. So this is now our third covenant that we have encountered. We will have one more coming. Um, and the mosaic covenant differs radically from the Noaa hide and the Abrahamic or patriarchal covenants that we've already seen. Because here, God makes no promises beyond being the patron or protector of Israel. And also in this covenant, he sets terms that require obedience to a variety of laws and commandments. So the Mosaic Covenant is neither unilateral. This is now a bilateral covenant mutual reciprocal obligations, nor is it unconditional like the other two.

Speaker 1:          21:43          It is conditional, so this is our first bilateral conditional covenant. If Israel doesn't fulfill her obligations by obeying God's Torah, his instructions, and living in accordance with his will as expressed in the laws and instructions, then God will not fulfill his obligation of protection and blessing towards Israel. Now, the biblical scholar Jon Levenson here maintains that historical critical scholarship has been unkind to biblical Israel because of a pervasive bias between the two main focus of the religion of ancient Israel. Those are the Torah or the law is it's, it's an understood as the law, not a great translation. I prefer instruction, but Tara taken to me in the law on the one hand and temple on the other. He says that on the one hand, negative stereotypes rooted in Paul's condemnation of mosaic law as a deadening curse from which belief in Jesus offers liberation. That account colors, scholarly accounts of the giving of the Torah.

Speaker 1:          22:57          On the other hand, a Protestant distaste for priest centered cultic ritual colors, scholarly accounts of the temple and its meaning for ancient Israelites so that these biases are so much embedded in our culture. He says they permeate the work of even secular scholars of the Bible, so that a negative view of the law affects interpretation of the book of Exodus. Scholars tend to place great emphasis on the deliverance from Egypt as the high point and the exodus narrative rather than the more natural literary climax, which is the conclusion of the Covenant at Mount Sinai and the delivery of the Torah. So Levenson in his book, Sinai and Zion, he tries to correct this prejudice, prejudicial treatment. He says he seeks to give the two central institutions of Torah on the one hand in temple on the other a fair hearing. So when his book Sinai and Zion Levinson Explores these, um, the two great, when he calls the two great mountain traditions that express these central concepts, the tradition of Mount Sinai, that's where Israel received the Torah and entered into this defining covenantal relationship with God.

Speaker 1:          24:11          And then on the other hand, the tradition of Mount Zion Zion will be the future site of the nation's holy temple in Jerusalem. Mount Zion is in Jerusalem. It's the Temple Mount today where the, the, the mosque now is, um, today, uh, we'll consider Levinson's analysis of the Sinai tradition as an entree into the Israelite concept of the Torah and the Covenant Bond, its meaning and its implications. So 11th and stresses the importance of the Covenant formulary. There are ancient near eastern parallels to the Sinai covenant of the Bible, especially Hittite treaties had tight treaties that date to 1500 to 1200 or so, also as Syrian treaties in about the eighth century. But they are in many ways continuous continuous with what you find in the Hittite treaties, treaties between a [inaudible] and a vassal. You remember we talked about two types of treaties, suzerainty treaties and parody treaties, parody treaties between equals, but suzerainty treaties are between a Suzanne who has a position obviously of power and authority and a vassal and he details the following six elements, which I hope you can all see and um, especially in the Hittite treaties, not all found in every treaty, but they're often enough found that we can speak of these six elements.

Speaker 1:          25:22          First, there is a preamble that's found in everyone. This is a rant, identifies himself. Second of all, there's generally an account of the historical circumstances that are leading to the treaty, so some kind of historical prologue. Then we usually have some sort of set of stipulations and requirements upon the vassal. Generally a force. There's generally some arrangement either for the publication of the treaty or its deposition. It's safekeeping and some sort of shrine. There is generally a concluding invocation of witnesses. Usually the gods are invoked as witnesses to a binding oath, some kind of covenantal oath that brings the cup, the, the treaty into effect and it's witnessed by God's. Lastly, there will be very often a list of blessings for the party who obeys and curses for the party that violates the pact. And the curses are particularly emphasized in the Assyrian treaties. They are really fun reading.

Speaker 1:          26:19          So Levinson then identifies these elements, uh, many of these elements in the ways very first speech to Moses and Moses and the Israelites arrive at Sinai in Exodus 19 and God says the following, a in x in verses three, three B two eight, the Lord called to him from the mountain saying, thus shall you say to the House of Jacob and declare it to the children of Israel, you have, sorry. You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, how I bore you on Eagle's wings and brought you to me now then if you will obey me faithfully and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession among all the peoples and did all the earth is mine, but you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words that you shall speak to the children of Israel. Moses came and some of the elders of the people and put before them all that the Lord had commanded him and all the people answered this one saying all that the Lord has spoken, we will do.

Speaker 1:          27:16          And Moses brought back the people's words to the Lord. So 11 son who, who draws actually on long standing work by other scholars and earlier in the 19th century even, um, Levinson find several of the main elements of the Hittite suzerainty treaties in this speech. So verse four, you've seen what I did to the Egyptians. How I bore you on Eagle's Eagle's wings is the historical prologue, right? That's the reason that we're in the situation we're in now and making this covenant. Verse five contains Gods stipulations. It's a very general conditional if you obey, my law is basically keep my covenant obeyed me faithfully. That's the conditional that's going to be filled out and articulated at great length in the file in the following chapters in the subsequent chapters. But all of the laws they have to obey or spelled out. The second half of verse five and six gives the reward.

Speaker 1:          28:04          God is conferring on the Israelites. This elevated status of, of royalty of priesthood. You'll be to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. And in verse eight, the people solomnly undertake to fulfill the terms of the covenant. So we have at least three of the steps, um, that we find in the Hittite treaty as well. If we take a broader view of the full biblical account of Israel's covenant with God, all six elements can be identified in the biblical narrative. They're scattered throughout the text. However, we have the preamble and the historical background to the covenant in Gods' summary. Introduction to the people in Exodus 20 I am Yahweh who brought you out of the land of Egypt, sums it all up. Introduction who I am and why we are historically connected. So this fact, God's bringing Israel out of Egypt, presumably establishes God's claim to sovereignty.

Speaker 1:          28:53          The terms of the treaty are then stipulated at great length in the instructions that are found in Exodus Chapter 23 Chapter 23 Moses reads the book of the Covenant. It's called the scroll of the Covenant. Publicly. This is said in exodus 24 verse seven and Deuteronomy, we read that it will be deposited for safe keeping and a special arc. The Israelites vow that they will obey. Exodus 24 verse three also seven be a covenant is then sealed by a formal ritual. In this case it's a sacrifice in exodus 24 verse eight. In a monotheistic system, you can't really call upon other gods to be witnesses to the, to the ceiling of the oath. Um, so we have heaven in earth being invoked as witnesses. Deuteronomy four verse 26. Deuteronomy 30 verse 1931 verse 28, Heaven and earth. The idea of being perhaps the inhabitants thereof should witness as for blessings and curses.

Speaker 1:          29:48          We have a long list of each found in Leviticus 26 and Deuteronomy 28 also interesting reading and some of these curses, particularly the ones in Deuteronomy bear a very striking resemblance to curses in um, an a theory and treaty that we have that was found dates to about six 77 BCE. The Assyrian King asked or hadn't. And many of the courses are really almost word for word. So while no one passage contains all of the elements of the Hittite treaty form, um, there are enough of them scattered around to suggest it as a model as well as its later instantiation in is in a Syrian culture. So what's the meaning of this? Why does it matter that Israel understands its relationship with God and, and uses the covenant as a vehicle for expressing its relationship with God? Um, the vehicle of the Suzerainty Treaty Treaty Levinson according to 11 sin, the use of a suzerainty treaty as the model for Israel's relationship to Callaway expresses several key ideas that captures several key ideas.

Speaker 1:          30:50          First, the historical prologue that's so central to the scissor anti-treaty grounds the obligations of Israel to halfway in the history of his acts on her behalf. And so it was granted in historical moment. We'll come back to this and what that might mean about her perception of God. Second, the historical prologue bridges the gap between generations, Israel's past and present and future generations form a collective entity Israel. That collectively a sense to the covenant and even today at Passover ceremonies everywhere, Jews are reminded to see themselves reminded of the obligation to see themselves as if they personally came out of Egypt and personally covenanted with God. The historical prologue thirdly explains why Israel accepts her place in the Susan Vassal relationship. Israel's acceptance of a relationship with God doesn't stem from a mystical introspection or philosophical speculation. Levenson says instead, the Israelites are affirming their identity and their relationship with God by telling a story, a story whose moral can only be that God is reliable.

Speaker 1:          32:10          Israel can rely on God just as a vassal can rely on his Susan. The goal is not Levenson says ultimately the affirmation of God's suzerainty in a purely verbal sense then right. The point is not mere verbal. A claim of God as Susan Levinson points out, that the affirmation of God's suzerainty is rendered in the form of obedience to commandments, not mere verbal acclamation. Observance of God's commandments is as Levinson puts it, the teleological end of history. Why is that important? Unless we recognize that the road from Egypt leads an extra bleach to Sinai, but the story of national liberation issues in and as subordinate to is ultimately subordinate to the obligation to God's covenant stipulations and observance of his laws. Then we run the risk of doing what has been done for some centuries now of reading exodus. That's first and foremost a story of a miraculous delivery rather than the story of a relationship which is expressed through obligations to the observance of specific laws, commandments and instructions.

Speaker 1:          33:21          So the Souza and vassal model has further implications. Other scholars, Levinson and other scholars point many of these out just as the ancient near eastern suzerainty treaties specify that vassals of a Susan are to treat other vassals of the Susan well. Um, Israelites are bound to one another then as vassals of the same Susan and are to treat one another. Well. And so covenant in Israel becomes the basis of social ethics, right? It's the reason that God gives instructions regarding the treatment of one's fellow Israelites, right? So the Susan Vassal relationship grounds, the social ethic within Israel also just as a vassal cannot serve two Susan's that's pretty explicit in all the treaties you oh exclusive service two years Susan. So the covenant with God entails the notion of Israel's exclusive service of Yahweh. The assertion is not that there is no other God but that Israel will have no other God before cafe.

Speaker 1:          34:26          The jealousy of the Susan is the motivation for prohibitions against certain intimate contact with non outweigh peoples because these alliances will end up entailing recognition of the gods of these peoples, the covenant with Yahweh Way. We'll also, we shall see soon preclude alliances with other human competitors. If Israel serves a divine king, she can't for example, serve a human king and that's an idea that will express itself in Biblical texts as we see that are clearly opposed to the creation of a monarchy in Israel. Not everyone was on board with the idea that Israel should be ruled by king. So there are texts that will object to the creation of the monarchy, King Saul and King David and so on. They're also texts that are going to object to alliances with any foreign king or subservience to any foreign king, whether it's Egypt or Syria, or Babylonia.

Speaker 1:          35:23          So subservience to human king, native or foreign is in these texts considered a rejection of the divine kingship, which is the ideal, the exclusive kingship of Yahweh and the scene as a breach of the covenant. Now, ancient near eastern suzerainty models also speak repeatedly of the vassals love for the service for the Susan, right? Vassal So-and-so will love the Assyrian Lord. So and so. And that's an element that is not absent at all in the biblical texts that deal with the covenant bond the Israelites promised to serve and to love. Yeah, halfway. That's an additional theme that's associated regularly with the covenant. It's one that will take up in greater detail, though when we get to the book of Deuteronomy where it is stressed to a greater degree than it is in exodus. But for now, we can accept Levinson's claim that Sinai represents an intersection of law and love because of the use of the suzerainty model.

Speaker 1:          36:19          So the covenant concept is critical to the Bible's portrayal and understanding of the relationship between God and Israel. The entire history of Israel as portrayed by biblical writers is going to be governed by this one. Outstanding Reality of covenant Israel. Fortunes will be seen to ride on the degree of it's faithfulness to this covenant. Exodus closes the book of exodus closes with the construction of the sanctuary. Um, and when the sanctuary is completed, the tech says the presence of the Lord filled the tabernacle. This is a sign of divine approval, but um, the long section where we have the receipt of the instructions for the building of the temple and then we have an actual account of, of those instructions being fulfilled. And the end, the not sample tabernacle, excuse me, it's just a tent structure at this stage. So receiving the instructions and then the actual construction of the Tabernacle that extends from exodus 25 to the end of the book, exodus 40, but it's interrupted in exodus 32 by the account of the Israelites apostasy with the golden calf.

Speaker 1:          37:29          It's just a great and very ambiguous story. But the moment of Israel's greatest glory is to be the moment of her greatest shame. As Moses Receives God's Covenant on Mount Sinai, he's there at the top of Sinai communing with God the Israelites who are encamped at the foot of the mountain, grow, restless and rebellious. And they demand of Aaron a God because they don't know what's become of this fellow Moses. They said, what about this? This guy, Moses, they use a very colloquial kind of term to dismiss him. So Aaron feeling the heat makes a golden calf and the people down bow down to it and someone declares, this is your God, o Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt. Well, and enraged. God tells Moses, you know what's going on down there. And he tells them to descend from the mountain. The people are sitting, they've already gone astray, a stray, and he says, I'm through.

Speaker 1:          38:23          I want to destroy the nation and I'm going to start a new nation again from you. Moses. Moses manages to play Kate God momentarily. Um, and then he turns around to face the people. He comes down from the mountain. He approaches the camp, you stunned by what he sees. He's carrying the tablets and all of the instruction and he smashes them at the foot of the mountain and fury. He manages to halt the activities. He punishes the perpetrators. He has a few choice words for Erin. This temporary alienation from God is ultimately repaired through Moses's intense prayer and intercession and it actually takes several chapters to reach a resolution and God pelts for quite awhile. But a renewal of the covenant does occur and another set of stone tablets is given, given and according to one biblical texts, the broken tablets as well as the, the new tablets are both placed in the Ark.

Speaker 1:          39:14          Um, and this is embarrassing. Episode is just the beginning of a sequence of embarrassing events that will occur as the Israelites move from Egypt towards the land that's been promised to them. Most of these episodes will occur in the book of numbers and they involve the rebellion of the people in some way. Generally God's fury in reaction to that rebellion. Moses's intervention usually on behalf of the people and God's appeasement. So the book of numbers recounts the itinerary of the Israelites throughout the 40 years of their wanderings and encampments around the sacred Tabernacle. The Tabernacle always moves in the center of the of the tribes, and they're positioned in certain specific positions around the tabernacle as they, as they move. They stay at Sinai for a year, I believe in the text before they begin. Their movement and numbers contains some law and much narrative material.

Speaker 1:          40:11          The material tells of God's provision for the people in the desert, but it also tells the Israelites constant complaining and rebellion. The Israelites rebelled against Moses and God and they long for Egypt. There are several times when God threatens to exterminate them, but Moses manages to dissuade in numbers 14 for example, the Israelites. When the Israelites Complain Again, God is determined to destroy them and Moses intervenes and the intervention leads to a compromise. God swears that none of the adults who witnessed the exodus, with the exception of Joshua and Caleb, who did not join in the rebellion, but none of the adults who witnessed the exodus would see the fulfillment of God's salvation and enter the promised land. This means the Israelites will have to wander for 40 years in the desert until all of those who left Egypt as adults pass away, leaving a new generation that hasn't really tasted slavery, uh, to enter the land and form a new nation.

Speaker 1:          41:11          The book of numbers I think is most remarkable for the relationship that it describes between Moses and God. I love reading these particular stories and just hearing the dialogue between them and imagining it because the two of them alternate in losing patients with the Israelites and wishing to throw them over. Um, but each time the one convinces the other to be forbearing the relationship between Moses and God is a very intimate one. Very much like a husband and wife are sort of working as together as partners in parenting a difficult child. Um, but they're trying to prepare their partners in the preparation of Israel for their new life readying Israel for life in God's land as a nation, as a people. I'm going to just give you two examples of the way Moses and God act as a check upon each other. The first excerpt is from numbers 14 and it shows Moses his ability to placate the wrath of God.

Speaker 1:          42:04          Now in this story, the Israelites, um, express great fear. They've just heard a report from a reconnaissance team, um, that scoped out the land and they come back and say, oh boy, you know, it looks really bad. And then they think that the chances of conquering the promised land are very, very slim. The whole community broken to loud cries and the people wept that night. All the Israelites railed against Moses and Aaron. If only we had died in the land of Egypt, the whole community shouted at them. Or if only we might die in this wilderness, why has the Lord taking us to that land to fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be carried off. It would be better for us to go back to Egypt and they said to one another, let's head back for Egypt. The presence of the Lord appeared in the tent of meeting to all the Israelites, and the Lord said to Moses, how long would this people spurned me?

Speaker 1:          42:50          How long will they have no faith in me? Despite all the signs that I've performed in their midst, I will strike them with pestilence and disown them and I will make of you a nation far more numerous than they. But Moses said to the Lord, and when the Egyptians from WHO's midst you brought up this, people in your might hear the news, they will tell it to the inhabitants of that land. If then you slay this people to a man, the nations who have heard your fame will say, oh, it must be because the lord was powerless to bring the people into the land. He had promised them on oath that he slaughtered them in the wilderness. Therefore, I pray, let my lords for Barron's be a bounding and kindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression. Pardon? I pray the iniquity of this people according to your great kindness as you have forgiven these people ever since Egypt.

Speaker 1:          43:34          And the Lord said, I pardon as you have asked. So nope. God's offer to start all over again with Moses. This is that. This is a, this is a pattern with this God, you know, create good subset of flood wipes them out. Let's start again and it's still not too good. Let's choose one person, Abraham, see how that goes up? Disappointed. Let's go with Moses. So this is a bit of a pattern, but Moses refuses to accept the offer and instead he defends the Israelites and he averts their destruction. He appeals primarily to God's vanity. What will the neighbors think? If you destroy them, they'll think you couldn't fulfill your promise. They'll think you're not the universal God of history. But the roles are reversed in the following passage. And this is where, you know, the text is blows hot and cold. In fact, that's there's a rabbinic image that, um, there's a rabbinic tradition that talks about this period of time and has gotten most of talking. And God says, listen, between the two of us, whenever I blow hot, you blow cold. Or when you, when I pour hot water, you pour cold. And when you pour hot, I'll pour cold. And you know, together we'll muddle through and get through here and the Israelites won't be wiped out. But in this next passage, which is a numbers 11, Moses is the one who's impatient with the Israelites, constant complaints and lack of faith. And he's ready to throw in the towel. I'll just read this last passage.

Speaker 1:          44:49          The riff Raff in their midst felt a gluttonous craving. And then the Israelites wept and said, Oh, if only we had meat to eat. We remembered the fish that we used to eat free in Egypt. Okay, we were slaves, but the food was free. You know, as there's love that line we use, eat this fish free in Egypt, the cucumbers, the melons, the Leeks, the onions, and the garlic. Now our gullets are shriveled. There's nothing at all. Nothing but this manner to look at. Moses heard the people weeping, every clan apart, each person at the entrance of his tent and the Lord was very angry and Moses was distressed and Moses said to the Lord, why have you dealt with your servant? Me? Why have I not enjoyed your favor that you have laid the burden of all this people on me? Did I conceived all this people?

Speaker 1:          45:33          Did I bear them that you should say to me, carry them in your bosom as a nurse carries an infant to the land that you have promised on oath to their fathers. Where am I to get meat to give to all this people when they wind before me and say, give us meat to eat. I cannot carry all this people by myself. It's too much for me. If you would deal thus with me, kill me rather I beg you and let me see. No more of my wretchedness. And the Lord said to Moses, gather for me, 70 of Israel's elders of whom you have experienced as elders and officers of the people, and bring them to the tent of meeting and let them take their place there with you. And I will come down and speak with you there and I will draw upon the spirit that is on you and put it upon them and they shall share the burden of the people with you and you shall not bear it alone.

Speaker 1:          46:17          So again, hot and cold. And in many ways, Moses sets the paradigm for the classical prophet. He performs this double duty. He chastises and upgrades the Israelites for their rebellion and failures, right when he's turning and facing the people he's, he's on their case. But at the same time he consoles the people when they fear they've driven God away irreparably. And when he turns to face God, he defends the people before God. He pleads for mercy when they do in fact deserve punishment and he knows they deserve punishment. He even says as much, but please have mercy at times. He expresses his frustration with the difficulty of his task and resentment that it's been assigned to him, but we'll consider the character and the role of Moses in much greater detail when we reached the book of Deuteronomy. Uh, next Monday for the coming week, I would like you to please pay particular attention. We're dealing with two topics that will be, I think perhaps for some of you, a little different. New Alien. We're going to be dealing with biblical law on Monday and biblical ritual, purity tech's holiness temple on Wednesday. These are worlds apart from many of the things we know. So please, there's a lot of of textual reading to do for Monday and Wednesday. Please do it carefully and I might even hand out a little bit of a study guide to help you with that.
