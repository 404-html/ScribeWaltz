Speaker 1:          00:00          So, as we saw last week before we start to talk about the produce, the materials and the holiness code, as we saw last week, the covenant ceremony at Sinai included Gods announcement of and Israel's agreement to certain continental stipulations. So exodus 24 verses three and four, describe this, uh, agreement as follows. Moses went and repeated to the people all the commands of the Lord and all the rules and all the people answered with one voice saying all the things that the Lord has commanded we will do. And Moses then wrote down all the commands of the Lord. So the Covenant concluded at Sinai is the climactic moment, uh, in the pentitude will narrative. And it came to be viewed as the initiation of God's articulation of the laws and rules and ordinances and instruction by which the ancient Israelites were to live. And so later edit editors consequently inserted lock collections from later times and circles into the story of Israel's meeting with God at Sinai and Subsequent Sojourn in the wilderness.

Speaker 1:          01:04          This was done in order to lend these collections and air of high antiquity and to give them divine sponsorship. The conclusion of Biblical scholarship is that a number of separate bodies of law have gravitated to the story of the 40 year period of Israel's formation into a people. So that's the period of the Covenant at Mount Sinai. And then the journey towards the promised land. All Israelite law is represented in the biblical account as having issued from that time, that 40 year period of intimate contact with, between God and Israel. So a, on your handout, I've given um, a division, a rough division of the different legal collections that we have in the pentitude. Um, the laws that scholars will often refer to as the Jie laws since they sort of are introduced by that narrative. Some people think it's best to just think of these as separate legal collections, but those occur in exodus and so they're 10, they tend to be dated 10th, ninth century in their written form.

Speaker 1:          02:05          The laws of the priest, the material are mostly going to be found in Leviticus and numbers. Um, and those will be formulated somewhere from the eighth to the sixth century, same period of time. Roughly. We have the laws of D, which are found obviously in Deuteronomy, but these sources themselves are clearly drawing upon much older traditions. Some of the individual laws are clearly quite ancient. They have a great deal in common with ancient near eastern legal traditions generally of the second millennium, the laws of exodus, for example. Some of them bear such similarity to the code of Hammurabi that we can really assume that they are drawing upon a common legal heritage, a Canaanite law, what would have been known as a, as a legal tradition in in Canaan, so whatever their actual origin. However, the Bible represents these materials as having been given at Sinai or during that 40 year period after, so given at, now this is on your sheet, you have the deck, a log, not very well translated as the 10 commandments.

Speaker 1:          03:05          We'll come back to that covenant code, so that's the chunk of material, three chapters and exodus. Then we have a small passage referred to as a ritual deck log. We'll come back to that. You have priestly legislation a little bit in exodus about the cult, obviously. Then on into Leviticus and some numbers and according to the biblical narrative, then the following materials were given in the 40 years after Sinai as the Israelites are encamped in the wilderness on their journey toward the land of Israel. So those are presented as supplements in numbers but also the Deuteron due to anomic code. Let's talk a little bit now about the deck log. It was this scholar by the name of Alt, a l t, Albrecht alt German scholar who examined the illegal material of the Bible in general and he noticed that there were really two forms of law. Yeah. Are these things I forgot to write down.

Speaker 1:          03:58          There's conditional conditional law and [inaudible] law. Conditional Law is case lock has with stick law and then there's absolute or APP apoplectic law. So Kacie with stick. He noticed these two forms. Um, Cassie was stick law is the common form of law that that law is the common form that law takes in the ancient near east. And you've seen it in the code of Hammurabi. It has a characteristic. If then pattern Cassie was stick law tells you, for example, if a person does x or if x happens, then y will be the consequence. It can be complex, it can be quite specific. If x happens, why is the consequence? But if x happens under these different circumstances, then z is the consequence and it can be quite detailed giving through your forced sub-cases with qualifications at the absolute or APP. Addictive law by contrast is an unconditional statement of a prohibition or a command.

Speaker 1:          04:53          It tends to be general and somewhat undifferentiated. You shall not murder you shall love the Lord your God. And absolute law at predictive law is not unknown as a form in other ancient near eastern cultures, but it seems to be most characteristically Israelite find a great deal more of it in our legal collections in the Bible than anywhere else. The provisions of the deck log. Um, and again the translation 10 commandments, it's actually a very poor translation in the Hebrew is simply means 10 statements, 10 utterances. Um, these are in the ones that are in some sort of legal form are in absolute or APP addictive form. The deck log is the only part of God's revelation that is disclosed directly to all of Israel without an intermediary. But it's directives are couched in the masculine singular. So it seems to be addressing Israelite males as the lead legal subjects in the community.

Speaker 1:          05:48          And the deck log sets out some of God's most basic and unconditional covenant demands. The division into 10 is a bit awkward. It's probably should be seen as an ideal number, an effort to find 10 statements in there. Because in fact there were really about 13 separate statements. And um, we, we see the fact that 10 doesn't work very well in a very interesting phenomenon, which is, um, that's so called commandments are actually numbered differently by Jews and by Christians. And then even within the Christian community, different Christian denominations number the commandments one through 10 quite differently from one another. They disagree about what is number one and what does number two. And so on. The first statements, either one through four, one through five depending on your counting, but the first group of statements concern Israel's relationship with her, Susan with God. She used to be exclusively faithful to God.

Speaker 1:          06:39          She's not to bow down to any man made image. She may not use God's name in a false oath, right to a test two or swear by a false oath. She's to honor God's Sabbath Day and on our parental authority, which is arguably an extension of God's authority. The remaining statements then concern Israel's relationship with her fellow vassals if you will, and they prohibit murder and adultery and robbery, false testimony and covetousness. It's important to realize that the pentitude contains three versions of the decalogue and there are differences among them. The deck log is going to be repeated in Deuteronomy chapter five and there are some minor variations. Specifically you'll see that the rationale for observing the sabbath is different gods name in Deca law in a deck log and Deuteronomy five is not to be used in a vein oath as opposed to a false oath.

Speaker 1:          07:35          There are differences in the meeting and there are some more differences too in language. So what are we to make of this one scholar Mark Brittler whose name I've mentioned before, he says that when we learn from this are these variations is something about the way ancient Israel preserved and transmitted sacred texts. They didn't strive for verbatim preservation when they transmitted biblical texts and they didn't employ cut and paste methods that might be important to us in the transmission of something. Texts were modified in the course of their transmission verbatim. Repetition was not valued in the way that it might be for us, so that even a text like the deck, a log which is represented as being the unmediated word of God, can appear in more than one version as a more surprising variation that occurs. However, an exodus 34 after smashing the first set of tablets that were inscribed with a deck, a log, um, the deck log, the tablets in exodus 20, those are smashed after the golden calf incident.

Speaker 1:          08:33          Moses is then given a second set of tablets and the biblical writer emphasizes in the story at that point that God writes on the tablets the words that were on the former tablets that were broken, the same words. So we expect now a verbatim repetition of exodus 20 and yet we don't have it. The deck, a log that follows in fact has very little overlap with the earlier a log. There's really only two, um, statements that even have the same content. And even those which do overlap in content very in wording, this deck log, which is often called the ritual deck log. So it's listed on there and exodus 34 it bands intermarriage with Canaanites lest they entice the Israelites into worship of their gods. It has other terms, um, that give pro commandments about the observance of the festivals, various festivals, the dedication of first fruits to God, the dedication of firstborn animals to God and so on.

Speaker 1:          09:27          Things that were not in the exodus 20 deck a log. So evidently there were different traditions regarding the contents of the deck, a log and the story of the golden calf. And Moses is destruction of the first set of tablets is brilliant narrative strategy for introducing this second deck log tradition. Also surprising is the fact that the decalogue and exodus 20 doesn't stand completely unchallenged in the Bible. Exodus 20 verses five through six contain explicitly the principle of intergenerational punishment. God has said to spread punishment for sin out over three or four generations. This is understood as a sign of his mercy. It's reducing the punishment on the actual center by spreading it out and limiting the consequences to only three or four generations. In contrast to what is said in the next verse. But kindness, he spreads out over thousands of generations, right? So it's seen as, as as a merciful mode of, of operation.

Speaker 1:          10:23          But the notion of intergenerational punishment is something that some segments of the community or perhaps later in time was rejected. Some segments of the community have rejected this notion and so in Deuteronomy seven we see that quite pointedly, God punish is only those who spurn him and does so instantly [inaudible]. When we get to a Zico, we'll see that he will also very adamantly a reject. The idea of intergenerational punishment. The children do not suffer for the sins of the father, only the father. So what are we to make of this? Again, Mark Brittler concludes that the deck, a log or deck logs did not originally possess the absolute authority that is so often claimed for it. Uh, even today, later religious traditions have elevated the deck log in exodus 22, a position of absolute authority, a position that's not completely justified given the Bible's own fluid treatment of the wording, right?

Speaker 1:          11:17          The deck logs text and it's content, right? And it's later objection even to one of its terms. So the claim that God's revelation of the decalogue was fixed inform the words that we see in exodus 20, for example, and immutable in substance is not a claim that's really native to or even justified by the biblical text. It's a later ideological imposition upon the text. I don't want to talk a little bit more about biblical laws, connection with the legal patrimony of the ancient Near East, because certainly biblical law shares in that patrimony, even if sometimes it's clearly reforming. So it's helpful and it's instructive to compare it with other ancient law collections. And I hope you've had time to sit and read. There was a study guide posted on the website and I hope you had time to work through these materials. They're fascinating and we'll see that there are certain key features that distinguish Israelite law from the other ancient near eastern legal collections.

Speaker 1:          12:12          I've also put on the handout for today, just a list of those collections. The, the laws of or nominally all is the laws of Lipid Ishtar that laws of [inaudible] of the code of Hammurabi which is c h m the Hittite laws. Um, the, the youngest laws would be the middle of Syrian laws giving you rough dates and so on. So you have that to refer to for the information about these particular collections. I should also say that, um, we would do better to under understand these materials as legal collections and not codes. I know the word code gets thrown around a lot, code of Hammurabi and so on, but they really aren't. Codes, codes are generally systematic and exhaustive, and they tend to be used by courts. We have no evidence about how these texts were used. In fact, we think it's not likely that they were really used by courts, but they were part of a learned tradition and scribes copied them over and over and so on.

Speaker 1:          13:02          They are also certainly not systematic and exhaustive. So for example, in the quote of homer ropy, we don't even have a case of intentional homicide. We only have a case of accidental homicide. So we really don't even know what the law would be. In a case of intentional homicide, we can't really make that comparison with the biblical law. Now in a very important article that was written nearly half a century ago now, it's hard to believe, um, by a man named Moshe Greenberg. Um, he's a biblical scholar and he argued that a comparison, a biblical law with other ancient near eastern collection reveals the central postulates or values that undergird biblical law. Uh, I'll be drawing extensively on Greenberg's work in this presentation as well as other scholars who have picked up some of his ideas. And I've taken them in other directions. So, but it was really Greenberg who was the one who I think made the first foray into this kind of comparative approach.

Speaker 1:          13:55          And since then others have have taken advantage of that idea. Um, there is Greenburg says and immediate and critically important difference between ancient, ancient near eastern collections and the Israelite laws as they're presented by the biblical narrator. And that's a difference in authorship. So if you look, for example, at the prologue to the laws of war Namo on an end, little gave kingship to or not, but or Namu is said to establish equity and the laws, if you look at Liquid Ishtar, the both the prologue and the epilogue on and legal, the gods give kingship to liberty each star. But Lipid Ishtar establishes justice to be first and the laws as my handiwork and the first person or the prologue to the code of Hammurabi again, laugh, Deon Newman and end lil established for him and enduring kingdom, they name him to promote the welfare of the people cause justice to prevail.

Speaker 1:          14:49          When Marduk commissioned me to direct the land and now it switches into first person speech. I established law and justice in the language of the land. At that time I decreed the laws of justice. The law is that the efficient King Hammurabi set up. I wrote my precious words on my stele, which you can go and see it. Sterling Memorial Library. Um, and in the presence of the statue of me, the king of justice, I set it up in order to administer the law of the land, to prescribe the ordinances of the land, to give justice to the oppressed. And we first do it is my justice, my statutes, no one should we send them my scribes, delay my precious words, um, do not alter the law of the land which I enacted I AI throughout. Um, by contrast in Biblical law, authorship is not ascribed to Moses ever.

Speaker 1:          15:32          It is attributed always to God. So you see an exodus 24 verses three and four Moses went and repeated to the people, all the commands of the Lord and all the rules and all the people answered with one voice. All that the Lord has commanded, we will obey and do. Moses then wrote down all the commands of the Lord. It's the repetition makes you feel that the biblical writer here is not accidentally saying these things, trying to drive home a very strong point. Exodus 31 18 when he got finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai with Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave Moses the two tablets of the pact stone tablets inscribed with the finger of God. So Greenburg and since him rettler and many others have argued that the principle of divine authorship has certain very important implications. First, it has a significant effect on the scope of the law in ancient near eastern and Biblical law differ concerning the areas of human life and activity that fall within the concern of the law.

Speaker 1:          16:31          It doesn't mean they don't fall within the concern of humanity. They just fall within the concern of the law. That's an ideal come back to in a minute is relight law will contain more than just rules and provisions that fall within the scope of the coercive power of the state to enforce, right? More than what would fall under the jurisdiction of law. Courts, for example, or illegal decides source. It is holistic. The scope of the law is holistic. It's going to contain social and ethical and moral and religious prescriptions and very often they're going to be couched in an authoritative app, addictive style, particularly the things that aren't enforceable in a court of law. They will tend to be the ones that are backed up by the authority of God directly. You shall do this, I the Lord am your God. Notice how many times that that refrain is used and it's almost always used with those unenforceable kinds of things.

Speaker 1:          17:18          Love your neighbor as yourself. You know I the Lord your God. It's me who's watching out for this one, not the court. Okay. The extra biblical law collections deal almost exclusively with matters that are enforceable by the state. That doesn't necessarily mean they were. We don't know how these were used, but they don't tend to deal with matters that we would call, we would call it matters of conscience or moral rectitude. So you'd be very hard pressed in the extra biblical collections to find a law like exodus 23 verses four and five when you encounter your enemies ox or ass wandering, you must take it back to him. When you see the ass of your enemy lying under its burden and you would refrain from raising it, you must nevertheless raise it with him or Leviticus 19 verses 17 and 18 you shall not hate your kinsfolk in your heart.

Speaker 1:          18:03          You imagined congress passing a law like that. You shall not hate your kinsfolk in your heart. Reprove your kinsmen, but incurred no guilt because of him and don't carry around a grudge. Reproof. I'm tell him what's wrong. Clear the air. Don't carry around a grudge. You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your countrymen. Love Yourself, love your fellow as yourself. I am the Lord, right? That refrain always comes after those kinds of statements. So the Bible includes norms for human behavior set by the divine will, even though enforcement has to be left to the individual conscience and in the tour. Therefore life is treated holistically in the realm of law. One's actions aren't compartmentalized, and that's why the legal materials to us can sometimes seem like an indiscriminate mix of laws concerning all areas of life. And it's one of the things that makes people confused because a lot of moderns have gotten the idea that the Bible only deals with what we call morality.

Speaker 1:          18:55          And so they don't understand all this other stuff that's in there, right? And sometimes if we tell ourselves, well, this is illegal collection, then we don't understand why there's all this moral looking stuff in there. It is a mixture because it's holistic. It is the will of God and God has something to say about all areas of life. And so in exodus 23 you're going to have a law that's tells you not to oppress a stranger because you were a stranger. It tells you to not plow your land in the sabbath year immediately following that to let the poor and needy eat from it. It tells you to observe the Sabbath Day. Rest, you shall not mention any other gods. Um, it tells you how to observe the three pilgrimage festivals and rules of ritual offering. And then there are also civil laws. Same thing in Leviticus 18 through 20.

Speaker 1:          19:33          We have incest laws, we have ritual laws, we have civil laws, and we have moral laws altogether. Now, a second implication, right? Another idea that flows from the fact that this law is, is divinely authored. So second implication of divine authorship according to Greenberg, is this connection between law and morality. So that in the biblical legal framework, every crime is also a sin. Every crime is also a sin. Law is the moral will of God, and nothing is beyond the moral will of God. So what's illegal is also immoral and vice versa. What's immoral? It's also illegal. Law and morality are not separate. As we moderns tend to think they are an ought to be right in our society. Offenses against morality. In the biblical world are also religious offenses. There are also sins because they are infractions of the divine will. So the fusion of morality and Law Greenberger I use is the reason that biblical law not only expresses, but legislates a concern for the unfortunate members of society.

Speaker 1:          20:36          For example, orphans, strangers, widows, as well as respect for the aged from the priestly sources is Leviticus 19 verse 32 we read you shall rise before the aged and show deference to the old you shall fear your God. I am the Lord. Yeah, I refrain always has to come with us. Kind of a statement. The extra biblical codes certainly exhibit concern for the rights of the poor. This is very important, particularly in their prologues. We read some of these prologues, you know, I, my desire was to help the orphans, the strangers and so on. Um, but when you look at the, the content of the laws as in our society, they don't legislate charity. They don't legislate compassion, compassion. It's likely that these were considered acts of who knows, personal conscience, religious convictions, something that was between the individual and society and their God, I don't know, but they were outside the domain and jurisdiction of the court.

Speaker 1:          21:29          That doesn't mean that charity and compassion we're not at, we're not present in other ancient near eastern cultures. The point is that law is not understood as being the appropriate vehicle for the expression of those values. There were other sorts of texts that might do those sorts of things and urge people to charity and compassion. But law legislation is not understood to be the appropriate vehicle for the expression of those values. So again, I'm, I'm not trying to say the ancient near eastern side. Everybody was mean. I'm starting to say that the law, because of its done, divine authorship suddenly takes on a scope, a holistic scope and a fusion of law and morality that are kept separate in other cultures in it and very much in our own right. Um, so the two, however, our combined and law is understood to be the appropriate vehicle to legislate compassion, for example.

Speaker 1:          22:17          So in Leviticus 19 nine verse 10 legislating charity. When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap all the way to the edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. You shall not pick your vineyard, bear or gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard. You shall leave them for the poor and the stranger. I The Lord am your God. Again, from the holiness code live, it gets 1914 you shall not insult the death or place a stumbling block before the blind. You shall fear your God. I am the Lord again. Always has to back it up because this is not something the courts can backup, right? This is a question of your morality or Leviticus 20 verse 18 love your fellow as yourself. I am the Lord. Leviticus 19 verses 33 to 34 when a stranger resides with you and your land, you shall not wrong him.

Speaker 1:          22:59          The Stranger who resides with you shall be to you as one of your citizens. You shall love him as yourself. For you were strangers in the land of Egypt. I The Lord am your God. Deuteronomy 22 six if along the road you chance upon a bird's nest in any tree or on the ground with fledglings or eggs and the mother sitting over the fledglings are on the eggs, do not take the mother together with her young. Let the mother go and take only the young in order that you may fare well and have a long life, meaning God will reward you. So again, this is enforceable by God. Furthermore, Greenberg argues that the fact that every crime is also a sin lays the ground for certain acts to be viewed as absolutely wrong and transcending the power of humans to forgive absolutely wrong, and they transcend the power of humans to pardon or forgive.

Speaker 1:          23:51          Take for an example, adultery. Deuteronomy 2122 if Amanda's found lying with another man's wife, both of them, the man and the woman with whom he lays shall die. Thus you shall sweep away evil from Israel and murder is the other one. Number's 35 verse 16 the murderer must be put to death. You may not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer. This is now verse 31 who is guilty of a capital crime. He must be put to death in the view of the biblical text. Adultery and murder are absolutely wrong. They must always be punished regardless of the attitude of the offended parties. All right, so a husband can say, oh, that's okay. I don't want to punish my white. Let them have their fun. It's no big deal. I don't mind. All right, and the family of a murder of victor can't murder victim can't say, you know, Joe was such a pain in the neck anyway.

Speaker 1:          24:44          You've really done us a favor. You know, just pay the funeral costs. We'll call it quits. You know, you can't do that. These are absolutely wrong. These deeds as infractions of God's will and God's law, they're always wrong. They transcend the power of human parties to pardon or forgive or excuse, and you compare that with the extra biblical collections and you see quite a difference in the code of Hammurabi number at one 29 adults rate. These are adultery is considered a private affair. If the wife of his senior, I have to, this terminology is just wonderful senor. This comes I think from um, French feudalism. These have to do with class distinctions. And so the translators of this particular translation, a chose these futile, very meaningful to you. I'm sure these futile categories. Essentially what's going on here is the underlying Acadian words, I guess are we alone?

Speaker 1:          25:35          Moosh, Ghanem and then a third category slave. When the three, when they appear together, IBM tends to refer to an upper class person and which came to a common, or having them can just mean an ordinary citizen. But when it's in juxtaposition with the other terms, it's clearly someone of a higher social class. So I will, we'll use aristocrat, which is where we get the French feudal senor and then we'll use common or and slave. So when the code of Hammurabi and the wife, if the wife of a, a citizen has been caught while lying with another man, they shall bind them and throw them into the water. But if the husband of the woman wishes to spare his wife, then the king and turn may spare his subject. It's up to the husband. He is the offended party. It's a private matter. He decides the middle of Syrian laws on tablet a numbers 14 to 16.

Speaker 1:          26:17          Again, it's a crime against the property of the husband. And so it's within his power to either prosecute or not. If a senior and I'll be loom has lane with the wife of another, either in a temple bravo or in the street knowingly knowing that she was a wife, then they shall treat the adulterer as the senior orders his wife to be treated. Okay. So whatever he does to hurt, they do the same thing to the, to the mail. But if he was innocent, he didn't know that she was a married woman. The senor shell prosecute his wife, treating her as he thinks fit. It's up to him. If the woman's husband, um, this more ifs and dens. But here's the case, that if the woman's husband put him, puts his wife to death, he shall also put this in your to death. But if he cuts off his wife's, knows he shall turn this in, you are into a unit and I guess this is considered equivalent and they shall mutilate his whole face.

Speaker 1:          27:04          However, if he let his wife go free, they shall let the Senor Goffrey. All right. Again, it's a private matter and the Hittite laws as well, tablet to one 97 to one 98 the husband can decide to spare his wife if he brings them to the gate of the palace and declares my wife shall not be killed and thereby spares his wife's life. He shall also spare the life of the adulterer and shall mark his head. But if he says, let them die, both of them, then the king may order them killed, but also the king can spare their lives. All right, and we see the same sorts of distinctions in murder cases. We'll, we'll come back to them later. A third implication or consequence of the divine authorship of biblical law according to Greenberg, is that the purpose of the law in Israelite Society is going to be different from the purpose of the law in other societies.

Speaker 1:          27:49          So in Non Israelite Society, the purpose of the law is um, to secure certain sociopolitical benefits. Um, think about the preamble of the American constitution, which states the purpose of the law. It reads almost exactly like the prologues to these ancient collections. You can pick out words that are identical. The purpose of the law is to establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty. So when you see the prologue of board anomal the purpose of the law, established equity, protect the underprivileged, promote the common wheel and welfare. Basically loss of liberty star in the prologue. Established justice. Banish complaints. I like that one. Bring wellbeing, promote the common wheel and welfare. Same again with the quote of Hama. Robbie's a prologue to promote the welfare of the people. Good government, the right way prosperity. But for Israel, the law is, it does include these benefits but is not limited to these benefits.

Speaker 1:          28:47          The law also aims at sanctifying. All right. A concept we dealt with at great length in the last lecture, sanctifying rendering holy or like God, those who abide by its terms. So the laws that are presented in the holiness code are introduced with this exhortation which you don't find in other places. Uh, Leviticus 19 verse two you shall be holy for I the Lord your God, am holy and then the laws began. You shall eat, revere your mother and father, keep my sabbaths, et Cetera, et cetera. But the introduction, you shall be holy for I the Lord your God, am Holy. Being wholly in imitation of God is emphasized repeatedly as the purpose of the laws in the holiness code, especially the holiness Motif is represented as being present at the very inception of the covenant when when Israel is assembled at Mount Sinai, that opening speech that God makes an exodus 19 verse five and six now then if you obey me faithfully and keep my covenant, keep my laws, you shall be my treasured possession among all the peoples.

Speaker 1:          29:47          Indeed, all the earth is mine, but you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the rules that Deema market you as dedicated to me, I, he holy. Now, there are lots of general and specific similarities and parallels between Israelite and ancient near eastern laws, lots of goring oxen, lots of pregnant women who are in the wrong place at the wrong time and getting struck and accidentally miscarrying. Um, but we're going to look at some of the formal and stylistic differences between ancient near eastern and Biblical law. And we can assume just a tremendous amount of common ground. Okay. And some of these are pointed out by Greenburg and some by other scholars, but I've listed them there under features. One distinguishing feature of his Israelite law is the addition of, um, a rationale or a motive clause in many of the laws.

Speaker 1:          30:38          All right? Which again, is not something that's really a featured in the genre of law writing in these other collections. It's not a part of the genre of writing. Those doesn't mean that he didn't have a rationale, but it wasn't how it was presented. So we find this in the Bible, particularly in what we might refer to as the, as the humanitarian laws. And on the whole, these rationales will appeal to historical events like the exodus or creation. You're a few laws that express the idea that the experience of slavery, slavery, and liberation should be the wellspring for moral action. It should be the impetus for moral action. Exodus 2120. You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress him for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. 23, nine you shall not oppress a stranger for you know the feelings of the stranger. Having yourself, yourselves been strangers in the land of Egypt.

Speaker 1:          31:31          And Leviticus 19 contains a similar x rotation. Not to wrong a stranger who resides with you, but love him as yourself for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. Likewise in Deuteronomy five, this is the deck log and Deuteronomy, um, which is talking about Sabbath observance and ensuring that all in your abode rest you, your son, your daughter, your male or female slave, your ox, your ass, or any of your cattle and the stranger and your settlements. So that your male and female slave may rest is you do remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt. And the Lord God freed you from there. Um, also for the Lord your God has God supreme and Lord Supreme, the great, the mighty and the awesome God who shows no favor and takes no bride. Bribe takes no bride also but takes no bribe but upholds the cause of the fatherless and the widow and befriends the stranger providing him with food and clothing.

Speaker 1:          32:21          So you two must have a friend, a stranger, you were strangers in the land of Egypt. We have two rationales there. One is the explicit rationale. If imma Tatsuo Day, this is what I do and this is what you should do. Um, and, and, and there are more many of them referring to the exodus and Egypt and others referring to the notion of imitates CEO d. So it's awesome, illuminating to compare, um, the ancient near eastern and the biblical legal materials in terms of, um, the concern for the disadvantaged, the elimination of, of social class distinctions and a trend towards humanitarianism. Greenburg notes that the Torah is concern for the disadvantage of society is quite marked in the actual laws themselves. Many of the extra biblical legal collections pay homage to this idea and they're prologues doesn't always seem to be appearing. However, in the actual terms of these collections, now these collections are incomplete.

Speaker 1:          33:16          We don't have everything. And again, it may be another literary genre that accomplished some of that work in that culture, the Torah laws, um, and that, oh, and also the laws in those collections, very often, despite the prologues rhetoric that they bring justice to the disadvantaged and so on. Many of the laws clearly served the interests of an upper class. Okay. That's the more important part point. They clearly serve the interest of an upper class. The Torah laws do not contain all the same distinctions of social class among free persons as the contemporary laws, the laws of Vishnu motion, the laws of Hammurabi. These laws distinguish between punishments for crimes committed against upper class and lower class person's not to mention slaves. So if we look at the code of Hammurabi, there's a stretch of, of um, laws. Number one, nine one 95 to up to eight something.

Speaker 1:          34:11          Um, and they're, they're very interesting to read them all in a row. I'll hit some highlights. So if an upper class person, okay, and if an aristocrat has destroyed the, I have a member of the aristocracy, they destroy his eye. If he breaks his bone, they break his bone. But as you move down to one 98, if he destroys the high of a commoner or breaks the bone of a commoner, a commoner, he pays one Mina of silver. And if it's a slave, he pays half the value of the slave onto 200 and 201 if he knocks out and aristocrats tooth, they knock out his tooth. But if it's a commoners tooth, he pays a third of a mean of silver. And so on the Hittite laws too, they are different. There are different amounts fixed by class. In the miscarriage laws, 95 and 99, the middle of Syrian laws also distinguished between the hour. We learned the Mooc Kanombe in the slave. Uh, Leviticus 24 verses 17 to 22, we have their laws of personal liability, bodily injury, assault and battery or bodily injury. And we find a clear and explicit statement to the effect that there shall be one standard for citizen and stranger alike. This is known as the principal of Talon Lex Talionis.

Speaker 1:          35:27          So reading from Leviticus, if anyone names his fellow, if anyone names his fellow as he has done so shall it be done to him? Fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, the injury he inflicted on another shall be inflicted on him. You shall have one standard for stranger and citizens alike. For I the Lord am your God. This was a radical concept and its day. Evidently the punishment should fit the crime no more and no less for all free persons. Granted, slaves are not included regardless of social class equality before the law and this cast the principle of Italian, I hope in a new light, the law of Italian, which is essentially the principle that a person should be punished according to the injury they inflicted. It's been decried as a primitive, archaic reflex of the vengeance or vendetta principle. The notion of an eye for an eye, it's usually cited, are held up as typical of the harsh and cruel standards of the uh, vengeful Old Testament God.

Speaker 1:          36:26          But when you look at it in a comparative light, in its legal context, we see that it's a polemic against the class distinctions that were being drawn in antecedent and contemporary legal systems such as the code of homer ropy. According to the Bible, the punishment should always fit the crime regardless of the social status of the perpetrator on the one hand or the victim on the other. All free citizens who injure are treated equally before the law. They're neither led off lightly nor punished excessively. If you read the middle of Syrian laws, don't want to do that on an empty stomach, a 20 a 21 and f one, you have multiple punishments that are carried out. Someone who causes a miscarriage, they have a monetary fine, they have to pay to talents and 30 meters of led their flogged 50 times, and then they have to do curvey forced labor for the state for a month.

Speaker 1:          37:12          Multiple punishments for sheep stealing. That's even worse if flogged a hundred times and they pull out your hair and there's a monetary fine and you do curvey forced labor for a month. So are these ideas, is this idea that the punishment should be neither too little, nor too much? It should match the crime that all free persons are equal before the law. That one standard should apply regardless of the social status of the perpetrator or the victim. These ideas really primitive legal concepts. In addition to asserting the basic equality before the law for all free citizens, the Bible mandates concern for the disenfranchised. We've already seen that a little bit and the laws of Leviticus 19 verses nine to 10 which says that you have to leave. Do you know, don't go over your fields picking every little last bit. You know, just go through, give it you need, but leave a little bit behind and let the poor and the stranger glean their Deuteronomy is a little less generous.

Speaker 1:          38:06          They substitute for the substitute. The phrase the widow, the orphan, and the stranger in that law were Leviticus, says the poor. Uh, Deuteronomy 24 verses 20 to 22, when you beat down the fruit of your olive trees or gather the Grapes of your vineyard, do not go over them again. That which remains on the tree shall go to the stranger and the orphan and the widow always remember, you are a slave in the land of Egypt. Therefore, do I enjoy new to observe this commandment? So Leviticus supports outright charity for the poor in the form of gleanings kind of a welfare system. Deuteronomy has more of a work fair system in mind. They actually never mentioned the poor. It's only Leviticus that mentions the poor. Uh, for Deuteronomy, it's the those who really can't provide for themselves. I'm the widow, the orphan, and the stranger who, who may not be able to find employment.

Speaker 1:          38:50          The poor should be working, but you can assist them with loans according to Deuteronomy and these should be generous. Here's Deuteronomy is admonition to loan money to the poor even if it means potential loss to yourself because the seventh year is imminent. The sabbatical year in the sabbatical year, all debts were released, canceled, okay. Sort of a economic corrective to restore people to a more equal economic situation. So in the sixth years, some people will feel, I don't really want to lend money and it's going to be canceled next year I won't get my money back. Loans must be made even if the debt will be canceled. For the simple reason that the problem of poverty is a terrible and persistent problem. Deuteronomy 15 verses seven through 11 if there is among you a poor man, one of your brethren, you shall not harden your heart or shut your hand against your poor brethren, but you shall open your hand to him and lend him sufficient for his need, whatever it may be.

Speaker 1:          39:42          Beware, lest you harbor the base thought woo. The seventh year, the year of debt releases approaching so that you are mean to your poor kinsmen and give him nothing you shall give to him freely and your heart shall not be grudging when you give to him for the poor will never cease out of the land, right? The poor will always be with you. This is where it comes from, but it gets misquoted later. Um, it's taken to me in the poor are always with you, so you don't have to do anything. It's not what it means here in Deuteronomy. Lend to them because the poor will never see side of the land. Therefore, I command you, open wide your hand, get busy, give charity. It's a problem that never goes away so you can never rest connected with. This is the biblical trend towards humanitarianism. And there is of course, much in biblical legislation that offends modern sensibilities.

Speaker 1:          40:28          There's no point in pretending that there isn't. For example, as in the rest of the ancient world, slavery existed in Israel. It did even so, and this is not to apologize for it. There is a tendency toward humanitarianism in the laws concerning slavery. The Bible's equivocating on this institution. Um, some societies in their legal systems, it's clear that slaves are the chattel, the property of the master. The Bible, again, equivocates on this question, they affirm some personal rights for the slave, but not all. Uh, in contrast to, for example, the middle of Syrian laws were a master can kill a slave with impunity. The Bible legislates that the master who wounds his slave in any way, even losing a tooth, which is understood to be a minor thing because it's not in any way in a central Oregon. So even if he knocks out a tooth, right, uh, he has to set him free.

Speaker 1:          41:18          That's an exodus 21 verses 26 to 27. Moreover, the slave is entitled to the Sabbath Rest in all of the sabbath legislation. And quite importantly, a fugitive slave cannot be returned to its his master. That's in Deuteronomy three verses 16 to 17. You shall not turn over to his master, a slave who seeks refuge with you from his master. He shall live with you in any place. He may choose among the settlements in your midst, wherever he pleases, you must not ill treat him. This is the opposite of the fugitive slave law, actually in this country in the 19th century, but also in Hammurabi's code, right? I'm Ravi is code 1516 through 19 if a citizen has harbored in his house, either a fugitive male or female slave belonging to the state or a private citizen and has not brought him forth at the summons of the police, that householder shall be put to death.

Speaker 1:          42:09          The term of Israelite Israelite slavery. That is to say an Israelite who has fallen into service to another Israelite through generally indebtedness. That's, that's a form that's slavery took in the, in the ancient world and in the biblical picture, the term was limited to six years by exodus, by the covenant code and the Priestly Code. It's prohibited altogether. No Israelite can be a slave to another Israelite, so it's actually done away with as an institution altogether. In general, the Bible urges humanitarian treatment of the slave. Again for you were once slaves in Egypt is the refrain. Other evidence of the trend towards humanitarianism is the lack of legalized violence in the Bible here, if you compare the middle of Syrian law is you'll see something quite different there. The middle of Syrian loss explicitly authorize inhumane treatment of a deserting wife. You can cut off her ears, um, legalized violence.

Speaker 1:          43:00          In the case of a disc trainee. A dis trainee is a pledge, someone who has been placed in your house because of a debt and is working for you. Um, the, the citizen may do what he wishes, um, as he feels the dis strain he deserves and he pull out his hair, he made mutilate his ears by piercing them. I'm in the middle of Syrian laws, also legalized violence against a wife when she deserves it. A Senor may pull out the hair of his wife, mutilate or twist her ears. There's no liability attaching to him. Legal systems often express their values by the punishments that are positive for various transgressions. And here, Moshe Greenberg has done something very interesting, a little controversial. Not everyone agrees with this, but he's pointed out that the Bible differs from the other extra biblical codes in the value that it places on human life.

Speaker 1:          43:45          And you consider the crimes that are punished by capital punishment and the crimes that are punished by monetary compensation. And he feels this is quite revealing. So I've put this very handy little chart on the board for you listing codes on one side and you'll see the kinds of things that are punished by monetary fine or compensation. In the Hittite laws. Homicide, you pay a certain amount of money to compensate for the desk, right? Um, personal injury, bodily injury, you pay a certain amount of money, um, in the middle of Syria and laws also homicide. It's up to the family. They'd can decide how they want this to be punished, but they can take money. Quote of Hama ropy we only have accidental homicide case. We don't have an intentional homicide cases and we don't know, but bodily injury when it's between equals than the principle of Italian applies.

Speaker 1:          44:32          But when it's not between equals monetary payment as cell on death. On the other hand is um, is the punishment for certain property crimes instead of personal injury and homicide crimes, death for theft in the Hittite laws and for bestie reality. I'm in the middle of Syrian laws also theft and in the code of Hammurabi, theft and cheating. I'll go over some of these in a little more detail. So Greenburg is going to argue that the Bible reverses the view of the other codes and he says because in those life is cheap and property is highly valued. So Hammurabi's code imposes the death penalty for the theft of property for assisting in the escape of a slave, which is it's master's property for cheating a customer over the price of a drink. Middle of Syrian laws, there's death to a wife if she steals from her husband and death to any who purchased the stolen goods.

Speaker 1:          45:23          The Bible never imposes his death penalty for violations of property rights, personal property rights, private property rights, um, only for intentional homicide and certain religious and sexual offenses, which are seem to be direct defenses to God. Greenburg argues that in so doing the Bible is expressing the view that the sanctity of human life is paramount in its value system. The Bible states explicitly that homicide is the one crime for which note monetary punishment can be substituted. You cannot ransom the life of a murderer. He must pay with his life numbers. 35 31 to 34. You may not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of a capital crime. He must be put to death, nor may you accept ransom in place of flight to a city of refuge. Remember, if it's an accidental homicide, there is the lenient seen in the law that that person can run to a city of refuge and remain there until the death of the high priest.

Speaker 1:          46:16          His, the shedding of his blood purchased the land of blood guilt, if you will, because this is a religious crime. Um, and you can't, but you, he can't pay money instead of running to the city of refuge. Um, and, uh, you shall not pollute the land in which you live. There's a notion here of blood guilt of pollution. Blood pollutes the land, and the land can have no expiation for blood that is shed on it, except by the blood of Him who shed it. You shall not defile the land in which you live. In which I myself abide for. I The Lord abide among the Israelite people and outside the Bible, we'd really don't have that absolute ban on monetary compensation for murder. And Greenberg has argued that for the biblical legislators, human life and property are simply incommensurable crimes. And the one realm cannot be compensated by punishment.

Speaker 1:          47:01          In the other realm, a crime in the realm of of life personal injury has to be compensated in the same realm. In the same way, property crimes are not punished by death. Also in the Bible, there is no what I call literal punishment. You'll sometimes see people refer to this as vicarious punishment. I don't think it's vicarious punishment. I call it literal punishment. Little punishment. For example, in the code of homer ropy where, um, someone's ox kills a child, um, then the ox child is killed. That's not vicarious. You're not substituting. It's literal. The the legal subject is the father. He has lost a child. So I have to suffer the literal punishment as a father, I have to lose my child, right? It's not a substitution. It's a literal punishment for what you did to the other. And the Bible explicitly rejects that idea.

Speaker 1:          47:48          In exodus 21, um, and explicitly says that the owner's child is not to be put to death, is not killed. Deuteronomy 24, 16 states that parents shall not be put to death for children or children be put to death for their parents. A person shall be put to death only for his own crime. The equal value of human life and limb is also protected by the principle of tallying that we discussed above in the quote of Hama, ropy and Aristocrat can simply pay money for injuring an inferior. That's not going to be much of a hardship to a wealthy person. And it certainly reflects the low value that's placed on the life and limb of a member of the lower class. [inaudible] only applies between social equals in the code of Hammurabi. But in the Bible, the extension of Townie and all free persons regardless of class, expresses the notion that all persons are of equal value.

Speaker 1:          48:35          In the case of rape, the rapists wife is not rate as happens in the middle of Syrian laws. Again, a literal punishment. Other biblical values are reflected in the emphasis on laws that deal with the plight of the poor, the slave, the alien, the rights and dignity of debtors. And so on. Reach just about the end of my time. Just one last statement. Um, because I don't want to leave you with the impression that the biblical materials speak with one voice. They don't, I mean, Greenberg has tried to pull out some, some common, um, uh, values. Biblical legal materials contain provisions that contradict one another later versions of the law, particularly in d for example, we'll update and revise earlier versions of the law. And I love it. It gets, takes issue with the whole institution of Israelites, slavery that's accepted in the covenant quote.

Speaker 1:          49:22          And in Deuteronomy it says, it's just, no, it can't happen. You can't be all Israelites are servants of God. None of you can be servants to another. All right, so these, these laws had, there's contradiction. Nevertheless, I think what Greenberg is trying to say is that it is still fair. Um, even though the materials are contain contradictions, it's still fair to say that they sound certain common themes, a express certain important principles and values which include the supreme sanctity of human life that's pretty consistently maintained among the codes. The value of persons over property pretty consistently maintained the equality of all free persons before the law consistently maintained. The importance of assisting the disadvantaged in society very consistently maintained. Um, the integration and the interdependence of all aspects of human life all coming within the will of God to legislate very consistently maintained. We come back on Monday. I just want to say a little bit about the narrative context in which the laws are found before we move on into Deuteronomy. Monday evening will be the time at which the midterm exam will be posted on the website and that'll be at 6:00 PM Monday evening. You'll have a 24 hour period of time in which to find, I forget what I said, 30 or 40 minutes. It'll be clear on the instructions to just sit and treat it as if you're in an in class exam situation. Write your essay.
