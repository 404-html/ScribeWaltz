Speaker 1:          00:00          We were talking last time about, uh, profits of the Syrian crisis. We focused on, we've seen, we've talked about two of the northern profits almost in Hosea. And we started talking about Isaiah who was a southern Prophet, a prophet in Judah. And we'll be talking now about the second southern profit of the Assyrian crisis. And that is Miko Amica. And he said to come from the town of more Russia, which is about 25 miles southwest of Jerusalem. So he's in Judah and he's the last of the eighth century profits. He's quite different from the city bread Isaiah. He seems to been a rural, a prophet who spoke for the poor farmers. Now he's prophesying in the second part of the eighth century. So seven 40 to about 700. He's attacking the s the northern kingdom, although he's a southern profit, he attacks Israel for, um, idolatries and says that the kingdom will surely fall because of these.

Speaker 1:          00:54          So he also follows the other profits as we've seen in, in condemning the people for their moral failings, the greedy land owners, a dishonest merchants, the aristocracy. They are all targets of his denunciations as our other leaders, the priests, the judges, a royalty, the royal house, as well as other false profits. But the greatest contrast between Isaiah and Micah. So if you want to differentiate these two southern profits of the Assyrian crisis in your mind, the greatest contrast lies in his view of the city as inherently corrupt. It's inherently sinful. It's inherently doomed to destruction. Isaiah had preached the inviolability of Xeon and Micah is sharply critical of the Davidic Dynasty. He ridiculed the idea of the invite inviolability of xenon. He ridicules the belief that the presence of the sanctuary in Jerusalem somehow protects the city from harm. He says on the contrary, that God will destroy his city and his house if need be.

Speaker 1:          01:54          Micah three verses nine through 12 here, this you rulers of the House of Jacob, you chiefs of the house of Israel who detest justice and make crooked all that is straight who build Zion with crime, Jerusalem with iniquity, her rulers judge for gifts, her priest give rulings for a fee and her profits divine for pay. And yet they rely upon the Lord saying the Lord is in our midst. No calamity shall overtake us assuredly because of use ion shall be plowed as a field. And Jerusalem shall become heaps of ruins. And the Temple Mount, a shrine in the woods. Stark contrast then between site between Isaiah who, who trusts and has confidence that God will never allow his holy city to be destroyed. His sanctuary to be destroyed. His presence in the midst of the city is guarantee that it will survive. And Micah says it's no guarantee of anything.

Speaker 1:          02:45          One of the most famous passages in the book of Micah is in chapter six, eight verses in chapter six. And this is a passage that takes the form of a covenant lawsuit, which we've talked about before, the Reeve. Um, and the structure is as follows. I've put it up on the whiteboard there. The first two verses are the issuing of the summons, the summons to the case. So the profit here is acting as God's attorney and he summons the accused. Any summons, the witnesses, those would be the mountains who are to hear the case against Israel. God's case against Israel. Hear what the Lord is saying, come present my case before the mountains and let the hills here, you pleading here you mountains. The case of the Lord, you from foundations of the earth for the Lord has a case, a lawsuit against his people.

Speaker 1:          03:31          He has a suit against Israel. So those are the opening verses and in verses three to five, we then move on to the plaintiffs charge God's charge or accusation. And this is given again through the attorney. He appeals to Israel's memory of, of all of the events that have manifested his great love for her. That begins with the exodus of course, and continues with the entry into the promise land. And he says, Israel seems to have forgotten all of these deeds that God has performed on her behalf and the obligations that those deeds obviously entail. Israel's conduct in response to this continuous benevolence on God's part is appalling. In verses six to seven you have the defendant's plea. This is Israel, I'm speaking, but Israel really of course, has no case to plead and Israel knows that I'm her only choice is to try to affect reconciliation, but she doesn't know where to begin.

Speaker 1:          04:25          Versus six to seven with what shall I approached the Lord, do homage to God on high shall I approached him with burnt offerings with calves, a year old? Would the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, with myriads of streams of oil? Shall I give my first born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for my sin and the prophetic attorney, right? Because the profit is here acting as the attorney in verse eight responds to this. He has told you, Oh man, what is good and what the Lord requires of you only to do justice and to love goodness and to walk humbly with your God. And the word that has been translated here, as goodness is this word has said, this is the word that we discussed last time in relation to Hosea. And it's a word that seems to refer to that covenantal loyalty, that the loyal love of covenantal partners.

Speaker 1:          05:16          And this is a classic passage that really typifies the prophetic emphasis on morality or the primacy of morality and prophetic thought. The book of Micah itself structurally alternates three prophecies of doom with three prophecies of restoration or hopes it's doom restoration, doing restoration, dune restoration. These, these last prophecies tell of the Glory of Zion to come in the future. These restoration passages may seem a little out of keeping her out of step with the scathing denunciations are condemnations of Judah in the other parts of Micah's prophecy. And so some scholars have suggested that those restoration passages and those references to God's unconditional promise to preserve the Davidic kingdom and the optimistic predictions of universal peace. Um, these must be interpretations by later editor. And it's true that certain parts we see again in Isaiah, but this is always a very difficult case or issue because we know that the prophetic writings do fluctuate wildly between denunciation and constellation.

Speaker 1:          06:25          So I think that a shift in theme alone is not ever a certain basis for assuming interpolation, outright contradiction perhaps. But a shift in theme or tone is, is never a solid basis for assuming interpolation. Anachronism is a very good guide to interpretation. So Micah explicitly refers to the Babylonian exile, of course, and that's going to be in five 86 and he's in the eighth century. Um, he's also going to refer to the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem. The walls of Jerusalem aren't even destroyed until five 86 for anyone to even speak about rebuilding them. So those little units or passages may of course represent late, late editorial interpretations, but in its present form. And that, that nice structure of alternation, of, of denunciation, restoration, denunciation, restoration of pattern, that happens three times. And that structure is, I think, typical of the common paradox that we find in the prophetic writings where they try to balance God's stern judgment.

Speaker 1:          07:23          On the one hand is punishment with his merciful love and salvation of his people. A further paradox lies in the very preservation of prophecies like Mike is Prophecy, prophecy. Um, these prophecies were probably preserved by priests in the temple even though priests were very often among the targets of the profits in their denunciations, particularly mica. All right, so we've talked about the profits who've responded to the Assyrian crisis right towards the end of the eighth century to in the north too, in the south. Jerusalem survived the siege of seven Oh one when the Assyrians laid siege, I'm in 701 and that gave credence to the royal ideology and the idea that God was with Zion was with Jerusalem and was with the house of David and would preserve them. But even so, Judah moves into the next century, into the six hundreds in a considerably weakened state after the siege.

Speaker 1:          08:20          Um, and it's during that century, the first half of the next century that is Syria reached the zenith of its of its power in Judah. You have king Monash, it raining that King Manasseh rain for nearly 50 years. We're not sure of exact dates, but somewhere around the six nineties to the six forties, about six 40, 50 years now, remarkably, the Deuteronomistic historian devotes only 18 verses to this king who reigned for 50 years. And all of those verses are entirely negative. Uh, and that's in great contrast to their treatment of his father has a Kia and his grandson who follows him, um, Josiah, uh, Menasha was apparently a loyal vassal of Assyria. And it, according to the biblical writer, he reversed the reforms of his father has a Kaia who is said by the writer to have, um, you know, destroyed idolatry and so on. Um, but he said, who have reversed that and to have adopted a Syrian norms as we move through this century and move towards the latter half of this century is Syria, which is overextended itself, is beginning to decline.

Speaker 1:          09:28          And some of the other states in the ancient near east are able to break away from Egypt, breaks away, Babylon breaks away. Josiah comes to the throne in Judah in seven 40 he sees a serious weakness. He decides to take advantage of that and asserts Judean independence carries out a series of reforms we've talked about several times in six 22 which include purging the cult, perhaps of a Syrian religious influences, centralizing worship of Yahweh only and in Jerusalem and so on. So this centralization of the cult served probably a political political agenda as well of asserting independence from a Syria. Syria is continuing to decline towards the end of this century. And in six 12 the capital Nineveh will fall. The Babylonians managed to conquer these Syrians. And by destroying Nineveh, it's actually an alliance of meads and Babylonians. So things are going quite well. Josiah is king, he's a favored king.

Speaker 1:          10:26          But just a few years later, he will die in a battle against the Egyptians at Mcgee. So just a little bit of historical background for you as we talk about the next profits. Alright. So Josiah, the king who's highly favored will die in six oh nine. Now Zephaniah was a Judean Prophet who prophesied during the reign of King Josiah. So we're going to be moving on now to Zephaniah and Jeremiah as, as the Babylonian, uh, profits of the Babylonian crisis. So we're going to throw in a couple of prophetic characters along the way, but there'll be the two main profits of the Babylonian crisis. Obviously in the south. All we have, and I was a southern kingdom, Judah, um, but I'll be picking up on two other profits in a moment as well. So he prophesied during the time of King Josiah. Um, some of his prophecies seem to date to the time we think before Josiah's reforms in six 22.

Speaker 1:          11:16          And those prophecies tend to be very pessimistic and very grim. Judah is condemned. It's condemned for apostasy, it's condemned for decadence. Um, all of the things that that flourished under King Manasseh, God is wrathful and his, his wrath is imminent. There will be a universal destruction according to Stefania. All life hand, animal and human will be exterminated. So as we saw in the book of Amos This Day of Yahweh, way this day of the Lord, which has been so eagerly awaited, will not in fact be a day of triumph, but a day of dark destruction and despair. Zephaniah one 15 to 18 that day shall be a day of Wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of calamity and desolation. A day of darkness and deep gloom. A day of densest clouds, a day of horn blasts send alarms against the fortified towns in the lofty corner towers.

Speaker 1:          12:10          I will bring distress on the people and they shall walk like blind men because they sinned against the Lord. Their blood shall be spilled like dust and their fat like Dung. Moreover, they're silver and gold shall not avail to save them on the day of the Lord's wrath and the fire of his passion, the whole land shall be consumed for he will make a terrible end of all who dwell in the land can see why people didn't enjoy listening to these profits. Um, but at the same time, like the other profits, Zephaniah also offered hope. There will be a humble remnant which will seek refuge in God. Um, these will, these, these, um, Jewish exiles, uh, he says will be delivered from their oppressors and even gentiles will join in the worship of God. Zephaniah three verses 11 to 13. In that day, you will no longer be shamed for all the deeds by which you have defied me.

Speaker 1:          13:02          For then I will remove the proud and exalted within you and you will be haughty. No more on my sacred mount, but I will leave within you a poor, humble folk. So this idea of purging the dross and leaving the, the pure remnant and they shall find refuge in the name of the Lord. The remnant of Israel shall do no wrong and speak no false hood. A deceitful tongue shall not be in their mouths only such as these shall graze and lie down with none to trouble them. Uh, there will also be an end gathering of any exiled. Verse 20. At that time I will gather you and at that time I will bring you home for I will make you renowned and famous among all the peoples on earth. When I restore your fortunes before their very eyes. There's one passage in particular that seems extraordinarily a joyous, uh, it seems to announce the salvation as, as happening now is present.

Speaker 1:          13:51          And so a lot of scholars think that this was, um, um, Zephaniah his reaction to Josiah and Josiah is reform, which seemed to him to perhaps be the very salvation for which the nation was longing. Chapter three verses 14 and 15, shout for joy fairs ion cry aloud, o Israel, rejoice and be glad with all your heart fair. Jerusalem, the Lord has a node. The judgment against you, he has swept away your foes. Israel is sovereign. The Lord is within you. You need fear. Misfortune. No more. So this, this sounds very much like a, um, a reaction to these reforms initiated by Josiah. This is hailed as the very restoration of God's presence in the community of Judah, uh, that that was desired. The judgment has been a node. These terrible things I've been prophesying will not happen. Another short prophetic book we should mention now is the book of [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          14:42          Um, it's very different from the other prophetic books. It doesn't really contain prophecies and it doesn't really upgrade the people for their failings, which are two things that most of the other prophets do. Um, the book of Nahum is a short little book and it's really a three, a series of three poems. And these are the first one is an acrostic poem and alphabetical poem. Um, you know, lines beginning with successive letters of the alphabet, the Hebrew Alphabet, and these poems rejoice over the fall of Nineveh in in six 12, um, the capital of the cruel Assyrian Empire. The Assyrians were actually quite widely hated in the ancient near east. They were noted for their exceptional brutality there in humanity, particularly in their conquest and empire building. They deported populations wholesale. They were guilty of all sorts of atrocities like mutilating their captives. They would butcher women and children, all sorts of horrendous deeds.

Speaker 1:          15:40          We have lots of testimony about this, both in a Syrian sources, but other ancient near eastern sources, texts as well as artwork. So not home in this poem is celebrating the Avenger, avenging and wrathful God who has finally turned around to destroy this terrible enemy of, of Israel. And indeed the world according to knock him. It's quite true that God had used a Syria as his tool. He had used a Syria to discipline the Kingdom of Israel, right? They did destroy Israel and to discipline Judah for Judas sins. But God is ultimately the universal sovereign. And so a serious savagery, even if it was part of God's disciplining of his children, is a serious savagery is itself something that must be punished. So for now, come the fall of Nineveh is God's vengeance upon a Syria for her barbaric in humanity. And the book of Naca, uh, has often been praised for its very vivid, poetic style.

Speaker 1:          16:39          It describes these armed legions that march against Nineveh and plundered. It's treasures and some of the most exciting archeology that's been going on has been the digging up of, of Nineveh. I think the dig has up obviously stopped for reasons having to do with the climate and that part of the world. But, um, the, the findings of, of Nineveh and the stacking of Nineveh and how, you know, shallow pits were dug and treasures thrown into them and covered over by the gates of the city as people were fleeing. And many of these things, when you read the description of Nineveh and look at some of the archeological data, it's, it's quite fascinating, but on looks forward to a happy era of freedom for Judah. And he says in two verse 15 for never again shall the wicked come against you. Well, this isn't true. And in fact, in a few years Josiah is going to be killed.

Speaker 1:          17:27          Um, Judah's going to be made subject to Egypt and in fact, Babylon by six Oh five, um, Babylon manages to extract, um, you know, tribute from Judah as a, as a vassal. Um, so in a way we have here really a glaring error and it's important to note that this error in not home, it wasn't updated. It wasn't, um, uh, repaired in order to protect his prophetic reputation. So we see this interesting tension. We sometimes see a prophetic books, um, being edited, revised, um, having interpretations put into them partly out of this conviction that their words must be relevant and continue to have some relevance. And other times there seems to be good evidence that prophetic oracles were preserved rather faithfully. But with the fall of Nineveh, national confidence was probably boosted a. And then things quickly turned sour with the death of Josiah and six oh nine, which was a terrible shock.

Speaker 1:          18:25          You have Judah lying trapped as it were between two great powers, Egypt in the South West Babylon in the north east and in six oh five, as I said, Babylon managed to defeat Egypt and reduced Judah to the status of a tributary vassal under the king you theme, um, King Jehoiakim rebels. And in response, the Babylonians laid siege to Jerusalem. There will be two sieges of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, just as we've had two sieges earlier to see just one in five 97, one and five 87, both under Nebuchadnezzar, he lays siege to Jerusalem. And five 97 it doesn't destroy Jerusalem. He kills the, the king takes the king's son into captivity in Babylon and installs a puppet king. I'm still under the assumption that things could be kept under control. So the puppet King Zedekiah is on the throne, but he also decides to rebel and Assert Judas independence against the Babylonians.

Speaker 1:          19:27          So neighborhood Netzero returns, and this is in five 87 and now the city is in fact captured. The sanctuary is completely destroyed and the bulk of the population is exiled. And this is what brings to end, uh, nearly 400 years of independent of an independent Hebrew nation. The book of Habakkuk Cook was written during this period, sort of 602, the destruction somewhere in those years. That's the period in which the Babylonians attack Jerusalem twice. And Habakkuk is another unusual prophetic book. It doesn't contain prophecies so much as it contains philosophical musings on God's behavior. And we're going to see this increasing. Now as we move into the next section of the Bible. When we complete the prophetic section, we'll be encountering writings of very different genres and some of them do contain these philosophical musings on God's conduct. Have a cook one and two are a kind of poetic dialogue between the profit and yeah way and the prophet complains bitterly about God's inaction.

Speaker 1:          20:33          Verses two and three of the first chapter, How long o Lord Shall I cry out and you not listen. Shall I shout to you violence and you not save? Why do you make me see iniquity? Why do you look upon wrong rating and violence are before me. Strife continues and contention goes on and skipping down to verses 13 and 14 you whose eyes are too pure to look upon evil who cannot countenance wrongdoing, why do you countenance treachery and standby idle while the one in the wrong devours the one on the right, you have made mankind like the fish of the sea, like creeping things that have no ruler. So God responds to these charges by saying that the Babylonians are the instruments of his justice, even though they ascribed there might and their success to their gods rather than to Yak way. Now we've already seen in other books.

Speaker 1:          21:24          The idea that I'm a conquering nation is, is serving as the instrument of God's punishment, but Habbakuk is a little bit unusual because he doesn't couch this idea in the larger argument that Judah deserves this catastrophic punishment. There's a great difference between Haba Cook and the Deuteronomistic historian, for example, because Haba Cook doesn't assert that the people are suffering for their sins. Haba Cook is struggling with what appears to him to be a basic lack of justice, right? The Deuteronomistic a story and wants to assert God's justice and whatever suffering happens is justifiable. A cook is resisting that idea. We're going to see that resistance really come to a climax next week when we talk about the book of Job, but Hypo Cook in one for struggles with this decision fails and justice never emerges for the villain hedges in the just man. Therefore, judgment emerges deformed. It's not merely that the wicked and the righteous suffer the same fate.

Speaker 1:          22:23          It's that the wicked really seemed to fair better than the just, and that reduces humankind to the level of fish and creeping things for whom sheer power and not morality is the principal consideration. And having made this charge Habbakuk awaits God. God's answer in chapter two, verses one to five, he says, I will stand on my watch, take up my station at the post and wait to see what he will say to me, what he will reply to my complaint. The Lord answered me and said, write the prophecy down and scribe it clearly on tablets so that it can be read easily. The righteous man is rewarded with life for his fidelity. How much less then shall the defiant go unpunished? Not a terribly deep answer. The righteous simply have to have faith that justice will prevail and this faith has sis to stain them through the trials that challenged that very idea.

Speaker 1:          23:15          We'll see a deeper answer to this same problem in the book of job. The third chapter then shifts gears. So much so that once again, scholars say it must be an interpolation. Um, but again, I would warn that dramatic shifts in tone and theme or not that uncommon in the prophetic books, and we'd have to be careful. But in this third chapter, God is described as a warrior. God, uh, he thunders from the east. He hurls his spear. He seeks vengeance on Israel's oppressors. It may be that this is some editors to respond to Hubba cooks skepticism that y'all way will bring justice and bring it soon. That he's waiting. How long? Why is this taking you so long? Why are you not acting? And this image of I'm an avenging warrior. God answers Hubba cooks opening question. How long will God stand by and watch while the Babylonians rape and pillage?

Speaker 1:          24:05          Uh, but on the other hand, it's possible that it's Habbakuk himself. And again, the book exhibits that same paradoxical tension we've seen through so many of the prophetic books. Specifically, he holds out the paradoxical view that God's injustice, God's justice is slow in coming, but the righteous must have complete faith in its ultimate execution. But he's raised the issue of theodicy the problem of evil, the problem of suffering. Ultimately he sees the problems resolution only in some vision of the future and avenging God when justice will be done. That is typical of some texts that we will see later, particularly apocalyptic literature, which is going to emphasize patient waiting for an end time where there will be a cataclysmic final acts that will bring justice and judgment. Now the prophet who lived at the time of the final destruction of Judah and saw the fall of Jerusalem at the hands of the Babylonians in five 87 was the prophet Jeremiah.

Speaker 1:          25:03          Another one, another long prophetic books. We have our three long prophetic books. Isaiah of the Assyrian crisis, Jeremiah of the Babylonian crisis and Ezekiel writing from exile in Babylon. And Jeremiah was born of a priestly family in a village near Jerusalem, Anatolia. And he began prophesying while he was still a boy. Now he was a contemporary of King Josiah. And, and so he saw the, uh, the renaissance that briefly occurred under his guidance, the sweeping reform, the eradication of a Syrian influences that had been welcomed by King Monash, Shia, the renewal of the covenant. Uh, all of these activities that are so highly favored by the biblical writer. And when Josiah died, Jeremiah also lamented his passing along with the rest of the nation. Jeremiah witnessed the final destruction and the exile. Um, the book of Jeremiah is a collection of very different types of material. There's really no clear organization.

Speaker 1:          26:01          There's no clear chronological order, not that kind of thing. You've been just sort of sit down and read from beginning to end and hope it will make sense. There are prophecies. There are oracles and diatribes against foreign nations. There are stories by a graphical narratives. There's some poetry, uh, and at the very end, a little brief historical appendix, which really resembles second kings chapter 24 and 25. So the literary history of, of the book itself is also quite complex because there's a great variation in our ancient witnesses. The CEP to again, which is the Greek translation of the Bible, Third Century BCE, Greek translation of the Bible is it's Jeremiah is much shorter than the version of Jeremiah. Uh, and it's arranged differently internally. The arrangement is different. There are also significant differences between the Hebrew texts that we have now and some fragments of Jeremiah that had been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.

Speaker 1:          26:57          So this attests to the very open ended nature of written compositions. In antiquity, we find three main types of material. However, in Jeremiah, the poetic oracles that I'm generally are attributed to Jeremiah. Then biographical anecdotes and narratives about him, which are attributed to his menu Ansas and assistant whose name I don't think I put up your morale, Ben and Ben, simply meaning son of. So Barak, the son of Nuria whose uh, whose name comes up quite a bit in the book of Jeremiah and he is a scribe who assists Jeremiah and it's thought that perhaps a biographical narrative sections were composed by [inaudible] Maria. And then we also have certain editorial notes about Jeremiah Jeremiah that are in the style of the Deuteronomistic historian, Deuteronomistic editor, Jeremiah in general, it seems to have very close connections with the language and the ideology of Deuteronomy. So if we look quickly at the structure of the book, for the most part, the first 25 chapters, Jeremiah one through 25 contain an introduction and an account of Jeremiah's call, but then also poetic, Oracle's with some biographical snippets thrown in there as well, not snippets, narratives, biographical narratives as well as poetic.

Speaker 1:          28:16          Oracle's 26 to 29. We have stories of his, um, encounters, I should say, run ins with other profits and with authority figures of various types. Chapters 30 to 33 are oracles of hope and consolation. 34 to 45 are more pros, stories and these stories center around. And after the time of the final destruction, then we have several chapters, 46 to 51 that contain Oracle's against nations. Some of these scholars think might be from other writers. And then again, as I say, it concludes with this historical appendix about the fall of Jerusalem that's extracted from second kings. Uh, Jeremiah preached the inevitable doom and destruction of the nation because of its violation of the covenant, which was a very charter for her existence. And his descriptions were quite vivid and quite terrifying. He denounced Israel's leaders, the professional profits in particular with whom he has many, uh, encounters.

Speaker 1:          29:22          Um, the professional profits are liars. He says, because they prophesied piece. He has some negative references to priests as well, but he's especially critical of king you Jolla Keem who's the son of Josiah. He can be compared to mica because he also attacked this idea of this popular ideology of the Inviolability of Zion. As long as injustice and oppression are practiced in Judah, the presence of the temple is no guarantee of anything. Judah will suffer the faith that she deserves for failure to fulfill her covenantal obligations. So God tells Jeremiah to go stand at the gate of the temple and speak these words. And this is a passage that's often referred to as the temple sermon. It's from chapter seven, thus said, the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, mend your ways and your actions. And I will let you dwell in this place. Don't put your trust in illusions and say the temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord.

Speaker 1:          30:21          Are these buildings? No. If you really mend your ways and your actions, if you execute justice between one man and another, if you do not oppress the stranger, the orphan and the widow, you hear the language of Deuteronomy, right? Those three are always together and Deuteronomy drawing very heavily on the same language. If you do not oppress the stranger, the orphan and the widow, if you do not shed the blood of the innocent in this place, if you do not follow other gods to your own hurt, then only will I let you dwell in this place in the land that I gave your father's for all time. See, you are relying on illusions that are to no avail. Will you steal and murder and commit adultery and swear falsely again illusion to the deck log, right? Those four terms in the decalogue, will you steal and murder and commit adultery and swear falsely and sacrificed a ball and follow other gods whom you have not experienced and then come and stand before me in this house which bears my name and say we are safe, safe to do all these apart things.

Speaker 1:          31:17          Do you consider this house? Which bears my name to be a den of thieves? As for me, I have been watching declares the Lord. So he attacked this doctrine of the inviolability of Zion, and that would have been, I kind of clastic to say the least, but he pointed to history as proof for his assertion. He cites the example of Shiloh as an example, if you remember during the period of the judges when the Ark of the covenant was peripatetic and would stay at different places, but for some time it came to rest at Shiloh with the priest, Eli and his sons. And in that time the Philistines managed to destroy the sanctuary and capture the ark and carry it off into Philistine territory. So the presence of the Ark of the covenant is no guarantee of anything and the belief that God would not allow his temple, his city, his anointed ruler to be destroyed.

Speaker 1:          32:04          Jeremiah says is a deception. It's an illusion. He, his political message resembles very much the message of his predecessors. He says that the nation's pathetic attempts to resist the great powers and to enter into alliances with the one against the other. These were all completely futile and to dramatically illustrate the destruction and the slavery that were inevitable. He paraded around Jerusalem first in a wooden yoke and then in an iron yoke. He does this in chapters 27 and 28 this is a symbol of the slavery, the yoke of the master that is to come in chapter 27 verse six he claims that God has power over all the earth and has given the earth to Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. God's servant. As you can imagine, referring to the destroyer of the nation as God's servant would have been shocking, not to say dangerous. You can imagine parallels in our own time where people would see the god most commonly understood to be the god of most Americans, being the one who orchestrated attacks against that, so it would have that same kind of feel and power to people and in several passages, Jeremiah exhorts the king to submit to the Babylonian forces.

Speaker 1:          33:17          This is acceptance of God's will, the forces that are surrounding Jerusalem, um, to ensure the preservation of his words, which were not popular. Jeremiah had his amendments, this borough write down everything that God spoke to him. Chapter 36 gives us an insight into this process. It's kind of interesting because, um, Jeremiah, Jeremiah, Jeremiah's words are transcribed. God specifically tells Jeremiah how, how to do this. Get a scroll. He says, and write upon it all the words that I have spoken to you concerning Israel and Judah and all the nations from the time I first spoke to you in the days of Josiah to this time. Now it's the time of King Yo Jakeem. And then in verse four we read. So Jeremiah called Barak, the son of Nuria and Barack wrote down in the scroll at Jeremiah is dictation. All the words which the Lord had spoken to him.

Speaker 1:          34:08          Now Jeremiah is in hiding at this time because he's politically very unpopular. So he instructs Barack to take the scroll to the temple and to stand there and to read it to the people. The king's officials are there. They report to the king about the submersive, the subversive message, which has been delivered by Barbara. So brook goes into hiding, the scroll is torn into strips and burned God orders Jeremiah to get another scroll and repeat the process. And he does verse 32 of Chapter 36. So Jeremiah got another scroll and gave it to the scribe by real son of Neriah. And at Jeremiah is dictation. He wrote in it the whole text of the scroll that King you Jolla Keem of Judah had burned and more of the like was added. So, and then some right, they got came back with even more. So it's possible that these, some scholars suggest that what was written, um, would have been the contents of chapters one to 25, which really contains the irregular material, the oracles.

Speaker 1:          35:03          Um, but in any event, this story gives us some insight into the profit. The process of prophecy. It doesn't appear to have been really off the cuff. The compositions of the profits were literary compositions that were committed to memory. They could then be dictated again. And on an archeological note, I should point out that one of the most exciting fines I think, um, is a claim. In 1975, they found a clay bula, which is like a clay imprint of, um, baroque son of Nuria. The scribe is what it says on the clay imprint. Another one was found in 1996 it was said to be found in a burnt house in Jerusalem, which would've been around the time of the destruction. And it just showed up on the antiquities market. So some question, whether it's genuine or not, the second one that was found has a fingerprint on it.

Speaker 1:          35:49          And people say, well, that could be the fingerprint of [inaudible], son of Neriah. Anyway, this is the fun stuff you get to do if you do archeology. But there are plenty of people who think that these probably are the seals of the scribe, but Roxanne of an area that he would've used to stamp anything, uh, that he would have a transcribed or written. So Jeremiah was rejected. He was despised. He was persecuted by fellow Judeans. Naturally, they would have seen him as a trader. Um, he was flogged. He was imprisoned, uh, often in his life. He was in hiding. He was a very troubled person and he lived in very difficult times. But he, we also get an insight into his, his emotional state, which we don't for many of the other prophets. He suffered immensely. He weeps over Jerusalem. In chapter eight a and nine, we get a sense of the turmoil that he suffers, particularly because of a group of passages that are referred to as the confessions of Jeremiah.

Speaker 1:          36:44          And these are sort of scattered throughout, um, some in chapters 11 and 12, 15, 17, 18, 20. But these are passages that reveal his interstate. Some people question their authenticity, but in any event, they paint a very fascinating portrait of the Prophet. He curses the day that he was born. He accuses God of deceiving him, of enticing him to act as God's messenger, only to be met with humiliation and shame. But he can't hold it in God's words, rage inside him. And he must prophesied. It would be better had he not been born at all than to suffer this ceaseless pain. Chapter 20 verses seven through 18 just selections from there, you enticed me, Oh lord and I was enticed. You overpowered me and you prevailed. I have become a constant laughingstock. Everyone jeers at me for every time I speak, I must cry out. I must shout lawlessness and ray pine for the word of the Lord causes me constant disgrace and contempt.

Speaker 1:          37:46          I thought I will not mention him no more. Well, I speak in his name, but his word was like a raging fire in my heart. Shut up, shut up in my bones. I could not hold it in. I was helpless. I heard the whispers of the crowd terror all around, informed. Let us inform against him. A curse would be the day that I was born a curse. It'd be the man who brought my father the news and said, a boy is born to you and gave him such joy. Let that man become like the cities which the Lord over through without relenting because he did not kill me before birth. So that my mother might be my grave and her womb big with me for all time. Why did I ever issue from the womb to see misery and woe to spend all my days in shame? Nevertheless, despite all of his very harsh criticisms of, of the establishment authorities or royal house and even scribes, other profits who are labeled as liars by Jeremiah, his words were preserved by scribes, by the Deuteronomistic editors.

Speaker 1:          38:47          Shortly after the fall of Judah, Jeremiah was taken forcibly to Egypt and he lived his final years out in Egypt. He didn't give up his job, though he kept announcing people. He, um, we have, uh, records of his denouncing his fellow Judean exiles down in Egypt, uh, for worshiping the Queen of Heaven. And as before it seems very few heated him there, but like the earlier prophets, Jeremiah also balanced his message with a message of constellation. And there's some very interesting and unique features of Jeremiah's message of consolation. These are particularly these passages or found particularly in chapters 30 to 33 where we have more hopeful, um, prophecies. He envisages a restoration. The exile will come to an end. And in fact, Jeremiah is the first to actually set a time limit to what we might refer to as the dominion of the idolaters and idolaters holding sway over God's people.

Speaker 1:          39:42          And that time limit, and he says is 70 years. Jeremiah writes a letter to the first group of deportees. So remember the first siege and five 97 you have the king killed his son and many people taken into exile in Babylon. Jeremiah from Jerusalem writes a letter to that first group of exiles and it's quite remarkable. It's found in chapter 29 and it's quite remarkable for its council. It's advice to the exiles to settle down and their adopted home and just wait out. The time there is an appointed end, he warns the people not to listen to prophets who say you will return shortly. It's just a lie. The Israelites have to serve the king of Babylon and by doing so, they will live. So in Jeremiah 29 versus four to seven, thus said, the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to the whole community, which I exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon.

Speaker 1:          40:33          Nice. He's writing to the exiles, build houses and live in them. Plant gardens and eat their fruit. Take wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there. Do not decrease and seek the welfare of the city to which I have exiled you said of seek the welfare of Jerusalem. Seek the welfare of the city to which I have exiled you and pray to the Lord and its behalf for in its prosperity, you shall prosper. In other words, you're in for the long haul and you shouldn't be deceived by the idle dreams or the false prophets, uh, who tell you that return is imminent. God has other plans. They are plants for welfare, not for evil. And they will give you a future and a hope. At the end of 70 years, Jeremiah said there will be a great war of all the nations and Judah and Israel will be returned to their land.

Speaker 1:          41:28          Xi'An he declared would be acknowledged as the holy city and a new Davidic king would rein new covenant would be made with Israel as well. And this time Jeremiah says it's a covenant that will be etched on the heart in coded as it were into human nature. Jeremiah 31 verses 31 to 34 see, a time is coming declares the Lord. When I will make a new covenant with the House of Israel and the House of Judah, it will not be like the Covenant I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt to covenant which they broke so that I rejected them, declares the Lord, but such as the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after these days declares the Lord. I will put my teaching into their inmost being and inscribe it upon their hearts and then I will be their God and they shall be my people.

Speaker 1:          42:18          And no longer will they need to teach one another and say to one another, he'd the Lord for all of them, from the least of them to the greatest shall he'd me, declares the Lord. So this is a remarkable idea. It seems to express some, some dissatisfaction with the element of free will, which is otherwise so crucial to the biblical notion of Covenant and Morality. The idea that humans freely choose their actions. After all, when you think about some of the major themes set out in the Hebrew Bible at the very beginning and the opening chapters, um, this would seem to be, uh, a cardinal principle choice, but free choice does mean of course that there will be bad choices and there will be disobedience and evil and people can get tired of that. And Jeremiah was so, his utopian ideal is inspiring, but it does eliminate the element of free will.

Speaker 1:          43:07          It seems to describe a situation in which humans are almost hardwired to obey God's covenant. And that's attention that will also be developed in some later texts. I just note it here in a very beautiful passage. Jeremiah describes a future restoration of the temple, the bringing up offerings. Again, the singing of psalms and praise. And this is in contrast to chapter 25 they're in chapter 25 he warned that God will banish the sound of mirth and gladness, the voice of bride, groom and bride leaving the land desolate ruin. And now in his article of Constellation, Jeremiah says, and again, there shall be heard in this place in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without men, without inhabitants, without beast, the sound of Mirth and gladness, the voice of bridegroom and bride, the voice of those who cry give thanks to the Lord of hosts, for the Lord is good for his kindness, his everlasting, as they bring Thanksgiving offerings to the house of the Lord, for I will restore the fortunes of the land as of old, said the Lord.

Speaker 1:          44:11          So just to kind of summarize these, these profits leading up to the time of the destruction, because next, next time we'll be talking about the exile and and later the return. But the fall of Jerusalem shattered the national and, and territorial basis of Israel's culture and religion. The had burned the temple to the ground. They carried away most of the people to exile, to live in exile in Babylon, leaving behind mostly members of of the lower classes to eke out a living, um, as best they could. And it was the completion of a tragedy that had begun centuries earlier and it was interpreted as a fulfillment of the covenant curses. It was the end of the Davidic monarchy, although the Deuteronomistic historian does close with this note that the son of your holy Jakeem was alive and living in Babylon, kind of holding out hope that the line had actually been killed out.

Speaker 1:          45:06          Um, I haven't, uh, been completely wiped out, but the institutions seemed to have come to an end for now. Um, it was the end of the temple, the end of the priesthood, the end of Israel as a nation is that an autonomous nation. And so the Israelites were confronted with a great test as I've stressed before. One option would be to see in these events a signal that Yahweh had abandoned them to or had been defeated by the god of the Babylonians and Marduk would replace Yaffe way as the Israelites assimilated themselves into their new home, and certainly there were Israelites who went this route, but others who were firmly rooted and exclusive. Yeah, wisdom did not, and they're the ones who left us there. Literature. How could this faith survive outside the framework of Israelite National Culture, away from the temple and the land uprooted and scattered?

Speaker 1:          45:58          Could Israelite religion survive without these national foundations and institutions and on foreign soil or would it go the way of other national religions? You hear the pain and the despair that would have been experienced at this time. In the words of the Psalmist, Psalm one 37 which is written at this time by the rivers of Babylon. There we sat, sat and wept as we thought of Zion there on the poplars, we hung up our liars for our captors. Ask us there for songs, our tormentors for amusement. Sing us one of the songs of Zion. How can we sing a song of the Lord on Alien Soil? If I forget you o Jerusalem, let my right hand, whether that my tongue stick to my palate, if I cease to think of you, if I do not keep Jerusalem in memory, even at my happiest hour. And it was the message of the profits that helped some Israelites make sense of their situation in a manner that kept them distinct and invulnerable to assimilation.

Speaker 1:          46:55          And this was probably the reason for the preservation of the prophetic writings, even though they had often been despised or an unheated in their own lifetimes. Yeah, why hadn't been defeated? They claimed the nation's calamities. We're not disproof of his power and covenant. They were proof of it. The prophets had spoken truly when they had said that destruction would follow if the people didn't turn from their moral and religious violations of God's law. So that rather than undermining faith in God, the defeat and the exile when interpreted in the prophetic manner had the potential to convince Jews of the need to show absolute and undivided devotion to God and his commandments. So that paradoxically, the moment of greatest national despair could be transformed by the profits into an occasion for it. The renewal of religious faith, the great contribution of the profits was their emphasis on God's desire for morality as expressed in the ancient covenant there.

Speaker 1:          47:54          The great contribution of Jeremiah was his insistence on God's everlasting covenant with his people, even outside the land of Israel. And despite the loss of national religious symbols, the temple, the holy city, the Davidic King, and this insistence that the faithful person's relationship with God wasn't broken even in an idolatrous land when added to Jeremiah as notion of a new covenant, provided the exiles with the ideas that would transform the nation of Israel into the religion of Judaism. And next time we're going to turn to to post destruction profits who also helped the nation formulate a viable response to the tragedy that had befallen them. This is a point at which we can begin to use words like Judaism.
