Speaker 1:          00:00          We're going to move on now to our second literary profit. And this is the Prophet Hosea. He was a native of the northern kingdom. So Amos and Hosea, you're going to associate with the Assyrian crisis and they profits of the northern Kingdom of Israel. He's prophesying in the time of Jeroboam. The second Jeroboam reigned until about seven 47. Okay. Um, and then he continues to the last king who is confusingly named Hosea. Uh, so he prophesies in the seven forties, thirties, 20s, somewhere in there. He doesn't seem to have seen the fall of Israel, though now, Hosea is considered by many to be the most difficult of the prophetic books. The Hebrew is very difficult. Um, and it sometimes seems rather garbled. It's very hard to render it intelligibly. But structurally we can divide the book into two main sections. Chapters one to three have a certain coherence to them.

Speaker 1:          00:51          And then chapters four through 14, one to three tells of the profits marriage to a promiscuous woman named [inaudible]. Um, this is, uh, his marriage is a metaphor for Israel's relationship with God. And these chapters also contain an indictment or a lawsuit. Remember this Reeve form lawsuit form. We're going to see it both in Hosea and Amos. Isaiah today. Then chapters four through 14 contain Oracle's primarily Oracle's against the nations, but also against the Kingdom of Israel. We're going to be focusing primarily on chapters one to three since these are so distinctive to Hosea and we'll refer occasionally to some of the other chapters where they might pronounce. I'm an important theme for Hosea, so again, the historical background for the book of Hosea is the Assyrian threat. The Assyrians are wiping out a number of the smaller states in the ancient near east, the middle of the 18th century, and Israel obviously could not be far behind, and the line that was taken by Hosea was to condemn the attempts that were made by various kings, by Israel's kings to withstand defeat or to avoid defeat at the hands of a Syria.

Speaker 1:          02:00          If a Syria was going to conquer Israel, Hosea said then it was God's just punishment and to fight against it, to fight against the inevitable with simply another kind of rejection of God. Another rejection of his plans and purpose. It demonstrate a lack of trust or faith in the power of God. Hosea 10 verse 13 spells out the disastrous consequences of trusting in human power or foreign alliances rather than trusting in God. And this is a theme that we'll see occurring again and again. Hosea 10 13, you'd have plowed wickedness. You have reaped iniquity, and you shall eat the fruits of treasure treachery because you relied on your way on your host of warriors. He was suggesting in action. Now that surely would have been viewed by the king and uh, the court as against all reason. But this was Jose, his insistence Israel was faced with a choice, uh, who and whom should she placed her trust in God or in human leaders and their armies?

Speaker 1:          03:02          Hosea one seven a go so far as to suggest that actually the moment of decision has passed for the northern kingdom. There's still some hope for the southern kingdom, but the northern kingdom has obviously made its choice than it was the wrong choice. Um, Hosea says that God says, I will no longer accept the house of Israel or part in them, but I will accept the house of Judah and I will give them victory through the Lord, their God, right? Victory through the Lord their God. I will not give them victory with Bo and sword and battled by horses and riders, right? If you think that's what gives you victory, you're mistaken. Some. See that verse as perhaps a later interpolation into Hosea has such a positive assessment of the southern kingdom, but there is this sense of impending disaster that resonates throughout the book of Hosea Chapter Eight verse seven they so wind and they shall reap whirlwind standing stocks devoid of ears and yielding no flour.

Speaker 1:          03:52          If they do yield, any strangers shall devour it. Israel is bewildered, so the catastrophe is unavoidable and Jose has often been described as painting a portrait of unrelieved, a gloom. It's very grim. He seems to hold out no real hope for Israel. She has to pay the price for her infidelity to God, but we need to look a little more closely at some of the themes of the book before we accept that evaluation entirely. And I think the one overarching theme that helps us organize most of the material in the book of Hosea and one that shows it's deep indebtedness to or interconnectedness with the book of Deuteronomy is the theme of Covenant. Particularly Deuteronomy is notion of covenant. So I've put covenant at the top there and we see the theme being played out in several different ways. The first I've just discussed as, yeah, Hawaii is covenant partner as a vassal of the covenant partner.

Speaker 1:          04:43          Yeah. Way The sovereign Israel should be placing her confidence entirely in yeah. Outweigh any foreign alliance. Any alliance with Egypt against a Syria for example, is, is against the terms of that, that covenant, that exclusive treaty between God and Israel and she should not be relying on her military might, but relying on the southern, the Susan. So anything short of complete trust in halfways power to save the vassal Israel is a violation of the terms of the covenant. So we see it in the notion of it's confidence, exclusive confidence and trust in God and his power. A second way in which the theme of Covenant is expressed is found in Jose, has denunciation of social injustice and moral decay. And of course this is a theme that's common to the profits. Here he follows Amos, but uh, he's now the first two couch, his charge in the form of this, a formal review or lawsuit.

Speaker 1:          05:36          He's a in which God is said to bring a charge against Israel for violating the terms of the covenant for breach of Covenant. This happens in chapter four, the first three verses of chapter four, Israel's charged and Hosea employs language that deliberately invokes the deck. A log. Here are the word of the Lord. Oh, people of Israel for the Lord has a case, a lawsuit against the inhabitants of this land because there is no honesty and no goodness and know obedience to God in the land. False swearing, dishonesty and murder and theft and adultery are rife, right? Picking out key terms from the decalogue, false swearing, murder, theft, and adult free, which of course occurred a threesome. And the decalogue crime are rife. These things are rife. Crime follows upon crime. For that the earth is withered. Everything that dwells on it languishes beasts of the field and birds of the sky, even the fish of the sea parish.

Speaker 1:          06:30          Unlike Amos, Hosea also engages in a prolonged or sustained condemnation of Israel's religious faithfulness, which is termed in it, which is figured in terms of adultery. Um, and so here again, the theme of Covenant is dominant and organizes the profits presentation to represent Israel's faith. Faithlessness he invokes other types of covenantal relationships as metaphors. Most notably the metaphor of marriage. Marriage can be referred to as a breed, as a covenant between a husband and wife. And so it's an appropriate metaphor. And we see it primarily in chapters one through three. He addresses the relationship between, yeah, white and Israel through the metaphor of marriage. And Israel is the unfaithful adulterous wife. He describes in Lurid terms, her lecherous addiction to images and idols for adulterous worship of Baal. He points to the nations leaders and their failures, the kings and the priests there, failure to prevent the people's waywardness there debauchery.

Speaker 1:          07:36          The first chapter is reported in the third person. And this contains God's command to Hosea, to marry a promiscuous woman as a symbol of God's own marriage with a faceless wife, Israel. Go get yourself. A wife of whoredom and a children of whoredom for the land will stray from following the Lord. So he marries this woman named Gomer, and she bears three children who have very in auspicious names. These names are symbolic of God's anger over Israel's religious infidelity. Jezreel Jezreel because God plans to punish Jay who for his slaughter of the House of Ahab. Even though Ahab was no favorite of God, you still should not raise your hand against the Lord's anointed. Um, and so Jay, who will have to be, um, I have, will have to be avenged Jay who will have to be punished at Jezreel, which is where the murder happened.

Speaker 1:          08:27          Lo Ruca mob, which means not loved, not forgiven, because God will no longer love or forgive or part in the house of Israel. And the third child's name is low. Amit, not my people. A sign that God has dissolved the Covenant Bond. He's rejected Israel as his people divorced Israel. There really could be no more stark and shocking denial of the covenant. Then this chapter three contains a first person. Hosea was first person account of God's command to him. Um, there had said that God commands him to be friend, although he seems to hire a woman on condition that she not consort with others. The woman again symbolizes Israel, who's brought into an exclusive relationship that requires her to remain faithful to one party in contrast to her customary behavior. And then sandwiched between chapter one and chapter three, both of which have the accounts of these relationships that are metaphors for God.

Speaker 1:          09:30          And Israel's relationship sandwiched between them is the almost schizophrenia a chapter two. It contains again, this sustained violent, very violent account on the faithless wife on faithless Israel. Um, and God's formal declaration of divorce. She is not my wife and I am not her husband. This would affect a divorce, the statement uttered by a husband. Um, we have that in verse four, and yet this is also, this chapter also contains a very gentle and very loving portrait of reconciliation. And it's in that portrait of reconciliation that we see. Another aspect of the covenant concept emerge and aspect that was again, most pronounced in the book of Deuteronomy as Israel's covenant partner. God loves Israel and he actually longs for her faithfulness, this steadfast covenantal love. One of the words that's used repeatedly is crested, but it refers to a special kind of steadfast love, loyal love, um, this covenantal love.

Speaker 1:          10:32          We'll reconcile God to wayward Israel just as Hosea is reunited or reconciled with his faithless wife. And then the profit imagines a, uh, a return to the wilderness. And you know, God is imagining what it would be wonderful if we could return to the Wilderness and covenant again. And this time it would even be a permanent and eternal marriage. And the three children who were cast off at birth, they will be redeemed and accepted by their father. Those are some of the ideas contained in this passage. This is Hosea to verses 16 to 25 the reconciliation. Assuredly, I will speak coaxing Lee to her and lead her through the wilderness and speak to her tenderly. I will give her vineyards from there and the valley of a whore as a plow, land of hope. And there she shall respond as in the days of her youth when she came up from the land of Egypt.

Speaker 1:          11:23          So the period of the exodus and wandering as it is romantically imagined, and as this time of a very good and close relationship between God and Israel. And in that day you will call me, he, she and no more will you call me by Ali? This is a pun. Both of these words can mean my husband. He, she is my man, a male. And Bali is my Lord. Women would have used both for their husbands, but, but I'll obviously has connotations with the god by Baal. So instead of calling me Bali, my bottle, you will call me. He, she, my husband using a word that's free of connotations for I will remove the names of the by Aleem from her mouth and they shall never more be mentioned by name. In that day, I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the creeping things of the ground and I will banish bow and sword and war from the land.

Speaker 1:          12:12          Thus I will let them lie down and safety and I will espouse you forever. Back to the marriage metaphor, I will espouse you with righteousness and justice and with goodness and mercy and I will espouse you with faithfulness and then you shall be devoted to the Lord. In that day I will respond, declares the Lord. I will respond to the sky and it shall respond to the earth and the Earth shall respond with new grain and wine and oil and they shall respond to Jezreel. The first of the children. I will sew her in the land as my own gesture was a fertile valley, not just a place of war and death. And I will take Lu, low rue, c'mon not loved back in favor and I will say to low Ami, not my people. You are my people and he will respond to you are my God.

Speaker 1:          12:57          So Hosea isn't unrelatedly gloomy and grim. It does provide these images, these very stirring images of hope and consolation and reconciliation. Us who, uh, almost also held out hope in the form of a remnant that would survive the inevitable destruction. So we need to think about the two traditions that prophets like Amos and Hosea are drawing on in this combined message of doom. On the one hand and hope on the other. Really what the profits are doing is drawing on to conceptions of covenant. The two conceptions that we saw in our study of the pen attukal material and on into a Samuel. On the one hand, they recognize the unconditional and eternal irrevocable covenant, right? That God established with the Patriarchs as well as the eternal covenant with David, with the house of David. Those covenants were the basis for the belief that God would never forsake his people.

Speaker 1:          13:58          But on the other hand, of course, they placed emphasis on the covenant at Sinai. It's a conditional covenant. It requires the people's obedience to moral, religious and civil laws, uh, in the Covenant Code. And it threatens punishment for their violation. So the profits are playing with both of these themes. Israel has violated the Senate edit covenant and the curses that are stipulated by the Covenant Must Follow National Destruction and even exile they will follow. They have to, but alienation from God is not and never will be complete and irreparable because of the unconditional covenant, the Covenant With the Patriarchs, the covenant with the House of David. So Israel will be God's people forever, despite temporary alienations alienation, the notion of election and active, purely undeserved or unmerited favor. And Love on God's part, not do in any way to a special merit of the people undergirds the prophetic message of consolation. And Hosea Paints a very poignant and moving portrait of this special, um, and indissoluble love that God bears for Israel.

Speaker 1:          15:06          And in doing so, he draws on a second metaphors. So, um, we've had the metaphor of husband and wife, which is a kind of covenantal relationship. We also have the metaphor of parents' son, which can also be understood in terms of a covenant with obligations. All right. The, the parent's son, um, relationship entails loyalty and love, but also obligation. Um, one of the obligations that is understood to fall on the parent is the obligation of disciplining I rebellious or ungrateful child while never forsaking that child. So that's a model that works very well with the prophetic message. Hosea 11 one through four. And then skipping to verses eight through nine, I fell in love with Israel when he was still a child and I have called him my son ever since Egypt, thus where they called, but they went their own way. They sacrificed about Aleem and offered a carved images.

Speaker 1:          16:01          I have pampered f fry him, another name for Israel, right? If Ryan, I have pampered efrein taking them in my arms, but they have ignored my healing care. I drew them with human ties, with cords of love, but I seem to them as one who imposed a yoke on their jaws though I was offering them food. How can I give you up? Oh, if Ryan, how surrender you. Oh Israel, how can I make you like admire or render you like Zavala, Iem, other foreign places? I have had a change of heart. All my tenderness is stirred. I will not act on my wrath, will not turn to destroy a fry them for I am God, not man, the holy one in your midst. I will not come and fury if these alternating passages of violent rejection and tender, tender love and reconciliation, and with these alternating passages, the profit is able to capture or convey.

Speaker 1:          16:56          I'm a passionate struggle taking place in the heart of God, right? They're giving us that passionate emotional portrait of God. It's the struggle of a lover who's torn between his jealous wrath and his undying love. And it's a struggle that is one, ultimately by love because God cannot let Israel go. We're going to see that each of the profits we look at holds these two, um, covenantal ideas, intention, and they will emphasize one or the other depending on the particular situation, the particular historical situation. Sometimes in a, when it's a time of relative ease or comfort, then the prophet emphasizes the violations of the Senate. It covenant the punishment that will inevitably come, uh, for these violations. And they'll downplay God's eternal commitment to his people. But in times of despair and suffering and destruction than the profit may point out that violations of the covenant where the cause of the distress, but they will emphasize God's undying love for Israel and hold out hope. Therefore for a better future.

Speaker 1:          18:00          Now we're going to leave the northern profits and move to southern prophets. Isaiah is a, well, Isaiah is the longest prophetic book. Um, the interpretation of many passages in the book of Isaiah as symbolic references to Jesus make it one of the most quoted books of the Bible by Christians. Um, Isaiah was a contemporary of Amos and Hosea, right? Second half of the eighth century. He was active for a little bit longer period. He was active into about the six nineties, somewhere in there, but he prophesied in the southern Kingdom of Judah when the Assyrian Empire threatened and destroyed the northern kingdom, right? Northern Kingdom falls seven 22. Uh, and then of course was threatening Judah. So he's active for over 50 years and he counsels Judas Kings, he counsels them through to sieges. I've listed these for you to see just seven 34 where he counsels King Ahaz and then the siege of seven Oh one where he counsels his son, um, has a kia or he's Kia Hezekiah.

Speaker 1:          19:01          Okay. Give you a little bit of a historical background to these sieges so you understand them. But those are the main dates that can help orient your approach to Isaiah. We have excellent evidence, by the way, for, for all of these events. In the Assyrian sources. And also archeological finds the archeological fines show destruction by the Assyrians at the places that we believe were destroyed at the times they were destroyed. But this is what happened in seven 34. You have the Assyrians who at this time or undertake lot Palliser and they're extending their control through the region region. So they're coming from the north east. So first they're going to hit a rum in Syria and then advanced on the northern kingdom of Israel. So a rum and Israel joined together in an alliance. They're trying to resist the advancing Assyrians. Judah refuse to join the alliance.

Speaker 1:          19:50          All right. The southern kingdom refused. So in anger or Ramen, Israel moves out and lay siege to Jerusalem. So the first stage of the sea, just seven 34, is actually a siege of Jerusalem by the northern Kingdom of Israel in alliance with Aaron Mans. They were trying to force Judas cooperation in standing against to Syria. King Ahaz of Jerusalem of Judah, um, decided to appeal to a Syria for help to tig. Left the pie. Pi Leazar for help. He submits to the Assyrians. Have a vet as a vassal. He pays tribute. We have a record of the tribute that was paid and the Assyrian records and seven 34 and this action is condemned by the biblical writers. The Deuteronomistic historian in second kings 16 condemns this action. Um, Isaiah also condemns it. So Judah has made itself vassal to, uh, Syria. And this is the case until has his son has a Kaia, decides that he will assert the nation's independence.

Speaker 1:          20:51          The Assyrians are angry about this. This is now after the fall of the northern kingdom of Israel. These Syrians are angry and under, um, Sinica ribs. They attack, they devastate many of the cities and the countryside. And again, archaeology confirms what we know from the Assyrian records and they advance on Jerusalem and lay siege to Jerusalem and seven oh one. And just as he had counseled, uh, King Ahaz Israel, now councils has a Kia. In the end, Jerusalem wasn't destroyed. Heavy tribute was paid to these Syrians, but eventually the Assyrians did withdraw. They were overextended to a large degree. All right. That's the general historical background. We'll come back to some of the details in a minute, but let me first give you a sense of the general structure of this very large book of the claim that the prophetic books are anthologies, anthologies of oracles and other materials compiled by the prophet or by his disciples.

Speaker 1:          21:44          That is to say schools, um, that, uh, kept, uh, set of prophecies and then added to those core prophecies because of their firm belief in their continuing relevance. Um, that portrait of the anthological nature of prophetic books is really a demonstrate demonstrable in the book of Isaiah. I've put the basic structure up there for you. The first 11 chapters contain memoirs. Chapter one sets out some of the basic themes of Isaiah, but, uh, we have a lot of first person narrative. Then we have various Oracle's against Israel. Um, some of this material refers to the attacks on Jerusalem, especially the siege of seven oh one. And there seems to be a kind of concluding him in chapter 12. We then have about 11 chapters of Oracle's against foreign nations. If that's a form that we also saw an almost and Jose and denouncing foreign nations from chapters 13 to 23.

Speaker 1:          22:39          Um, I'm skipping over chapters 24 to 27. They are a little apocalypse, the sort of mythological vision of the end of days and that probably dates to a much later time. The sixth century, that was the time in which the apocalyptic genre was really developing. So we skip over that. We don't think of that as associated with the historical Isaiah and move on to chapters 28 to 33 here. We turned from Oracle's against foreign nations to Oracle's against Judah and Israel and the relationship with Egypt, right? This is a time where caught between these two powers, Egypt and Assyria. Um, Judah is, is trying to figure out with whom to make alliances, right? Should she cast her lot with Egypt and so on. Um, and these are from a slightly later period down towards the siege of seven oh one. And they include accounts of um, Isaiah's council to two has a Kia in seven oh one 34 and 35 we'll kind of skip over for now.

Speaker 1:          23:35          These also are post Zelig insertions and then chapters 36 to 39. This is third person historical narrative and it is in fact, um, second kings chapters 18 to 20. That material has simply been inserted here. So those three chapters appear here in Isaiah. It's the story of the invasion of snuff a rib, the interactions of Isaiah and Hezekiah during the siege and seven oh one. So I'm stopping at chapter 39 even though there are 66 chapters in the book of Isaiah because most scholars agree, I think this is, this is really a very strong consensus that the remaining material is not the work of Isaiah of Jerusalem. It dates to a period long after Isaiah's lifetime. I've already mentioned the apocalypse, which we think was probably from the sixth century. That's embedded in their chapters 24 to 27. But the other, the remaining material we speak of in two main sections, we refer to these as second Isaiah.

Speaker 1:          24:33          And third, Isaiah chapters 40 to 55, which we refer to as second Isaiah, assume a, um, a historical setting, which is in which Babylon is dominating, not Assyria. Um, and so we see that as coming at a much later time, chapters 56 to 66 re referred to as Third Isaiah. This material contains oracles that are spread throughout the eighth to the fifth centuries. Um, so we will consider those on another occasion in their proper historical context. Right now we're looking at the material that is most likely a attributable to first Isaiah to Isaiah of Jerusalem. The book also contains material that is a repetition of material found elsewhere. Um, we've, I've already noted second kings 18 to 20 appears here, but in addition, you have snatches of verses that appear in other places. So Isaiah two verses two to four I founded Micah and the book of Micah four verses one to four.

Speaker 1:          25:33          Jeremiah 48 is essentially equivalent to Isaiah 15 and 16. So this kind of repetition among or between different books illustrates again, the anthological nature of the prophetic corpuses right, that these prophetic corpus, that these were works that were compiled from material that sometimes circulated in more than one school. So if we turn now to the major themes of Isaiah, let's note first the common ground between Isaiah and the prophets. Amos and Hosea that we've already discussed. Isaiah is consistent with Amos and Hosea and Hosea and denouncing again with social injustice and moral decay, which is the cause of God's just an inevitable punishment. Isaiah five I'm extracting from verses eight through 24, uh, those who add house to house and join field to field. So there was room for none but you to dwell in the land are those who chase liquor from early in the morning until late in the evening are inflamed by Wine.

Speaker 1:          26:33          Uh, those who vindicate who him who was in the wrong in return for a bribe and withhold vindication from him who is in the right. He joins Amos. And the assertion that cultic practice without just behavior is anathema to God. Isaiah one verses 10 to 17 here are the word of the Lord. You chieftains of Sodom give ear to our God's instruction. You folk of Gomorrah, right? So he's referring to his fellow countrymen. Has Sodomites, are people of Sodom and Gomorrah. Who of course were the paragons of of immoral behavior. What need have I have? All Your sacrifices says the Lord. I am sated with burnt offerings of Rams and suit of fat lanes and blood of Bulls and I have no delight in lambs and he goats. You're new moons and fixed seasons fill me with low thing. They are become a burden to me. I cannot endure them.

Speaker 1:          27:25          And when you lift up your hands, I will turn my eyes away from you though you pray at length, I will not listen. You're hands are stained with crime. Wash yourselves clean. Put your evil doings away from my site. Cease to do evil. Learn to do good. Devote yourselves to justice. Aid the wronged. Uphold the rights of the orphan. Defend the cause of the widow. I think these are harsh and shocking words. I'm sick of sacrifices. I'm thick of your festivals and holidays as long as you are, or it's committing these terrible acts and like Amos and Hosea. Isaiah asserts that morality is a decisive factor in the fate of the nation. Again, um, the phrase that the passage that begins are those who add house to house and join field to field. In my hearing said, the Lord of hosts, surely great houses shall lie for Lauren, spacious and splendid ones without occupants.

Speaker 1:          28:18          Assuredly, my people will suffer exile for not giving heed its multitude victims of hunger, and it's massive, parched with thirst. So there are of course some commonalities, but Isaiah differs from Amos and Hosea in this, he places far greater emphasis on the Davidic covenant than on the mosaic. Covenant is a key feature of, of Isaiah, the wilderness tradition, the exodus tradition, the covenant at Sinai. These are so important to Amos and Hosea and are referred to by Amos and Hosea, but they have less of an explicit influence on Isaiah's prophecy. They're not not there, but they have less of an explicit influence. Instead, Isaiah has an overriding interest in Davidic theology, the Royal Ideology that centers on Zion, um, an ideology that we discussed earlier. So we see this in his read his covenant lawsuit, which focuses a little less on the violations of the nation than it does on the failure of the kings and the leaders who have misled the nation and who will now have to be punished as a, as was stipulated in the Davidic covenant.

Speaker 1:          29:25          We also see it in his firm belief in the inviolability of Zion. This is a clear doctrine with Isaiah. The inviolability of Zion, yeah, way has a special relationship with the Davidic royal line and the Davidic capital, Jerusalem or Zion, and he will not let either parish. And that belief undergirds and informs his consistent advice to the kings of Judah. Times of great danger, our opportunities to demonstrate absolute trust in young boys covenant with the Line of David with the House of David, the king must rely exclusively on your weight and you always promises to David and his city and not on military might or diplomatic strategies. So if we look at Isaiah, dealings with King has right the first siege in a seven 34. This is described in Isaiah Chapter Seven and eight. Isaiah who also has children with portentous names. This is a fad, I guess among the profits.

Speaker 1:          30:30          Um, his children's names are only a remnant will survive and he sinned for spoil. Hurry for plunder, um, which indicates the destruction and exile. So he goes to visit the king and his advice to the king is be quiet and do not fear. Chapter Seven, verse four, the crisis will pass seven verse nine, if you will not believe, surely you shall not be established. This is an evocation of Zion theology. God is in the midst of the city. That means the Lord of hosts is with the people. Um, Isaiah then offers a, has a sign of the truth of his prophecy. And that is namely that a young woman who has conceived will bear a son and will call him Emmanuel.

Speaker 1:          31:18          That's Hebrew. Manu l God is with us. Humano is with us. So this woman who has conceived will bear a son and we'll call him Emmanuel. This is in seven verse 14. Now in the New Testament, Matthew in chapter one, verses 22 to 23, um, takes this verse as a prophecy of the birth of Jesus. This is based on a Greek mistranslation translation of the word young woman as virgin. The Hebrew term that's used is not in fact the term for virgin, but it was translated into the Greek with the term that can mean virgin. Um, and more over the verb that's used in the Hebrew is in the past tense. Like a woman has already conceived. The birth is pending, it is imminent. This child will be born, God will be with us. The identity of the woman that Isaiah speaking about is a matter of some dispute.

Speaker 1:          32:08          So some scholars take the verse as a reference to Isaiah, his own wife. She's already had two children with portentous names and now she's pregnant with the third. Um, but the others take the verse as a reference to the king's own wife who will bear. His son has a Kaia king, has a Kia. There are some problems with chronology. It doesn't quite work out that he would be the right age, but the fact is, has a Kaia was a celebrated king. He did in fact manage to keep Judah intact against the Assyrian threat and kept Jerusalem from falling in the sea. Just seven Oh one and second kings, right. The book of Second Kings, chapter 18 verse seven says of Hezekiah, the Lord was with him, right? God was with him connecting it to the name Emmanuel. God is with us. God is with him.

Speaker 1:          32:56          Uh, very similar, very, very similar in the Hebrew in fact sounds the same. So in keeping with this interpretation, the idea that, um, the child who he says, uh, we'll be able to in a sense saved Judah is, is the child of the king to be born, has a kayak. And keeping with that scholar. See the famous verses in Isaiah Nine, uh, as praise of king has a Kaia. These verses are verses that announced for unto us a child is born a wonderful counselor, mighty God, everlasting father, Prince of peace, referring then to an unending piece in which David's throne and kingdom are firmly established. And again, these verses have also been decontextualized and are utilized in Christian liturgies to this day. Again, as if they refer to the future birth of Jesus. Uh, in any event, a cause doesn't heat Isaiah's call for inaction, right?

Speaker 1:          33:50          He says he should be doing nothing. How could any king really follows such advice to seek no political or military solution? And so he appeals to a Syria for help against, around them and the northern kingdom of Israel who are laying siege to him. And this is a disastrous development in Isaiah. His eyes, we move to the second season seven Oh one, we see that Isaiah really takes a similar stance, has a Kaia, tries to form an alliance with Egypt now to stave off the Assyrian threat. And Isaiah castigates the king and he castigates the king's men for abandoning yeah. Halfway and relying on the frail read of Egypt. And we find here an example of this bizarre and demonstrative behavior of um, of the profit. We will see this in many of the profits will sleep particularly in the Prophet Ezekiel, but we see it with others, um, where they would engage in these symbolic acts that were meant to shock and attract attention.

Speaker 1:          34:43          Isaiah paraded naked through the streets of Jerusalem to illustrate the exile and the slavery that will follow from this mistaken reliance on Egypt. He denounces the political advisers who counsel the king to form an alliance with Egypt, um, because they are simply trusting in horses and chariots rather than God's, and I'd say a council's differently. He says, for the Egyptians are man, not God, and their horses are flesh, not spirit. Chapter 31 verse three, the King should simply trust in God in the narrative account that we have of the siege of seven oh one that's found in chapter 36 and 38. It's also duplicated in second kings. Isaiah councils has a kayak when the siege is underway, not to capitulate to the Assyrians. This might seem to contradict his earlier message that a Syria was the rod of God's anger. Um, and that, um, and that has a Kaia should not resist.

Speaker 1:          35:41          But in fact there's a basic consistency to Isaiah's council just as his earlier counsel to trust in God rather than Egypt was based on his trust in God's promises to David and the inviolability of the royal city. So now his counsel to resist not to open the doors of the city to the Assyrians is based on his belief that y'all, we could not possibly intend to destroy his royal city. Isaiah 37 versus 33 to 35 assuredly thus said the Lord concerning the King of Assyria. He shall not enter this city. He shall not shoot an Arrow at it or advanced upon it with a shield or a pile up, a siege mount against it. He shall go back by the way he came. He shall not enter. This city declares the Lord. I will protect and save the city for my sake. And for the sake of my servant David, right again, for the sake of the Davidic covenant.

Speaker 1:          36:33          And the fact that Jerusalem did in fact escaped destruction after this terrifying siege by the Assyrians only fueled the belief fueled the belief in the inviolability of David's city. Zion. Isaiah six contains a striking account of the call of Isaiah. Many of the prophetic books we'll feature some, um, some passage which refers to the profits initial call and it's something we might expect to find at the beginning of the book. Uh, so obviously chronology is not the organizing principle in the book of Isaiah. Um, but I want to draw your attention to God's extraordinary message to Isaiah at the time of his call or commission. Go and say to that people here, indeed, but do not understand. See indeed, but do not grasp dull that people's mind stop its ears and seal it's eyes lest singing with his eyes and hearing with its ears. It also grasped with its mind and repent and save itself.

Speaker 1:          37:34          Well. There's a nice literary kayaks and before we get to the substance in have it in the last line you have heart, ears and eyes. And then these are repeated. But in reverse order, eyes, ears and heart. But in this passage we returned to the kind of bleakness that we saw in um, Hosea destruction is inevitable. God's message by His prophet will not be understood and indeed God will see to it that the people do not understand the message. They do not heed the call to repent, do not save themselves, and so do not escape God's just punishment. It's a fascinating, if theologically difficult passage, God tells Isaiah to prevent the people from understanding lest through their understanding they turned back to God and save themselves. And again, we see God or perhaps as profit caught in the tension between God's justice and God's mercy as a god of justice.

Speaker 1:          38:28          He must punish the sins of Israel with destruction. He indicated he would do so in the covenant. He must be faithful to those terms. But as a god of mercy, he wishes to bring his people back. He wishes to send them a profit to warn them of the impending doom and urge them to repent so that he can forgive them and renounced his plan of destruction. Yet, how can he both punish Israel and so fulfill the man, the demands of justice and yet save Israel and so fulfill the demands of mercy and love. Verses 12 and 13 in chapter six answer this question with an idea that we've seen a little in Amos and Hosea. When Isaiah asks how long the people will fail to hear, failed to understand, to turn back to God and save themselves. God replies till towns lie, waste without inhabitance and houses without people and the ground lies, waste and desolate for the Lord will banish the population and deserted sites are many in the midst of the land, but while a 10th part yet remains in it, it shall repent.

Speaker 1:          39:30          It shall be ravaged like the terrapins and the oak of which stumps are left even when they are felled and it stump shall be a holy seed. So God will punish God, cannot not punish Israel, and so the demands of justice will be met and God will have upheld the terms of the conditional mosaic covenant, but God will at the same time affect the salvation of his people in the future. He has sent a prophet with the call to return and in due time a remnant of the people at 10th Isaiah says, we'll understand and heed that call. They will receive God's mercy and the Covenant will be reestablished and in this way, the demands of love and mercy will be met and God will have been faithful to his covenantal promise to the Patriarchs and the royal house of David. The people's delayed comprehension of the profits message guarantees the operation of God's just punishment now and his merciful salvation later.

Speaker 1:          40:29          While the notion of a remnant leads to the idea of a future hope, it wasn't a very consoling message at the time because of profits were essentially saying that the current generation would all but ceased to exist. Isaiah 10 verses 21 to 23 only a remnant shall return only a remnant of Jacob to mighty God. Even if your people o Israel should be as the sands of the sea, only a remnant of it shall return. Destruction has decreed. Retribution comes like a flood for my Lord. God of hosts is carrying out a decree of destruction upon all the land.

Speaker 1:          41:05          Well, we've seen that the profits, message of destruction and punishment and doom is very often accompanied by often alternates with a message of consolation and a promise of restoration, restoration of a purged or purified remnant in the land of Israel. This is where the profits differ from the Deuteronomistic historian. Um, the Deuteronomistic historian is more concerned with the justification of God's actions against Israel then with a painting, a vivid portrait of the time of a future restoration. But this period of restoration is elaborately envisioned in some prophetic writings, and it even takes on an eschatological 10 or the word eschatology means an account of the end. Uh, so in some of them, this becomes an eschatological vision that this is what will the restoration will happen at the end of days. And we will, um, the restoration will bring about some sort of perfect end time. So in Isaiah, for example, the return will be a genuine, wholehearted and permanent return to God.

Speaker 1:          42:08          It will be the end of sin. It will be the end of idolatry. All the nations of the earth will recognize the Lord of history. A new epoch will open in world history. It's an enormous transformation. And I say it is the first to envisage, envisage this kind of transformation, the end of the dominion of idolatrous nations. When God comes to Jerusalem to save the remnant of Israel and gathering the dispersed exiles, it will be a theophany, a self revelation of God, of worldwide scope. Isaiah two, verses two to four in the days to come, the Mount of the Lord's House shall stand from above the mountains and tower above the hills. So this little hill, um, if you've ever been there, it's really not very big that the temple stood on. We'll tower like some large impregnable mountain over all other hills and mountains and all the nations shall gaze on it with joy.

Speaker 1:          43:02          And the many people shall go and say, come let us go up to the mount of the Lord, to the House of the God of Jacob. That he may instruct us in his ways and that we may walk in his paths for instruction. Torah shall come forth from Zion. The word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And thus he will judge among the nations and arbitrate for the many peoples and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not take up sword against nation. They shall never again, no war. Note this, the direction that Israelite thought is taking the j source in genesis assumed that all humans had knowledge of Yahweh from the time of creation and remember that that was one of the distinctive traits of Jay as opposed to p for example, they assumed, however, that humans turned from Galloway so halfway selected one nation to know him in covenant with him.

Speaker 1:          43:56          The book of Deuteronomy accepts that Yahweh is Israel's God. Other nations have been assigned to the worship of other gods and that's just fine. But in classical prophecy, universal claims are made on behalf of Galloway. According to the prophets, God will make himself known to all the nations as he once did to Israel. And the universal worship or recognition of Yahweh will be established at the end of days. This is a very different idea. And so as a consequence of this idea, the very notion of Israel's election is transformed by the profits in the Torah books. The election of Israel means simply God's undeserved choice of Israel as the nation to know him and bind himself in Covenant Bind itself in Covenant to him. But in the prophetic literature, Israel's election is an election to a mission. Israel was chosen so as to be the instrument of universal redemption, universal recognition of your way.

Speaker 1:          44:56          When God comes finally to rescue the Israelites, he will simultaneously reveal himself to all of humankind. They'll abandon their idols, they'll return to him. A messianic period of peace will follow, and eventually we're going to see the idea that the mission for which Israel was elected was to become a light unto the nations. This is a phrase that we're going to see in other parts of Isaiah, Isaiah 49 as they have 51 later, but royal ideology of Judah plays an important role in the eschatological vision of Isaiah because this new peaceful, righteous kingdom is going to be restored by David died. It's going to be restored by a king from the branch of Jesse Davids. Father's name was Jessie. So, uh, when you say the branch of from the stump of Jesse, then you're referring to a David died. Isaiah 11 refers to the restoration of the Davidic line, which implies that it had been temporarily interrupted.

Speaker 1:          45:52          So Isaiah 11 may be posting silicate may date from a time when people were hoping for a Messiah to arise and restore the line of David. Isaiah 11 verses one to 12 and 16. But a shoot shall grow out of the stump of Jesse. A twig shall sprout from his stock. The spirit of the Lord shall a light upon him, a spirit of wisdom and insight, a spirit of counsel and valor, a spirit of devotion and reverence for the Lord. He shall since the truth, by his reverence for the Lord. He shall not judge by what his ears perceive. Thus, he shall judge the poor with equity and decide with justice for the lowly of the land. He shall strike down a law, a land with the rod of his mouth, and slay the wicked with the breath of his lips. Justice Shelby, the girdle of his loins and faithfulness the girdle of his lips.

Speaker 1:          46:35          The wolf shall dwell with the lamb. The leopard lie down with the kid, the calf, the beast of prey and the fat link together, and a little boy to herd them. The cow and the bear shall graze. The bear is vegetarian. Now, not, not killing the cow, but eating the grass with the cow. They're young shall lie down together. And the lion like the ox shall eat straw. A Babe shut play over a viper's hole and an infant passed his hand over and adders den, right? The hostility, the animosity between between humans and serpents are snakes, which was decreed a at the fall. Um, and the expulsion from Eden is reversed in this end time, right? This is a return to the situation in paradise. In all of my sacred mountain, nothing evil or viral shall be done for the land shall be filled with devotion to the Lord as water covers the sea.

Speaker 1:          47:22          And in that day, the stock of Jesse that has remained standing shall become a standard to peoples. Nations shall seek his counsel and his abode shall be honored. In that day, my Lord will apply his hand again to redeeming the other part of his peoples from a Syria as also from Egypt path rose Nubia, a alarm. She now Hamas and the and the coastlands. Thus there shall be a highway for the other part of his people out of Syria, such as there was for Israel when it left the land of Egypt. So this new ideal Davidic king will rule by wisdom and insight in the spirit of the Lord will a light on him. That's a phrase that we saw it being used in the case of judges. In the case of salt or David, it doesn't refer to a military might and strength. Here it refers to counsel and a spirit of devotion to God.

Speaker 1:          48:06          And this king's reign will begin an in gathering of the exiles of the nation and a transformed world order. So to conclude, Isaiah is typical of the prophetic re-interpretation of the ancient covenant promises, giving Israel a hope for a better ideal future. And like the other prophets, he declared that the nation was in distress, not because of promises weren't true, but because they hadn't been believed. The nation's punishment was just a chest ties meant it wasn't a revocation of the promises. The profits pushed the fulfillment of the promises beyond the existing nation. However, it's only after suffering the punishment for the present failure. Would a future redemption be possible? So the national hope was maintained, but pushed off to a future day. Right? We'll deal with some more prophetic books when we come back. Please be sure to take the handouts in the box at the side of the room.
