1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.850
So last time I gave a reading of the creation accounts that are in genesis one

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.610
to three.
These are two very different stories,

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.470
but their placement side by side suggests the possibility of a joint reading.

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.800
Uh,
nevertheless,
they are very different in character.

5
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:19.500
And today I want to focus in on the second creation story.

6
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:24.210
This is the story that is predominantly in genesis two and trickles into genesis

7
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:28.620
three.
And I'm going to look at it mostly in isolation from the first account.

8
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.950
I'm going to be looking at it in light of an important parallel.

9
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.010
This parallel is the epic of Gilgamesh.

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.020
I get to point this way now to the boards.
Okay,
the epic of Gilgamesh,

11
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.260
and I'll be drawing on the work of many scholars,

12
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.060
knock them Sarna probably most prominently among them,

13
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:48.750
but others also who have devoted themselves to the study of these textual

14
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:52.920
parallels and developing an interpretation of these stories and like you to

15
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:54.870
carry that with you into your discussion sections.

16
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.440
As you look at some of the other interpretations from antiquity and on into the

17
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:00.360
modern period.
Now,

18
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:05.361
the epic of Gilgamesh is a magnificent Mesopotamian epic that relates the

19
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:10.380
exploits of a Sumerian king,
King Gilgamesh of Orac.
That's the name of the city,

20
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:13.830
state over which he is king.
And the epic,
as we now have,

21
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:18.500
it was probably composed between 2000 and 1800 BCE.
Um,

22
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.190
Gilgamesh was apparently a historical character.
I get an actual king of Orac,

23
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.090
but the story of course,
has fantastic and legendary qualities to it.
Um,

24
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.180
we have a full text of the epic that was located in the library of Ashurbanipal.

25
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.860
Um,
a an Assyrian king.

26
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:38.280
It's a seventh century copy of the story,

27
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:39.900
but we have fragments that are much,

28
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:43.980
much older that date back to the 18th century that were found in Iraq.

29
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.510
So clearly it's an old story.

30
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.290
And we have even older prototypes for elements of the story as well.

31
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.740
The story opens with a description of Gilgamesh.

32
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:57.100
She's an extremely unpopular king.
He's tyrannical,
he's repaste,

33
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.890
he's undisciplined,
he's oversexed.
The people in the city cry out to the gods.

34
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:03.210
They want relief from him.

35
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:06.510
They particularly site his abusive towards the young women of the city.

36
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.110
And the God [inaudible] is told that she must deal with Gilgamesh.
A room,

37
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.040
um,
is on the board.
So I roof fashions.

38
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.700
This noble savage named Inky do
thank you.

39
00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:25.701
Do is designed to be a match for Gilgamesh and he's very much like the biblical

40
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:30.420
human.
In genesis two,
he sort of an innocent,
um,
primitive.

41
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:32.940
He appears unclothed.
He lives a free,

42
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.180
peaceful life in harmony with the animals,

43
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:40.080
with nature and the BC races across the steps with the gazelles.

44
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.390
But before he can enter the city and meet Gilgamesh,
he has to be tamed.

45
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.160
So a woman is sent to [inaudible] and her job is to provide the sexual

46
00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:55.050
initiation that will team and civilize and can you do,

47
00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.130
I'm reading now from the epic of Gilgamesh for six days and seven nights.

48
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.170
And you do comes forth meeting with the less after he had had his fill of her

49
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:09.760
charms,
he set his face toward his wild beasts on seeing him.

50
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:10.594
And you do.

51
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.040
The gazelles ran off the wild beasts of the step drew away from his body.

52
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.640
Startled was thank you.
Do.
As his body became taught,

53
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.900
his knees were motionless for the wild beasts had gone,

54
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.450
and you do had to slack in his pace.
It was not as before,
but he now had wisdom,

55
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.160
broader understanding,
returning.
He sits at the feet of the Harlot.

56
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.230
Not sure why that translation,
I've been told by those who know Acadian,

57
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.660
that the word could mean harlot,
prostitute.
It could mean some sacred prostitute.

58
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:44.560
I'm not an expert in Akkadian,
but he looks up at the face of the Harlot.

59
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:48.820
His ears attentive as the harlot speaks,
and the hardest says to him to ask you,

60
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:53.410
do thou art wise?
Thank you.
Do you aren't become like a God?
Why?

61
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:56.800
With the wild creatures dust,
they'll Rome over the step calm.

62
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:59.800
Let me lead the Taran part.
It [inaudible] to the Holy Temple,

63
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.370
a boat of Uno and each car where lives Gilgamesh,

64
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.070
accomplished in strength and like a wild ox.

65
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:10.480
Lords it over the folk as she speaks to him.
Her words find favor.

66
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.200
His heart enlightened.
He yearns for a friend and he said,
thank you.

67
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:18.070
Do says to her,
to the harlot up last escort me to Gilgamesh.

68
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.790
I will challenge him and will boldly address him.

69
00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:23.080
So that's tablet one from the epic of Gilgamesh.

70
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.860
So through this sexual experience and if you do has become wise growing and

71
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:33.520
mental and spiritual stature,
and he has said to have become like a god.

72
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.230
At the same time there's been a concomitant loss of innocence.

73
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.320
His harmonious unity with nature is broken.

74
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:45.580
He closed himself and his old friends,
the gazelles run from him.

75
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:48.610
Now he will never again roam free with the animals.

76
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:52.360
He cannot run as quickly his pace slackens he can't even keep up with them.

77
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.100
So as one reads,

78
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:59.101
the epic one senses this very deep ambivalence regarding the relative virtues

79
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:00.364
and evils,

80
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.570
civilized life and many of the features that make us human.

81
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.010
On the one hand,

82
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:11.011
it's clearly good that humans rise above the animals and build cities and wear

83
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:16.750
clothes and pursue the arts of civilization and develop bonds of love and duty

84
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:19.270
and friendship the way that animals do not.

85
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.100
These are the things that make humans like the gods in the epic of Gilgamesh.

86
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.060
But on the other hand,
these advances have also come at a cost.

87
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.620
And in this story,

88
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.680
there's also a sense of longing for the freedom of life in the wild.

89
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.100
The innocent,
simple,
uncomplicated life lived day to day without plans,

90
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:43.450
without toil in harmony with nature,
somewhat Edenic existence.

91
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.460
So there are very obvious parallels between this part of the epic that I've just

92
00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:50.830
read to you and our second creation story.

93
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.940
And can you do like Adam is fashioned from clay.
He's a noble savage.

94
00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:55.900
He's a kind of innocent,

95
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.810
primitive and he lives in a peaceful coexistence with animals.

96
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.290
Nature yields it's fruits to him without hard labor.

97
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.330
He's unaware of he's unattracted by the benefits of civilization,
clothing,

98
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.010
cities and all their labor.

99
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.940
Just as ANC you do gains wisdom and becomes like a God and loses his oneness

100
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:18.830
with nature.
So Adam and eve,

101
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.270
after eating the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil are said to have become

102
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:27.850
like gods and they also lose their harmonious relationship with nature.
Um,

103
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.980
in genesis three 15 God says to the snake,

104
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.050
I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers,

105
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.710
they shall strike it.
Your head and you shall strike at their heels.

106
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.720
Presumably there had been a peaceful relationship between creatures like snakes

107
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:48.140
and humans.
To that point,
they're banished now from the garden.

108
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:50.840
It used to yield their fruits to them without any labor,

109
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.590
but now humans have to toil for food and the the earth yields its fruit only.

110
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.580
Stinting Lee.
So in genesis three 18 God says to Adam,

111
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.620
Kersty would be the ground because of you.

112
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:03.770
By toil shall you eat of it all the days of your life.

113
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:06.410
Thorns and thistles shall it sprout for you,

114
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.580
but your food shall be the grasses of the field by the sweat of your brow shall

115
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:11.990
you give bread to eat.

116
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.240
So knowledge or wisdom or perhaps moral freedom seem to come at a very high

117
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.620
price.
But there are important differences between these stories too.

118
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.760
And the most important has to do with the nature of the act that leads to the

119
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:29.870
transformation of the human characters.
It's Encke dues,

120
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.030
sexual experience,

121
00:07:31.031 --> 00:07:35.780
his seven day encounter with the woman that makes him wise and God like at the

122
00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:38.360
cost of his life with the beasts.

123
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.750
There has been a long tradition of interpreting the,
um,

124
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.800
deed or the sin of Adam and eve and eve as sexual.

125
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.700
And there are some hints in the story that would support such an interpretation.

126
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.830
And I was just reading recently a,
um,
a scholarly,
um,

127
00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.590
introduction to genesis that very much argues and develops this interpretation.

128
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.400
Um,

129
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.400
Adam and eve eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in violation of

130
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:09.980
God's command.
Eating can perhaps be a metaphor for sex.

131
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:12.890
Some have argued knowledge of good and evil,

132
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:17.090
perhaps that could be understood in sexual terms.
In biblical Hebrew,

133
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:20.360
the word to know can mean to know in the biblical sense.
Um,

134
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:22.790
it can mean sexual intercourse.
Uh,

135
00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:27.791
snakes are symbols of renewed life and fertility in the east because they shed

136
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:31.100
their skins,
so they seem to be eternally young.
Um,

137
00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:32.780
and they're also phallic symbols.

138
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.730
Eve says the snake seduced her and uses a term that has some sexual overtones.

139
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.650
So do all of these hints suggest that in the biblical view,

140
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.840
the change in Adam and Eve came about through sex?
If so,

141
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:51.220
is sex a negative thing for bitten by God?
It depends.

142
00:08:51.221 --> 00:08:56.130
If you view the changes a negative thing that seems in my view,

143
00:08:56.131 --> 00:08:59.520
you will certainly hear it argued,
but it seems unlikely in my view.

144
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.630
God's first command to the first couple was to be fruitful and multiply.

145
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.040
Now admittedly that comes from the first creation story in genesis one.

146
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.650
Nevertheless,
in the second creation story,

147
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.870
when the writer is recounting the creation of woman,

148
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.300
the writer refers to the fact that men and women women will become one flesh.

149
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:23.510
So it seems that sex was part of the plan for humans even at creation.

150
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:25.381
Also,

151
00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:29.850
it's only after their defiance of God's command that Adam and eve first become

152
00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:33.000
aware of and ashamed by their nakedness,

153
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:37.680
putting the sort of sexual awakening after the act of disobedience rather than

154
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.720
at the same time or or prior to.

155
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.140
So maybe what we have here is another polemic,

156
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.280
another adaptation of familiar stories and motifs to express something new

157
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.480
perhaps for the biblical writer,

158
00:09:51.481 --> 00:09:56.190
Adam and Eve's transformation occurs after an act of disobedience,

159
00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.280
not after a seven days sexual encounter.

160
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.020
The disobedience happens in a rather backhanded way.
It's kind of interesting.

161
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:09.530
God tells Adam before the creation of eve that he's not to eat of the tree of

162
00:10:09.661 --> 00:10:14.010
the knowledge of good and evil.
That's in genesis two 16 on pain of death.

163
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.200
Eve doesn't hear this command directly.
She has not yet been created.

164
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.450
In genesis three,

165
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:26.480
we meet the cunning serpent and although many later a Hellenistic Jewish texts

166
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:31.890
and the New Testament,
we'll identify the snake as as a Sutton,

167
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.790
an enticer attempt or some sort of evil creature.

168
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.300
He doesn't seem to be.
So in this fable,

169
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:44.620
there's no real devil or Satan character.
We'll talk about job later.
Uh,

170
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.780
in the Hebrew Bible,
the snake and Eden is simply a talking animal.

171
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:54.290
He's a standard literary device that you see in fables of this period and later

172
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.590
the kind that you find,
for example,
in the,
in the,
um,

173
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:02.630
fables of aesop and the woman responds to the serpents queries by saying that

174
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.830
eating and even touching the tree is forbidden on pain of death.

175
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.640
One wonders.
When's the addition of touching?

176
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.490
Did Adam conveyed God's command to Eve with an emphasis all his own?

177
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.610
Don't even touch that tree.
Eve.
It's curtains for us.
If you do,

178
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:26.130
she didn't hear the original command or did she just miss here in some very

179
00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:30.960
tragic version of the telephone game?
You know?
Um,
and the serpent tells her,
no,

180
00:11:30.961 --> 00:11:35.280
you're not going to die if you touch your eat the fruit.
In fact,

181
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.740
he adds the fruit,
will bring you wisdom.

182
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:42.480
Making humans like gods who know good and bad.
And in fact,
that's certainly true.

183
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.490
He tells her the truth.

184
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.190
Genesis three seven is a very critical verse and it's rarely properly
translated.

185
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:55.060
Most translations read like this.
She took of its fruit and ate.

186
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.730
She also gave some to her husband and he ate.

187
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.550
The implication is that eve acts alone,

188
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:05.080
and then she goes and finds Adam and gives him some of the apple and convinces

189
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:08.260
him to eat it.
But in fact,
the Hebrew literally reads,

190
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.880
she took of its fruit and ate and gave also to her husband with her.

191
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.690
And he ate with her is a very teeny,
tiny little word in Hebrew.

192
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:18.970
So I guess a lot of translations figure they can leave it out,

193
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.500
but the width or is there in the Hebrew at that fateful moment,

194
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.920
Adam and eve are standing together at the tree.

195
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.560
And although only the woman and the serpent speak,

196
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:33.850
Adam was present and it seems he accepted the fruit that his wife handed him.

197
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.750
He was fully complicitness and indeed God holds him responsible.

198
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.700
He reproaches Adam.
Adam says,
well,
you've handed it to me.
She gave it to me.

199
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.800
Eve explains the serpent trick to me.

200
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.420
God vents his fury on all three and he does so in ascending order.

201
00:12:49.421 --> 00:12:53.650
First the snake for his trickery and then the woman,
and finally the man.

202
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.860
So just as the Harlot tells,
Nq do after his sexual awakening that he,

203
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.140
um,
has become like a god.

204
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:06.670
So Adam and eve after eating the forbidden fruit are said to be like divine

205
00:13:06.671 --> 00:13:08.350
beings.
Why?

206
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:11.920
Perhaps because they become,

207
00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:16.420
they have become wise in that they have learned,
they have moral choice,

208
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.130
they have free wheel will,

209
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:23.260
they can defy God and God's plans for them in a way that animals and natural

210
00:13:23.261 --> 00:13:25.000
phenomena cannot.

211
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.990
But now that means there is a serious danger here.

212
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.440
And in Genesis three verse 22 God says,

213
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.160
now that man has become like one of us,
knowing good and evil.

214
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.610
What if he should stretch out his hand and take also from the tree of life and

215
00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:40.990
eat and live forever.

216
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:46.420
So it's the threat of an immortal antagonist that is so disturbing and must be

217
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.760
avoided.
And so God banishes,

218
00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:53.350
Adam and Eve from the garden and he stations these craving these cero beam,

219
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.950
not puffy,
cute little babies like Raphael painted,
but these fierce,

220
00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.180
monstrous creatures.

221
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:02.980
And if fiery ever turning sword to guard the way back to the tree of life,

222
00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:04.750
it is now and accessible.

223
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:10.320
So the acceptance of mortality as an inescapable part of the human condition.

224
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.100
It's a part of this story.
It's also one of the themes of the epic of Gilgamesh.

225
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:20.140
As the story continues and you do enters the city and um,

226
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.840
and you do earns Gilgamesh is respect and deep love.

227
00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:27.220
And this is the first time that this rapacious tyrant has ever actually loved

228
00:14:27.221 --> 00:14:30.310
anyone in his character is reformed as a result.

229
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.510
And then the rest of the epic contains the adventures of these two close
friends.

230
00:14:34.511 --> 00:14:37.840
All of the things that they do together.
And when Hanky do dyes,

231
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.790
Gilgamesh is absolutely devastated.

232
00:14:39.791 --> 00:14:43.360
He's for the first time confronted with his own mortality.

233
00:14:43.361 --> 00:14:45.220
He is obsessed with grief over inky do.

234
00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:48.430
And he's obsessed with the whole issue of mortality.

235
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.980
He begins a quest for immortality,

236
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.190
and that takes up most of the rest of the epic.
He leaves the city,

237
00:14:55.191 --> 00:14:59.390
he travels far and wide.
He crosses these primeval sees and,
and jurors,

238
00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:03.800
all sorts of hardships.
And finally exhausted and,
and,
and battered.

239
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:08.890
He reaches a Pysch team also there on the board would not pitch team who is the

240
00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:14.240
only mortal ever to have been granted in mortality by the gods.

241
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.150
Uh,
and he had becomes to him and asks for his secret.

242
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:21.300
It turns out that peach team can't help him.
Um,

243
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.770
and we'll come back that would not pitch team later in the flood story.

244
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.840
And Gilgamesh is devastated.

245
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:31.841
He then learns the whereabouts of a plant of eternal youth and he says,

246
00:15:33.261 --> 00:15:36.640
well,
that's better than nothing that at least we'll keep him young.
Um,

247
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.410
and so he goes after the plant of eternal youth,

248
00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:41.750
but he's negligent for a moment.

249
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.040
And a thieving snake or serpent manages to steal it.

250
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:50.540
And that explains why snakes are always shedding their skins and our forever

251
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:54.440
young Gilgamesh is exhausted.
He feels defeated.

252
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:58.580
He returns to Iraq and as he stands looking at the city from a distance,

253
00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.020
I'm gazing at it.

254
00:16:00.021 --> 00:16:05.021
He takes comfort in the thought that although humans are finite and frail and

255
00:16:05.571 --> 00:16:06.500
doomed to die,

256
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:10.970
their accomplishments and their great works give them some foothold in,

257
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:14.420
in human memory.
Now not come.

258
00:16:14.421 --> 00:16:19.421
Sarna is one of the people who's pointed out that the quest for immortality,

259
00:16:19.551 --> 00:16:22.190
which is so central in the epic of Gilgamesh,

260
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.250
is really reflected in the biblical story.

261
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.170
The tree of life is mentioned and it's mentioned with the definite article.

262
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.430
Genesis two nine says with the tree of life in the middle of the garden,

263
00:16:34.431 --> 00:16:37.850
as if this is a motif we're familiar with as if this is something we all know

264
00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:42.200
about,
but then it's really not mentioned again,
as the story proceeds,

265
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:43.400
the snake,

266
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.260
which in the epic of Gilgamesh is associated with the plant of eternal youth in

267
00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:53.330
genesis is associated instead with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

268
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:57.560
That's the focus of our attention and genesis and it's only at the end of the

269
00:16:57.561 --> 00:17:02.561
story that the tree of life appears again in the passage that is emphasizing

270
00:17:04.371 --> 00:17:06.530
it's permanent in accessibility.

271
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.840
And we could perhaps draw two conclusions from this.
First,

272
00:17:11.841 --> 00:17:15.500
it may be that Adam and eve had access to this tree up to that point,

273
00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:17.990
as long as there will conform to the will of God,

274
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.570
there was no danger to them going on eternally being immortal.

275
00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.700
Once they discovered their moral freedom,

276
00:17:25.701 --> 00:17:29.560
once they discovered that they could thwart God and work evil in the world,
um,

277
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.940
and abused and corrupt all that God had created,

278
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.620
then God cannot afford to allow them access to the tree of life that would be

279
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:40.790
tantamount to creating divine enemies and mortal enemies.

280
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:46.420
So God must maintain the upper hand in his struggle with these humans who have

281
00:17:46.461 --> 00:17:50.460
learned to defy him.
He maintains the upper hand in this,

282
00:17:50.461 --> 00:17:54.210
the fact that they eventually must die.
Second of all,

283
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:59.240
the Motif of guards who block access to the tree of life suggests that no humans

284
00:18:00.391 --> 00:18:04.110
have access to in mortality.
And the pursuit of immortality is futile.

285
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:09.740
So it might be then that God really spoke the truth after all the fruit and did

286
00:18:09.781 --> 00:18:11.580
bring death to humankind.

287
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.540
Before we leave this story and move on to Cain and Abel,

288
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:19.800
I just want to make a couple of quick observations.
Um,
first of all,

289
00:18:19.801 --> 00:18:21.450
the opening chapters of genesis,

290
00:18:21.451 --> 00:18:25.080
genesis one through three have been subjected to centuries of theological

291
00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:28.170
interpretation.
And I hope that you're in the midst of reading some of them now.

292
00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:32.070
Um,
they have generated,
for example,
the doctrine of original sin,

293
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:37.340
which is the idea that humans after Adam are born into a state of sin.

294
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.700
By definition,

295
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:44.450
as many ancient interpreters already have observed the actions of Adam and eve

296
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.240
bring death to the human race.

297
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.980
They don't bring a state of utter and unredeemed sinfulness.
In fact,

298
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:57.060
what they tell us is that humans have moral choice in each and every age.

299
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.900
The story is primarily ideological,

300
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.770
ideological rather than prescriptive or normative.

301
00:19:04.771 --> 00:19:06.780
We've talked about this where ed illogical tails,

302
00:19:06.781 --> 00:19:10.800
tails that are trying to explain how or why something is the way it is.

303
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:14.520
This is why serpents shed their skin.
For example,
in the epic of Gilgamesh,

304
00:19:14.521 --> 00:19:18.630
they were the ones who got the plant of eternal youth.
It's Ed illogical.

305
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.720
The writer observes that humans emerge from innocent childhood to self conscious

306
00:19:25.241 --> 00:19:26.074
adult hood.

307
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:31.670
The writer observes that survival is a difficult endeavor and that the world can

308
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:34.530
sometimes seem harshly hostile.

309
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:39.270
The writer observes that women are desirous of and emotionally bonded to the

310
00:19:39.271 --> 00:19:42.420
very person who established the conditions of their subordination.

311
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.560
The story is explaining how these odd conditions of life came to be as they are,

312
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.340
which is not to say that it's the ideal situation or even that it's God's will

313
00:19:53.341 --> 00:19:57.750
for humankind.
These are ecological fables and their best read.
As such.

314
00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:00.810
Second of all in this story,

315
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.960
we see something that we'll see repeatedly in the pentitude and that is that God

316
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:07.770
has to punt a bit.

317
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
He has to modify his plans for the first couple by barring access to the tree of

318
00:20:14.581 --> 00:20:17.370
life.
That was not something presumably he planned to do.

319
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.290
This is in response to perhaps there unforeseen disobedience.

320
00:20:21.291 --> 00:20:23.940
Certainly the way the story unfolds,
it's how it seems to us,

321
00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:28.020
so despite their newfound mortality,

322
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.350
a humans are going to be a force to be reckoned with.

323
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:34.650
They're unpredictable to the very god who created them.

324
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:36.631
Finally,

325
00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:39.390
I'll just draw your attention to some interesting details that you can think

326
00:20:39.391 --> 00:20:44.220
about and maybe talk about in section God ruminates that the humans have become

327
00:20:44.221 --> 00:20:49.221
like one of us in the plural that echoes his words in Genesis one where he

328
00:20:50.051 --> 00:20:54.370
proposes let us make humans or humankind in our image.

329
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.660
Again in the plural,

330
00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:01.290
who was he talking to and what precisely are these chair we'll beam that are

331
00:21:01.691 --> 00:21:04.810
stationed in front of the tree of life barring access.

332
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:10.290
Why do we make of these illusions to divine colleagues or subordinates and light

333
00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:14.410
of Calvin's claims regarding biblical monotheism?

334
00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.640
You should be bringing some of the things we talked about in discussing his work

335
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:22.390
into dialogue with and in conflict with some of the evidence you'll be finding

336
00:21:22.391 --> 00:21:24.130
in the text itself.
So think about these things.

337
00:21:24.131 --> 00:21:27.610
Don't pass over these details lightly and don't take them for granted.

338
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.520
The Cain and Abel story,

339
00:21:30.521 --> 00:21:34.420
which is in Genesis four verses one through 16 this is a story of the first

340
00:21:34.421 --> 00:21:38.890
murder and it's a murder that happens despite God's warning to Cain that it's

341
00:21:38.891 --> 00:21:42.580
possible to master the urge to violence by an act of will.

342
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.780
He says,
sin couches at the door.
It's urges towards you,

343
00:21:46.781 --> 00:21:48.520
yet you can be its master.

344
00:21:48.521 --> 00:21:53.200
Genesis four verse seven now come Sarna and others have noted that the word

345
00:21:53.201 --> 00:21:58.060
brother occurs throughout this story repeatedly and at climax isn't God's

346
00:21:58.061 --> 00:22:02.740
question.
Where is your brother?
Abel and Cain responds,
I don't know,

347
00:22:02.741 --> 00:22:04.180
am I my brother's keeper?

348
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.370
And ironically you sense when you read this that even though Kane and tens,

349
00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:13.750
it says a rhetorical question,
am I my brother's keeper?
In fact,

350
00:22:13.751 --> 00:22:18.010
he's right on the money.
Um,
yes,
we are all of us our brother's keepers.

351
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:23.070
And the strong implication of the story is a CRNA puts it that all homicide is

352
00:22:23.381 --> 00:22:27.190
in fact fratricide seems to be the message of this story.

353
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.530
Note also,
that cane is culpable and for someone to be culpable of something,

354
00:22:32.531 --> 00:22:36.010
we have to assume some principle that they have violated.

355
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:40.450
And therefore this story assumes the existence of what some writers,

356
00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:44.590
Sarna among them have called the universal moral law.

357
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.040
There seems to be in existence from the beginning of creation,

358
00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:52.900
this universal moral law and that is the God in doubt,
sanctity of human life.

359
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:57.430
If we can connect it with the fact that God has created humans in his own image,

360
00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:58.420
um,

361
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:03.010
but the god endowed sanctity of human life is an assumption and it's the

362
00:23:03.011 --> 00:23:06.340
violation of that assumption which makes cane culpable.

363
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.600
The story of Cain and Abel is notable for another theme.

364
00:23:10.601 --> 00:23:13.060
And this is a theme that's going to recur in the Bible.

365
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.070
And that's the tension between,
um,

366
00:23:15.071 --> 00:23:20.071
settled areas and the unsettled desert areas and desert life of the nomads.

367
00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:25.720
Abel is a keeper of sheep.
He represents the nomadic pastoralists,

368
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:29.200
unlike Kane who is the tiller of soil.

369
00:23:29.201 --> 00:23:31.930
So he represents more settled urban life.

370
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.250
God prefers the offering of Abel.
And as a result,

371
00:23:36.251 --> 00:23:39.610
Cain is distressed and jealous to the point of murder.

372
00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:45.330
God's preference for the offering of able valorizes the free life of the nomadic

373
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.350
pastoralists over urban existence.

374
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.800
And even after the Israelites will settle in their own land.

375
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.240
I'm the life of the desert.

376
00:23:53.241 --> 00:23:55.970
Pastoralists remained a sort of romantic ideal for them.

377
00:23:55.971 --> 00:23:58.880
And it's a theme that we'll see coming up in many of the stories.

378
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.750
It's a romantic ideal for this writer too.
Now,

379
00:24:02.751 --> 00:24:07.520
the murderer of Abel by Cain is followed by some genealogical lists.

380
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:12.290
They provide some continuity between the tails.
They tell us,
um,

381
00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:17.660
sort of folkloric traditions about the origins of various arts,

382
00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:21.410
the origins of building,
of metalwork and music.

383
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:24.200
But finally in Genesis six,
verse five,

384
00:24:24.201 --> 00:24:28.160
we read that every imagination of the thoughts of the heart,

385
00:24:28.161 --> 00:24:30.860
the human heart was evil continuously.

386
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:36.200
And this sets the stage then for the story of a worldwide flood.
Now here again,

387
00:24:36.201 --> 00:24:40.040
the Bible is making use of older traditions and motifs and adapting them to

388
00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:42.200
their own purposes of hinted at this already.

389
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.170
And we'll look at it in a bit more detailed.

390
00:24:44.171 --> 00:24:47.780
Now we know of a very ancient Sumerian flood story.

391
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:51.920
The hero of that one is zero dra also on the board.
Um,

392
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.410
we also know of a very early Semitic work,

393
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:59.210
the epic of Etra Hassis in which there's a flood with the most detailed flood

394
00:24:59.211 --> 00:24:59.511
story.

395
00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:03.920
We have actually comes from the epic of Gilgamesh on the 11th tablet of the epic

396
00:25:03.921 --> 00:25:08.390
of Gilgamesh.
Um,
you'll remember that in his search for him,
mortality,

397
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.030
Gilgamesh sought out pitch team,

398
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:15.050
the one human who had been granted and mortality.
He wants to learn his secret.

399
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.480
And when he begs for the secret of eternal life,

400
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.350
he gets eaten up each team's story.
And it's the flood story.

401
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.680
He learns that [inaudible] him and his wife gain the immortality by a twist of

402
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.760
circumstances.

403
00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:32.780
They were the sole survivors of this great flood and as a kind of reward,

404
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.520
they were given mortality.

405
00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.590
The Sumerian story of zeal,

406
00:25:38.591 --> 00:25:43.160
so is very similar to the genesis account in both.

407
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:47.060
You have the flood coming about as the deliberate result of a divine decision.

408
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.840
You have one individual who's chosen to be saved from the flood.

409
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:55.640
That individual has given specific instructions on building an Ark and has given

410
00:25:55.641 --> 00:26:00.170
specific instructions on who to bring on board the Ark.
Um,
he's also,

411
00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.500
um,
the arc also comes to rest on a mountaintop.

412
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:07.940
The hero sends out a bird to reconnoiter the land to find out if it's dry.

413
00:26:07.941 --> 00:26:11.660
Yet when they hero emerges,
he builds an altar,

414
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.980
he offers sacrifice to the deity and receives a blessing.

415
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.410
Very similar parallel stories.

416
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:23.590
And yet there are significant contrasts between the Mesopotamian story and it's

417
00:26:23.691 --> 00:26:25.370
his relight adaptation.

418
00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:30.830
Let's compare some of the elements from all three of the stories with the

419
00:26:30.831 --> 00:26:34.250
biblical story.
Uh,
in the epic of Gilgamesh,

420
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.270
we have no motive given for the divine destruction whatsoever.

421
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:42.080
It just seems to be pure capriciousness and the epic of at Hassis,

422
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:45.450
we do in fact read of a reason and the texts their states,

423
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.200
the land became wide and the people became numerous.

424
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.690
The land bellowed like wild oxen,

425
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.340
but God was disturbed by their uproar and little heard the clamor and said to

426
00:26:56.341 --> 00:27:00.870
the gods,
oppressive has become the clamor of humankind by their upward.

427
00:27:00.871 --> 00:27:01.950
They prevent sleep.

428
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:07.340
So it seems that humankind is to be destroyed because they irritate the gods

429
00:27:08.071 --> 00:27:12.000
with their tumult and noise.
In the Gilgamesh,

430
00:27:12.001 --> 00:27:17.001
epic Ia an Earth Water God does ask another God and Lil how he could have

431
00:27:18.361 --> 00:27:22.590
brought the flood on.
Um,
so senselessly he says,
lay upon the sinner.

432
00:27:22.591 --> 00:27:25.470
This sin lay upon the transgressor his transgression,

433
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.570
which would indicate that in the epic of Gilgamesh,

434
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.770
there is this element of capriciousness the biblical writer in retelling the

435
00:27:31.771 --> 00:27:35.250
story seems to want to reject this idea,
um,

436
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.200
by providing a moral rationale for God's actions.
The earth,

437
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:43.020
the text says,
is destroyed because of Hamas.

438
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.590
Hamas is a word that literally means balance,
bloodshed,

439
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.680
but also all kinds of injustice and oppression.

440
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.970
Noah is saved specifically for his righteousness.

441
00:27:53.971 --> 00:27:58.170
He was righteous in his generation.
He was chosen,
therefore for moral reasons.

442
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:03.180
So the writer's seems very determined to tell the story in a way that depicts

443
00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:05.190
God is acting,
not capriciously,

444
00:28:05.191 --> 00:28:08.070
but according to certain clear standards of justice,

445
00:28:08.071 --> 00:28:11.760
this was deserved punishment and the person who was saved was righteous.

446
00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.670
Furthermore,
in the Mesopotamian accounts,

447
00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.550
the gods do not appear to be in control.

448
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:22.110
This is something that's been pointed out by many writers and Lil,
uh,

449
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.960
wants to destroy humankind completely.

450
00:28:24.961 --> 00:28:29.961
He's forwarded by ear who drops hints of the disaster to Udon a peach team.

451
00:28:31.201 --> 00:28:31.891
So he wound up,

452
00:28:31.891 --> 00:28:35.250
each team knows what to do and therefore manages to escape the flood.

453
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.100
But that's thwarting the design of the God who brought the flood.

454
00:28:38.101 --> 00:28:40.950
He wanted everything destroyed.
When the flood comes,

455
00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.540
the gods themselves seem to have lost control.
Um,
they're,
they're terrified.

456
00:28:45.541 --> 00:28:50.070
They cower.
The text says they cower like dogs,
crouched against the outer wall.

457
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:54.810
Ishtar the goddess Ishtar cried out like a woman in labor.
And Moreover,

458
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:58.410
during the period of the flood,
they don't have food.
They don't have sustenance.

459
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.920
And at the end when [inaudible] offers his sacrifice,

460
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.540
the gods are famished and they crowd around like the around the sacrifice like

461
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:11.340
flies.
The tech says the biblical writer wants to tell a different story.

462
00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.770
In the biblical flood story,

463
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.700
God is represented as being unthreatened by the forces of nature that he

464
00:29:17.701 --> 00:29:20.280
unleashes and being completely in control.

465
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:24.930
He makes the decision to punish humans because the world has corrupted itself

466
00:29:24.931 --> 00:29:27.150
through Hamas to bloodshed and violence.

467
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:32.280
He selects Noah due to his righteousness and he issues a direct command to build

468
00:29:32.281 --> 00:29:33.114
an Ark.

469
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:37.320
He has a clear purpose and he retains control throughout the story.

470
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:38.423
At the end,

471
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.880
the writer doesn't depict him as needing the sacrifice for food or sustenance.

472
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:50.280
We might say that this story like the story of Cain and Abel before it and like

473
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.650
the story we will read later of Sodom and Gomorrah.

474
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:58.390
This story presupposes this universal moral law that Sarna and Kaufman and

475
00:29:58.391 --> 00:30:00.580
others have talked about,
right?

476
00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:05.410
This universal moral law that seems to govern the world and if God sees in

477
00:30:05.411 --> 00:30:09.610
fractions of it,
then as supreme judge,
he brings humans to account.

478
00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.400
If morality is the will of God,

479
00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:16.840
morality then becomes an absolute value and these infractions will be punished

480
00:30:16.841 --> 00:30:18.130
in the biblical writers view.

481
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:23.560
The message of the flood story also seems to be that when humans destroyed the

482
00:30:23.561 --> 00:30:28.240
moral basis of society,
when they are violent or cruel or unkind,

483
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.470
they endanger the very existence of that society.
The world dissolves.

484
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:37.570
So corruption and injustice and lawlessness and violence inevitably bring about

485
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:38.583
destruction.

486
00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:43.330
Some writers have pointed out that it's interesting that these humans are not

487
00:30:43.331 --> 00:30:45.790
being punished for for religious sense,

488
00:30:45.791 --> 00:30:49.030
right dollar tree for worshiping the wrong God or anything of that nature.

489
00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:50.710
And this is important.

490
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:56.040
The view of the first books of the Bible is that each nation worships,

491
00:30:56.401 --> 00:31:00.450
sits own gods,
its own way perhaps at this point in the story.
Um,

492
00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:04.180
perhaps the view is that all know of God even if they ignore him,

493
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:08.740
but the view eventually will be that only Israel is obligated to the god of

494
00:31:08.741 --> 00:31:09.310
Israel.

495
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:14.230
Other nations aren't held accountable to for their idolatry in the books of the

496
00:31:14.231 --> 00:31:19.030
Torah will see this as we as we continue along.
And yet everyone,

497
00:31:19.031 --> 00:31:19.900
all humans,

498
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.700
Israelites and non Israelites alike by virtue of having been created by God in

499
00:31:24.701 --> 00:31:26.110
the image of God,
um,

500
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:29.950
even though they may not know that God or may ignore that God,

501
00:31:29.951 --> 00:31:33.490
they are bound to a basic moral law that precludes murder.

502
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:37.840
And perhaps from this story we could argue other forms of oppression and

503
00:31:37.841 --> 00:31:38.674
violence.

504
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:44.400
What better way to drive home the point that in humanity and violence undermine

505
00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:50.820
the very foundations of society then to describe a situation in which a cosmic

506
00:31:51.071 --> 00:31:54.820
catastrophe results from human corruption and violence.

507
00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.580
It's an idea that runs throughout the Bible.

508
00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.760
It also appears and later Jewish thought and some Christian thought,

509
00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:04.600
some Islamic thought,
the psalmist is going to use this motif.
Um,

510
00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:09.310
when he denounces um,
social injustice,
the exploitation of the poor and so on.

511
00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.380
He says,
through wicked deeds like this,

512
00:32:11.381 --> 00:32:14.380
all the foundations of the earth are moved,
are shaken.

513
00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.380
The Noah story,

514
00:32:17.381 --> 00:32:21.250
the flood story ends with the ushering in of a new era.

515
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.990
And it is in many ways a second creation that mirrors the first creation in some

516
00:32:25.991 --> 00:32:30.070
important ways.
But this time God realizes,
and again,

517
00:32:30.071 --> 00:32:31.690
this is where God's got to punt all the time.

518
00:32:31.691 --> 00:32:33.400
It's what I love about the first part of Genesis.

519
00:32:33.401 --> 00:32:35.860
God is trying to figure out what he has made and what he's done.

520
00:32:35.861 --> 00:32:37.540
And he's got to shift modes all the time.

521
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.460
And God realizes that he's going to have to make a concession.

522
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.570
He's going to have to make a concession to human weakness and the human desire

523
00:32:44.571 --> 00:32:49.370
to kill and is going to have to rectify the circumstances that made his

524
00:32:49.371 --> 00:32:52.340
destruction of the earth necessary in the first place.

525
00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:57.820
So he establishes a covenant with Noah Covenant and humankind receives its first

526
00:32:59.301 --> 00:33:02.720
set of explicit laws.
No more implicit.
You know,
murder is bad.
Oh,

527
00:33:02.721 --> 00:33:03.620
I wish I had known.

528
00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:07.760
Right now we're getting our first explicit set of laws and they're universal in

529
00:33:07.761 --> 00:33:11.450
scope on the biblical writers view.
They applied to all humanity,
not just Israel.

530
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.140
So these are often referred to as the terms of the Noaa hide covenant.

531
00:33:15.141 --> 00:33:16.910
They apply to all humanity.

532
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:22.040
This covenant explicitly prohibits murder in Genesis nine that is the spilling

533
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:26.000
of human blood.
Blood is the symbol of life.

534
00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:30.470
That's a connection that's made elsewhere in the Bible.
Leviticus 17 right?

535
00:33:30.471 --> 00:33:35.330
The life is in the blood,
so blood is the biblical symbol for life,

536
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:40.360
but God is going to make a concession to the human appetite for power and

537
00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:44.270
violence.
Previously,
humans were to be vegetarian.

538
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:48.890
Genesis one the portrait was one in which humans and animals did not compete for

539
00:33:48.891 --> 00:33:52.220
food or consume one another.
Humans were vegetarian.

540
00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:57.320
Now God is saying humans may kill animals to eat them,

541
00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.870
but even so,
he says,

542
00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:04.370
the animal's life is to be treated with reverence and the blood,

543
00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:09.380
which is the life essence must be poured out on the ground,
return to God,

544
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.550
not consumed,

545
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:14.960
so the animal may be eaten to satisfy the human hunger for flesh,

546
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.570
but the life essence itself belongs to God.

547
00:34:17.571 --> 00:34:20.930
It must not be taken even if it's for the purposes of nourishment.

548
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:26.200
Genesis nine verses four through six you shall not eat flesh with its life.

549
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.570
That is its blood for your lifeblood.

550
00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:32.990
I will surely require a reckoning of every beast.

551
00:34:32.991 --> 00:34:36.590
I will require it and of humans.
So if you are killed by a BS story,
human,

552
00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:41.120
there will have to be a reckoning and accounting of every person's brother.

553
00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.070
I will require the life of the person,

554
00:34:43.071 --> 00:34:47.810
whoever shoved sheds the blood of a person in exchange for that person shall his

555
00:34:47.811 --> 00:34:51.710
blood be shed for God made humans in his image all life,

556
00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:53.870
human and animal is sacred to God.

557
00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:59.350
The covenant also entails God's promise to restore the rhythm of life and nature

558
00:34:59.781 --> 00:35:01.730
and never again to destroy the earth.

559
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:07.400
The rainbow is set up as a symbol of the eternal covenant,

560
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:12.350
a token of the eternal reconciliation between the divine and human realms.

561
00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:17.810
And we should note that this notion or this idea of a god who can even make and

562
00:35:17.811 --> 00:35:22.811
keep an eternal covenant is only possible on the view that God's word and we'll

563
00:35:24.171 --> 00:35:29.171
our absolute in susceptible to nullification by some superior power or some

564
00:35:29.301 --> 00:35:33.380
divine antagonist.
Now,
um,
you worked,
I,

565
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.530
I handed out or there was handed out to you a sheet of paper.

566
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:39.510
You might want to get that out in front of you because we're going to talk a

567
00:35:39.511 --> 00:35:43.400
little bit about the flood story in genesis six through nine.
Um,

568
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.660
when we read the flood story in Genesis six through nine were often struck by

569
00:35:48.661 --> 00:35:50.640
the very odd literary style.

570
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.600
I hope you were struck by the odds that are very style and the repetitiveness

571
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.660
and the contradictions.
So I want to ask you now and,
and,

572
00:35:57.661 --> 00:36:01.470
and be brave and speak out,
um,
in your reading of the story,

573
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.610
did anything of that nature strike you?
Was a story hard to follow?

574
00:36:05.611 --> 00:36:09.600
Was it self contradictory and in what ways?
Anything?

575
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.500
Just don't even be polite.
Just throw it right out there.
Yes.

576
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:17.223
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

577
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.530
<v 0>Okay.
We seem to have two sets of instructions,
right?</v>

578
00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:22.731
Someone's pointing out here.

579
00:36:22.731 --> 00:36:25.970
We seem to have two sets of instructions about what to bring on board.

580
00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.150
I had to bring two of each sort of living thing,

581
00:36:29.151 --> 00:36:33.920
animals and birds and creeping things.
Or in another passage,

582
00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:38.600
God tells Moses to bring on seven pairs of pure animals.
Um,

583
00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:43.460
and one pair of impure animals and seven pairs of birds,

584
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:45.710
right?
Different sets of instructions.

585
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:48.110
Anything else strike you as odd when you were reading this story?

586
00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.980
Okay.
Rain seems to be there for different amounts of time,
doesn't it?

587
00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:01.590
There are some passages in which the flood is said to last for 40 days or beyond

588
00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.800
the earth for 40 days.
You find that in genesis seven,
verse 17,

589
00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.780
but in Genesis seven verse 24,
150 days is given us the time of the flood.

590
00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:14.740
Anything else?
Any other sorts of doublets or contradictions?

591
00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.090
<v 1>Okay,</v>

592
00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:17.990
<v 0>because there are a few more.</v>

593
00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:24.420
Who's giving the instructions?

594
00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:29.920
That's not hard.
That's not hard.

595
00:37:29.921 --> 00:37:33.820
You haven't right in front of you who's giving the instructions.
Okay.
God,

596
00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:36.280
we have the word God being used,
I guess in that translation,
right?

597
00:37:36.281 --> 00:37:39.220
With a capital g,
what else is used?
Lord?

598
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.460
Those are actually different Hebrew words underneath there.
Okay.

599
00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:45.970
Those two terms are different names for the dd that's giving the instruction.

600
00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:50.440
Okay,
so there are two designation is used for God,
Yahweh way,

601
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.100
which is the sacred Tetra Gramaton.
It's written with four letters in Hebrew.

602
00:37:54.101 --> 00:37:57.250
There you don't include avowals.
Um,
we don't really know how it's pronounced.

603
00:37:57.251 --> 00:38:00.910
I'm guessing it your way and that is a proper name for God and in your

604
00:38:00.911 --> 00:38:04.090
translation that will be translated as lord in small caps.

605
00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:06.220
So wherever you see lord in small caps,

606
00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:11.320
that's actually the English translation for yeah way.
Um,
the proper name,

607
00:38:11.321 --> 00:38:12.910
like a,
almost a personal name for God.

608
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:17.210
And then in other places we have this word Elohim,
which um,

609
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:22.500
actually is the word for God's a sort of generic term for deities in the plural.

610
00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:26.470
However,
when it's used to refer to the god of Israel,
it's clearly singular.

611
00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:27.790
It always has a singular verb.

612
00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:32.230
So that will be appearing in your text as God with a capital g.

613
00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:35.890
Okay.
So whenever you see Lord or God,

614
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:39.370
those are actually pointing to different words that are being used in the

615
00:38:39.371 --> 00:38:40.600
underlying Hebrew text.

616
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:44.410
Twice God has said to look down on creation twice.

617
00:38:44.411 --> 00:38:46.660
It has said that he is displeased twice.

618
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:50.500
He decides to destroy all living things twice the issues,
instructions.

619
00:38:50.501 --> 00:38:52.210
And as we've seen,
they're contradictory.

620
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:55.870
We seem to also have a different account of how long the flood lasted.

621
00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.930
There are more subtle contradictions throughout as well.

622
00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:02.740
Sometimes the flood seems to the be the result of very heavy rain,

623
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:07.030
but in other descriptions it seems to be a real cosmic of upheaval.

624
00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.420
You'll remember the description of the world from genesis one as an air bubble

625
00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:15.190
essentially that's formed by separating waters above and waters below and

626
00:39:15.191 --> 00:39:15.971
they're held back.

627
00:39:15.971 --> 00:39:19.990
We're pressed back by the firmament above and it's the windows in the firmament

628
00:39:19.991 --> 00:39:23.140
that are open.
Those waters are allowed to rush in and dissolve that air bubble.

629
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:26.320
It's as if we're back to square one with the deep right.

630
00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:27.760
Just this watery mass again.

631
00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:32.470
So it's creation undoing itself in some of the descriptions as opposed to just

632
00:39:32.471 --> 00:39:36.490
heavy rain.
And in keeping with that idea of a kind of a return to chaos,

633
00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.630
Noah is represented in a way as the beginning of a new creation because like

634
00:39:40.631 --> 00:39:42.640
Adam and eve and the first creation story,

635
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:44.950
no as told to be fruitful and multiply.

636
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.750
He's also given rule over everything and that's now extended to the taking of

637
00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:50.584
human life.

638
00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:56.340
The Bible contains a lot of repetition in contradiction and sometimes it occurs

639
00:39:57.281 --> 00:40:02.281
in one passage as in the flood story here and sometimes it occurs in stories are

640
00:40:02.291 --> 00:40:05.800
passages that are separate from one another.
For example,

641
00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.390
the two creation stories,

642
00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:12.850
there are many significant differences between the two creation stories.

643
00:40:12.851 --> 00:40:17.050
They differ greatly in style.
Genesis one is formalized.

644
00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:18.790
It's highly structured,
right?

645
00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:21.820
It has the seven days and everything is paired up and it's beautifully

646
00:40:21.821 --> 00:40:25.510
structured.
It's very abstract.
Genesis two,
as much more dramatic,

647
00:40:25.511 --> 00:40:27.280
much more earthy.
Um,

648
00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:30.970
the first creation story doesn't really contain puns and word plays.

649
00:40:30.971 --> 00:40:31.990
It's a little bit serious.

650
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:35.260
The second creation story is full of them are all sorts of little ironies and

651
00:40:35.261 --> 00:40:39.100
puns in the,
in the Hebrew,
a dumb the earthling made from the earth.

652
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:43.210
A dom is made from Adam Ma.
Adam and Eve are naked.
A room,

653
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.450
which is the same word for clever or shrewd and the snake is our room.

654
00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:49.480
He's clever and shrewd.
They,
there are lots of little puns of this kind.

655
00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.810
There are also differences in terminology between the two stories.

656
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:57.280
Genesis one speaks of male and female.
It's that one set of Hebrew terms,

657
00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.740
but genesis two uses man and woman,

658
00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:03.580
a different set of Hebrew terms to describe the genders.
So the gender,

659
00:41:03.581 --> 00:41:06.100
the terms for gender are different in the two stories.

660
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:11.020
Genesis one refers to God as in your translation,
God,

661
00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:16.240
Elohim,
the word that's a translated as God.
He's remote,
he's transcendent,

662
00:41:16.241 --> 00:41:20.470
he creates effortlessly through his word and through his will.

663
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:25.270
But Genesis two we first the deity as a name.
That's really a combination.

664
00:41:25.271 --> 00:41:27.910
It's Yahweh Elohim.
So you'll see Lord God,
right?

665
00:41:27.911 --> 00:41:29.860
You see that a lot in the Bible as well.
Lord God,

666
00:41:29.861 --> 00:41:32.590
that tells you that both of those words are side by side in the original Hebrew.

667
00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:36.650
So in genesis two the DD is Yahweh Elohim.
He's much more down to earth.

668
00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.910
He forms the human like a potter,
working with clay.
He talks to himself.

669
00:41:40.911 --> 00:41:44.360
He plants a garden,
he takes a stroll in the garden in the cool of the evening.

670
00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.690
He makes clothes for Adam and eve.

671
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:50.810
He's spoken of and much more anthropomorphic terms.

672
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.450
Then the God that we encounter in genesis one.

673
00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:58.190
So what we have in the first few chapters of genesis are two creation stories.

674
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.100
They have distinctive styles,
distinctive themes,

675
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.160
distinctive vocabularies and their place side by side.

676
00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:08.840
In genesis six through nine we seem to have two flood stories with distinctive

677
00:42:08.841 --> 00:42:13.070
styles and themes and vocabularies and substantive details,

678
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:17.510
but they're interwoven instead of being placed side by side and there are many

679
00:42:17.511 --> 00:42:22.280
such doublets in the Bible at times we have whole books that repeat or go over

680
00:42:22.281 --> 00:42:24.410
the same material.
In fact,

681
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:28.580
the whole historical saga that's recorded from genesis through the end of second

682
00:42:28.581 --> 00:42:33.230
kings is rehearsed again in the books of first and second chronicles.

683
00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:38.680
What are we to make of the repetitions and the contradictions here and

684
00:42:38.781 --> 00:42:41.570
throughout the Bible?
What are the implications?

685
00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.980
Suppose you came across a piece of writing that you knew nothing about,

686
00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:51.170
just lying there on the table.
You didn't know who wrote it,
where,
when,

687
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.900
how,
why,
and someone says,

688
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.320
I want you to draw some conclusions about that piece of writing.

689
00:42:57.321 --> 00:43:00.710
I want you to draw some conclusions about it's authorship and the way it was

690
00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:04.610
compiled or composed and so you pick it up and you start reading and you notice

691
00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:07.400
features like this.
What my,
to conclude,

692
00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.970
throw it out.
What might you conclude?
No presuppositions.

693
00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:15.490
You pick up the work and you find these features.

694
00:43:15.491 --> 00:43:19.140
What might you conclude about its author,
shipper manner of composition?
Yeah.

695
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:27.670
You might conclude that there are multiple authors write multiple authorship.

696
00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:28.533
Yeah.

697
00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:35.960
That revisions may have been made so that you might have different sources that

698
00:43:36.251 --> 00:43:39.070
have been revised or put together in different ways,
right?

699
00:43:39.071 --> 00:43:42.790
Visions implying you've got something and then it's worked over again.

700
00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:45.460
Additions might be made,
so now that's a new source.
Right?

701
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:50.140
You might conclude that these features are evidence of multiple authorship,

702
00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:54.460
a good deal of revision,
which points itself to a kind of composite structure,

703
00:43:54.461 --> 00:43:59.290
different layers,
maybe different sources.
Well,
as early as the Middle Ages,

704
00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.710
there were some scholars who noticed these things in the biblical texts,

705
00:44:02.711 --> 00:44:05.320
they noticed that there were contradictions and repetitions and there are

706
00:44:05.321 --> 00:44:06.041
anachronisms.

707
00:44:06.041 --> 00:44:10.660
Two other features that were evidence of multiple authorship revisions and

708
00:44:10.661 --> 00:44:13.870
composite structure.
So what,
why would that be a big deal?

709
00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:19.810
Okay.
We can all go home then there's no problem with that.
Right?

710
00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.090
Why would that be a big deal?
Yeah.

711
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.940
Okay.

712
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.790
It could be a bit of a problem if this text has become the basis for a system of

713
00:44:32.791 --> 00:44:36.630
religious faith or belief and your assumptions about it are that it's telling a

714
00:44:36.631 --> 00:44:38.280
truth that is singular in nature.

715
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:43.200
And also what about the traditional beliefs in the origin of this text?
Right?

716
00:44:43.201 --> 00:44:46.200
Who wrote this text going into traditional beliefs?

717
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:52.420
I'm hearing Moses,
I'm hearing God.
I'm hearing a bunch of different things,

718
00:44:52.421 --> 00:44:53.081
but right.

719
00:44:53.081 --> 00:44:57.520
There are traditional ideas about generally the mosaic authorship of the Bible,

720
00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:59.770
certainly the first five books of the Bible.

721
00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:03.280
And so these features of the text,

722
00:45:03.281 --> 00:45:06.490
which were noticed were a challenge to traditional religious convictions

723
00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.670
regarding the mosaic authorship of the first five books of the Bible.

724
00:45:09.671 --> 00:45:10.510
And in many ways,

725
00:45:10.511 --> 00:45:13.720
the perfection of the Bible as speaking with a unified voice on matters of

726
00:45:13.721 --> 00:45:18.130
doctrine or religious theology.
So medieval commentators,

727
00:45:18.131 --> 00:45:19.450
for example,
um,

728
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:23.380
began to speak a little bit more openly about some of these features.

729
00:45:23.381 --> 00:45:27.970
One of the first things they noticed is that Deuteronomy 34 describes the death

730
00:45:27.971 --> 00:45:29.020
and burial of Moses.

731
00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:33.220
So they decided it was possible that Moses didn't write at least that chapter.

732
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:37.240
Similarly,
there were some anachronisms that they had to explain.

733
00:45:37.241 --> 00:45:40.630
One of the most famous is in genesis 13 verse seven.

734
00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:45.250
It's a midst of a story about dividing the land between lot and at that time,

735
00:45:45.251 --> 00:45:46.990
his name is Abraham.
Later becomes Abraham.

736
00:45:46.991 --> 00:45:50.800
But between lot and Abraham and the narrator in telling the story sort of

737
00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:52.390
interjects and turns to us,

738
00:45:52.391 --> 00:45:57.391
the readers and says the Canaanites and parasites were then dwelling in the

739
00:45:57.461 --> 00:46:00.610
land.
Now,
what's weird about that sentence?

740
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:05.440
The narrator is speaking to us from a time in which the Canaanites and parasites

741
00:46:05.441 --> 00:46:06.730
don't live in the land,
right?

742
00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:11.590
That's back when the native Americans lived in Connecticut.
Is that right?

743
00:46:11.591 --> 00:46:14.140
Are Living at a time when native Americans are still living in Connecticut or

744
00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.690
owning Connecticut?
No.
They're writing from a later point of view.

745
00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:21.100
So the narrator breaks and talks to the audience in genesis 13 and seven says

746
00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:23.530
that was back in the time and the Canaanites were in the land.

747
00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:28.270
When did Moses live?
Who lived in the land and the time of Moses?
The Canaanites,

748
00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.430
I know you haven't gotten there yet,
but when you get to Deuteronomy,

749
00:46:30.431 --> 00:46:32.200
you're going to find out he doesn't make it into the land.

750
00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:36.250
So he never makes it in there.
He's never gets in before the Israelites conquer.

751
00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.410
He dies.
The Canaanites are still in possession.

752
00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.620
So that line was certainly written not by Moses,

753
00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:45.550
is written by someone at a much later time who's looking back and referring to

754
00:46:45.551 --> 00:46:47.170
the time when the Canaanites were in the land.

755
00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:50.110
So these are the kinds of things that people began to notice.

756
00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.440
And with the rise of rationalism in the modern period,

757
00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:58.030
traditional notions of the divine and mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch or the

758
00:46:58.031 --> 00:47:01.390
Torah.
The first five books of Moses were called into question.

759
00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:06.490
The modern critical study of the Bible begins really with Spinosa who in the

760
00:47:06.491 --> 00:47:11.491
early 17th century suggested that the Bible should be studied and examined.

761
00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:14.680
Like any book without presuppositions,

762
00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:17.320
without presuppositions about its divine origin,

763
00:47:17.321 --> 00:47:21.070
or any other dogmatic claims about its composition or authorship.

764
00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:25.480
But it was a Catholic priest,
Richard Cmon.
We shard Simone,

765
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:30.610
who first argued that Moses didn't write the Torah and that it contained many

766
00:47:30.611 --> 00:47:33.400
anachronisms and errors.
We've run out of time.

767
00:47:33.401 --> 00:47:37.600
But I'll pick up this fascinating story on Wednesday and we'll learn a little

768
00:47:37.601 --> 00:47:39.010
bit more about tradition,
uh,

769
00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:42.010
about critical ideas about the composition of the Bible.

770
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.870
Please be on the lookout for emails from section leaders with study guides for

771
00:47:46.871 --> 00:47:48.790
sections,
which will be meeting this week.

772
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.010
You'll have a lot of fun with the creation stories.
