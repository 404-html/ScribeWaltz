1
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.700
Let me just briefly recap.

2
00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:06.090
As we're moving into the literary profits or the classical prophets are

3
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:06.990
sometimes called,

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.130
it's easiest to think of them as being associated with particular crises in the

5
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:13.050
nation's history.
We're not going to be looking at them all,

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.880
and I've picked out some of the main ones that we'll be looking at.
Really,

7
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:19.680
they're exemplary in a number of different ways.

8
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.720
So you have profits of the Assyrian crisis.

9
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.550
This is when the two kingdoms still exist.

10
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.030
So in the north prophesied in Israel you have Amos and Hosea,

11
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.400
and in the south of Isaiah and Micah,

12
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.590
they'll so think of those four books together.

13
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.660
It'd be easier to know what the differences among them,

14
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:35.430
if you group them together and we'll be doing that.

15
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.560
Then the profits of the Babylonian crisis.

16
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:39.480
By this time the northern kingdom has fallen.

17
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.940
We're moving towards the end of the seventh century.

18
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.960
The Assyrian Empire has fallen in six 12 the profit knock home talks about the

19
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:50.460
fall of Assyria and we move then into the very end of the century and down to

20
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:53.640
the beginning of the sixth century with the destruction of,
of Judah.

21
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.000
So profits associated with that time,
particularly Jeremiah,
uh,

22
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:58.470
on also also have a cook.

23
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.260
Then we have the profit of the exile who is Ezekiel and then the post exhilarate

24
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:05.970
period or the restoration when the,

25
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.300
when the Israelites were allowed to return to their land.

26
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.770
And we have several profits at that time.
Hi Guys,
Zechariah,
Joel and Malakai.

27
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:16.200
We're B will be,
the profits will be looking at briefly.

28
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.730
There are three long prophetic works and I have circled those,
Isaiah,

29
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.930
Jeremiah and Ezekiel one associated with each of the three crises.
So again,

30
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:28.120
another mnemonic for you is to sort of think of them,
um,

31
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.010
each associated with each of those major crises.
Um,

32
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.850
and the rest are all much shorter works.
I think Ovadia value being the shortest,

33
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:37.740
really just a very,
very short work.

34
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.370
There's been a long debate over the degree to which these classical or literary

35
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:49.761
profits we're harking back to longstanding Israelite traditions or constructing

36
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:56.370
norms that would later come to be viewed as longstanding Israelite traditions.

37
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.181
Uh,

38
00:01:57.181 --> 00:02:02.181
Koufman describes these classical profits as the standard bearers of the

39
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:04.860
covenant.
This is his term.
And in his view,

40
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:08.430
they couldn't be seen as conservatives.
But by the same token,

41
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:12.960
he says the new prophecy conceived ideas,
um,
that,

42
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.070
that Israelite thought of the earlier time had not conceived.

43
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.340
And in this sense,
Koufman argues they are also radical.

44
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:24.380
He describes them as radical conservatives are conservative radicals.
Um,

45
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.120
as a result of the radical nature of some of their mesh message,

46
00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:30.270
the profits had to speak with great exaggeration.

47
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.180
And you will notice this when you read the writing,
great exaggeration,

48
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:37.530
a lot of dramatic imagery,
um,
dramatic features.
They denounced the people,

49
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:39.420
they chest dies,
the people,
uh,

50
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:43.230
and as a result they were often scoffed at or even persecuted in return.

51
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.150
But eventually the nation would come to enshrine their words.

52
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.010
And it's ancient sacred heritage,

53
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.850
which is testimony to the fact that their message must have served a crucial

54
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:57.570
role at sometime in the changing political and religious reality.

55
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.040
Now we've already talked about the Deuteronomistic historiography and how it

56
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:08.020
developed as an interpretation of the historical catastrophes of seven 22 and

57
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:08.950
five 86.

58
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.140
And this interpretation made it possible for Israelites to accept the reality of

59
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.160
the defeat of the nation,

60
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:18.970
that feed of Israel without at the same time losing faith in God,

61
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.800
the defeat of Israel,

62
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:25.801
the exile of the nation was not to be taken as evidence that God was not the one

63
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:31.111
supreme lord of history or that God was a faithless God who had abandoned his

64
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:32.770
covenant and his people.

65
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.100
The defeat and the exile were interpreted to affirm precisely the opposite God

66
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.950
as the universal God could use other nations as his tool.

67
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.060
He could use these nations to execute judgment on his people,

68
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.760
and he did this in an act of faithfulness,

69
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.170
ultimately faithful to his covenant which promised punishment and chastisement

70
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.170
for the sins of the people,
the sins of idolatry,

71
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.300
the classical literary prophets,
Isaiah,
Jeremiah,
Ezekiel,

72
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:06.190
and the 12 minor prophets follow the basic thrust of this interpretation of

73
00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:07.024
events.

74
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.060
They agree that the defeat and the exile are evidence rather than disproof of

75
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:14.230
God's universal sovereignty,

76
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.010
and they agree that they are gods just punishment for sin,

77
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.000
but they're going to differ from the deuteronomist in two significant ways.

78
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.340
First they're going to differ in their identification of that sin for the

79
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:31.150
profits.
It isn't just idolatry,
uh,
for which Israel is punished,

80
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.640
although that's important too.
And second of all,

81
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:37.560
they're going to differ in their emphasis on a future restoration and a glory,

82
00:04:37.561 --> 00:04:40.570
a message that we don't find in the Deuteronomistic historian.

83
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.250
The individual books of the prophets are really arranged according to two

84
00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:48.310
principals interacting principles,
size and chronology.

85
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.290
So you have the first three books are the very large prophetic books,
Isaiah,

86
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.550
Jeremiah and Ezekiel,

87
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.850
Ezekiel in chronological order of the three crises we've outlined here.
Uh,

88
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.160
and then you have the minor prophets and the minor prophets again are in roughly

89
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:04.610
chronological order.
Um,

90
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.800
although book size also plays a bit of a role in arranging these materials.

91
00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:09.220
And I was very common in the ancient world,

92
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:12.600
first for size to determine the order of books and a corpus.
Um,

93
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.540
we are not going to be following the order of the cannon,
um,

94
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.140
because it does jump around chronologically first with the large three large

95
00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:23.470
books and then going back and having some of the smaller books of earlier

96
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:27.460
profits.
We're going to be looking at them in in chronological order.

97
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:30.640
We're going to be looking at them against the backdrop of the historical crisis

98
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:31.780
to which they're responding.

99
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.510
So we're going to begin with the first of the literary profits,

100
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:37.420
even though it's not the first in the order of the,
of the Bible.

101
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.610
And that is Amos and Amos preached during a relatively stable period of time.

102
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.840
This was in the northern kingdom,
is around seven 50 under the reign of Jeroboam.

103
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:48.640
The second,
not the first,

104
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.890
and this is at a time before the Assyrian threat is,

105
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.640
is becoming very apparent and,
and,

106
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.240
and a series empire building ambitions before those are becoming very apparent.

107
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.750
There are many passages that suggest that Amos was an ordinary shepherd.

108
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.720
He came from a small town about 10 miles south of Jerusalem.

109
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:11.990
So he came from the southern kingdom to prophesied in the northern kingdom.

110
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.670
He was called to Bethel,

111
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.180
which was one of the royals sanctuaries in the northern kingdom to deliver his

112
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:19.780
profits,
his prophecies.
Um,

113
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.470
but despite the suggestion that he was an ordinary shepherd,

114
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.660
it seems more likely that he was probably a fairly wealthy owner of land and

115
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:30.080
flocks.
He was probably educated and literate.
Um,

116
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.010
the northerners are said to be very surprised by his,

117
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.710
his eloquence and his intelligence,
but they didn't like his message.

118
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:39.890
And ultimately he's going to be forced to go back to the southern kingdom.

119
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.900
The book of almost can be divided structurally into four sections,

120
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:48.650
which I've listed on the board over here.
You first have a set of,

121
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:52.610
of brief oracles of doom is there in the first two chapters.
I'm a one and two.

122
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.170
And then you have a series of three short Oracle's Oracle's to the women of

123
00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.200
Symeria and Oracle to the wealthy,

124
00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:03.350
have some area and Jerusalem and then an oracle to Israel as a whole.

125
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.300
These are in chapters three through six.

126
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.940
This is followed then by five symbolic visions which receive interpretation.

127
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.130
These are visions of judgment first locusts than a fire,

128
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.180
than a plumb line that one uses.
And building a building,
um,

129
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:26.260
a basket of fruit and then a vision of God standing by the altar at Basal.

130
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.450
This happens chapters seven through nine,
um,

131
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.310
about verse eight and nine.
It also,

132
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.820
this section besides the five visions also has a little narrative account of

133
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:40.940
emesis conflict with a priest at Bethel,

134
00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:45.530
the priest Matsiya who accuses most of treason.
All right.

135
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.580
And then there's a concluding epilogue in the ninth chapter that runs for about

136
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:52.520
seven or eight versus to the end of the book.

137
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.710
So the book of Amos is a wonderful place to start for us because it contains

138
00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:00.920
many features that are going to be typical of all of the classical profits,

139
00:08:00.921 --> 00:08:02.870
all of the literary profits by and large.

140
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.110
And also this book introduces certain major themes.

141
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:10.490
These will become standard themes of prophecy with some variation here and
there.

142
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.440
So by setting them out in the book of Amos,

143
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.440
then we can really go forward and just look at the variations on some of those

144
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:18.230
themes that are sounded by some of the,
the other profits.

145
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.300
So first some literary features.

146
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:23.900
And then we'll talk about the themes of the book.
In terms of literary features.

147
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:25.220
I've jotted down a few here.

148
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.810
You see in the book what we would call editorial notes.
That is to say,
um,

149
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.870
you have notes in the book of Amos,
which are in the third person.

150
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.510
These won't very often occur at the beginning of a book.

151
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.190
They sort of introduce her,
set the stage.
So we have an Amos,
the words of Amos,

152
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:40.670
a sheep,

153
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:44.660
a sheep breeder from Tacoma who prophesied concerning Israel in the reigns of

154
00:08:44.661 --> 00:08:47.010
King's Uccja of Judah and Jeroboam,
the son of Joe,

155
00:08:47.011 --> 00:08:49.730
wash of Israel two years before the earthquake.

156
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.030
So almost all of the prophetic books are going to contain an interdict

157
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.730
introduction of this type,
some third person,
um,

158
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.210
phrase which will identify the place and the Prophet and his time.
Um,

159
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.970
there's another kind of,
um,
uh,
of writing in some of these works as well.

160
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.510
Um,
which is in the first person.
It's not always in the third person,

161
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:13.110
but you sometimes have first person passages in which the prophet himself,

162
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.970
we'll speak about and describe something about himself.
Right?
It's,

163
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:20.660
it's stepping aside from the irregular moment and,

164
00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:23.520
and speaking in some way about some experience that he's had.

165
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.510
So we have these first person and the third person passages that give us

166
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.800
information about the profit.

167
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:33.030
The third person passages we surmise may have been written by the prophet,

168
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:37.980
but they were probably written by disciples or others who were responsible for

169
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:42.660
collecting the profits.
Oracles,
indicting the profits.
Oracles,

170
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:47.130
um,
almost seven is an example of this.
In almost seven,

171
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:51.720
we find an example of this kind of writing again where you have a description of

172
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:56.580
Amos in debate with a priest,
priest dementia at the,
at the shrine of Bethel.

173
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.700
Okay?
So you have the irregular statements,
but you also have these other,
um,

174
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:05.520
identifying passages as well and descriptive passages.
Um,

175
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:07.020
this brings us then to a second point,

176
00:10:07.021 --> 00:10:11.940
which is that the prophetic books are a compilation of a variety of materials.

177
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.300
All right?
They consist of varied materials that have been collected.

178
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.930
They've been revised,
they've been supplemented the profits,

179
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:23.190
Oracle's which were delivered in various situations over a period of time.

180
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:28.220
We're apparently saved and then compiled again perhaps by the prophet himself,

181
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.480
perhaps by his disciples.

182
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.400
We know that prophetic oracles were written down and transmitted in other

183
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.820
ancient near eastern societies.
We know this about a Syria for example.

184
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.340
These were literary compositions.

185
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:46.370
And the literary nature of these compositions will account sometimes for their

186
00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:50.550
ordering.
Sometimes,
um,
it appears that there is not chronological ordering.

187
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:53.100
This is one of the things that can make it so hard to read some of the prophetic

188
00:10:53.101 --> 00:10:54.930
writings because they are not,

189
00:10:54.931 --> 00:10:57.420
the oracles are not necessarily in chronological order,

190
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.710
they are literary works and sometimes the profit or the disciple or the editor

191
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.610
would combine principles or juxtapose,
sorry,

192
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.780
combine oracles or juxtapose Oracle's according to principles other than

193
00:11:09.781 --> 00:11:12.600
chronology literary principles.
So for example,

194
00:11:12.601 --> 00:11:15.290
you very often find the principle of a catchword,

195
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.600
a prophecy or oracle that might end with a particular word in,

196
00:11:19.601 --> 00:11:21.690
in its last line or last spurs.

197
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.540
And so next to it will be a second prophecy or Oracle,

198
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.030
which echoes that word in its opening line.

199
00:11:27.031 --> 00:11:29.670
And so the two have been brought together for literary reasons.

200
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.390
So Amos three verse two reads,
you alone,

201
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:38.391
have I known of all the families of the earth and that's the concluding line of

202
00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:40.200
that particular oracle.

203
00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:45.201
And that verb to know is probably the catchword for the oracle that follows

204
00:11:45.241 --> 00:11:46.410
because the next one opens.

205
00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:48.930
Do two people walk together unless they know each other.

206
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.870
So that may have suggested the juxtaposition of those two.

207
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.110
So we need to understand that the prophetic books are really little anthologies,

208
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:57.340
anthologies of Oracle's.

209
00:11:57.341 --> 00:12:01.480
They can be connected for literary rather than substantive or chronological

210
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:03.970
reasons.
You can't assume chronological sequence.

211
00:12:03.971 --> 00:12:08.290
It's not like reading the historical books of Joshua through second kings.

212
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:08.591
It's very,

213
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:13.591
very different and interesting question concerns the degree to which the

214
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:19.060
prophetic books preserve the actual oracles of the profits.

215
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:24.430
Certainly there's no doubt that there has been revision and supplementation of

216
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.990
the prophetic books.
Not Everything in the book of Amos is from Amos himself.

217
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.910
Additions have been made to most of the prophetic books.
Um,

218
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.970
it was believed that the words of the prophets had enduring significance.

219
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.360
Those are received.
These words believed that they had enduring significance.

220
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.800
And so they were supplemented because of the conviction that they had enduring

221
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:46.810
relevance,
not despite of it,
because of it.

222
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.680
And some scholars believe that this accounts for the Oracle and Amos to that

223
00:12:52.841 --> 00:12:55.990
prophesies the fall of Judah and he misses living in seven 50,

224
00:12:55.991 --> 00:12:58.450
the latter half of the eighth century,
not in the sixth century.

225
00:12:58.451 --> 00:13:02.440
He's living in the eighth century,
but he prophesized the fall of Judah.

226
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:06.280
And most people would assume that this is an addition which is made to the book

227
00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:07.990
of Amos after Judas Fall.

228
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.540
These supplementations and additions and revisions that we will see in some of

229
00:13:13.541 --> 00:13:15.670
the prophetic books.
And some of them are quite obvious.

230
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.100
We're not completely promiscuous.

231
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.450
I don't want to give you the idea that they were,
um,

232
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:25.300
because there are many instances in which a profits words are not updated,

233
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.470
are not modified,

234
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:31.450
even though the failure to do this leaves the prophecy a woefully out of step

235
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.790
with what actually came to be later.

236
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.330
So those kinds of inconsistencies between a profits,

237
00:13:37.331 --> 00:13:41.590
words and later fact with suggests that there was a strong tendency to preserve

238
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.600
the words of the prophet faithfully.

239
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:47.590
So we will see both tendencies within the litter literature tendency to leave

240
00:13:47.591 --> 00:13:51.640
words and tech and at the same place a tendency to supplement or to add sections

241
00:13:51.641 --> 00:13:53.530
to the prophet,
the prophetic writing.

242
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.780
A third feature that we'll see in many of the prophetic books is what we call

243
00:13:58.781 --> 00:14:02.320
the call.
And this is common to most of the profits.

244
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:07.350
It's the claim to authority as a result of having been called by God to deliver

245
00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:10.690
his word.
We talked before about apostolic prophecy,

246
00:14:10.691 --> 00:14:13.960
this notion of the profit as someone who is sent by God with a message,

247
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:17.710
not someone who has a consulted by a client to find out what God thinks.

248
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:22.450
The irresistibility of the call is a feature of these passages and we find it

249
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:25.870
illustrated an Amos three verses seven and eight,

250
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:31.440
after citing a series of proverbs that illustrate inexorable cause and effect,

251
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.760
uh,
for example,
he says,

252
00:14:33.761 --> 00:14:37.060
does a trap spring up from the ground unless it is caught something.

253
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:42.040
And then the oracle continues.
A lion has roared who can but fear my lord.

254
00:14:42.041 --> 00:14:46.660
God has spoken who can but prophesy.
Why does this irresistible call?

255
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.610
We find metaphors used,
um,

256
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.640
liberally throughout the prophetic writings.

257
00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:57.080
And Amos describes his prophecy by means of two types of metaphors,

258
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.550
word and vision.

259
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:04.250
So many of the prophetic oracles will be introduced by the phrase,

260
00:15:04.251 --> 00:15:08.160
the word of Yahweh came onto profit x,
the word of Yahweh.

261
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.530
He came sort of an image of God's speaking directly to these profits in human

262
00:15:12.531 --> 00:15:17.210
language,
which is then repeated or passed on to the audience,
to the listener.

263
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.900
Um,
this could be understood in the literal sense.

264
00:15:20.901 --> 00:15:23.660
We could take this as a metaphor behind it,
however,

265
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:26.660
is a simple idea that it is God who is communicating to the prophet and the

266
00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:28.790
prophet than communicates the message to the people.

267
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.050
But in addition to hearing Amos and many of the other prophets also see,

268
00:15:33.051 --> 00:15:35.270
so the word of the Lord comes,
but another moments,

269
00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:39.350
the prophetic oracle but will be introduced by by verbs or words and connected

270
00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:44.270
with seeing and vision,
hence the word seer as a designation for a profit.
Also.

271
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.170
Yes,

272
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:50.170
Amos is shown visions of various kinds and particularly those five visions

273
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:55.010
clumped in chapter seven,
eight,
nine.
And this is true of the profits.

274
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.930
Generally these visions might be visions of God's speaking or visions of God

275
00:15:59.931 --> 00:16:01.430
performing some kind of action.

276
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:06.850
They might also be visions of perfectly ordinary objects or events that carry

277
00:16:07.981 --> 00:16:09.890
some sort of symbolic significance.

278
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.900
So we have five visions in Amos in chapter seven through nine and some of them

279
00:16:14.901 --> 00:16:16.430
are visions of ordinary objects,

280
00:16:16.431 --> 00:16:20.870
but those objects have some special coated meaning or symbolic significance for

281
00:16:20.871 --> 00:16:23.600
Israel.
And then we have visions of extraordinary things as well.

282
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.300
So we have a locust plague.
It's about to consume the crop.
Um,

283
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.760
right after the king has taken his share,
um,
his taxes of the crop.

284
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.950
I'm not such an extraordinary vision.

285
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:39.020
But then there's a vision of a fire that consumes the lower waters that are

286
00:16:39.021 --> 00:16:42.530
pressed down below the earth and which threatens to consume even the soil,

287
00:16:42.531 --> 00:16:47.090
the earth itself.
It's an extraordinary vision.
We have a vision of the plum line,

288
00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.080
right?
The tool that's used by v builders.
There's a vision of God.

289
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.690
I'm destroying worshipers in the temple.

290
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.080
The Vision in chapter eight is an ordinary vision.

291
00:16:57.081 --> 00:17:01.910
It's a vision of a basket of summer fruit.
Um,
the Hebrew word for,

292
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.400
for summer or summer fruit is kites.

293
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:08.240
And this is a pun because the word Kate's means end.

294
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.770
So the vision of kites is indicating or symbolizing the kits,

295
00:17:12.771 --> 00:17:16.910
the end of Israel.
And these kinds of symbolic visions will very often,
um,

296
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:21.920
typically include puns of this,
of this type.
So,
uh,

297
00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:22.730
another,
uh,

298
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:26.360
point to May just make about just the literary features of prophetic writings is

299
00:17:26.361 --> 00:17:30.290
that they do contain or employ a variety of literary forms.

300
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:35.420
One commonplace form that you will see over and over again in these writings as

301
00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:38.960
a form that we call the Oracle and Oracle against the nations.

302
00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.370
This is found an aimless.
It's found also in the three large prophetic writings,

303
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:44.840
Isaiah,
Jeremiah and Ezekiel.

304
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.920
Amos one and two contains seven of these oracles that inveigh against the

305
00:17:49.921 --> 00:17:54.120
nations.
But I must give the form a new twist.
And this is what's interesting.

306
00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.980
Six of the seven oracles are directed against surrounding nations and they are

307
00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:01.980
excoriated for they're inhumane treatment of others,

308
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.340
Israelite and non Israelite,
um,
during,

309
00:18:05.341 --> 00:18:10.341
during wars and conflicts as punishment for their terrible war atrocities.

310
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:15.000
A divine fire is going to break out and destroy all of their palaces in four to

311
00:18:15.001 --> 00:18:16.080
five places.

312
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:21.450
But then the twist comes because after these six horrific,
um,

313
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.800
Oracle's which condemn the nations for these brutal acts of atrocity and war,

314
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.760
Amos then turns to address his own people and he says,

315
00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:33.750
the same divine power will consume the people of y'all way because of the

316
00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:37.500
atrocities and inhumanities that they commit even in times of peace.

317
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.090
So the seventh,

318
00:18:39.091 --> 00:18:43.920
the climactic Oracle and now senses that God's wrath will be directed at Israel.

319
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:47.040
And this is a very unwelcome,
unexpected,
um,
statement.

320
00:18:47.041 --> 00:18:51.830
And you can see how he perhaps would almost draw his audience in,
you know,
by,
uh,

321
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.810
with these images of their enemies getting what they deserve,

322
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.800
only to then turn it around.
I'm having drawn them in.
I'm seduced them,

323
00:18:58.801 --> 00:18:59.161
if you will,

324
00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:02.730
with his words to turn around and then charge them with something even worse.

325
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.790
The term Israel that he uses is of course,
ambiguous.

326
00:19:05.791 --> 00:19:07.980
That's one of the problems with some of the prophetic writings.

327
00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:12.060
You're never completely sure whether they're prophesying against the northern

328
00:19:12.061 --> 00:19:16.770
kingdom,
Israel or the house of Israel,
right?
Both kingdoms together.
Um,

329
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.910
the whole tribal confederation.
Some passages in Amos would suggest one,

330
00:19:20.911 --> 00:19:23.700
some passages suggest the other.
Um,

331
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.200
the other thing that we find in Amos is an oracle against Judah,

332
00:19:28.201 --> 00:19:31.320
against the southern kingdom.
This is in chapter two.

333
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.860
It's just two lines versus four and five.
And it's in chapter two.

334
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.910
And many people identify that as a later edition by an editor.

335
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:41.370
Um,
first of all,

336
00:19:41.371 --> 00:19:45.480
it's written in very standard sort of Deuteronomistic language.

337
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:49.110
And also if we leave it out,
then we have a nice literary pattern.

338
00:19:49.111 --> 00:19:51.960
We have six Oracle's right plus one,

339
00:19:51.961 --> 00:19:56.430
we have six Oracle's against foreign nations and then we have one against
Israel.

340
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.100
And that pattern is a very standard literary pattern,

341
00:19:59.101 --> 00:20:01.020
particularly in poetic sections of the Bible.

342
00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:04.530
And the profits are written and in an elevated poetic style,

343
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.970
we very often have a six plus one pattern that's related to another pattern that

344
00:20:08.971 --> 00:20:12.230
we also see an Amos,
which is the three plus one pattern,
right?

345
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.210
This is just a doubling of its six plus one.
Um,

346
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:19.350
the three plus one pattern you'll recognize,
um,
it's quite explicit at times.

347
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.250
Amos,
we'll say for three transgressions of Damascus for four,

348
00:20:23.251 --> 00:20:26.310
I will not revoke it.
The decree of punishment,
right?

349
00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:31.290
The similar kind of language is used in verse six for Gaza in verse nine for

350
00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:35.370
Tire in verse 11 for Itam and verse 13 for the ammonites and so on.

351
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.840
So we often have this pattern.

352
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:41.190
And so the suggestion by scholars is that without that prophecy,

353
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:45.550
that prophecy concerning the fall of Judah,
which postdates Almas,
um,

354
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.940
you would have a nice complete six plus one pattern and this might be the sign

355
00:20:48.941 --> 00:20:53.290
of a leader editor updating Thomas' prophecy so that it would look as though he

356
00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:55.180
had in fact prophesied the fall of Judah.

357
00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.670
You have other sorts of literary patterns and forms used in the prophetic works.

358
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.250
Some of the literary forms we see our hymns,

359
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.580
we see songs we see lamence,

360
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.390
particularly the immense are mourning for Israel as if her destruction is

361
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:12.130
already a fait accompli.

362
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:16.540
You find proverbs very often when the prophets site a proverb,

363
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:19.840
they will turn its accepted meaning on its head.

364
00:21:19.841 --> 00:21:24.760
They'll take an old proverb and they'll apply it to some new situation and give

365
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:28.750
it a radically new kind of meaning to sort of shock and surprise their audience.

366
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:33.040
And I'm a s three through eight contains a lot of of proverbs,

367
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.090
another literary form that we'll see,
and this is an important one,

368
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.270
is a literary form that's called the Reeve r.
I.
V.

369
00:21:40.271 --> 00:21:44.650
I have it up there or [inaudible],
which basically means a lawsuit,

370
00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.170
specifically a covenant law suit.

371
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.980
Many of the prophetic books feature passages in which God basically brings a

372
00:21:53.621 --> 00:21:58.000
lawsuit against the people,
charging them with breach of covenant,

373
00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.500
breach of contract if you will.

374
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:04.810
And in these passages you have legal metaphors being used throughout,
right?

375
00:22:04.811 --> 00:22:07.090
People testifying or witnessing against Israel,

376
00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:10.430
can she speak in her defense and so on.
Um,
so the rebar,

377
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.310
the Covenant Law suit is a formal,
see here,

378
00:22:12.311 --> 00:22:15.010
we'll also see it again when we get to the book of job.

379
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:20.200
So the prophetic corpus draws on the entire range of literary forms that were

380
00:22:20.201 --> 00:22:23.240
available in Israelite tradition,
literary tradition.
Um,

381
00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.300
and very often gives them a rich and,

382
00:22:25.301 --> 00:22:28.420
and that's what gives the books are very rich and varied texture.

383
00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.860
So almost is a model for us in terms of its literary features,

384
00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:37.410
but it's also a model for us in terms of some of the,

385
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.370
the themes or the content of the book because I'm also,

386
00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.770
we'll articulate certain themes that we will see resoundingly throughout the

387
00:22:44.771 --> 00:22:48.100
prophetic literature.
There will be some variations on these themes,

388
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.820
but some standard themes appear here.
So we'll review those.
Now.
Um,

389
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.630
many scholars,
uh,
Koufman among them,
uh,

390
00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:01.650
have noted that the literature of the classical prophets is most clearly and

391
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:08.251
strongly characterized by a vehement denunciation of the moral decay and social

392
00:23:08.921 --> 00:23:12.250
injustice of the period.
It really doesn't matter what period.

393
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:18.130
Vehement denunciation of moral decay in social injustice is the way Katherine

394
00:23:18.131 --> 00:23:21.670
phrases it almost criticizes the sins of the nation.

395
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.330
He's critical of everyone.
The middleclass,
the government,
the king,

396
00:23:25.331 --> 00:23:27.370
the establishment,
the priests are,
they're all,

397
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.590
they're all plagued by a superficial kind of piety for Amos.

398
00:23:32.591 --> 00:23:37.000
As for all the profits will be looking at the idea of covenant prescribes a

399
00:23:37.001 --> 00:23:40.840
particular relationship with your way,
but not only with the white,

400
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:44.260
also with one's fellow human beings,
right?
The two are interlinked.

401
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:48.890
It's a sign of closeness to your way that one is concerned for Israel's poor and

402
00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:53.400
needy,
right?
The two are completely intertwined.
It are.

403
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.970
And so a must announces the wealthy.

404
00:23:55.971 --> 00:23:58.850
He denounces the powerful and the way they treat the poor.

405
00:23:58.851 --> 00:24:02.000
I'm going to be reading some passages from Amos to illustrate some of these

406
00:24:02.001 --> 00:24:02.750
themes.

407
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:07.750
So Amos chapter four verses one to three and listen to the dramatic rhetoric

408
00:24:08.001 --> 00:24:12.390
that's used here.
This word you cows of Bashan on the hill of Symeria.

409
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:16.340
It's a capital of the northern kingdom,
Israel who defraud the poor,

410
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:21.290
who robbed the needy,
who say to your husband's brain,
and let's carouse my Lord.

411
00:24:21.291 --> 00:24:23.630
God swears by His Holiness,
behold,

412
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:28.340
days are coming upon you when you will be carried off in baskets and to the last

413
00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:31.610
one in fish back it's baskets and taken out of the city,

414
00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:35.750
each one through a breach,
straight ahead and flung on the refuse heap.

415
00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:37.820
The wonderful pun here,

416
00:24:37.821 --> 00:24:41.570
because the wealthy women of Symeria are referred to as cows of Bashan.

417
00:24:41.571 --> 00:24:44.420
Number Shan is an area that's very rich pasture land.

418
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:49.430
I'm in the Trans Jordan and also it's very common in Canaanite literature to

419
00:24:49.431 --> 00:24:54.431
refer to the nobility and even to gods with terms like bull or ram or cow.

420
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:58.310
These were not insulting terms as they might be in our culture.

421
00:24:58.311 --> 00:25:00.590
These were in fact terms that did not offend.

422
00:25:00.591 --> 00:25:04.400
These were very complimentary terms.
So when he refers to the cows of Bashan,

423
00:25:04.401 --> 00:25:07.190
he speaks to the women of some area as the cows of Bashan.

424
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.410
He's flattering them to begin with.

425
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:14.680
But the pun is quite wonderful because these women are going to end up like fat

426
00:25:14.871 --> 00:25:18.710
cows as slabs of meat in the butcher's basket or in the fish basket,

427
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:22.940
which you know is flung out on the refuse heap wants it spoiled,
right?

428
00:25:22.941 --> 00:25:27.830
So he takes that term,
cows have a shine and leads it to this horrendous end.

429
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:32.990
Amos,
um,
he must six verse one and verses four through seven.

430
00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:37.991
This is another scaling attack on the idol life of the carefree rich who ignore

431
00:25:39.021 --> 00:25:42.740
the plight of the poor.
Woe to those at ease in Zion.
Of course,

432
00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:44.030
that's the capitol of the southern kingdom,

433
00:25:44.031 --> 00:25:48.020
Jerusalem and those confident on the hill of Sumeria,
the northern kingdom,

434
00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:53.030
you notables of the leading nation on whom the House of Israel pin their hopes,

435
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.480
they lie on ivory beds,
lolling on their couches,

436
00:25:56.481 --> 00:25:59.690
feasting on lambs from the flock and on calves from the stalls.

437
00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.380
They hummed snatches of song to the loo,
to the tune of the loot.

438
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:05.870
They account themselves.
Musicians like David,

439
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:09.830
they drink straight from the wine bowls and anoint themselves with the choices

440
00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:14.540
oils,
but they are not concerned about the ruin of Joseph assuredly.
Right?

441
00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:16.880
Soon they shall head the column of exiles.

442
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:19.730
They shall no more at festive meals.

443
00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.820
So great image of them allying about as the head of the nation we'll be heading,

444
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.730
there'll be at the head of the nation as it moves into exile.

445
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.320
And on an archeological note,

446
00:26:27.321 --> 00:26:30.950
I understand that in some area they have in fact uncovered all kinds of ivory

447
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:35.480
furniture,
um,
and ivory coverings that would then be attached to furniture.

448
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.380
So the image of them lolling on ivory couches in some area apparently,
uh,

449
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.250
makes a lot of sense.
So the moral decay,
the greed,

450
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.560
the indulgence of the upper classes,

451
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:51.450
this is directly responsible for the social injustice that according to the

452
00:26:51.451 --> 00:26:56.190
profits outrages God,
Amos eight,
four through six,
listen to this.

453
00:26:56.191 --> 00:27:00.660
You who devour the needy,
annihilating the poor of the land,
saying,
Oh,

454
00:27:00.661 --> 00:27:04.620
if only the new moon were over so that we could sell grain the sabbath so that

455
00:27:04.621 --> 00:27:08.760
we could offer wheat for sale using a measure that is too small and the shekel

456
00:27:08.761 --> 00:27:10.050
wait,
that is too big.

457
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.040
Tilting and dishonest scale and selling grain refuse as grain.

458
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:17.790
We will by the poor for silver,
the needy for a pair of sandals.

459
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:19.800
The Lord Swears by the pride of Jacob.

460
00:27:19.801 --> 00:27:23.640
I will never forget any of these doings again.

461
00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:28.470
Notice that they are prone to extreme formulations and high flown rhetoric.

462
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.690
And sometimes when you strip away the rhetoric,

463
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:36.230
you see that the crimes that are being denounced are not murder and rape or

464
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.850
horrendous physical violence.

465
00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:42.630
And these are obvious and grievous violations of social morality.

466
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.220
Rather many scholars have pointed out,
but I think Kauffman chief among them,

467
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:50.280
that the crimes that are denounced here are uh,

468
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:53.640
crimes that are prevalent in any society,
in any area.

469
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.790
The crimes that are denounced as being utterly unacceptable to God,

470
00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:00.660
infuriating God to the point of destruction of the nation are the kinds of

471
00:28:00.661 --> 00:28:04.050
crimes we see around us every day.
Taking bribes,

472
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.730
improper weights and balances,

473
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.090
lack of charity to the poor in difference to the plight of the debtor.

474
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.480
A second theme that's pointed out again by many scholars is what Calvin calls

475
00:28:15.481 --> 00:28:18.090
the idea of the primacy of morality.

476
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:23.760
That is to say the idea or the doctrine that morality is not just an obligation

477
00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:27.060
equal in importance to the cultic or religious obligations,

478
00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:30.870
but that morality is perhaps superior to the cult.

479
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.880
What God requires of Israel is morality and not cultic service.
Now,

480
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.500
the profits are all going to have,

481
00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:41.010
we're going to see many different attitudes towards the culture among the

482
00:28:41.011 --> 00:28:45.720
profits.
So allow that to be,
uh,
become a more nuance statement as we go through.

483
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.020
Some are going to reject the cult of the entire nation.
Others will not.

484
00:28:49.021 --> 00:28:50.310
So there's going to be some variation,

485
00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:54.540
but certainly morality as his primary and their words could at times be very

486
00:28:54.541 --> 00:28:56.100
harsh and very astonishing.

487
00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:01.470
Almost five verses 21 to 24 I low.
He's speaking now as God,
right?

488
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:06.000
So God is speaking and God says,
I Loath,
I spurn your festivals.

489
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.610
I am not appeased by your solemn assemblies.

490
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.200
If you offer me burnt sacrifices or your meal sacrifices,
I will not accept them.

491
00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.470
I will pay no heed to your gifts of fat links.

492
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:20.970
Spare me the sound of your hymns and let me not hear the music of your lutes,

493
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:25.530
but let justice well up like water righteousness,
like an unfailing stream.

494
00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:30.030
This is an attack on empty piety,
on the performance of rituals,

495
00:29:30.031 --> 00:29:31.350
without any meaning,

496
00:29:31.351 --> 00:29:35.460
perhaps behind that performance or in accompaniment to social injustice,
right?

497
00:29:35.461 --> 00:29:37.710
That the two can't happen at the same time.

498
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.220
And that's a theme that is sounded repeatedly throughout prophetic literature.

499
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.050
So for Amos and for all the profits,

500
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:46.450
injustice is sacrilege.

501
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:50.290
The ideals of the Covenant are of utmost importance,
right?

502
00:29:50.291 --> 00:29:53.020
That's why they are called the standard bearers of the covenant.

503
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:57.490
Harking back to the covenant obligations.
And without,
without these,

504
00:29:57.491 --> 00:29:58.930
without the ideals of the covenant,

505
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:03.580
the fulfillment of cultic ritual obligations in and of itself is a farce.
Right?

506
00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:07.030
That's not to say that they would be rejected were Israel to be upholding the

507
00:30:07.031 --> 00:30:07.750
covenant.

508
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:12.750
So this rejection of the cult depends of course on a caricature of cultic and

509
00:30:13.951 --> 00:30:17.690
ritual performance,
right?
The profits caricature it as meaningless.

510
00:30:17.691 --> 00:30:22.510
They caricature it as unconcerned with ethics or with the ideals of Justice and

511
00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:23.344
righteousness.

512
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:27.310
But internal cultural conflicts often do involve the character cheering or the

513
00:30:27.311 --> 00:30:30.670
ridiculing of an opponent's beliefs or practices.

514
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:34.780
But for some of the profits,
the rejection of the cult was quite radical.

515
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.380
That's an idea that's not yet really fully formed.
In Amos,

516
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:42.130
we're going to see again that some of the profits will reject the cult of the

517
00:30:42.131 --> 00:30:45.130
nation,
not just the color of the wicked,
but,
but everyone.
Um,

518
00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:48.520
even if performed properly and by righteous persons.
Um,

519
00:30:48.521 --> 00:30:52.420
there will be one or two prophets who believe the cult has no inherent value or

520
00:30:52.421 --> 00:30:55.900
no absolute value for God.
In some sense,

521
00:30:55.901 --> 00:31:00.901
this is a view that we've already encountered in sources devoted to the cult.

522
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.350
Uh,

523
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:05.980
even in a source like p the priestly material prep the materials already moving

524
00:31:05.981 --> 00:31:10.480
towards the idea or establishing the idea that the cult is an expression of

525
00:31:10.481 --> 00:31:13.840
divine favor rather than divine need,
right?
It's,

526
00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:18.550
it doesn't really have an actual value necessary for necessarily for God.

527
00:31:18.551 --> 00:31:21.490
It doesn't really affect his vitality.
Um,

528
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:26.520
it's given to humans as a ritual conduit as a way to attract and maintain God's

529
00:31:26.891 --> 00:31:29.440
presence within the community,
um,

530
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:34.240
or to procure atonement for four deeds or impurities that might temporarily

531
00:31:34.241 --> 00:31:37.360
separate one for God.
I'm so already in the priestly source.

532
00:31:37.361 --> 00:31:41.350
We have a very complicated notion of the function of the God for society and

533
00:31:41.351 --> 00:31:42.184
humanity.

534
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:47.430
So the prophetic doctrine of the primacy of morality seems to be a reaction

535
00:31:47.561 --> 00:31:49.960
against other views of cultic practice.

536
00:31:49.961 --> 00:31:54.700
Perhaps there were popular assumptions about the automatic efficacy of the cult

537
00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:56.170
and,
and,
and its rights.

538
00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:02.160
But a Kauffman has been joined by many other scholars who argue that the profits

539
00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:07.090
raised morality to the level of an absolute religious value,

540
00:32:07.091 --> 00:32:10.810
and they did so because they saw morality as essentially divine.

541
00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:14.200
The essence of God is his moral nature.

542
00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:17.980
Moral attributes are the essence of God himself.

543
00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:23.760
So Koufman notes than he who requires justice and righteousness and compassion

544
00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:28.030
from human beings is himself just and righteous and compassionate.

545
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.710
This is the prophetic view.

546
00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:35.230
The moral person can metaphorically be said to share in divinity.

547
00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.860
This is the kind of apotheosis that you find then in the prophetic writings,

548
00:32:39.861 --> 00:32:44.450
not the idea of a transformation into a divine being in life or even after

549
00:32:44.451 --> 00:32:45.650
death.
Um,

550
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.680
but the idea that one strives to be God like by imitating his moral actions.

551
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:53.630
The idea again of Hitachi o d

552
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:59.270
a third feature of the prophetic writings,
um,

553
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:03.320
this is again underscored by Kaufman but also many other scholars and that is

554
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.370
the profits view of history.
Their particular view of history,

555
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:12.970
their interpretation of the catastrophic events of seven 22 and five 86.

556
00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:18.880
It's an interpretation that centers on their elevation of morality because the

557
00:33:19.191 --> 00:33:23.000
profits insisted that morality was a decisive,

558
00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:27.260
if not the decisive factor in the nation's history,
right?

559
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:32.740
Israel's acceptance of God's covenant placed certain religious and moral demands

560
00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:37.550
on her.
Now in the Deuteronomistic view that we've talked about,

561
00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.380
one,
sin is singled out as being historically decisive for the nation.

562
00:33:42.381 --> 00:33:43.970
Other sins are punished,
absolutely,

563
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:48.350
but only one is singled out as being historically decisive for the nation.

564
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.710
And that's the sin of idolatry,
particularly the idolatry of the royal house.

565
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:56.270
So the Deuteronomistic historian presents the tragic history of the two kingdoms

566
00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.720
as essentially a sequence of idolatrous aberrations,

567
00:33:59.721 --> 00:34:01.190
which were followed by punishment.

568
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.520
And this the psycho continued into continued until finally there had to be

569
00:34:04.521 --> 00:34:06.350
complete destruction.

570
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:10.970
While it's certainly true that moral sins and other religious sins in his or

571
00:34:10.971 --> 00:34:13.340
were punishable,
and in the Deuteronomy this view,

572
00:34:13.341 --> 00:34:17.600
it's really only the worship of other gods that brings about national collapse

573
00:34:17.601 --> 00:34:18.920
national exile.

574
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:24.310
And that view is exemplified in second kings chapter 17 which I read to you.

575
00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:28.340
It doesn't mention moral sins as leading to the collapse of the state.

576
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.230
It harps on idolatry.

577
00:34:30.231 --> 00:34:34.880
Idolatry was what provoked God to drive the nation into exile.

578
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:38.390
The view of the classical profits is a little different.

579
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:42.560
Israel's history is determined by moral factors,

580
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:46.850
not just religious factor.
So the nation is punished,
not only fire a dollar tree,

581
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:50.270
but for moral failings.
And of course the two are to a large degree intertwined,

582
00:34:50.271 --> 00:34:53.540
but the emphasis on the moral is striking in the profits.

583
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:59.290
And it may not be so startling to hear that God would doom a generation or

584
00:34:59.601 --> 00:35:03.050
domination for,
uh,
for grave moral sins like murder and violence.

585
00:35:03.051 --> 00:35:06.950
This is something we've already seen,
right?
And the generation of the flood,
uh,

586
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.300
the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah,

587
00:35:08.301 --> 00:35:12.740
they were destroyed for grievous violations of morality,
murder,

588
00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.040
um,
violence and so on.
The profits,
however,

589
00:35:16.041 --> 00:35:20.540
are claiming that the nation is doomed because of commonplace wrongs,

590
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.980
because of bribe taking,

591
00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:26.990
because of false scales and false weights that are being used in the
marketplace.

592
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:31.430
These are the crimes for which destruction of the nation and exile will take

593
00:35:31.431 --> 00:35:33.530
place.
Amos two,
verses six through eight,

594
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:37.890
thus said the Lord for three transgressions of Israel for four,

595
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.540
I will not revoke the decree of destruction because they have sold for silver.

596
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.980
Those whose causes just write,
taking bribes in,

597
00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.630
in a courtroom setting and the needy for a pair of sandals.
Uh,

598
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:52.320
you who trample the heads of the poor into the dust of the ground and make the

599
00:35:52.321 --> 00:35:54.180
humble walk a twisted course.

600
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.750
So this is the first difference really between the Deuteronomistic

601
00:35:57.751 --> 00:36:02.751
interpretation of the nation's history and the destruction of Israel and the

602
00:36:03.841 --> 00:36:06.240
prophetic interpretation for the profits.

603
00:36:06.241 --> 00:36:09.540
The national catastrophes are just punishment for sin,

604
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:13.860
but not just the sin of idolatry for all sins,
no matter how petty,

605
00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.790
no matter how venial because all sins violate the terms of the Covenant Code

606
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:19.840
which has given especially to Israel.
Right.

607
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:24.180
And the terms of the covenant being vassals to the sovereign yeah way means

608
00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:27.630
treating co vassals in a particular way and it is breach of Covenant Covenant

609
00:36:27.631 --> 00:36:29.910
not to do that.
And again,

610
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:34.260
how much the profits were harking back to an older tradition to ancient

611
00:36:34.261 --> 00:36:37.920
traditions about Israel and its covenant relationship,
um,

612
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:43.250
traditions according to which Israel's redemption and election entailed moral

613
00:36:43.351 --> 00:36:47.640
obligations,
how much they were,
the ones to actually generate and argue for.

614
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.670
This idea again,
is hotly debated by scholars.

615
00:36:50.671 --> 00:36:53.250
It's not an issue that we need to decide.

616
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:57.940
But I would note that the primacy of morality in Israel,

617
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.490
religion certainly dates back at least to the times of the earliest profits.

618
00:37:02.491 --> 00:37:06.450
Amos in the eighth century for example,
and may indeed have had antecedents,

619
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.670
it's certainly didn't just arrive,

620
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.120
arise in the exile as some scholars would have us believe.

621
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:15.600
It's certainly was not the invention of the Deuteronomistic historian.

622
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:18.600
It's alive and well in some of these very early profits.

623
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:23.610
I'm going to turn now to the second difference between the Deuteronomistic and

624
00:37:23.611 --> 00:37:25.890
the prophetic interpretation of Israel's history.

625
00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:28.950
And that is that the profits coupled their message of,

626
00:37:28.951 --> 00:37:32.160
of tragedy and doom with a message of hope and consolation.

627
00:37:32.161 --> 00:37:34.770
And this is something that just simply doesn't come within the purview of the

628
00:37:34.771 --> 00:37:38.610
Deuteronomistic historians writing
first,

629
00:37:38.611 --> 00:37:41.550
let me say a little bit about the message of doom and then,
um,

630
00:37:41.551 --> 00:37:43.260
the message of hope and consolation.

631
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:47.070
One of the things that's so interesting in the classical prophets is that they

632
00:37:47.071 --> 00:37:52.071
give a new content to older Israelite ideas about the end of days or what we

633
00:37:52.981 --> 00:37:54.240
call eschatology,

634
00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:58.050
eschatology and account of the Eschaton eschaton meaning the end.

635
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.810
So an eschatology is and account of the end,

636
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:05.730
the prophets warned that unless they changed the people,

637
00:38:05.731 --> 00:38:08.580
we're going to suffer the punishment that was do them.

638
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.440
And in fact the people were very foolish to be eagerly awaiting,

639
00:38:13.441 --> 00:38:17.360
are eagerly expecting what was popularly known as the day of Yom Kippur,

640
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:18.540
the day of the Lord.

641
00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:26.400
I said the prophets referred to the day of Yahweh's as if it were a popular

642
00:38:26.401 --> 00:38:29.110
conception out there in the general culture.
Um,

643
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.200
it was a popular idea at the time that on some future occasion God would

644
00:38:34.201 --> 00:38:37.930
dramatically intervene and world affairs and he would do so on Israel's behalf.

645
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.430
He would lead Israel in victory over her enemies.
They would be punished.

646
00:38:42.431 --> 00:38:46.840
Israel will be restored to her full and former glory.
And that day,

647
00:38:46.841 --> 00:38:50.620
the day of the Lord or the day of [inaudible] in the popular mind was going to

648
00:38:50.621 --> 00:38:54.220
be a marvelous day,
a day of victory for Israel,
triumph for Israel,

649
00:38:54.221 --> 00:38:56.110
and the day of vengeance on her enemies.

650
00:38:56.590 --> 00:39:01.590
Amos five verses 18 and 29 talks about the people as desirous of the day of

651
00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.820
[inaudible].
They're very confident that this is going to be a day of light,

652
00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:10.480
day of blessing,
a day of victory.
He says,
but the profits,

653
00:39:10.481 --> 00:39:14.860
I must among them tell a different story according to tell them,

654
00:39:14.861 --> 00:39:16.240
if there is no change,

655
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:19.720
then this day of y'all way is not going to be some glorious thing that the

656
00:39:19.721 --> 00:39:21.670
people should be eagerly awaiting.

657
00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:24.010
It's not going to be a day of triumph for Israel.

658
00:39:24.011 --> 00:39:26.710
It will not be a day of vengeance on her enemies.

659
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:28.960
It's going to be a dark day of destruction.

660
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:33.670
It's going to be a day of doom when God will finally call his own people to

661
00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:38.290
account.
So this is another instance of the way in which the the profits tried to

662
00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:43.291
radically surprise their audience by taking an older concept and and reversing

663
00:39:43.541 --> 00:39:44.890
its meaning,
changing it's meaning.

664
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.530
And here they've transformed the popular image of the day.

665
00:39:47.531 --> 00:39:51.760
If your way from one of national triumph to one of national judgment,

666
00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:56.950
Amos five verses 18 through 20 I you who wish for the day of Yahweh's,

667
00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.090
why should you want the day of the Lord?
It shall be darkness,
not light.

668
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:04.360
As if a man should run from align and be attacked by a bear,

669
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.990
or if he got endorsed,
should lean his hand on the wall and be bitten by a snake,

670
00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:10.210
there's going to be no place to hide.
In other words,

671
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:13.330
surely the day of the Lord shall not be light,
but darkness,

672
00:40:13.331 --> 00:40:18.331
blackness night without a glimmer or chapter eight verses nine through 12 and in

673
00:40:18.671 --> 00:40:22.300
that day declares my Lord God,
I will make the sun set at noon.

674
00:40:22.301 --> 00:40:25.990
I will darken the earth on a sunny day and I will turn your festivals into

675
00:40:25.991 --> 00:40:30.220
mourning and all your songs and to dirge is I will put sackcloth on all loins

676
00:40:30.221 --> 00:40:32.320
and Tantra is on every head.
Morning rights.

677
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:36.940
I will make it mourn as for an only child,
all of it as on a bitter day.

678
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.850
So again,

679
00:40:39.851 --> 00:40:43.060
at the heart of this idea that the day of you always being transformed me to

680
00:40:43.061 --> 00:40:46.210
this day of judgement is the old idea that God is the god of history,
right?

681
00:40:46.211 --> 00:40:51.190
God can control the destiny of nations.
He can control the actions of nations.

682
00:40:51.191 --> 00:40:55.720
It's not a new idea,
but in the past,
or not so much in the past,

683
00:40:55.721 --> 00:40:58.510
I suppose that would have been present to the profits.

684
00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:03.780
The profits were reacting against a notion that God's involvement with other

685
00:41:04.091 --> 00:41:07.090
nations was always undertaken on Israel's behalf.

686
00:41:07.091 --> 00:41:10.180
This is the idea they seem to be battling.
In other words,

687
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:15.310
they're battling the idea or the assumption that God controlled other nations by

688
00:41:15.311 --> 00:41:19.510
exercising judgment on them and punishing them and subjecting them to Israel,

689
00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:24.690
and the profits are challenging this idea and they're making a very shocking of

690
00:41:25.361 --> 00:41:27.940
what would have been hurt as a shocking and extraordinary claim.

691
00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:32.980
God is of course,
yes,
the god of history of all history.
He is concerned with all,

692
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:34.550
not only Israel,

693
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:39.890
but his involvement with other nations doesn't extend merely to their

694
00:41:39.891 --> 00:41:43.610
subjugation if need be or rather if Israel deserves,

695
00:41:43.611 --> 00:41:47.780
then God will raise up another nation against her.
So the final chapter,

696
00:41:47.781 --> 00:41:50.690
nameless begins by proclaiming this idea of utter destruction.

697
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.670
I will slay them all God says,

698
00:41:52.671 --> 00:41:56.390
and not one of them shall survive wherever they hide under the Earth,

699
00:41:56.391 --> 00:41:58.400
in the heavens,
at the bottom of the sea.

700
00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.140
Gods going to haul them out and he's going to slay them.

701
00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:06.050
And what about the covenant?
Isn't it a,
a guarantee of privilege or safety?

702
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:11.480
Um,
again,
for Amos,
its primary function is to bind the nation.
Um,

703
00:42:11.481 --> 00:42:14.030
in a code of conduct and violations of that code,

704
00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:18.230
we're going to be severely punished.
So in chapter nine,
verses seven to eight,

705
00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:22.750
Amos uh,
makes the startling claim that in God's eyes,
Israel,

706
00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.480
it's really no different from the rest of the nations.
He elevated her.

707
00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:31.520
He can also lower her to me.
Oh,
Israelites,
you are just like the Ethiopians.

708
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.310
True.
I brought Israel up from the land of Egypt,

709
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:39.290
but also the Philistines from cuff door and the Armenians from care before.

710
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:43.550
Behold the Lord God has his eye upon the sinful kingdom and I will wipe it off.

711
00:42:43.551 --> 00:42:46.880
The face of the earth is a harsh,
harsh words.

712
00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.420
And you also have to remember that almost was living in a time of relative peace

713
00:42:50.421 --> 00:42:55.160
and prosperity.
Not Seven 50.
Um,
national competence is riding high.

714
00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.310
Uh,
the people of Israel were pretty convinced that God was with them.

715
00:42:58.311 --> 00:43:02.600
They weren't in Randy real imminent or obvious danger and almost was convinced

716
00:43:02.601 --> 00:43:05.960
that despite this external appearance of health,
uh,

717
00:43:05.961 --> 00:43:07.670
the nation was disease,

718
00:43:07.671 --> 00:43:11.300
they were guilty of social crimes and unfaithfulness to their covenantal

719
00:43:11.301 --> 00:43:15.260
obligations.
And so he says they're headed down this path of destruction.

720
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:18.860
And perhaps because of the optimism of the time,

721
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:22.700
Amos had to emphasize this message of doom because his,

722
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:26.410
his book is a pretty depressing a book.
Um,

723
00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:29.300
later prophets who are speaking in a different,
uh,

724
00:43:29.301 --> 00:43:33.140
historical setting and a more desperate historical setting will often speak

725
00:43:33.141 --> 00:43:37.490
words of much more comfort and,
and,
um,
uh,
and hope.

726
00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.380
But Amos doesn't do this.

727
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:44.120
He does indicate that his purpose is the reformation or the reorientation of the

728
00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:48.830
nation.
He wants to awaken Israel to the fact that change is needed.

729
00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:51.740
Amos five,
verses 14 and 15,

730
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:55.340
seek good and not evil that you may live.

731
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.850
And that the Lord the God of hosts make truly be with you.

732
00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:02.750
As you think right now,
you think he's with you.
He's not change,
right?

733
00:44:02.751 --> 00:44:04.700
So that he will truly be with you,
hate,

734
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:09.200
evil and love good and establish justice in the gate.
Perhaps the Lord,

735
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:12.800
the God of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.

736
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:17.300
There perhaps is important and it's very indicative of Amos's fatalism.

737
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:19.550
This is very much a fatalistic book.

738
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:24.620
The overriding theme of Imus's message is that punishment is inevitable.

739
00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:25.910
It's pretty much inevitable.

740
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:30.410
And this is one of the reasons that most scholars believe that the final verses

741
00:44:30.411 --> 00:44:31.590
of the book,
um,

742
00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:36.690
versus my halfway through eight down to 15 are a later edition by an editor.

743
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:38.310
Um,

744
00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:43.310
it's an epilogue and it was likely added in order to relieve the gloom and the

745
00:44:43.891 --> 00:44:48.891
pessimism and the fatalism of the profits message because in these verses almost

746
00:44:49.591 --> 00:44:54.030
does an almost complete about face.
Um,
you've just,

747
00:44:54.031 --> 00:44:58.530
we've just finished nine of the first half of verse eight in Chapter Nine.

748
00:44:58.531 --> 00:45:02.880
So nine,
8:00 AM you have this oracle of complete and devastating judgment.

749
00:45:02.881 --> 00:45:05.550
Behold the Lord God has his eye upon the sinful kingdom.

750
00:45:05.551 --> 00:45:07.080
I will wipe it off the face of the earth.

751
00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.560
But then the second half of the verse and the beginning of this epilogue that's

752
00:45:10.561 --> 00:45:12.750
been added immediately dilutes this,

753
00:45:12.751 --> 00:45:16.470
but I will not wholly wipe out the house of Jacob,
declares the Lord.

754
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:22.430
It seems that an editor editor has qualified this last oracle of doom as what

755
00:45:22.751 --> 00:45:27.751
was desired to qualify this last article of doom and the editor continues for.

756
00:45:27.811 --> 00:45:32.040
I will give the order and shakes the house of Israel through all the nations as

757
00:45:32.041 --> 00:45:35.340
one shakes sand in a sieve and not a pebble falls to the ground.

758
00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:39.420
All the centers of my people shall perish by the sword who boast never shall the

759
00:45:39.421 --> 00:45:41.400
evil overtake us or come near us.

760
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:45.240
And in that day I will set up again the fallen booth of David.

761
00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:47.610
I will mend its breaches and set up its ruins,

762
00:45:47.611 --> 00:45:51.900
a new and I will build it from as in the days of old,
a time is coming,

763
00:45:51.901 --> 00:45:52.621
declares the Lord.

764
00:45:52.621 --> 00:45:57.580
When the mountains shall drip wine and all the hills shall wave with grain and I

765
00:45:57.581 --> 00:45:59.040
will restore my people Israel,

766
00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:02.910
they will rebuild ruined cities and inhabit them and they shall till gardens and

767
00:46:02.911 --> 00:46:05.310
eat their fruits and I will plant them upon their soil.

768
00:46:05.311 --> 00:46:08.220
Nevermore to be approached Rupp rooted from the soil.
I have given them,

769
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:11.730
said the Lord your God.
In other words,
according to this epilogue,

770
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.610
God's punishment of Israel isn't the end of the story.

771
00:46:14.611 --> 00:46:18.690
It's one step in a process and the affliction and the punishment serve a
purpose.

772
00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.990
It's to purge the dross to chase in Israel.

773
00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:25.500
They're going to be put through a sieve.
Only the sinner's will really parish.

774
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:26.491
I'm a remnant.

775
00:46:26.491 --> 00:46:30.990
Presumably a righteous remnant will be permitted to survive and in due time that

776
00:46:30.991 --> 00:46:33.670
remnant will be restored.
Um,

777
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.010
to summarize,
Amos and I,
hopefully,
hopefully this'll give us,

778
00:46:38.011 --> 00:46:40.470
send some foothold as we move into other prophetic books.

779
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:46.160
We need to understand that the book of Amos is a set of Oracle's by a prophet

780
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:49.920
addressing a concrete situation in the northern kingdom.

781
00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:55.320
It's been subject to some additions that reflect the perspective of a later

782
00:46:55.321 --> 00:46:56.500
editor.
Um,

783
00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:00.570
Amos's message was that sin would be punished by God and it would be punished on

784
00:47:00.571 --> 00:47:04.890
a national level,
right?
The Nation would fall when the northern kingdom fell.

785
00:47:04.891 --> 00:47:08.040
It was understood to be a fulfillment of Amos's words.

786
00:47:08.041 --> 00:47:11.070
The Assyrians were the instruments of God's just punishment.

787
00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:15.330
So his words were preserved in Judah after Judah fell,

788
00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:20.070
presumably a later editor editor added a few key passages to reflect this later

789
00:47:20.071 --> 00:47:21.870
reality.
Most significantly,

790
00:47:21.871 --> 00:47:26.871
the Oracle against Judah in chapter two verse four five and the Epilogue in

791
00:47:26.971 --> 00:47:29.220
chapter nine verse eight,
beat to 15,

792
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:33.730
which explicitly seem to refer to the fall of,

793
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:35.500
of the southern kingdom,
right?
The,
uh,

794
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.920
every first for a future day when the fallen booth of David will be raised,

795
00:47:38.921 --> 00:47:42.280
that reflects a knowledge of the end of Judah and the end of the Davidic

796
00:47:42.281 --> 00:47:44.920
kingship.
And the phrase on that day,

797
00:47:44.921 --> 00:47:48.220
which is used as a phrase that often signals what we feel is an editorial

798
00:47:48.221 --> 00:47:49.600
insertion in a prophetic book.

799
00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:54.640
It's pointing forward to some vague future time of restoration.
Okay.
On Monday,

800
00:47:54.641 --> 00:47:57.880
we are going to be moving on to Hosea and Isaiah.
