00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.520
Last time we started looking at the psalms and a number of different genres or

2
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:10.521
forms in which the psalms appear and we were just looking at a som last time,

3
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:15.360
which seems to explicitly reject the Deuteronomistic interpretation of the

4
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:18.210
national history in the national tragedy,
um,

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.720
depicting Israel as innocent and rebuking God for his inaction.

6
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.840
It was another psalm in this genre that I'd like to read from.

7
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:28.410
This is psalm 44 selective passages in God.

8
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:31.890
We glory at all times and praise your name unceasingly.

9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.910
Yet you have rejected and disgraced us.
You do not go with our armies.

10
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.630
You let them devour us like sheep.
You disperse us among the nations.

11
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.470
You sell your people for no fortune and you said no high price on them.

12
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.300
All this has come upon us,

13
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.840
yet we have not forgotten you or been false to your covenant.

14
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.310
Very different from what the prophets have been screaming,
right?

15
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.390
Our hearts have not gone astray,

16
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.070
nor have our feet swerved from your path though you cast us crushed to where the

17
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:01.830
sea monster is and covered us over with deepest darkness.

18
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.000
If we forgot the name of our God and spread forth our hands to a foreign god,

19
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.030
God would surely search it out for he knows the secrets of the heart.

20
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.020
It is for your sake that we are slaying all day long and that we are regarded as

21
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:17.270
sheep to be slaughtered.
Rouse yourself.
Why do you sleep?
Oh Lord awakened.

22
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:20.010
Do not reject us forever.
Why do you hide your face?

23
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.180
Ignoring our affliction and distress.
We like prostrate and the dust.

24
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.740
Our body clings to the ground,

25
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.370
arise and help us redeem us as we fits your faithfulness.

26
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.820
So here's a som full of anger that contains an explicit denial of the

27
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:39.270
rhetorically inflamed charges against Israel that we read in in many of the

28
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:41.760
prophetic books.
We have not forgotten you.

29
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:44.670
We haven't been false to your covenant where our hearts have it gone astray.

30
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.940
We haven't swerved from your path.
Why are you behaving this way?

31
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.390
This astonishing,
uh,

32
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.520
protestations of innocence that accuses God a sleeping on the job is reminiscent

33
00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:56.820
of job in a way.
The,

34
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.170
the two conflicting viewpoints that we see running through a lot of this

35
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:04.140
literature.
One in which there is suffering.
Therefore there must be sin.

36
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.770
Israel has sinned horribly and the other there is an explicit and explicable

37
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:10.770
suffering.
We haven't done anything that would deserve this,
anything at all.

38
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.690
It really is reminiscent of job.

39
00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:15.870
It seems to give us these two perspectives on job's suffering as an individual.

40
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.480
Uh,
we see that now played out on the level of the nation.

41
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.310
One that is asserting in what we have here is a view that is asserting God's

42
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.680
negligence rather than Israel's guilt.

43
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.680
But then you can contrast psalms like 44,
the one I've just read and 74,

44
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:36.681
which I read at the end of the last lecture with Psalms 78 and one oh six,

45
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.960
uh,
these psalms belong to the category of hymns.

46
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.430
Some people call this category hymns in celebration of divine action in Israel's

47
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:44.761
history,

48
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:48.990
the sort of historical reviews that praise God for all he has done for Israel.

49
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.100
And they towed the Deuteronomistic line in their recapitulation of Israel's

50
00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:55.050
history from the creation,
from the exodus,

51
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:59.440
and onto the conquest of the promised land.
They stress,
uh,
uh,

52
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.860
Israel's utter indebtedness to God.
Got his patiently endured,

53
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:06.940
Israel's constant faith faithlessness and so when you juxtapose these two types

54
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:08.680
of psalms,
they're just remarkably different.

55
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.310
He performed marvels in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt,

56
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:15.010
the plane of so on.
He split the sea and took them through it.

57
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.300
He made waters stand like a wall.
It continues.
He split rocks in the wilderness,

58
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:22.090
so it's a recounting of all the marvelous things that God has done,

59
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.500
but they went on sinning against him defying the most high and the parched land

60
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.520
to test God was in their mind when they demanded food for themselves,

61
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.080
they spoke against God's saying,
Ken,
God spread a feast in the wilderness.
True.

62
00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:37.870
He struck the rock and water is flowed and streams gushed forth,

63
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:40.960
but can he provide bread?
Can he supply his people with meat?

64
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.940
It's interesting that this is in the third person.

65
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:46.510
They did all these terrible sinful things.
The psalm that I just read previously,

66
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:47.171
that protests,

67
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:51.070
Israel's innocence is in the first person we have not straight at all.

68
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:53.920
We've been completely faithful to you.
Why are you treating us this way?

69
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.800
So God's faithful actions.
Israel's faithful faith,

70
00:03:57.801 --> 00:04:01.540
less responses are featured in the psalm that I just read.

71
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.100
And also in one oh six,
they tow the Deuteronomistic line.
And again,

72
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:11.020
we see this clear attempt to explain Israel's tragic end.
And here again,

73
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:14.620
the tendency is to blame Israel and to justify God at all costs.

74
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.700
Uh,
we'll move on now to the genre of psalms.

75
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.460
Actually these are sort of two genres that I'm putting together.

76
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.510
The genres of blessing and cursing,
obviously there,
um,
rather antithetical.

77
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.400
But these are psalms,
first of all,

78
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:31.780
psalms of blessing are psalms that invoke God to bless the righteous might be

79
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:36.370
the nation Israel or it might be the righteous within the nation and to punish

80
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.230
or afflict the wicked.
And again,

81
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:41.860
that can be enemy nations or it can be the wicked within Israel and other

82
00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:46.840
nations.
And sometimes these psalms can be quite shocking in their violence.
Uh,

83
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:51.130
and in their fury,
psalm one 37 by the waters of Babylon,

84
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.550
I'm very rarely people read all the way to the end of that particular psalm.
Um,

85
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.060
it's very poignant at the beginning,
but at the very end,

86
00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:03.061
it calls for vengeance on the Babylonians who destroyed Jerusalem verses eight

87
00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:06.670
and nine.
Fair Babylon you Predator,
a blessing on him.

88
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:11.320
Who repays you in kind when you have inflicted on us.
Uh,
blessed blessing on him.

89
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.770
Who sees is your babies and dashes them against the rocks.

90
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.300
A Psalm 109 contains this very lengthy list of,

91
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.470
of terrible afflictions that the psalmist is asking God to smite his foes with.

92
00:05:25.121 --> 00:05:29.110
That was a poorly constructed sentence that the psalmist is asking God to,

93
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.910
I don't want to say bestow,
but inflict upon his fo,
uh,
versus eight and 10.

94
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:37.510
May his days be few,
may another take over his position.

95
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.470
May His children be orphans,
his wife,
a widow.
And it's a nice way of saying,
man,

96
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:44.110
he died,
right?
May his children wander from there.

97
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:47.920
Hovels begging in search of bread.
May he be clothed the din a curse,

98
00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:51.940
like a garment.
May it enter his body like water,
his bones like oil.

99
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.870
Let it be like the cloak he wraps around him like the belt he always wears.

100
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.930
May the Lord,
thus my accusers and all those who speak evil against me.

101
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.101
So again,

102
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:05.180
it's hardly the simple piety that we often associate with the book of Psalms.

103
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.520
And the last category I just want to briefly mention is a category of Psalms,
um,

104
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:13.970
that um,
have a reflective or meditative tone.

105
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.650
These are psalms of wisdom,

106
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.350
psalms in praise of instruction or Torah and meditation.
Um,

107
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.970
there are somewhat proverbial in nature.

108
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:27.290
Many of them will begin with this sort of stock phrase.
Happy is the man who,

109
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.250
so we said,

110
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.250
see that in Psalm one 28 happy are all who fear the lord who follow his ways.

111
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.490
You shall enjoy the fruit of your labors.
You shall be happy and shelf prosper.

112
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.640
Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine within your house.

113
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.430
Your son's like olives,
saplings around your table.

114
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.410
So shall the man who fears the Lord be blessed or reveres the Lord is the sense

115
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:49.400
of fear.
There.

116
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.800
Many psalms we've seen proceeded to presuppose worship in the temple,

117
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.010
um,
and can even have that.
And Tiffany [inaudible] character,

118
00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:01.280
the call and response or call an echo character.

119
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.430
But there are three that I'm instead have this theme of Med meditating upon are

120
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:09.480
delighting in the Torah that some one,

121
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.500
Psalm 19 and psalm one 19 conveniently enough,

122
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:18.130
one night one 19 is the longest psalm because it's written in a cross stick

123
00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:21.550
form.
There are different stands as a different stands,
uh,

124
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.360
for each letter of the alphabet at 22 letters and there are eight lines in each

125
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:29.420
stanza.
All eight lines beginning with that letter of the alphabet.

126
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.350
So it's a very,
very long some um,

127
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.710
and the Somme represents Torah as an object of study and devotion.

128
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.460
Studying Torah makes one wise and happy.
Psalm 19 verses eight through 11.

129
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.970
The teaching of the Lord is perfect renewing life.

130
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.330
The decrees of the Lord are enduring.
Making this simple,
wise,

131
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.360
the precepts of the Lord are just rejoicing the heart.

132
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.020
The instruction of the Lord is Lucid,
making the eyes light up.

133
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.860
The fear or reverence of the Lord is pure abiding forever.

134
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.680
The judgments of the Lord are true,
righteous all together,

135
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:04.130
more desirable than gold than much fine gold,
sweeter than honey.

136
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.840
Then drippings of the comb.

137
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:11.290
And so this elevation of Torah reflects a shift that begins or starts to occur

138
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:14.870
in the second temple period,

139
00:08:14.871 --> 00:08:18.890
the late second temple period in which Tara is of growing importance.

140
00:08:18.891 --> 00:08:22.880
And in about two minutes we're going to start to talk about this period and uh,

141
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:25.880
and the importance and centrality of Torah.
It's um,

142
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.640
it's centricity in terms of study,
uh,

143
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.880
and the study of Torah as a form of worship.

144
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:37.160
So there are many different ways to categorize and classify the psalms.

145
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:42.200
A many individual som seemed to combine units that belong to different

146
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:46.820
categories.
So for example,
you have psalm 22,
which opens as a lament,
my God,

147
00:08:46.821 --> 00:08:50.540
my God,
why have you forsaken me?
That's the well known RSV translation.

148
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.460
And then it changes to a hymn of praise.
It concludes with,

149
00:08:54.461 --> 00:08:58.860
with this it on into a kind of confident,
um,
triumph.
Um,

150
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.860
at least one psalm.
Psalm 68 really defies any kind of rigid categorization.

151
00:09:02.861 --> 00:09:06.330
So we can't be too strict and trying to impose these forms.

152
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:09.510
They are helpful guides to the interpretation of the psalms.
But again,

153
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:13.110
we can't be too rigid about it.
But from the sampling that we've seen,

154
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.950
it should be in parent that the psalms are a microcosm of the religious insights

155
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:20.610
and convictions of,

156
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.290
of ancient Israelites perhaps because so many of them lack historical

157
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:27.480
specificity.
Some of them are quite historical.

158
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:31.200
Some of them in fact recount Israel's history in order to praise God.

159
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.580
But many of them,
very,
very many of them lack any real historical specificity.

160
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:39.630
And that is probably the reason that the psalms have become a great source for

161
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:42.540
personal spirituality in Western civilization.

162
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.620
Some of them were composed perhaps as many as 3000 years ago,

163
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.610
and yet they can be inspiring where they can feel relevant to contemporary

164
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:53.000
readers.
They can provide an opportunity to,

165
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.540
to confess one's failings or to proclaim good intentions or to rail against

166
00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:02.550
misfortune or to cry out against injustice or to request assistance or to affirm

167
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:08.090
trust in divine providence or to simply express emotions of praise and,

168
00:10:08.091 --> 00:10:13.080
and joy and wonder at creation or reflect on human finitude in the face of

169
00:10:13.081 --> 00:10:17.160
divine infinitude.
I mentioned briefly,

170
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.330
um,
the centrality of Torah.
Actually,
no.

171
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.930
Let me finish talking about psalms and also move on to the other,

172
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.400
another major poetic work.

173
00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:29.680
Then we'll come back to talk about the restoration period.
Um,

174
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:35.090
another poetic book within the Anthology of the Hebrew Bible is the little work

175
00:10:35.821 --> 00:10:39.780
known as the Song of Psalms at Song of songs.
And for many people,

176
00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:44.781
this is perhaps the most surprising a book to be included in the Hebrew Canon.

177
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:50.810
It's a beautiful and very erotic love song that celebrates a human sexuality and

178
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:53.040
physical passion.

179
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:58.290
The opening line seems to be a late superscription that attributes the book to

180
00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:02.040
Solomon and it seems more likely,

181
00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:05.190
however that these sent you was love lyrics are post [inaudible].

182
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.500
I'm the attribution to Solomon.

183
00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:12.150
It was probably fueled by the fact that in first kings chapter four,

184
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.730
um,
we read that Solomon,

185
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:19.970
or there's a tradition there that Solomon uttered 3000 proverbs and 1,005 songs.

186
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:26.090
So it seems natural to attribute this song to Israel's most prolific composer of

187
00:11:26.671 --> 00:11:28.950
songs and proverbs,
according to tradition,

188
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.660
the speaker in the poem alternates most often it is a woman.

189
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.010
She seems to be addressing her beloved.
Sometimes she addresses other women,

190
00:11:38.011 --> 00:11:42.260
the daughters of Jerusalem at times,
the speaker is a man.
Um,

191
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.770
but he's not identified as Solomon.
Solomon's name is mentioned about six times,

192
00:11:46.771 --> 00:11:50.480
but Salomon has not said to be one of the speakers.
And for the most part,
this,

193
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.320
the main speaker is,
is female.

194
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:58.000
There's a pastoral setting for the book.
The two young lovers,
um,

195
00:11:58.001 --> 00:12:02.200
express their passion through an amid the beauties of nature.

196
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:07.201
There are frequent references to gardens and vineyards and fruit and flowers and

197
00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:13.240
perfumes and doves and flocks of goats and shorn,
shorn use.

198
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.110
There are very vivid descriptions of the physical beauty of the lovers.

199
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:20.200
They are described and highly erotic passages.
Um,

200
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:26.320
translations of the song of songs vary tremendously.
Um,
as you might imagine.

201
00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:30.130
So I'm going to read one little section from the translation by someone named

202
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:34.300
Walsh Ce Walsh,
which I think captures the,

203
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:39.330
the tremendous eroticism in some of the passages of song of songs I slept,

204
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.490
but my heart was awake.
The sin,

205
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.050
my lover is knocking open to me,
my sister,
my love,
my dove,

206
00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:49.570
my perfect one for my head is wet with dew.

207
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.940
My lover thrust his hand into the hole and my insides yearned for him.
I arrived,

208
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.510
I arose to open to my lover and my hands dripped with myrrh,

209
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.950
my fingers with liquid maror upon the handles of the lock.
I opened to my lover,

210
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.580
but he was gone.
These poems are very unique.

211
00:13:06.581 --> 00:13:10.630
They give expression to the erotic feelings of a woman.
Um,
and as I say,

212
00:13:10.631 --> 00:13:12.850
translations will vary tremendously.

213
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.240
According to Jewish tradition.
Uh,

214
00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.560
the ancient rabbis debated over whether or not the song of songs should be

215
00:13:20.561 --> 00:13:25.360
included in the Canon.
And it was rabbi Akiva,
sort of late first,

216
00:13:25.361 --> 00:13:28.060
early second century sage who's view prevailed.

217
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.500
He declared the whole world was only created so to speak for the day on which

218
00:13:32.501 --> 00:13:36.580
the song of songs would be given to it.
Why?
Because all the writings are wholly,

219
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.000
but the song of songs is the holy of holies.
Um,

220
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.550
but for some religious authorities over the centuries,

221
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.630
the candid descriptions of passionate love proved to be too much.

222
00:13:46.631 --> 00:13:50.770
And so the explicit content of the book,
which contains no reference to God.

223
00:13:50.771 --> 00:13:53.700
By the way,
God is not mentioned anywhere in Song of songs.
Um,

224
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:57.940
so it seems to have been a completely secular poem.
Uh,
originally,
um,

225
00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.900
the explicit content of the book has at times been interpreted away.

226
00:14:01.901 --> 00:14:04.170
So not only do we have translations that,
um,

227
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.240
that tone down a great deal of the eroticism,

228
00:14:07.241 --> 00:14:12.010
but we also have a tradition of interpretation that interprets away a lot of the

229
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:13.630
explicit content of the text.

230
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.610
So we have trends within Jewish tradition that read the book as a metaphor or an

231
00:14:18.611 --> 00:14:21.130
expression of God's love for his chosen people.

232
00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:25.390
Israel Christians have allegorize the song seeing it as an expression of

233
00:14:25.391 --> 00:14:30.270
Christ's love for his bride who is the spiritual church.
And I think some,

234
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.540
I think,
I think all of the sections,

235
00:14:31.541 --> 00:14:34.330
we'll be dealing with the song of songs this week.
So you should have a,

236
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.210
an interesting time looking at some of the interpretations of this text.

237
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.910
Now I want to move on a little bit more to the back,

238
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.190
the historical background of some of the books that we'll be looking at,
um,

239
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.310
in today's lecture.
And then also the last couple of lectures,

240
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.940
we left the Israelites in exile in Babylon.

241
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.910
And in five 39 BCE,

242
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.720
the Babylonian empire was itself a defeated by the Persians.

243
00:14:59.721 --> 00:15:03.890
Under the leadership of Cyrus Cyrus of Persia,
five 39,

244
00:15:03.891 --> 00:15:07.990
he manages to establish the largest empire that's been seen in the ancient near

245
00:15:07.991 --> 00:15:12.680
east to date.
Uh,
it stretches from Egypt all the way north up to Asian minor,

246
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:17.510
which is modern day Turkey and all the way over to eastern Iran.
Huge Empire.

247
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.670
Unlike other ancient empires,
uh,

248
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:26.770
the Persian empire espoused a policy of cultural and religious independence for

249
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:30.140
it's conquered subjects.
Um,

250
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:35.030
the famous Cyrus cylinder,
this is a nine inch long,
um,

251
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:40.180
fired clay cylinder and it's covered in cuneiform writing and it tells of

252
00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:44.760
Cyrus's conquest of Babylon.
Um,

253
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.530
the conquest is described as being at the command of Babylon's God Marduk.

254
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:49.730
So obviously the Babylonians,

255
00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:54.260
God Marduk wanted our Cyrus of Persia to be able to come in and conquer,
um,
his,

256
00:15:54.261 --> 00:15:55.280
his nation.

257
00:15:55.730 --> 00:16:00.170
And it tells it his conquest and it tells of Cyrus is policy of allowing

258
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:04.070
captives to return to their homelands and to rebuild their temples and worship

259
00:16:04.071 --> 00:16:06.080
their gods.
And this is consistent.

260
00:16:06.081 --> 00:16:09.980
This archeological find is consistent with the picture that's presented in the

261
00:16:09.981 --> 00:16:14.270
Bible.
According to the biblical texts we'll be discussing soon.

262
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.600
Cyrus in five 38 gave the Judean exiles permission to return to Jerusalem and

263
00:16:20.421 --> 00:16:24.230
reconstruct their temple.
The exiles did return.

264
00:16:24.231 --> 00:16:27.710
Many of the exiles returned.
They returned to what was now a Persian province.

265
00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:30.320
It's the province of the WHO'd,
I don't think I wrote that up there.

266
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.230
You,
who'd is the name now of Judea and you who it is,

267
00:16:36.231 --> 00:16:39.620
where are we going to get the word Jew?
You who Dee is the word Jew.

268
00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:44.360
A one who belongs to the province of you who'd,
and um,

269
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:48.170
so many of the exiles returned to this now Persian province hood and they

270
00:16:48.171 --> 00:16:50.990
exercise a fair degree of self determination.
Now,

271
00:16:50.991 --> 00:16:54.740
periodization of Jewish history tends to center on these events.

272
00:16:54.741 --> 00:16:59.120
So the period from five 86 to five 38 or so,

273
00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.060
that's known as the exilic period.
Um,

274
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:06.470
most scholars maintain that the traditions of the priestly source,

275
00:17:06.471 --> 00:17:09.080
the traditions of the Deuteronomistic source,

276
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.590
it pretty well re reached their final form in those years.

277
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:17.570
Obviously older traditions go into the composition of those,
those Corpora,

278
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:20.600
but they reached their final form form for the most part in that period.

279
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.580
So the post exhilarate period following,
um,

280
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:27.380
is also known as the Persian period.
I should put that there too

281
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.150
at first.
But of course the Persians won't rule for long.

282
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.340
Alexander's going to come marching through the ancient near east.

283
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.500
So after the Persians will have the Hellenistic period,

284
00:17:36.501 --> 00:17:40.070
but the period after the exile is referred to as the Persian period,

285
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.070
the period of the restoration post exhilarate period,

286
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.520
it's also called the second temple period because by about five 20,

287
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.410
they will have reconstructed the temple.
So it's,

288
00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:52.350
it's not an accurate really to refer to this time as the second temple period.

289
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.970
The second temple will stand until 70 the year 70 of the common era.
Um,

290
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.560
so the period of course before the exile we think of as the first temple period,

291
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.540
the temple is destroyed in five 86.

292
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:06.060
So the first temple period where preexist like period.

293
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:12.500
Now the books of first and second chronicles provide a second account of the

294
00:18:12.811 --> 00:18:13.644
history of Israel.

295
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:17.010
Genesis all the way through second kings has given us one long account.

296
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.980
First chronicles actually begins with Adam.
Um,

297
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:23.730
and it does go through first and second chronicles do go up to the Babylonian

298
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.593
exile.

299
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.400
They echo a good deal of what we find in the books of Samuel and kings.

300
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.941
Um,

301
00:18:29.941 --> 00:18:34.941
but they have more of a priestly bias and they eliminate a lot of material that

302
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:39.120
sheds a poor light on Israel's kings.
So for example,

303
00:18:39.121 --> 00:18:41.970
you won't find the story of David and Bathsheba when you're reading the

304
00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:44.730
chronicles account of the vein of David.
Um,

305
00:18:44.731 --> 00:18:48.210
so chronicles is already and interpretation of,

306
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.160
it's an inner biblical interpretation.

307
00:18:50.161 --> 00:18:54.030
It is the Bible interpreting itself right later strand of tradition reflecting

308
00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:58.080
on earlier strands of tradition and re presenting that material in a particular

309
00:18:58.081 --> 00:19:02.850
light.
The chronicler is less interested in David's political genius,
for example.

310
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:06.480
It doesn't go into his strategy and his political accomplishments nearly so much

311
00:19:06.481 --> 00:19:10.470
as it does go into his role in establishing Jerusalem as a religious capitol,

312
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:14.640
implanting a temple in,
um,
organizing the music for temple worship.

313
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:16.560
These are the interests of the chronicler.

314
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:22.310
The book of Second Chronicles concludes with the decree of Cyrus a permitting

315
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.250
the Jewish captives to return to their homeland and build their temple.

316
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:30.840
We have a second fuller version of this decree,
which as I said,

317
00:19:30.841 --> 00:19:35.841
seems to be consistent with what we know of Persian policies of the policy of

318
00:19:36.181 --> 00:19:38.910
tolerating and even encouraging local religious cults.

319
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.100
So that fuller version appears in Ezra.

320
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.200
I'm going to read first from second chronicles,

321
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:49.340
second chronicles 36 verses 22 to 23 and in the first year of King Cyrus of

322
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.580
Persia,
when the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah was fulfilled.

323
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:54.780
The Lord Rouse,

324
00:19:54.781 --> 00:19:58.770
the spirit of King Cyrus of Persia to issue a proclamation throughout his realm

325
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:03.510
by word of mouth and in writing as follows,
thus said,
King Cyrus of Persia,

326
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.440
the Lord God of Heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has

327
00:20:07.441 --> 00:20:10.890
charged me with building him a house in Jerusalem,
which is in Judah.

328
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.490
Any one of you have all of his people,
may the Lord his God,

329
00:20:14.491 --> 00:20:16.470
be with him and let him go up.

330
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:21.180
And then an as rhe there's an addition as or one verses three and four,

331
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.080
let him go up to Jerusalem that is in Judah and build the house of the Lord God

332
00:20:25.081 --> 00:20:25.711
of Israel,

333
00:20:25.711 --> 00:20:30.240
the God that is in Jerusalem and all who stayed behind wherever he may be

334
00:20:30.241 --> 00:20:33.510
living.
Let the people of his place assist him with silver,

335
00:20:33.511 --> 00:20:38.511
gold goods and livestock besides the freewill offerings to the House of God that

336
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:39.624
is in Jerusalem.

337
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.160
Notice that the decree at the very beginning and in chronicles and the second

338
00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:44.941
chronicles version,

339
00:20:44.941 --> 00:20:48.190
the decree is said to fulfill the word of the Prophet Jeremiah.

340
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.980
Now you remember that Jeremiah prophesied that the Babylonian exile would last

341
00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:57.070
70 years,
right?
He wrote the letter,
he said,
settle down.

342
00:20:57.071 --> 00:21:00.160
This is going to last awhile.
Plant plants and build homes.

343
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.760
So he had prophesied 70 years for an exile.

344
00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:08.761
Well now from the time of the first departure of exiles and five 97 maybe to the

345
00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:12.700
return in five 38,061 years,
it's close.

346
00:21:12.701 --> 00:21:14.620
If you look from the destruction of the first temple,

347
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:18.490
perhaps in five 86 to the completion of the second,

348
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.080
somewhere between five 25 15 we're not really sure.
That's about 70 years.

349
00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:26.500
Either way.
It seems that in the eyes of the Chronicler,
it was close enough.

350
00:21:26.501 --> 00:21:29.530
This seems to have been a fulfillment of Jeremiah is prediction that it would be

351
00:21:29.531 --> 00:21:31.630
about 70 years before they would return.

352
00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:36.940
So the books of Ezra and Nehemiah give an account of the return of the

353
00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:40.390
Babylonian exiles in the late sixth and fifth century.

354
00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.170
And Ezra and Nehemiah were regarded as a unit.

355
00:21:44.171 --> 00:21:47.420
Those two books were regarded as a unit in the Hebrew Bible,
um,

356
00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.700
until the middle ages.

357
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.060
They may in fact have formed part of a larger historical work.
Ezra,

358
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:55.720
Nehemiah first and second chronicles Ezra.

359
00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.280
And to a lesser degree,

360
00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:02.310
Nehemiah seem to have a good deal in common with chronicles and therefore may

361
00:22:02.651 --> 00:22:04.090
derive from the same author.

362
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:07.900
So sometimes in secondary literature you will see references to the chronicler,

363
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:12.460
which refers to the hypothetical author of first and second chronicles and Ezra

364
00:22:12.461 --> 00:22:13.420
and possibly Nehemiah.

365
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.100
The chapters report the initial return of the exiles,

366
00:22:18.101 --> 00:22:22.750
the rebuilding of the temple,
uh,
the career of Ezra and the career of Nehemiah.

367
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.220
All four of the books were probably edited in the late fifth century.

368
00:22:27.221 --> 00:22:29.650
Bce may be close to the fourth century.

369
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.890
It's our best guests when Judah was a small province,

370
00:22:32.891 --> 00:22:37.870
still within the massive Persian empire.
The books of Ezra and Nehemiah,

371
00:22:37.871 --> 00:22:41.500
however,
contained conflicting information about the return,

372
00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.480
about the restoration.
And as a result,

373
00:22:43.481 --> 00:22:47.830
our knowledge of the timing of various events is quite poor.

374
00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.790
It's really not clear who returned first to help,
um,

375
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:54.520
rebuild Jerusalem,
whether it was Ezra,

376
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:59.590
a priest or Nehemiah,
a scribe.
He was,
um,
uh,
Persian,

377
00:22:59.591 --> 00:23:02.320
how describe it.
He was the governor.
Ezra was a priest and a scribe,

378
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.320
and Nehemiah is a Persian appointed governor of Judah.

379
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:10.300
And even though the chronicler dates events according to the year of the reign

380
00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:13.510
of the Persian King,
the king is Artis Xerxes.

381
00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:17.500
And unfortunately there are two kings named Arctic Searcy's in the fifth
century,

382
00:23:17.501 --> 00:23:21.290
and there's one in the fourth.
So it's extremely difficult to figure out,
um,

383
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.630
when these events happen.

384
00:23:22.631 --> 00:23:26.860
So keeping in mind that even the experts can not agree at all on the sequence of

385
00:23:26.861 --> 00:23:30.710
events,
we're simply going to look at the career of Ezra,
the career of Nehemiah,

386
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.980
not going to claim priority for either of them.

387
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.490
And because the events are not presented in chronological order,

388
00:23:36.491 --> 00:23:37.330
even in the books,

389
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:42.100
I'm going to skip fairly freely around between back and forth between the books

390
00:23:42.101 --> 00:23:46.160
of Ezra and Nehemiah.
So the book of Ezra opens with Cyrus decree,

391
00:23:46.161 --> 00:23:46.994
which we've heard,

392
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.950
and then provides a long list of the exiles who returned to Judah after five 38.

393
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.760
They're led by shish bizarre,
shish bizarre.
Uh,

394
00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:59.570
and then among the exiles,
he says there was Yeshua who was a priest.

395
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.220
And Zerubbabel,

396
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:06.620
Zerubbabel was a grandson of King [inaudible],

397
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:11.540
who was the last Davidic king who had been kept in house arrest in,
in Babylon.

398
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.170
He had been among the exiles.
And five 97,

399
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.980
he eventually had been released from house arrest in and Babylon.

400
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:24.080
So now his grandson,
it was a rubella,
uh,
David died,
was returning to Jerusalem.

401
00:24:24.081 --> 00:24:27.560
And you can imagine that this would have stirred a hope in the hearts of many.

402
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:33.280
Chapter three of Ezra describes the sacrifices offered on a rebuilt altar.

403
00:24:33.771 --> 00:24:36.920
And the beginning of the process of rebuilding the temple,
uh,

404
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.930
probably around five 21 or so,

405
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.530
when the builders had laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord,

406
00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:46.070
priests in their vestments with trumpets and Levi's,

407
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.970
sons of a soft with symbols were stationed to give praise to the Lord.

408
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.190
As King David of Israel had ordained,

409
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.270
they sang songs like stolen and praising the Lord for he is good.

410
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.520
His steadfast love for Israelis eternal.

411
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:03.170
All the people raised a great shout extolling the Lord because the foundation of

412
00:25:03.171 --> 00:25:04.730
the house of the Lord had been laid.

413
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.730
Many of the priests and Levites and chiefs of the clans,

414
00:25:07.731 --> 00:25:09.980
the old men who had seen the first house,

415
00:25:09.981 --> 00:25:14.090
the first temple wept loudly as the site of the founding of this house.

416
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:17.360
Many others shouted joyously at the top of their voices.

417
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:22.280
The people could not distinguish the shouts of joy from the people's weeping for

418
00:25:22.281 --> 00:25:25.850
the people raised a great shout,
the sound of which could be heard from afar.

419
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.590
So the older generations who remembered the magnificence of the first temple of

420
00:25:30.591 --> 00:25:33.030
Solomon shed tears.
Um,

421
00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:36.920
the younger people are shouting for joy at the establishment of a new temple,

422
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.860
but the building doesn't proceed smoothly.

423
00:25:39.861 --> 00:25:44.360
And that's due largely to the hostilities of the surrounding communities.

424
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.940
And the surrounding communities are referred to as adversaries,

425
00:25:46.941 --> 00:25:51.650
adversaries of Judah and Benjamin and chapters four,
five and six.

426
00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.280
These,
um,
Samaritans in many cases,
uh,

427
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:58.190
offered to assist in the project of reconstruction.

428
00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.430
Their offer is rejected and as a result,

429
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:06.170
the Samaritans and salted persuade the Persians that this is a bad idea,

430
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:10.280
right?
Rebuilding a potentially rebellious city is a bad idea.

431
00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:14.150
And the Persians listened to them and they order the rebuilding stopped.

432
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.410
There are two profits then Haggai and Zechariah,

433
00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:27.010
right?
So these are profits now of the post exhilarate period.
And we,

434
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.150
if as we go through our periodization of profits,

435
00:26:29.151 --> 00:26:33.560
you'll want to add this fourth category postings like profits,
a third category.

436
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:38.480
They urged the continuation of the building,
uh,
a Persian official,

437
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:39.320
um,

438
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:44.130
objects the Jews appeal to the new Persian Emperor Darrius and they ask him to

439
00:26:44.131 --> 00:26:48.000
search through the court records.
Look for the original authorization by Cyrus.

440
00:26:48.001 --> 00:26:51.010
We've been authorized to do this.
And according to the text,
um,

441
00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.680
Cyrus's edict is found.
Darrius agrees,
uh,
not only to enforce it,

442
00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:59.040
but to honor his obligation to supply money for the rebuilding.

443
00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:02.700
This is under Persian imperial sponsorship and he will honor the obligation to

444
00:27:02.701 --> 00:27:06.870
supply money for the rebuilding and to procure sacrifices as well.

445
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.490
The temple is finally dedicated.

446
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:13.491
We think about five 15 BCE and a Passover celebration is celebrated in the

447
00:27:14.131 --> 00:27:14.964
sanctuary.

448
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.140
There are other social tensions in the restoration community,

449
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:24.170
specifically French friction between those who had remained behind in Judea

450
00:27:24.811 --> 00:27:29.640
during the [inaudible] period.
And um,
the returning exiles who,

451
00:27:29.641 --> 00:27:33.330
although they were few in number enjoyed imperial support,

452
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.170
these a self styled children of the exile,
right,

453
00:27:37.171 --> 00:27:41.250
they refer to themselves as the sons of the exile are children of the exile then

454
00:27:41.251 --> 00:27:46.110
refer to the local people as the local Judeans as peoples of the land.

455
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.890
Um,
this is a derogatory term that seems to cast dispersions on.

456
00:27:49.891 --> 00:27:52.280
They're very status as Jews there.

457
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.660
They're like the other nations or peoples of the land,

458
00:27:54.661 --> 00:27:59.480
they seem to be classifying even Judeans in that category of other.
Um,

459
00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.250
and as we will soon see,
um,

460
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.790
some radically different views of Jewish identity are going to emerge during

461
00:28:05.791 --> 00:28:09.840
this period.
So that's the initial restoration,

462
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:13.740
the process by which the temple was rebuilt.
Let's jump now.
We think,

463
00:28:13.741 --> 00:28:17.310
tell him where to the mid fifth century,
perhaps Nehemiah,

464
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.080
he's a Jewish subject of Persia.

465
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.800
He's the official Cup bearer to the Persian emperor arctic circus.

466
00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:26.070
Cirque sees in the court at Souza.

467
00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:30.370
This is a position that probably entailed his being a unit.
Um,

468
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:34.260
the book of Nehemiah opens with a description of Nehemiah's grief.

469
00:28:34.261 --> 00:28:37.300
He hears these reports of the terrible conditions,
um,

470
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.970
of of his people in Jerusalem sometime around the mid fifth century.
And weeping.

471
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:47.010
He asks for the consent of the emperor to go to Jerusalem and to help rebuild

472
00:28:47.011 --> 00:28:51.780
the city.
So Nehemiah travels to Jerusalem.
We think about four 45 BCE,

473
00:28:51.781 --> 00:28:56.160
and he undertakes the reform vacations of the city and he meets with opposition.

474
00:28:56.390 --> 00:29:01.230
And there's some internal opposition.
There's a female prophet tests no idea.
Uh,

475
00:29:01.231 --> 00:29:05.700
in Nehemiah six 14 seems to be opposed to this and there's some external

476
00:29:05.701 --> 00:29:10.290
opposition as well from Israel's neighbors.
The Samaritans,
the ammonites,

477
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:13.800
some Arabs,
um,
they resent this,
uh,

478
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.920
reconstruction and they see the reconstruction of the city's defensive walls as

479
00:29:18.931 --> 00:29:22.890
an affront to Persian rule.
But Nehemiah continues.

480
00:29:22.891 --> 00:29:26.760
He gives his workman weapons so that they can protect themselves against enemy

481
00:29:26.761 --> 00:29:30.870
attack.
And the walls around the city are completed in record time.

482
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:36.030
These re fortifications helped to establish Jerusalem as an urban center.

483
00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:39.960
And eventually Nehemiah is appointed governor of juice of Judah,

484
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:45.160
governor of Judah Persian domination.
The text says that he institutes,

485
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:48.850
um,
various reforms,
economic reforms,
social reforms.

486
00:29:48.851 --> 00:29:52.990
He's seems to be trying to improve the situation of the poor and established

487
00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:53.950
public order.

488
00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.720
We think that the governorship of Nehemiah overlapped to some degree with the

489
00:29:58.721 --> 00:29:59.950
mission of Ezra.

490
00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:03.970
And Ezra is activities are reported in both the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.

491
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.510
Some scholars believe that they didn't overlap,
that that's,
uh,

492
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:09.310
an illusion created by our sources.

493
00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:13.480
But Chapter Seven of the book of Ezra Introduces Ezra.

494
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:16.660
He's a Babylonian Jew.
He comes from a priestly family,

495
00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:21.661
but he's also described as a scribe who is expert in the Torah of Moses.

496
00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.070
And in verse 10 of Chapter Seven,

497
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:28.540
it said that Ezra had dedicated himself to study the teaching of the Lord,

498
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:32.650
so as to observe it and to teach the laws and rules to Israel.

499
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:36.830
So Ezra is commissioned by the Persian emperor,
um,

500
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.860
and in a letter and the text of which is,
uh,

501
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.740
represented or reproduced in Chapter Seven verses 12 to 26.

502
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:49.950
And the emperor commissions him to travel to Jerusalem to supervise the temple

503
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:55.440
and to assess how well mosaic standards are being implemented in the Gdn

504
00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:57.640
province.

505
00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:02.500
He's charged with appointing scribes and judges to administer civil and moral

506
00:31:02.501 --> 00:31:02.861
order.

507
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:07.690
He has the backing of the Persian Empire to institute mosaic law as a standard

508
00:31:07.691 --> 00:31:09.970
and norm for the community in Jerusalem.

509
00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:13.150
And this is standard operating procedure for,
um,

510
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:18.230
for the Persians to find loyal subjects to regulate their own local cults

511
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.190
according to,
you know,
ancestral traditions.

512
00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.740
And as there's work needs to be understood in that light.

513
00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:28.630
Chapter Seven for you are commissioned by the king and his seven advisors to

514
00:31:28.631 --> 00:31:31.810
regulate Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God,

515
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:35.230
which is in your care.
And you,
Ezra,
by the divine wisdom,

516
00:31:35.231 --> 00:31:39.310
you possess a point magistrates and judges to judge all the people of the

517
00:31:39.311 --> 00:31:44.080
province of beyond the river sees Jordan who know the laws of your God and to

518
00:31:44.081 --> 00:31:45.640
teach those who do not know them,

519
00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:49.210
but anyone who does not obey the law of your God and the law of the king be

520
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:53.320
punished with dispatch.
So he has powers of enforcement,
whether by death,

521
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:57.400
corporal punishment,
confiscation of possessions or imprisonment.

522
00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.200
In addition,

523
00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.580
as was appointed to bring treasures of silver and gold to the temple,

524
00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:08.620
the text says that Ezra brings with him a copy of the Mosaic Torah in order to

525
00:32:08.621 --> 00:32:12.070
regulate and unify Jewish life and the restoration community.

526
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:17.070
And together Ezra and Nehemiah bring about a revival as or as reforms are aimed

527
00:32:17.531 --> 00:32:20.890
at strengthening the religious identity of the Judah Heights.

528
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:25.390
He wants to revitalize morale and he also wants to prevent the decline of mosaic

529
00:32:25.391 --> 00:32:29.140
standards and to prevent the decline of,
of Biblical monotheism.

530
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:34.810
His two most important acts are the dissolution of foreign marriages.

531
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:39.010
This is a first and his renewal of the covenant.
Stay a little bit first.

532
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.910
The dissolution of foreign marriages.

533
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:46.880
Ezra is said to have been distressed when he arrived to discover that many of

534
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:51.881
the returned exiles had married with we think non Israelite women's not clear.

535
00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:56.480
Sometimes peoples of the land might refer to Judeans who had remained behind,

536
00:32:56.481 --> 00:33:00.980
but who themselves had perhaps become lax in as resides in their observance of

537
00:33:00.981 --> 00:33:05.810
mosaic standards.
But they had married a women who seem to follow,

538
00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:07.490
um,
pagan practices,

539
00:33:07.491 --> 00:33:11.960
perhaps chapters nine and 10 describe his efforts to reverse this trend.

540
00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:17.180
And he begs God to forgive the people for this violation of his law.

541
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:18.950
And then at a great assembly,

542
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:22.370
he calls upon all the people to divorce their foreign spouses.

543
00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.820
Now this isn't in fact Penta to goal law,
plainly red.
Um,

544
00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:31.840
the prohibition of marriage with any foreigner is a great innovation on as part

545
00:33:32.571 --> 00:33:37.280
and it's one that,
as we shall see,
was not universally accepted at all.

546
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.150
Um,
the high incidence of intermarriage is perhaps indicated by the fact that it

547
00:33:41.151 --> 00:33:44.570
took several months to identify all those who had intermarried and descend away

548
00:33:44.571 --> 00:33:46.830
their spouses and their children.
Um,

549
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:50.900
even priests were among those who didn't view intermarriage per say is a

550
00:33:50.901 --> 00:33:53.990
violation of the covenant.
And in the next two lectures,

551
00:33:53.991 --> 00:33:57.710
we'll see other perspectives on this question of integration of foreign groups

552
00:33:57.711 --> 00:33:58.940
within the community.
So I just,

553
00:33:58.941 --> 00:34:02.060
I raise it as an issue now we're going to see many different attitudes as we

554
00:34:02.061 --> 00:34:03.950
move through the last section of,
of the Bible.

555
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:08.940
The text of Ezra is prayer before God is a,
um,

556
00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:13.310
a fascinating presentation of ezers interpretation of Israel's history and is

557
00:34:13.311 --> 00:34:18.311
and prior texts and again constitutes yet another response to the calamity that

558
00:34:19.011 --> 00:34:20.060
had befallen the nation,

559
00:34:20.061 --> 00:34:23.810
but also constitutes another example of inner biblical interpretation later

560
00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:28.160
levels or layers within the biblical text turning to older traditions and

561
00:34:28.161 --> 00:34:29.990
interpreting them or reinterpreting them.

562
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:35.200
So listen to how Ezra understands biblical tradition and listen to how he

563
00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:38.990
interprets Israel's history from Ezra nine.

564
00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.730
He's praying to God before the assembled people from the time of your father's

565
00:34:43.731 --> 00:34:48.230
to this very day,
we had been deepen guilt because of our iniquities.

566
00:34:48.231 --> 00:34:51.880
We are kings and our priests have been handed over to foreign kings to the
sword,

567
00:34:51.881 --> 00:34:55.460
to captivity to pillage.
And to humiliation as is now the case.

568
00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:57.500
But now for a short while,

569
00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:01.610
there has been a reprieve from the Lord our God who was granted us a surviving

570
00:35:01.611 --> 00:35:02.840
remnant,
right?
Maybe the height,

571
00:35:02.841 --> 00:35:06.770
prophetic idea of a remnant that would survive and given us a stake in his holy

572
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:11.060
place.
Our God has restored the Lester to our eyes and furnished us with a little

573
00:35:11.061 --> 00:35:15.920
sustenance in our bondage.
Now what can we say in the face of this?
Oh our God,

574
00:35:15.921 --> 00:35:19.760
for we have forsaken your commandments,
which you gave us through your servants,

575
00:35:19.761 --> 00:35:22.880
the prophets.
When you said here he's quoting Bible,

576
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:26.450
the land that you are about to possess is a land uncleaned through the

577
00:35:26.451 --> 00:35:28.280
uncleanness of the peoples of the land,

578
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.540
through their important practices with which they in their impurity have filled

579
00:35:32.541 --> 00:35:33.830
it from one end to the other.

580
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:37.350
Now then do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or let their

581
00:35:37.351 --> 00:35:40.920
daughters marry your sons.
Do nothing for their wellbeing or advantage.

582
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:44.100
Then you will be strong and enjoy the bounty of the land and bequeath it to your

583
00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:47.370
children forever,
right?
So he's quoting earlier tradition.

584
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.970
And after all that has happened to us because of our evil deeds and our deep

585
00:35:50.971 --> 00:35:52.530
guilt,
though you are God,

586
00:35:52.531 --> 00:35:56.430
have been forbearing punishing us less than our iniquity deserves in that you

587
00:35:56.431 --> 00:36:00.570
have granted us such a remnant as this shall we once again violate your

588
00:36:00.571 --> 00:36:05.070
commandments by intermarrying with these people who follow such a and practices

589
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:09.600
will you not rage against us till we are destroyed without remnant or survivor.

590
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.580
So as there's argument is first of all,
following the Deuteronomistic line,

591
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:19.510
you know,
history reflects God's judgment.
Um,
Israel's tragic fate,
um,

592
00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:22.700
is because of her sins and indeed she's been,
um,

593
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.960
she's been given a mercy and a reprieve.

594
00:36:24.961 --> 00:36:27.630
She hasn't been punished as fully as she deserves.

595
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:32.310
He also follows the prophetic line that this remnant has been saved and now

596
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.220
restored.
So the covenant hasn't been completely abrogated,

597
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:39.840
but notice his identification of the sin for which Israel was punished.

598
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:42.930
Israel has mixed and this is the language that he uses elsewhere.

599
00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.020
Israel has mixed in,
um,

600
00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:50.100
whole has mixed holy seed with common seed by uniting through marital unions

601
00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:54.690
with the peoples of the land.
Um,
meaning foreigner's cert.
Certainly,

602
00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:57.800
but possibly also some of these,
um,

603
00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:01.770
Judeans who had remained in the land during the exile and who seemed to have

604
00:37:01.771 --> 00:37:05.760
adopted some of the customs of their neighbors.
And if history is any guide,

605
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:09.960
he's warning the community is placing itself at great risk by intermarrying

606
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:12.150
again and those who will,
uh,

607
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.450
intermarrying with those who will lead them into the worship of other gods and

608
00:37:15.451 --> 00:37:17.460
the performance of important practices.

609
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:22.140
And surely he says this time God will not be so merciful as to spare even a

610
00:37:22.141 --> 00:37:23.970
remnant.
So learn from history.

611
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.480
We send once by intermarrying that was a sin for which we have been exiled.

612
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:31.920
If we do the same thing again this time we will be punished without any hope of

613
00:37:31.921 --> 00:37:32.754
a remnant.

614
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:38.210
So his interpretation of mosaic prescriptions about marriage,
um,

615
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.080
is an expansive one.

616
00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:44.790
The Torah does prohibit intermarriage with the native Canaanites,
um,

617
00:37:44.791 --> 00:37:46.020
at the time of the conquest,

618
00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:50.520
the rationale being that they would lead Israelites into abhorrent pagan

619
00:37:50.521 --> 00:37:53.790
practices,
child sacrifices and so on.
But of course,

620
00:37:53.791 --> 00:37:55.950
it's actually not a completely,
uh,
you know,

621
00:37:55.951 --> 00:37:58.920
there is actually a legal provision for what,
for how to go about.

622
00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.340
I'm marrying a captive Canaanite woman,
so it's,

623
00:38:01.341 --> 00:38:04.580
it's not a completely unqualified prohibition to begin with.
Um,

624
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.130
the Torah then also prohibits intermarriage with certain very specific

625
00:38:08.131 --> 00:38:08.670
foreigners,

626
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:12.570
Moabites and ammonites specifically because of their cruel treatment of the

627
00:38:12.571 --> 00:38:15.600
Israelites during their trip from Egypt to the promised land.

628
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.870
Egyptians are prohibited only to the third generation,

629
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:22.440
but there's no prohibition against marriage with other foreigners.
You know,

630
00:38:22.441 --> 00:38:26.850
a Phoenician,
uh,
an Arab,
so long as they enter into the covenant of Gateway,

631
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:30.540
as long as they don't lead the Israelite partner into the worship.
Other gods,

632
00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:35.541
the ration now for intermarriage prohibitions in the Pantry are always

633
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.810
behavioral,
right?
They're always moral.

634
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.120
If this person will lead you with straight with warrant practices,

635
00:38:40.121 --> 00:38:44.740
that is prohibited.
But marriage into the group is not prohibited.
Indeed,

636
00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.500
Israel's kings married foreign women regularly.

637
00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:51.160
Many of the kings of Israel were themselves offspring of these foreign women.

638
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:55.030
They were still fully Israelite.
Israelite identity passed through the male line.

639
00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:00.720
But Ezra who is protective of Israel's religious identity is zealous for the

640
00:39:00.821 --> 00:39:02.590
Lord,
is wary of God's wrath.

641
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:07.620
He's interpreting and promulgating these prohibitions in such a way as to create

642
00:39:07.691 --> 00:39:10.210
a general ban on intermarriage of any kind.

643
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.520
Israel mustn't make the same mistake twice.

644
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:17.290
Israelite identity is now made contingent in Ezra as view on the status of both

645
00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:18.580
the mother and the father.

646
00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:22.360
One is only an Israelite if one has both an Israelite mother and an Israelite

647
00:39:22.361 --> 00:39:24.670
father,
both must be of the holy seed.

648
00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:29.820
This is a phrase which is being coined now in Israel time and is now serving as

649
00:39:30.281 --> 00:39:33.250
a rationale for intermarriage.
The ban on intermarriage.

650
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:37.060
It's not that a person is prohibited because they will lead to a straight to the

651
00:39:37.061 --> 00:39:38.170
worship of what the gods.

652
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:42.160
That's something that can be corrected if the person in fact enters into the

653
00:39:42.161 --> 00:39:43.330
religious community of Israel.

654
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.990
The rationale is that they just simply are not up holy seed and there's nothing

655
00:39:46.991 --> 00:39:50.710
that you can do to change that.
So this becomes a permanent and universal band.

656
00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.790
So that's the first very important thing that as or tries to do,
right,

657
00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:58.690
the dissolution of marriage with foreign spouses and two to establish a blanket

658
00:39:58.691 --> 00:40:00.460
universal ban on,

659
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.240
on intermarriage to make Israel identity dependent on the Israelite status,

660
00:40:04.241 --> 00:40:06.220
the native Israelites status of both mother and father.

661
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:11.410
Second deed is the renewal of the Mosaic Covenant and this act is reported in

662
00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:15.760
Nehemiah eight there's an extended public reading of the tour of Moses and

663
00:40:15.761 --> 00:40:18.670
that's followed then by a renewal of the mosaic covenant.

664
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:22.090
When the seventh month arrived,
the Israelites being settled in their towns,

665
00:40:22.091 --> 00:40:26.200
the entire people assembled as one man in the square before the Watergate and

666
00:40:26.201 --> 00:40:29.590
they asked Ezra the scribe to bring the scroll of the teaching of Moses with

667
00:40:29.591 --> 00:40:33.640
which the Lord had charged Israel.
On the first day of the seventh month,

668
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.340
Ezra the priest brought the teaching before the congregation,

669
00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:38.890
men and women and all who could listen with understanding.

670
00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.970
He read from it facing the square before the Watergate from the first light

671
00:40:42.971 --> 00:40:45.310
until mid day to the men and the women.

672
00:40:45.311 --> 00:40:48.700
And those who could understand the ears of all the people were given to the

673
00:40:48.701 --> 00:40:51.970
scroll of the teaching.
The word here is Tara as her,

674
00:40:51.971 --> 00:40:56.971
the scribes stood upon a wooden Torah tower made for the purpose as her open the

675
00:40:57.371 --> 00:41:00.790
scroll and the sight of all the people for he was above all the people as he

676
00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:03.850
opened it.
All the people stood up as you're blessed,
the Lord,

677
00:41:03.851 --> 00:41:06.850
the Great God and all the people answered.
Amen.
Amen.
With hands,

678
00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:11.440
appraised the leaders and the Levi's explained the teaching to the people while

679
00:41:11.441 --> 00:41:12.940
the people stood in their places.

680
00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.510
They read from the scroll of the teaching of God translating it and giving the

681
00:41:16.511 --> 00:41:18.430
sense so they understood the reading.

682
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:23.350
Apparently the assembled people no longer understood the classical Hebrew of the

683
00:41:23.351 --> 00:41:26.680
Bible.
If it was formulated in that,
I mean,
what,
what he was actually,

684
00:41:26.681 --> 00:41:27.670
what is this scroll?
I mean,

685
00:41:27.671 --> 00:41:30.670
this is the first time now that we're hearing about the Torah as a scroll and

686
00:41:30.671 --> 00:41:34.490
being read to people.
So,
um,
this is historically quite fascinating,

687
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.580
but the people don't seem to be able to understand it as ran.

688
00:41:37.581 --> 00:41:41.000
His sister and his assistants are probably translating it into Aramaic,

689
00:41:41.001 --> 00:41:44.270
which is now the Lingua Franca of the Persian empire,

690
00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.450
giving the sense of the text perhaps as it's,
as it's being read,

691
00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:52.640
we really can't be certain what it is that Ezra was presenting as the Torah of

692
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.300
Moses.
It may have been the pentitude basically in the form that we now have it.

693
00:41:56.570 --> 00:42:00.890
Um,
both d and p are very strongly reflected in Ezra.

694
00:42:00.891 --> 00:42:01.850
He quotes from them,

695
00:42:01.851 --> 00:42:05.240
he refers to them and then interprets and applies them in new and interesting

696
00:42:05.241 --> 00:42:07.100
ways.
And in any event,

697
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:11.690
this Torah was to become the basis and the standard with a lot of good,

698
00:42:11.691 --> 00:42:16.250
heavy Persian imperial support for the Jewish community from that time forward

699
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:19.010
and at a festival celebration a few weeks later,

700
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:23.390
there was an additional public teaching of the law and a recital of Israel's

701
00:42:23.391 --> 00:42:27.620
history that once again laid special emphasis on Israel's obligations,

702
00:42:27.621 --> 00:42:29.120
what she owed to Yahweh.

703
00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:34.190
The recitation of that history is found in the Hawaiian nine and again,

704
00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:38.390
as an interpreter,
as an interpretation of the calamities that Israel had faced.

705
00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:42.230
It's consistent with the earlier prayer of Ezra,
uh,
that I read.

706
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:44.360
God has withheld nothing from Israel,

707
00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:46.880
yet Israel has to five God rebelled against him,

708
00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:50.030
killed the prophets who had urged them to turn back to the covenant.

709
00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:53.720
And God tolerated Israel sin as long as he possibly could.

710
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:58.370
But finally he had to punish her.
But even so in his great compassion,

711
00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:00.920
God didn't abandoned Israel completely.

712
00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:05.270
Verse 33 of this prayer then turns and addresses God.

713
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:09.500
Surely you are in the right with respect to all that has come upon us for you

714
00:43:09.501 --> 00:43:12.440
have acted faithfully and we have been wicked.
So again,

715
00:43:12.441 --> 00:43:16.430
this justification of God and blaming of the Israelites for all that has

716
00:43:16.431 --> 00:43:20.090
befallen them and learning a lesson for that in the future.
No intermarriage.

717
00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:26.110
All of this is but a prelude to the people's reaffirmation and renewed

718
00:43:26.151 --> 00:43:28.220
commitment to the covenant.

719
00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:33.460
And it's spelled out in great detail in Nehemiah 10 chapter 10 opens in view of

720
00:43:34.371 --> 00:43:37.490
all this,
we make this pledge and put it in writing.

721
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:42.680
And then their follows the list of all the officials,
the Levites,
the priests,

722
00:43:42.681 --> 00:43:43.790
the heads of the people.

723
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.660
And it says that all of these officials and leaders in conjunction join with the

724
00:43:47.661 --> 00:43:48.260
people.

725
00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:52.520
Verse 30 and 31 they joined with their noble brothers and take an oath with

726
00:43:52.521 --> 00:43:56.360
sanctions to follow the teaching of God given through Moses,
the servant of God,

727
00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.630
and to observe carefully all the commandments of the Lord,
our God,

728
00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:01.730
his rules and laws.
Namely,

729
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:05.420
we will not give our daughters in marriage to the peoples of the land or take

730
00:44:05.421 --> 00:44:06.800
their daughters for our sons.

731
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.990
So we then read the various obligations that the people are committing

732
00:44:11.991 --> 00:44:12.950
themselves to.

733
00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:16.160
And these include observance of the Sabbath Day in the sabbath year,

734
00:44:16.161 --> 00:44:20.300
as well as supplying the needs of the upkeep of the temple.

735
00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:24.560
But it's surely significant that the ban on intermarriage and the observance of

736
00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:26.540
the Sabbath top the list,
right.

737
00:44:26.541 --> 00:44:31.440
We are going to commit ourselves again to,
to God's teachings rules.

738
00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:34.390
And laws.
Namely we won't intermarry and we'll observe the sabbath,

739
00:44:34.391 --> 00:44:38.220
though these are are singled out as the top at the top of the list as central

740
00:44:38.221 --> 00:44:40.020
covenantal obligations.

741
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:44.940
And chapter 13 describes Nehemiah's efforts to see that the people live up to

742
00:44:44.941 --> 00:44:47.430
this pledge and he's he scurries around Jerusalem.

743
00:44:47.431 --> 00:44:50.880
He's enforcing the cessation of work on the Sabbath.

744
00:44:50.881 --> 00:44:55.400
He's persuading individuals to give up therefore and wives.
Ezra,

745
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.190
Nehemiah,
we're zealous in their promotion of the renewed covenant.

746
00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:00.211
And in their view,

747
00:45:00.211 --> 00:45:03.570
the centerpiece of the Covenant was the ban on intermarriage and the observance

748
00:45:03.571 --> 00:45:04.404
of the Sabbath.

749
00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:08.790
And it is interesting that these two phenomena in addition to circumcision,

750
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:13.200
uh,
will emerge as the three identifying features of a,
of a Jew.

751
00:45:13.201 --> 00:45:15.750
In the ancient world,
when you look at external literature,

752
00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:17.220
there were circumcised people.

753
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:20.880
There's one day of the week that they don't work and they don't marry outside

754
00:45:20.881 --> 00:45:23.520
their group.
Those are the kinds of themes that you start to see in,

755
00:45:23.521 --> 00:45:26.910
in writings of ancient Greeks and so on.
When they talk about this,

756
00:45:26.911 --> 00:45:29.070
people as are,

757
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:33.750
Nehemiah's reforms can be seen as a direct response to the events of Israel's

758
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:37.350
history.
What's happened before just cannot be allowed to happen again.

759
00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:41.190
And they view the tragic history as a cautionary tale.

760
00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:45.840
It's calling upon the people to make the necessary changes to avoid a repeat

761
00:45:45.841 --> 00:45:46.674
disaster.

762
00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:50.970
There's only one way to guarantee that Israel will never again be destroyed.

763
00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.740
She has to live up to the covenant.

764
00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.700
She failed to honor in the past just to dead her,

765
00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:57.330
dedicate herself to the continent.

766
00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:02.190
And this time she has to be single minded in her devotion to God because history

767
00:46:02.191 --> 00:46:05.250
has shown that God will punish faithlessness and betrayal.

768
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:09.930
Israel can't be led astray by the beliefs and practices of her neighbors.

769
00:46:09.931 --> 00:46:14.880
And so a strict policy of separation has to be enforced if Israel is going to

770
00:46:14.881 --> 00:46:19.110
finally be cured of the desire for idols.
And again,

771
00:46:19.111 --> 00:46:22.590
it's interesting that in Jewish tradition,
the Jewish tradition is that the,
um,

772
00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:27.030
uh,
the flirtation with idolatry which had plagued Israel and the first temple

773
00:46:27.031 --> 00:46:30.470
period cease to exist in the second temple period.
Uh,

774
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:35.280
so again,
this is another area in which Jews earn for themselves a reputation in

775
00:46:35.281 --> 00:46:38.160
antiquity.
They have a reputation for their strict monotheism,

776
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:40.290
the their scrupulous avoidance of foreign gods.

777
00:46:40.291 --> 00:46:41.850
They will not bow down to another God.

778
00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:43.320
There is this people that doesn't in a Mary,

779
00:46:43.321 --> 00:46:46.110
they don't work one day a week and they won't bow down to our kings or to other

780
00:46:46.111 --> 00:46:49.590
gods.
These are the kinds of things you find in these,
in writings in this period.

781
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:55.150
But Ezra and Nehemiah backed by Persian imperial authority help to create and

782
00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.530
preserve,
create and preserve,
not just preserve,

783
00:46:58.531 --> 00:47:02.550
create and preserve a national and religious identity for Jews at a precarious

784
00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:07.160
time.
Their reforms were not universally welcomed,
um,

785
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:09.980
already even in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah,
uh,

786
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:12.900
which give a very sympathetic account of their work.

787
00:47:12.901 --> 00:47:16.220
Obviously we can see rumblings and discontent.
Um,

788
00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:21.120
there are other works that are going to express opposition to the separatism of

789
00:47:21.121 --> 00:47:25.200
Ezra and Nehemiah.
Isaiah 56 verses one to seven.

790
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:29.410
I'm an interesting passage at states quite explicitly that foreigners have

791
00:47:29.411 --> 00:47:32.020
joined themselves to God are welcome.
They're welcome in the temple.

792
00:47:32.021 --> 00:47:34.030
They are welcome.
Even to minister before God,

793
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:38.290
there's a good deal of historical evidence for the assimilation of foreigners

794
00:47:38.291 --> 00:47:42.190
within the Jewish community going on all the time.
Non Jews became Jews.

795
00:47:42.191 --> 00:47:45.880
They married Jews.
Um,
we know of one family,
the [inaudible] family,

796
00:47:45.881 --> 00:47:48.580
quite influential.
They were originally an ammonite family.

797
00:47:48.581 --> 00:47:52.750
Now that is a group that is explicitly prohibited from entering the congregation

798
00:47:52.751 --> 00:47:53.530
in Deuteronomy,

799
00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:58.050
but this is a family that adopted Jewish identity became fully assimilated.
Um,

800
00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:02.530
so clearly there's there,
there's great difference of opinion on this matter.

801
00:48:02.531 --> 00:48:05.860
And in the last two lectures we're going to be focusing a lot on the diversity

802
00:48:05.861 --> 00:48:10.060
of approaches to the whole question of Israelite Jewish identity and

803
00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:11.800
relationship to the gentile world.

804
00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:17.610
So although under Ezra the Torah became the official and authoritative norm for

805
00:48:18.311 --> 00:48:19.144
Israel,

806
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:24.340
although under Ezra Judaism took the decisive step towards becoming a religion

807
00:48:24.341 --> 00:48:26.950
of scripture,
you know,
based on this scriptural text,

808
00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:32.370
this did not in itself result in a single uniform set of practices or beliefs.

809
00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:38.850
Adopting the Torah as a communal norm simply meant that practices and beliefs

810
00:48:38.951 --> 00:48:43.180
were deemed to be authentic to the degree that they accorded with the sense of

811
00:48:43.181 --> 00:48:47.170
scripture and interpretation of scripture varied dramatically.

812
00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.920
So that widely divergent groups now in the Persian period,

813
00:48:50.921 --> 00:48:52.690
and as we move into the Hellenistic period,

814
00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:57.790
widely divergent groups will claim biblical warrant for their specific practices

815
00:48:57.791 --> 00:48:59.830
and beliefs.
So in short,

816
00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:03.730
Ezra may have unified Israel around a common text,

817
00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:08.520
but he didn't unify them around a common interpretation of that text.
Alright,

818
00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:11.500
when we come back,
we'll be looking at about four more books,

819
00:49:11.501 --> 00:49:14.890
all of which set up very interesting and different views on some of these basic

820
00:49:14.891 --> 00:49:15.550
questions.
