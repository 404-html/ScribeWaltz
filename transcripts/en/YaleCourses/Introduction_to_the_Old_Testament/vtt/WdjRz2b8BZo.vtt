1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.490
Okay.
So having studied job,

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.950
we've seen that the Bible is not a book with a single uniform style and message.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.810
It's an anthology of diverse works,
uh,

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.740
that may have different conflicting points of view.

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.090
So the con conventional religious piety of proverbs,

6
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:22.260
the firm belief in a system of divine reward and punishment that's so important

7
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:25.800
to the deuteronomist.
Um,
this is challenged by the book of job.

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.120
Job concludes that there is no justice,
not in this world,
not in any other world.

9
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.770
And nevertheless job feels that he is not excused from the task of righteous

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.610
living.

11
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.320
And it's a wonderful and fortuitous fact of history that Jewish sages chose to

12
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:44.370
include all of these dissonant voices in the Canon of the Hebrew Bible without,

13
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:47.820
for the most part striving to reconcile the conflicts.

14
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.420
And I mentioned this because I hope it will help you in writing your final
paper.

15
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.900
Um,
careful exegesis of the biblical text,

16
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.380
which is part of your task in these papers.
I'll come back in a minute too.

17
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.720
The other part of your task,
uh,

18
00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:04.830
but careful exegesis of the biblical texts requires you to set aside your

19
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:09.831
presuppositions and to attend to the many complex and often conflicting details

20
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:11.040
of the text.

21
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.900
Some of the other presuppositions that you need to set aside when you write this

22
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:20.010
paper are presuppositions that I mentioned at the very outset of the course,

23
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.030
but it might be wise to mention a few of them.
Again.
The first is,

24
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:28.950
and I hope you've seen by now that the Bible is not a set of stories about

25
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:33.420
saints or pious people who always say and do what is right or exemplary,

26
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.250
right?
Even the Bible's heroes are,
are human.
They're not superhuman.

27
00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:41.580
Their behavior can be confused.
It can be immoral,

28
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.540
and if we try to vindicate Biblical characters merely because their names appear

29
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:50.370
in the Bible,
we can miss the moral dilemma that's being set out by the writer.

30
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.160
We can miss the psychological complexity of the stories.

31
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.390
So when you do these papers,
put yourself in the place of the character.

32
00:01:57.391 --> 00:01:59.970
In other words,
humanize them.
I think of them as,

33
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:01.830
as I think of them as acting in ways you might act.

34
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.480
Think about their likely feelings.

35
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:07.140
They're likely mode motivations as human beings.
Secondly,

36
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:09.480
remember that the Bible isn't a manual of religion.

37
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:11.430
It's not a book of systematic theology.

38
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:15.810
It doesn't set out certain dogmas about God and you need to be careful not to

39
00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:20.790
impose upon the Bible theological ideas and beliefs that arose centuries after

40
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:23.070
the bulk of the Bible was written.
For example,

41
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:26.970
a belief in a heaven and hell is a system of reward or punishment or the belief

42
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:28.440
in a God that doesn't change his mind.

43
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:30.690
The character Yaffe white in the Bible changes his mind.

44
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:31.980
It's just a fact of the text.

45
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.690
If we wish to understand the Bible on its own terms and in its own context,

46
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.560
then we have to be prepared to find ideas in it that may conflict with later

47
00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:44.280
theological notions that we hold dear and don't assume you're going to agree

48
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:47.520
with the Bible.
Don't assume that the Bible will agree with itself.

49
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.530
So then coming to your paper assignments,
you've been asked in a,

50
00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:56.940
in the final paper assignment to develop an interpretation of a passage.

51
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.800
And the task of interpretation for the purposes of this class is not excavated.

52
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.673
In other words,

53
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.660
you're not asked to analyze sources or to account for how the text reached its

54
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:09.640
final form,
right?
Source criticism.

55
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.870
You're to look at the final form of the text and give a plausible reading that

56
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:16.540
makes the best sense that you can out of the details,

57
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.780
whether you like the meaning or not,
whether you agree with the meeting or not.

58
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.900
Try to argue from the evidence in the text itself.

59
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.380
So you're going to be doing what you're probably quite accustomed to doing in an

60
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:30.490
English class.
You're going to study the texts language.
It's vocabulary,

61
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:34.510
it's structured,
it's style,
all of the clues.
Look at the immediate context,

62
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:37.930
the larger context,
the way vocabulary is used elsewhere in the Bible,

63
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:42.580
similar vocabulary.
Um,
anything that might shed light on the passages meaning,

64
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:44.080
or a character's motivation.

65
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.080
And then you're going to weigh the evidence and present your reading.

66
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.060
And as in an English class,

67
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.180
you'll want to minimize any external assumptions that you bring to the text.

68
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:56.710
Anything that's not supported by the text.

69
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.920
And often the text will be truly ambiguous,

70
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.820
precisely because there are gaps of information or there are hints that pull in

71
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.400
two different directions at times.

72
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.220
That's part of the great artistry of the Biblical text.

73
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.090
That's what makes it so interpretable.
And if that happens,

74
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:17.620
then you may want to present various,
uh,
dueling interpretations,

75
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.130
various plausible interpretations of the passage based on the evidence and the

76
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:22.330
texts and say,
you know,

77
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.420
these sorts of things lead would lead one to suppose that this is going on.

78
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.170
But on the other hand,
these textual clues lead to the following,
you know,

79
00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:31.660
a plausible interpretation of what's going on.

80
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.940
You'll find that the task of interpretation is easier if you keep in mind the

81
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:38.854
following point.

82
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.580
Not all statements in the Bible are equal when a story is being told,

83
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.800
information conveyed by the narrator is reliable.

84
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.710
Speech attributed to God is reliable.

85
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.750
The words of individual characters are not necessarily reliable.

86
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.030
Characters can be wrong.
They can be misguided.

87
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:02.500
They have limited perspective and sometimes the narrator hints as much.
Um,

88
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.770
but the voice of the narrator is privileged and that's part of the game we play

89
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:07.270
when we read works of Literature.

90
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.740
We accept facts that are established by the narrator as facts that guide our

91
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:15.370
interpretation.
And so it was with the story of job,
right?

92
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:20.260
The narrator established as a fact of the story.
That job is perfectly righteous.

93
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:22.660
That's in the narrator's voice.
In the pros introduction,

94
00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.770
he states that explicitly he bolsters this statement by attributing the same

95
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:31.600
assertion to God and the narrator also establishes as a fact of the story that

96
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:34.720
Joe was afflicted with horrendous suffering that he didn't deserve.

97
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.220
It's not a punishment for sin and then he leaves the characters to struggle with

98
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:40.300
the implications.

99
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.720
Job's friends cling to the idea that God rewards and God punishes.

100
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.250
And so anyone who suffers must have sinned.

101
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.330
We as readers know that they are wrong because of the narrative facts

102
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:56.260
established at the beginning of the story.
Job takes the other row route.

103
00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.170
He knows we do that he is innocent,

104
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.200
that he is not being punished for sin and therefore he concludes that God

105
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.950
doesn't punish and reward at all.

106
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.870
And that's a radical idea that God punishing the wicked and rewards the good in

107
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:12.470
this life,

108
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.550
even if a little delayed sometimes is a fundamental idea in much of the Bible

109
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:19.490
that we have studied so far,
it's getting,
it's going to get weaker.

110
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.960
And some of the books we'll be looking at,

111
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.350
but but job denies this idea and in doing so he arrives at a radical moral

112
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:31.550
conclusion.
The truly righteous man is righteous for its own sake,

113
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.050
even if his righteousness brings him nothing but suffering and pain in this life

114
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:38.900
or in any other.
And remember that at the end of the book,

115
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.610
the narrator has God's state.

116
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.970
That job is the one who has spoken rightly and not his friends.

117
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.990
So be sure to consider point of view and your interpretation.

118
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:51.330
You wouldn't want to go in and just lift something out of Bill Dad's mouth to

119
00:06:51.331 --> 00:06:53.600
say,
this is what the Bible thinks,
right?

120
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.700
Taking a verse right out of context that way.

121
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.970
Don't assume that every character in the Bible is reliable.

122
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.110
Look to the surrounding framework as you evaluate their deeds and their actions

123
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:05.600
and their speech and their views,
and finally,

124
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:08.840
don't be surprised if after carefully looking at all of those things,

125
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:11.930
a passage remains ambiguous.
Again,
in those cases,

126
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:15.500
you might want to detail the features that would support interpretation a,

127
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:18.800
the features that would support interpretation be or you might plump for one

128
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:22.190
interpretation over the other.
That's the first part of your task.

129
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.830
It will help you enormously if you do that right,

130
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.070
it will help you enormously and by right,
I mean thoroughly.
I don't mean correct.

131
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:30.830
I mean,
right in the sense that if you do it well and thoroughly,

132
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.770
then it will help you enormously in the second part of your task,

133
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.980
which is to analyze a Jewish and a Christian and a Christian not or a Jewish and

134
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:43.580
a Christian interpretation of the passage,
particularly whatever key,

135
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:45.620
ambiguous point you might have found in it.

136
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.740
And try to understand how they are a reading of the text,

137
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.450
a genuine effort to deal with,

138
00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:53.870
to grapple with probably the very points of ambiguity that you,

139
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:56.870
yourself found when you really delved into the text.
Right.

140
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.050
And as much as their answers may not be answers that you would come up with,

141
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.850
they are still genuine readings of the exact issues that bugged you when you

142
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:07.730
analyze the texts closely tried to give an account for that.

143
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:12.620
What is it that this interpretation chooses to,
um,
develop,

144
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.740
um,
as it presents its interpretation?
What is it suppressing?

145
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.110
What does this interpretation suppressing?

146
00:08:18.111 --> 00:08:20.300
What is it picking up on and developing?
Right?

147
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:22.850
And you'll be sensitive to those things because you will have invested the time

148
00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:26.150
yourself and appreciating how complex the passages.

149
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.720
So do understand that you need to do all of those things for any of the four

150
00:08:29.721 --> 00:08:31.970
questions.
Develop your own interpretation,

151
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.410
analyze a Jewish and a Christian interpretation of the same passage.
Okay,

152
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.460
now there is debate among scholars over the date of the book of job as well as

153
00:08:43.011 --> 00:08:46.340
some of the other books of the two of Veem to Veem is the Hebrew word that

154
00:08:46.341 --> 00:08:50.390
simply means writings and it's the label or the name that we use to refer now to

155
00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:52.010
the third section of the Bible,
right?

156
00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:55.980
So we've talked about Tara and the VA more profits and now we're moving into the

157
00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:58.350
writings or we have already really moved into the writings.

158
00:08:58.351 --> 00:08:59.610
The third section of the Bible,

159
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:05.150
most scholars would concur that many of these books contain older material,

160
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.880
right?
But that the books reached their final form,

161
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:12.630
their final written form only later,
uh,
in the post exit like period.

162
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.160
Now if these books contain material that predates the exile,

163
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.700
is it legitimate for us to speak of them and study them as a response to the

164
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:25.530
national calamities?
Um,
particularly the,

165
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.560
the destruction and defeat and exile five 87 and five of 86 and answer to this

166
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:34.530
question will consider a relatively recent approach to the study of the Bible.

167
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:37.020
It's an approach known as canonical criticism.

168
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:43.460
Canonical criticism grew out of a dissatisfaction with the scholarly focus on

169
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:49.371
original historical meanings to the exclusion of a consideration of the function

170
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:56.870
or meaning of biblical texts for believing communities in various times and

171
00:09:57.241 --> 00:09:58.800
places,
right?

172
00:09:58.801 --> 00:10:03.360
A dissatisfaction with a focus on original context and original meaning,
um,

173
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.840
to the exclusion of any interest in how the texts would have served a given

174
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:10.980
community at a later time.
A community for which it was canonical.
Right?

175
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:15.000
At what point did these stories and sources suddenly become canonical and have

176
00:10:15.001 --> 00:10:17.250
authority for communities?
And when they did,

177
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.320
how were they read and understood and interpreted?

178
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:24.530
So the historical critical method was always primarily interested in what was

179
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:28.980
really said and done by the original biblical contributors.

180
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.840
Canonical criticism assumes that biblical texts were generated,

181
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.240
transmitted,
reworked,

182
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.380
and preserved in communities for whom they were authoritative.

183
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.680
And that biblical criticism should include study of how these texts functioned

184
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.840
in the believing communities that received and cherished them.

185
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.280
So emphasis is on the final received form of the text,

186
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.030
much less interest in how it got to be,
what it is more interested in how,

187
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.320
what it is now and um,
rather than the stages in its development,

188
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:06.120
there's a greater interest and emphasis and canonical criticism on the function

189
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.320
of that final form of the text in the first communities to receive it.

190
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:15.830
And on the processes of adaptation by which that community and later communities

191
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.560
would really signify earlier tradition to function authoritatively in a new

192
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:26.070
situation.
So a canonical critic might ask,
for example,

193
00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:31.340
what meaning authority or value did a biblical writers seek in a tradition or

194
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.740
story when he employed it in the final form of his text?

195
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.080
What meaning authority or value,

196
00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:41.070
what a community with his community have found in it and what meanings and

197
00:11:41.071 --> 00:11:43.290
values would later communities fine in it?

198
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.330
When that text became canonical for them,

199
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.290
how did they re signify it to be meaningful for them?

200
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.310
Why did religious communities except what they did as canonical rather than

201
00:11:54.311 --> 00:11:55.720
setting certain things aside,

202
00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.160
why was something chosen as canonical and meaningful for them when it came from

203
00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:00.994
an earlier time?

204
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.440
So I propose that we adopt this approach for many of the books.

205
00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:07.090
In this third section of the Bible,

206
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:13.470
we look at the Bible through the eyes of the post exilic community for whom they

207
00:12:13.601 --> 00:12:16.570
were canonical,
at least in part that we won't do this for everything.

208
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:19.750
But I'm going to be coming back to this approach many times in the last few

209
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:23.920
lectures because in this way it becomes possible for us to understand these

210
00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:26.980
books as a response to the national history,

211
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.020
not in their genesis or origin.

212
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.500
They weren't written necessarily as responses to the national history.

213
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.750
Some of them may even predate the exile,

214
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.920
but in the fact that they were adopted or cherished as meaningful by the post

215
00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:39.790
exhibit community.

216
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.960
So whatever the circumstances of their origin and final reduction might have

217
00:12:43.961 --> 00:12:44.794
been.

218
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.450
Many of the books of the two VM of the writings eventually would serve the post

219
00:12:49.451 --> 00:12:54.370
exit community as a prism through which to view Israel's history.

220
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:55.960
Interestingly,

221
00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:00.100
many of the books in this section of the Bible explore questions of suffering

222
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:01.660
and evil and challenge.

223
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.130
Some of the ideas that we've seen is more fundamental in the Torah and the

224
00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:06.964
prophets.

225
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:11.080
They explore the very questions that are raised by the events of Israel's

226
00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:11.914
history.

227
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.940
And so they were appropriated by the community in its quest for meaning in the

228
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:20.650
midst of suffering
as turned to the book of Ecclesiastes.

229
00:13:20.651 --> 00:13:24.290
These are co hell at the Hebrew name is co Helot.
ECCLESIASTES is,

230
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
it's a second attack on the optimism and piety of conventional religion.

231
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.720
Uh,
the book is mostly in the first person.

232
00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:37.480
There's a third person introduction and a little epilogue.

233
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.020
The introduction reads the words of [inaudible],

234
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:45.040
son of David King in Jerusalem.
Now Co hell,

235
00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:48.280
it may mean preacher and that's why the Greek translation Ecclesiasticus,

236
00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:52.540
which means preacher.
Um,
it's hard to know one who assembles or gathers others,

237
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.610
but tradition attributes the work to David's son Solomon known for his wisdom.

238
00:13:57.611 --> 00:13:59.560
This attribution is fictive.

239
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.740
I'm the writer speaks of King's raining before him.

240
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:05.020
That implies there were many but more important,

241
00:14:05.021 --> 00:14:09.370
there are linguistic and literary features that suggest a later,

242
00:14:09.371 --> 00:14:14.020
probably more perhaps a fourth century date,
so as such,

243
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.340
the work can be understood as a post destruction and a post exists like work.

244
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.240
It was available to Israelites who were struggling to make sense of their

245
00:14:22.241 --> 00:14:27.010
history and their God even though no reference is made to that history at all

246
00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.760
and in fact God is not referred to by his personal Israelite name.
Yeah,

247
00:14:30.761 --> 00:14:34.840
halfway in the book at all.
He's only referred to with the general term Elohim.

248
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.410
The prominent tone of the book is one of alienated,

249
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:44.140
a cynicism and a wiry melancholy.
It's the prominent tone.

250
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:49.000
The theme that's repeated throughout is the idea of the emptiness of human

251
00:14:49.001 --> 00:14:52.580
effort.
All is vanity means few tile.

252
00:14:52.581 --> 00:14:57.581
It's all for not co at one one utter futility said Co helot utter futility,

253
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.650
all is futile.

254
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.270
What real value is there for a man in all the gains he makes beneath the sun.

255
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.770
One generation goes,
another comes,
but the earth remains the same forever.

256
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.030
And in verse nine,

257
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.740
only that shall happen which has happened only that occur which has occurred.

258
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.080
There is nothing new beneath the sun.

259
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.320
The endless repeated cycles of the natural world,

260
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:25.040
the rising and setting of the sun and moon,
the ebb and flow of the tides.

261
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:26.740
This leads the um,

262
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:30.650
speaker to the conclusion that everything is that nothing is permanent.

263
00:15:30.651 --> 00:15:33.090
All is fleeting change constantly in any,
uh,

264
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:38.220
we don't find in Cohasset the linear view of time or the sense of progress in

265
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:43.040
history that scholars rightly or wrongly associate with the Hebrew Bible.

266
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:47.120
We find here instead the sick click view of time,
which scholars again,

267
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.670
rightly or wrongly associate with myth.

268
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.650
There are also the endlessly repeated cycles of human,
of the human world,

269
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:58.670
birth and death,
breaking down and building up weeping in laughter,

270
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.130
love and hate killing and healing.

271
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:05.500
And one of the most famous passages from this book now co Hell.

272
00:16:05.501 --> 00:16:09.770
It expresses the idea that everything has its season or time with the

273
00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:14.270
consequence that the effort of humans to alter or affect anything is

274
00:16:14.271 --> 00:16:15.104
meaningless.

275
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:18.500
I'm going to be reading from the RSV translation and in fact many of the things

276
00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:22.310
I'll be reading today will be from the RSV revised standard version because I

277
00:16:22.311 --> 00:16:26.120
think many of these passages will be familiar to you and I'd rather read

278
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:30.170
versions that will catch your ears as familiar then the more accurate

279
00:16:30.171 --> 00:16:32.120
translations of Jewish publication society,

280
00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.500
but which may not ring that that familiar a note for you.

281
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.660
So this is the RSB translation.

282
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.930
But notice how in context it has a very different meaning from the meaning

283
00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:45.380
that's been granted it by folk singers,
for everything.

284
00:16:45.381 --> 00:16:48.140
There is a season and a time for every matter under heaven,

285
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.480
a time to be born in a time to die,

286
00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.630
a time to plant and a time to pluck up what is planted,

287
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:58.340
time to kill and a time to heal,
a time to break down and a time to build up,

288
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.750
a time to weep.
And a time to laugh,
a time to mourn,
and a time to dance,

289
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.530
a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together.

290
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.810
A time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to seek an a time

291
00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:15.200
to lose,
a time to keep and a time to cast away.

292
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.900
A time to rand and a time to sow.

293
00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.730
A time to keep silent and a time to speak.
A time to love and a time to hate.

294
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:27.830
A time for war and a time for peace.
Switching now to the jps translation.

295
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.430
What value then can the man of affairs get from what he earns?

296
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.670
I have observed the business that God gave man to be concerned with.

297
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:39.080
He brings everything to pass precisely at its time.
In other words,

298
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:41.840
everything comes to pass and returns and endless cycles.

299
00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:45.490
We add nothing by our efforts.
It's not quite the comforting,
uh,

300
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.320
comforting passage that it's often quoted to be.

301
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.820
So the writer has tried everything in his search for something that's permanent

302
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:58.080
and not evanescent physical pleasure,
he says is unsatisfying.

303
00:17:58.081 --> 00:18:01.080
It's transient.
Wealth just brings anxiety.

304
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.180
Wisdom is better than power,

305
00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.480
but even knowledge brings great pain one 17 and 18 and so I set my mind to

306
00:18:09.481 --> 00:18:14.340
appraise wisdom and to appraise madness and folly and I learned that this too

307
00:18:14.341 --> 00:18:17.160
was pursuit of wind for as wisdom grows,

308
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:21.690
vexation grows to increase learning is to increase heartache.
Don't believe him.

309
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:27.330
Even if we concede that wisdom is superior to ignorance,

310
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:31.860
we must still face the fact that ultimately death obliterates everything,

311
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.780
death is the great equalizer.

312
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:39.530
Go hell it to 13 to 17 I found that wisdom is superior to folly as light as

313
00:18:40.171 --> 00:18:41.370
superior to darkness.

314
00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:46.290
A wise man has his eyes and his head where as a fool walks in darkness,

315
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.500
but I also realized that the same fate awaits them both.

316
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.800
So I reflected the fate of the fool is also destined for me to what advantage

317
00:18:55.081 --> 00:18:59.460
then have I been wise and I came to the conclusion that that too was few tile

318
00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:03.810
because the wise man just like the fool is not remembered forever for as the

319
00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:07.350
succeeding days roll by,
both are forgotten.
Alas,

320
00:19:07.351 --> 00:19:12.240
the wise man dies just like the fool.
And so I loathed life for,

321
00:19:12.241 --> 00:19:16.340
I was distressed by all that goes on under the sun because everything is few

322
00:19:16.341 --> 00:19:18.030
tile and pursuit of wind,

323
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:23.250
so even more explicitly than job Ecclesiastes,

324
00:19:23.251 --> 00:19:27.450
these attacks the principle of divine providence or distributive justice,

325
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.810
there's no principle of reward or punishment.

326
00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:35.400
The wicked prosper while the innocent suffer and even the principal of delayed

327
00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:39.320
punishment,
which is so important to the Deuteronomistic historian is attacked,

328
00:19:39.321 --> 00:19:43.890
is unjust and [inaudible] eight versus 10 beat of 14 and here's another

329
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:44.724
frustration.

330
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.900
The fact that the sentence imposed for evil deeds is not executed swiftly,

331
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.600
which is why men are emboldened to do evil.

332
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:55.350
The fact that a sinner may do evil a hundred times and it's punishment still be

333
00:19:55.351 --> 00:19:56.130
delayed.

334
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.610
Sometimes an upright man is requited according to the conduct of the Scoundrel

335
00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:03.180
and sometimes the scoundrel is required according to the conduct of the upright.

336
00:20:03.181 --> 00:20:07.230
I say all that is frustration and in a more famous passage,

337
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.760
chapter nine 11 and 12 I have further observed under the sun that the race is

338
00:20:11.761 --> 00:20:14.760
not won by the swift nor the battle by the Valeant,

339
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.900
nor is bread one by the wise nor wealth by the intelligent nor favor,

340
00:20:18.901 --> 00:20:23.220
by the learned for the time of miss chance comes to all and a man cannot even

341
00:20:23.221 --> 00:20:27.690
know his time.
Again,
a passage which is often used as a comforting exhortation.

342
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.600
You know the battle at the,
the race is not won by the swift and so on.

343
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.790
It's here actually in context.

344
00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.990
I'm a lament of the great injustice of the way things occur,

345
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:43.160
but really for Helen it is the inexorable fact of death that makes life entirely

346
00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:46.140
meaningless and that is in fact the starting point of modern schools of

347
00:20:46.141 --> 00:20:48.910
existentialist death is the bottom line.

348
00:20:48.911 --> 00:20:51.700
He rejects the idea of any life after death.

349
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:57.040
A chapter nine verses two through six for the same fate is in store for all,

350
00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.430
for the righteous and for the wicked,
for the good and pure and for the impure.

351
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.180
For Him who sacrifices and for him who does not,
for him,
who is pleasing.

352
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:07.960
And for him he was displeasing and for him who swears and for him who shuns

353
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:11.860
oaths.
And that is the sad thing about all that goes on under the sun,

354
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.790
that the same fate is in store for all four.

355
00:21:14.791 --> 00:21:18.310
He who was reckoned among the living has something to look forward to since the

356
00:21:18.311 --> 00:21:22.450
living.
No,
they will die.
It was ironic,
but the dead know nothing.

357
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:26.800
They have no more recompense for even the memory of them has died.
Their loves,

358
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:30.430
their hates their jealousies of long since perished and they have no more share

359
00:21:30.431 --> 00:21:33.040
till the end of time and all that goes on under the sun.

360
00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:39.880
Nevertheless,
despite all of this despair and cynicism,

361
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.070
there is a positive note in Cohasset.

362
00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:47.670
The writer after all doesn't recommend neorealism or suicide despite the lack of

363
00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:51.340
purpose or meaning in life.
And in fact he does quite the opposite.

364
00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:56.820
He states that every life does have its moments of happiness and these one

365
00:21:56.831 --> 00:22:01.831
should seize while one can go highlit nine verses seven through 10 go eat your

366
00:22:02.771 --> 00:22:06.910
bread in gladness.
And drink your wine and joy for your action was long ago,

367
00:22:06.911 --> 00:22:08.020
approved by God.

368
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.490
Let your clothes always be freshly washed and your head never lacked ointment

369
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.800
and joy.
Happiness with a woman you love,

370
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:17.950
all the fleeting days of life that had been granted to you under the sun.

371
00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:22.840
All your fleeting days for that alone is what you can get out of life and out of

372
00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:27.370
the means you acquire under the sun,
whatever it is in your power to do,

373
00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:31.990
do with all your might for there is no action,
no reasoning,
no learning,

374
00:22:31.991 --> 00:22:34.750
no wisdom and Shay ole where you are going.
And again,

375
00:22:34.751 --> 00:22:38.620
she all refers to this shadowy placed beneath the soil that the shades of the

376
00:22:38.621 --> 00:22:42.550
dead just in habit.
Um,
and that's an ancient notion in Israel.
It's,

377
00:22:42.551 --> 00:22:46.060
it's not connected with the idea of a reward or a punishment after death.

378
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:51.100
A similar,
um,
exhortation is in Kohala at five or 17.

379
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:52.031
Behold,

380
00:22:52.031 --> 00:22:55.750
what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment

381
00:22:55.751 --> 00:22:59.440
and all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life,

382
00:22:59.441 --> 00:23:03.610
which God has given him for this is his lot or three 13.

383
00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:07.150
Whenever a man does eat and drink and get enjoyment out of all his wealth,

384
00:23:07.151 --> 00:23:11.560
it is a gift of God.
We have to be sure not to dilute ourselves.

385
00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:15.880
There is no grand plan.
There's no absolute value or meaning to our toil co hell.

386
00:23:15.881 --> 00:23:17.290
It says there's no life in the here.

387
00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:22.240
After that we are working towards and here he seems to be polemicizing I think

388
00:23:22.241 --> 00:23:25.960
against the belief in the afterlife or reward or punishment that was taking root

389
00:23:25.961 --> 00:23:29.500
at this time in some parts of the Jewish community under the influence of Greek

390
00:23:29.501 --> 00:23:33.700
thought.
But one can still find happiness and love.

391
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:38.850
And with these one should be content striving after anything more is a striving

392
00:23:39.281 --> 00:23:42.790
after wind that leaves one frustrated and weary and bitter.

393
00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.000
Accept the reality of death and then enjoy what you can and the short time you

394
00:23:47.001 --> 00:23:51.890
have.
Indeed,
it's precisely the reality of death that makes life precious.

395
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.970
Whatever it is in your power to do do with all your might because you have only

396
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.440
this one brief chance.

397
00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:02.540
Eternal unlimited life with endless opportunities to act would make any one act

398
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:03.403
meaningless.

399
00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:07.730
So given the fact of death and the limitations that it places upon us taking

400
00:24:07.731 --> 00:24:12.080
pleasure in the ordinary activities in labors of life becomes not meaningless

401
00:24:12.081 --> 00:24:14.410
but meaningful co hell.

402
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:19.510
It is an unusual if not subversive book and its inclusion in the Canon was

403
00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:23.810
apparently a matter of some controversy.
It's controversial.

404
00:24:23.811 --> 00:24:28.811
Character is reflected in the pious editorial postscript that appears at the end

405
00:24:28.911 --> 00:24:29.744
of the book.

406
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:34.220
The very end of chapter 12 verses 11 through 13 we read the following.

407
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:39.770
The sayings of the wise are like goads like nails fixed in prodding sticks.

408
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.610
They were given by one shepherd,
a further word against them.

409
00:24:43.611 --> 00:24:44.900
My son be warned.

410
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.620
The making of many books is without limit and much study is a weariness of the

411
00:24:48.621 --> 00:24:51.650
flesh,
the sum of the matter.
When all is said and done,

412
00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:55.940
revere God and observe his commandments.
For this applies to all mankind,

413
00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.630
that God will call every creature to account for everything unknown,

414
00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:04.631
be it good or bad to fear God and obey his commandments because he will reward

415
00:25:04.641 --> 00:25:08.660
the good and punish the evil is simply not the message of the book of

416
00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.960
[inaudible].
It's very likely in my view,
people will disagree,

417
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:16.640
but it's very likely that this line comes from a later hand which was disturbed

418
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:19.160
by the theme of Co helots preaching.

419
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:24.850
So we have juxtapose then two responses to the suffering and pain in the world

420
00:25:25.341 --> 00:25:28.580
and specifically the tragedy that befell Israel.
One,

421
00:25:28.581 --> 00:25:32.960
an assertion of God's Providence and justice observe urging obedience and the

422
00:25:32.961 --> 00:25:36.350
other and assertion of the lack of justice and providence in the world.

423
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:40.250
Preaching simple existential pleasures as a source of life's meaning and the

424
00:25:40.251 --> 00:25:44.180
frustration of trying to make sense out of what has happened and the richness of

425
00:25:44.181 --> 00:25:47.930
the Hebrew Bible derives precisely from its placement together of radically

426
00:25:47.931 --> 00:25:51.740
diverse points of views like these points of view like these.

427
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:54.650
I'm going to turn now to the book of Psalms,

428
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.710
which we will probably not quite finished today.
Um,

429
00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:59.910
but the book of Psalms contains a,

430
00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:04.970
the principal collection of religious lyric poetry in the Bible consists of 150

431
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:11.500
poems,
uh,
most of which are prayers addressed to God.
Uh,

432
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:15.230
in a very nice little essay on the psalms.
There's a woman,

433
00:26:15.231 --> 00:26:19.970
Margaret and duty who recounts a wonderful dialogue that takes place in

434
00:26:19.971 --> 00:26:23.810
Charlotte.
Bronte's novel Jane Eyre.
You have the 10 year old Jane.

435
00:26:23.811 --> 00:26:24.900
She's a very honest,
um,

436
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.940
but ms treated child and she's being interviewed by Brocklehurst who is this

437
00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:33.230
very harsh school master.
And Jane recounts the conversation like this.

438
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:38.600
Do you read Your Bible sometimes with pleasure?
Are you fond of it?

439
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.530
And I liked revelation and the book of Daniel and Genesis and Samuel and a

440
00:26:43.531 --> 00:26:47.910
little bit of exodus and some parts of kings and chronicles and job and Jonah

441
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:54.030
and the psalms.
I hope you like them.
Oh no sir.
No shocking.

442
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.690
I have a little boy younger than you who knows six psalms by heart.

443
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:01.200
And when you ask him,
which he would rather have a gingerbread nut to eat,

444
00:27:01.201 --> 00:27:05.400
or a verse of a Psalm to learn,
he says,
oh,
the verse of a song,
Angels Sing.

445
00:27:05.401 --> 00:27:08.580
Psalm says,
he,
I wish to be a little angel here below.

446
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.090
And he then gets to nuts in recompensed for his infant piety.

447
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:18.390
Psalms are not interesting.
I remarked that proves you have a wicked heart.

448
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:21.660
So Margaret and duty has pointed out,
I think some,

449
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:24.300
some set several interesting aspects to this dialogue.

450
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:29.190
And first she points out the literary authority and individual taste that's

451
00:27:29.191 --> 00:27:33.990
exhibited by Jane.
She likes prophetic books with dramatic apocalyptic imagery.

452
00:27:33.991 --> 00:27:36.360
She likes revelation and Daniel,
which we'll see soon,

453
00:27:36.361 --> 00:27:38.370
is very dramatic and apocalyptic.

454
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.780
And then she likes rich narrative texts and histories.
Genesis Samuel,

455
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:47.160
parts of exodus,
I can probably pick out which parts,
uh,
kings chronicles.

456
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:51.480
And then she likes the stories of the trials of great survivors of tribulation

457
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:56.600
like Jane herself job and Jonah and Brocklehurst is looking for evidence of her

458
00:27:56.731 --> 00:27:57.271
piety.

459
00:27:57.271 --> 00:28:02.190
And instead he finds evidence of her distasteful love of drama and story and

460
00:28:02.191 --> 00:28:04.170
imagery and suffering.
And he's quite shocked.

461
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.560
A pious child would naturally love the psalms,

462
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:12.240
which in Brocklehurst mind are the songs of angels and they teach humility and

463
00:28:12.241 --> 00:28:15.900
reverence and his own pious child knows how to recite the psalms.

464
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:17.220
Jane's not impressed.

465
00:28:17.221 --> 00:28:22.221
She obvi obviously sees through the sun's a little game even if Brocklehurst

466
00:28:22.321 --> 00:28:25.680
does it and she says psalms aren't interesting and he's mortified.

467
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:30.800
Jane's lack of interest in the psalms.
Her preference for what duty?
Cause uh,

468
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:33.990
the raw and the reel is proof of her wickedness,

469
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:37.410
but Brocklehurst his perception of the Book of Psalms,

470
00:28:37.411 --> 00:28:41.250
which I think many people share,
um,
is not an entirely accurate one.

471
00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.200
And if Jane were to look closely,

472
00:28:43.201 --> 00:28:47.190
she would find plenty of emotion and drama and suffering in the psalms as well.

473
00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:52.680
Um,
the title psalms derives from the Greek Samoy.
It denotes,
um,

474
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.950
religious songs that are performed to musical accompaniment,

475
00:28:55.951 --> 00:28:57.940
the musical accompaniment of the cell Teriana.

476
00:28:57.941 --> 00:28:59.950
That's a string musical instrument.

477
00:28:59.951 --> 00:29:04.020
So they imagined that these were performed to this accompaniment and som away.

478
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:08.190
And it's the scent to against translation of the Hebrew title to helium.

479
00:29:08.191 --> 00:29:12.390
That Hebrew titled to helium probably means or does mean praises.

480
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:18.110
The psalms were only collected into a large anthology in the post exhilarate

481
00:29:18.901 --> 00:29:23.520
period.
We can be pretty sure of that,
the fifth or the fourth century,
but many,

482
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.750
many particularly those that are attributed to professional temple musical

483
00:29:27.751 --> 00:29:31.560
guilds are thought to have been used in the temple service.

484
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:36.740
Many of them date from very early preexist like times the temple staff provided

485
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.040
the psalms with musical and liturgical,
um,
notations,
I don't mean musical notes,

486
00:29:42.041 --> 00:29:45.880
but I mean,
uh,
words indicating some sort of musical or liturgical use.

487
00:29:45.881 --> 00:29:47.620
And those are preserved for us in the text.

488
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.090
We don't for the most part really know what they mean.
Their technical,
um,

489
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:57.300
some superscription and notes seem to be telling us the tune or the kind of

490
00:29:57.761 --> 00:29:59.560
musical accompaniment for the SOM,

491
00:29:59.561 --> 00:30:02.260
whether it was on stringed instruments or flutes.

492
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:07.370
Most of the psalms really tell us very little.
However,
about the time,
um,

493
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.370
and circumstances of their composition,
several it seems were um,

494
00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:15.340
to be used at royal coronations,

495
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.720
which would mean that they were written when Davidic kings still ruled in

496
00:30:19.721 --> 00:30:20.554
Jerusalem.

497
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:25.890
Psalm 45 is an example of a love song that's written in celebration of the

498
00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:30.910
king's marriage with a form bride.
So this is also a of preexist like date.

499
00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:36.160
So Psalm 45 verses 11 through 18 this would have been sung probably at a royal

500
00:30:36.161 --> 00:30:40.090
wedding.
Take Heed,
lasts and note.
Incline your ear.

501
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:44.470
Forget your people and your father's house and let the king be aroused by your

502
00:30:44.471 --> 00:30:48.490
beauty.
Since he is your Lord.
Bow to him.
Oh,
Tyrian last.

503
00:30:48.491 --> 00:30:50.080
So she's from tire to the north.

504
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:54.280
The wealthiest people will court your favor with gifts,
goods of all sorts.

505
00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:55.660
The royal princess,

506
00:30:55.661 --> 00:31:00.460
her dress embroidered with golden mountings is led inside to the king maidens in

507
00:31:00.461 --> 00:31:03.040
her train.
Her companions are presented to you.

508
00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.000
They are led in with joy and gladness.
They entered the palace of the king.

509
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:09.490
Your sons will succeed,
your ancestors,

510
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:11.890
you will appoint them princess throughout the land.

511
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.530
I commemorate your fame for all generations,

512
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:17.650
so people's will praise you forever and ever so clearly.

513
00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:22.240
Some of the psalms date to the period of the monarchy and scholars divide the

514
00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:24.430
psalter into five main collections.

515
00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:27.580
Each of them concludes with like a little duck salad you that indicates that

516
00:31:27.581 --> 00:31:30.430
it's the end of a section.
So I've listed the sections down here,

517
00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:34.480
sort of five books within the larger book of Psalms.

518
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:36.003
Um,

519
00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:42.010
the latest of these probably go somewhat in chronological order.

520
00:31:42.011 --> 00:31:43.570
So we think number five for example,

521
00:31:43.571 --> 00:31:48.250
is probably the latest of the group because it's the one where,
um,

522
00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:53.110
the manuscripts that were found at Qumran,
um,
show the greatest variation,

523
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.190
which suggests that they had continued fluid for some time before being finally

524
00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:01.630
fixed.
The second book,
book two,
so about halfway through the psalms,

525
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:06.370
right at the end of number 72 book two concludes with this postscript,

526
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.700
the prayers of David,
the son of Jesse are ended.

527
00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:13.930
So at one time the Davidic psalms were thought to end.

528
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:18.960
They're almost all of the psalms in book one are prefaced with the phrase two or

529
00:32:20.711 --> 00:32:21.700
of David.

530
00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:26.701
The harder the particle in in Hebrew can be ambiguous probably of David.

531
00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:31.030
And to this old first temple nucleus,

532
00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.930
you had other collections then gravitating.
So,
for example,

533
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:39.500
all of the psalms between one 20 and one 34,
they all bear the same title,

534
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:40.790
a song of a sense.

535
00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.930
They were songs that were probably sung by pilgrims on pilgrimage to Jerusalem

536
00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:48.230
because from any direction you go into Jerusalem and you have to go up.
Um,

537
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:51.830
and so you go up to Jerusalem.
Nevertheless,

538
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:55.820
tradition attributes the entire book of Psalms to King David.

539
00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:00.740
And that attribution stems from the fact that 73 of the 150 psalms are

540
00:33:00.741 --> 00:33:03.200
explicitly said to be psalms of David.

541
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.910
And David is also in the historical books said to be a man of musical talent,

542
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:11.300
right.
So,
um,
the superscription is however,

543
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:14.780
are in many cases late additions.

544
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:19.930
So perhaps the psalms can only be said to be of David or Davidic if by that term

545
00:33:20.241 --> 00:33:23.260
we mean that they are the result of royal patronage,
um,

546
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:27.920
or royal patronage of poetry by the House of David.
In general,

547
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.880
the Biblical text itself lists other authors for some of the psalms.

548
00:33:31.881 --> 00:33:35.630
So 72 is ascribed to Solomon.
Number 90 is described in Moses.

549
00:33:35.631 --> 00:33:38.790
Others are described to us stuff.
And the sons of Korah,
Caracas,

550
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:42.570
an ancestor of a priestly family,
some of them are clearly post exit,

551
00:33:42.571 --> 00:33:45.980
like I'm number 74 laments the destruction of the temple,

552
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.670
number one 37 by the rivers of Babylon.
There we sat,

553
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.720
sat and wept as we thought of Xeon clearly from the perspective of the exile.

554
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:58.310
So what we have is an anthology and then theology of religious expressions

555
00:33:58.311 --> 00:34:00.890
deriving from many centuries of Israel's history.

556
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.810
So despite the claim of religious tradition that the psalms were penned by
David,

557
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.480
uh,
it's clear that they were not all pinned by David.

558
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.560
Some of the psalms are oriented toward community worship.

559
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.850
Some of them are oriented more to individual worship.
But in ancient Israel,

560
00:34:16.851 --> 00:34:20.150
there really isn't always a sharp distinction between the two.

561
00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:23.150
The ancient Israelite in the temple,
uh,

562
00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:26.150
prayed to God as a member of a larger community,

563
00:34:26.151 --> 00:34:29.330
bound by a covenant and not as alone individual.

564
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:33.200
So in the words of Psalm 34,
three,
uh,
we read,

565
00:34:33.201 --> 00:34:36.710
exalt the Lord with me,
let us extol his name together.

566
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.680
So there was a communal aspect,
too much worship.

567
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:45.050
A good deal of form critical work has been done on the book of Psalms.

568
00:34:45.051 --> 00:34:47.870
We haven't spent a lot of time on form criticism.
It's another tool,

569
00:34:47.871 --> 00:34:50.390
another approach that you is used in studying the text.

570
00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:54.350
But the pioneer in this area was a man named Hormone Herrmann Gungko.

571
00:34:54.351 --> 00:34:58.250
I think I've mentioned him before.
His work,
particularly in the book of Psalms,

572
00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:02.840
was forwarded by Sigmund Moe Winkle.
Form.

573
00:35:02.841 --> 00:35:07.490
Critics look at the forms that are used in the construction of Psalms and they

574
00:35:07.491 --> 00:35:11.900
classify psalms according to their forms or their literary genre,
if you will.

575
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:17.470
And then the attempt to place these literary types or genres within their cultic

576
00:35:18.021 --> 00:35:20.150
setting or their sits in Laban,
you know,

577
00:35:20.151 --> 00:35:23.570
what would have been the circumstances under which such a psalm would have been

578
00:35:23.571 --> 00:35:26.300
written or performed in general,

579
00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:31.070
the psalms can be categorized formally and thematically and a number of

580
00:35:31.071 --> 00:35:31.940
different ways.
And I've,

581
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:37.030
I've given you a handout which presents some broad classifications of form or

582
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:39.090
genre.

583
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:43.470
I've actually collapsed many of the main forms into several broader groupings.

584
00:35:43.471 --> 00:35:47.940
But,
um,
the very serious form critics will give you upwards of 13,
14,

585
00:35:47.941 --> 00:35:51.510
15 or more different forms for the psalms.
And as I say,
I've,

586
00:35:51.511 --> 00:35:53.940
I've group many of them together.
As you see on the sheet,

587
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.570
I'm going to go through each one of these and give you some examples and talk

588
00:35:57.571 --> 00:36:00.920
about some of the themes as well as the formal characteristics in the psalms.

589
00:36:00.921 --> 00:36:05.760
So you'll see the variety that's contained in the [inaudible] first looking at

590
00:36:05.761 --> 00:36:09.180
some hymns of praise.
These include creation,
hymns,
praise,

591
00:36:09.181 --> 00:36:11.970
and God is the creator of the natural world.
Um,

592
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:14.820
psalms of Thanksgiving and psalms of trust.

593
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:18.630
These are really the largest category of psalms and probably are what give

594
00:36:18.631 --> 00:36:22.800
Brocklehurst the impression that he has.
Many of them celebrate God's Majesty.

595
00:36:22.801 --> 00:36:27.060
God's wisdom has power,
uh,
such as this creation him.
This is eight.

596
00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.910
And by the way,
the numbers are just giving you some examples.

597
00:36:29.911 --> 00:36:31.750
This is not exhaustive.
I didn't go through and,

598
00:36:31.751 --> 00:36:34.170
and put every one of the hundred and 50 psalms.

599
00:36:34.171 --> 00:36:37.050
But to give you an idea of an example of each category,

600
00:36:37.051 --> 00:36:39.180
and I'll be drawing from these numbers.

601
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:42.480
So number eight Oh lord our Lord.

602
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.790
How majestic is your name throughout the earth?

603
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:48.750
You who have covered the heavens with your splendor.
When I behold your heavens,

604
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.110
the work of your fingers,
the moon and stars that you set in place,

605
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.810
what is man that you have been mindful of him,

606
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:59.070
mortal man that you have taken note of him and Adorn Him with glory and majesty?

607
00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:03.060
You have made him master over your handiwork,
laying the world at his feet,

608
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:07.350
sheep and oxen,
all of them,
and wild beasts to the birds of the heavens,

609
00:37:07.351 --> 00:37:11.640
the fish of the sea,
whatever travels the paths of the sea.
Oh Lord our Lord.

610
00:37:11.641 --> 00:37:15.420
How majestic is your name throughout the earth?
It's a tiny little psalm.

611
00:37:15.421 --> 00:37:20.340
Psalm one 17 that's just two verses long and it contains really all of the

612
00:37:20.341 --> 00:37:23.970
classic formal elements of a psalm of praise or thanksgiving.

613
00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.650
You have an opening invocation to worship I calling others to worship or praise

614
00:37:28.651 --> 00:37:33.120
God.
Then you have a motive clause which is giving the reason and then a

615
00:37:33.121 --> 00:37:38.121
recapitulation or a renewed call to praise so that all of of psalm one 17

616
00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:43.140
follows this form.
Praise the Lord.
All you nations extol him all you peoples.

617
00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:46.740
There's your invocation for greatest,
his steadfast love toward us.

618
00:37:46.741 --> 00:37:50.220
The faithfulness of the Lord endures forever.
There's your motive clause.

619
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.720
Hallelujah.
Hallelu is Hebrew imperative.
Praise Yahweh,

620
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:58.110
short for Yahweh God.
So highly Lou Yang means praise God.

621
00:37:58.111 --> 00:38:01.950
So it's a recapitulation of the call to praise the imperative.
Praise God.

622
00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:06.810
It's classic,
tiny little,
but it has all of the elements of,
of the form of a,

623
00:38:06.811 --> 00:38:08.970
of a,
of a psalm of thanksgiving,

624
00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.930
some one 36 punctuates,

625
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.950
a recitation of God's great deeds,
the creation,
the exodus,

626
00:38:16.951 --> 00:38:20.040
the conquest of the promised land and so on.
With the phrase,

627
00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.110
his steadfast love is eternal.

628
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:27.270
It's an excellent illustration of how Israel's praise is inspired by remembering

629
00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:29.040
what Yahweh has done in history.

630
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:32.820
Still other psalms extol God in his role as creator.

631
00:38:32.821 --> 00:38:37.100
One Oh four is another one of those and we've already seen one or as law giver.

632
00:38:37.101 --> 00:38:39.820
So there are various reasons to praise God creation.

633
00:38:39.821 --> 00:38:42.460
His role in history has giving of the law.
Uh,

634
00:38:42.461 --> 00:38:47.461
striking characteristic of this category of psalms is the variety of metaphors

635
00:38:47.861 --> 00:38:52.840
that are used that are used to describe God.
King Shield,
stronghold,

636
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.830
rock refuge,
shelter.
Many more metaphors as well.

637
00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:02.650
The pair of Sigmadek,
Psalm of trust is contained in the 23rd psalm.

638
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.970
This is a psalm that employs the metaphor of a shepherd to describe God,

639
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:10.180
guiding the individual and straight paths through a frightening valley.

640
00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:14.110
The speakers trust creates a sense of tranquility,

641
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.740
even in the presence of enemies.
And here I'm going to use the RSB translation,

642
00:39:17.741 --> 00:39:21.160
which would be more familiar to many of you.
The Lord is my shepherd.

643
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:25.180
I shall not want.
He makes me lie down in green pastures.

644
00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:29.170
He leads me beside still waters.
He restores my soul.

645
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.680
He leads me in paths of righteousness for his sake.

646
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:35.650
Even though I walk through the Valley of the shadow of death,

647
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:40.540
I fear no evil for thou art with me,
thy Rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

648
00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:45.310
That preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies though anointest

649
00:39:45.311 --> 00:39:47.590
my head with oil,
my cup overflows.

650
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.880
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I shall

651
00:39:51.881 --> 00:39:56.710
dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
The short psalm one 31,

652
00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:01.120
it's another psalm of trust that invokes the image of a mother and a child to

653
00:40:01.121 --> 00:40:05.500
express an even greater tranquility in the RSV translation.
Oh God,

654
00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:09.160
my heart is not lifted up.
My eyes are not raised too high.

655
00:40:09.161 --> 00:40:11.230
That's a metaphor for arrogance in Hebrew.

656
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:15.790
I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me,

657
00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:20.080
but I have calmed and quieted my soul like a child quieted at it's mother's

658
00:40:20.081 --> 00:40:23.260
breast,
like a child that has quieted is my soul.

659
00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:26.920
Oh Israel hope in the Lord from this time forth and forevermore.

660
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:32.380
So these and similar psalms contained some of the most personal depictions of

661
00:40:32.381 --> 00:40:36.040
biblical faith,
have confidence or simple trust in God.

662
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.980
The second category I've got listed,

663
00:40:38.981 --> 00:40:43.550
therefore you are psalms of divine kingship or royal psalms.
Um,

664
00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:46.570
these are not quite the same.
They're two distinct things.
Um,

665
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:51.470
and thrown mint or kingship.
Psalms celebrate halfway as the enthroned ruler,

666
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:55.270
the sovereign ruler of the heavens,
and as sovereign over foreign nations,

667
00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:56.640
so sovereign over nature,

668
00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:01.660
sovereign over the human world and their descriptions of God employ the language

669
00:41:01.691 --> 00:41:04.330
and themes that are associated with the deities of ancient near eastern

670
00:41:04.331 --> 00:41:09.310
mythology,
particularly the bow,
um,
the,
the,
uh,
the language associated with bile,

671
00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:11.050
the Canaanite storm God,

672
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:16.470
some even allude to the defeat of a sea monster as key to God's role as creator

673
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.870
and enthroned king.
In Psalm 29,

674
00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:24.280
the assembly of the God's praises.
Yeah,
way for defeating the water monster.

675
00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:29.730
And although some psalms fully personify nature at the time of creation in

676
00:41:29.741 --> 00:41:32.960
others,
the old ancient near eastern combat creation myths are d.

677
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:37.550
So we see both of these tendencies within some of these psalms.
So for example,

678
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:41.600
some 93,
the Lord is king,
he is robed in Grand Europe,

679
00:41:41.601 --> 00:41:44.630
most of these and throw them in or divine kingship.
Psalms,

680
00:41:44.631 --> 00:41:48.230
we'll begin with the Lord is king,
the Lord is king.
He is robed and rancher.

681
00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.800
The Lord is robed.
He was girded with strength.
The world stands from.

682
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:55.490
It cannot be shaken.
Your throne stands from,
from of old,
from eternity.

683
00:41:55.491 --> 00:41:59.960
You have existed.
The ocean sounds o Lord,
the ocean sounds,
it's thunder.

684
00:41:59.961 --> 00:42:03.410
The ocean sounds,
it's pounding above the funder of the mighty waters,

685
00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:05.550
more majestic than the breakers of the sea.

686
00:42:05.551 --> 00:42:10.130
Is the Lord Majestic on high your decrees or indeed and during holiness be fits

687
00:42:10.131 --> 00:42:13.700
your house.
Oh Lord,
for all times.
See here the mention of the sea,

688
00:42:13.701 --> 00:42:14.870
the ocean pounding,

689
00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:19.280
but it's completely de mythologized did appears here as a natural and an entity

690
00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:21.920
and not a divine antagonist.
By contrast,

691
00:42:21.921 --> 00:42:25.220
there are psalms in which God is battling with a c in the form of a monster.

692
00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:31.400
While Psalms are psalms that praise God's anointed king.

693
00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:35.240
Some scholars believe that these were coronation psalms.

694
00:42:35.241 --> 00:42:38.750
These would have been used at the time of the coronation of a Davidic king,

695
00:42:38.751 --> 00:42:39.470
for example.

696
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:44.300
So some one 10 the yogic way said to my Lord my Lord,

697
00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:48.170
now meaning the King Yahoo,
I said to my Lord,

698
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:51.530
sit at my right hand while I make your enemies your footstool.

699
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:55.700
The Lord will stretch forth from Xy on your mighty septor hold sway over your

700
00:42:55.701 --> 00:42:59.090
enemies,
your people come forward willingly on your day of battle.

701
00:42:59.091 --> 00:43:02.570
I guess that's what every king wishes for your people come forward willingly on

702
00:43:02.571 --> 00:43:06.350
your day of battle and majestic holiness from the womb,
from the dawn.

703
00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:10.640
Yours was the do of youth.
The Lord has sworn and will not relent.

704
00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:14.450
You are a priest forever.
A rightful king by my decree.

705
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.630
The Lord is at your right hand.
Yeah,
is at your right hand.

706
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.180
He crushes kings in the day of his anger,

707
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:24.590
but not all of the Royal Psalms were concerned primarily with military success

708
00:43:24.591 --> 00:43:28.520
or guaranteeing military success.
Some seek to ensure that the king,

709
00:43:28.521 --> 00:43:30.790
the anointed king is bestowed with,
uh,

710
00:43:30.791 --> 00:43:33.530
other qualities necessary for good stewardship.

711
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.310
And so we find in Psalm 72 oh God,

712
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:41.660
endow the king with your judgments that King's son with your righteousness,

713
00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.500
that he may judge your people rightly,
your lowly ones justly.

714
00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:48.020
Let him champion the lowly among the people.

715
00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:52.250
Deliver the needy folk and crush those who wrong them.
Let them be like rain.

716
00:43:52.251 --> 00:43:55.730
That falls on a Moen field like a downpour of rain on the ground,

717
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:58.490
that the righteous may flourish in his time and wellbeing.

718
00:43:58.491 --> 00:44:00.470
A bound till the moon is no more.

719
00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:05.150
A third category I've got listed for you are psalms of lament and petition and

720
00:44:05.151 --> 00:44:07.760
indebtedness,
and these can be voiced in the plural,

721
00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:11.060
a communal supplication or in the voice of the individual.

722
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:15.680
Although individual laments may open with an invocation to um,

723
00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.360
or praise of God,

724
00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:21.890
some launch immediately into a desperate plea for deliverance from some

725
00:44:21.891 --> 00:44:23.120
suffering or crisis.

726
00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:27.290
It's often expressed metaphorically or they might launch into a plea of for

727
00:44:27.291 --> 00:44:31.800
vengeance on one's enemies.
After presenting his complaint,

728
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.310
the psalmist will usually confess his trust in God,

729
00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:40.730
then ask for help or forgiveness and conclude with a vow that he will praise God

730
00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:44.760
again and we sometimes even see an acknowledgement of a divine response.

731
00:44:44.761 --> 00:44:48.990
Perhaps a thank you in advance.
Some 13 has many of these features.

732
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:52.470
How long o Lord will you ignore me forever?

733
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:56.460
How long will you hide your face from me?
How long will I have cares on my mind?

734
00:44:56.461 --> 00:45:00.930
Grief in my heart all day?
How long will my enemy have?
The upper hand look at me,

735
00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:02.490
answer me,
o Lord,
my God,

736
00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:06.090
restore the luster to my eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death,

737
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:10.830
lest my enemies say I have overcome him.
My foes exalt in your deliverance.

738
00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:13.710
I will sing to the Lord for he has been good to me.

739
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:18.750
Psalm 55 asks for deliverance from the treachery of a deceitful friend.

740
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:21.450
It is not an enemy who reviles me.

741
00:45:21.451 --> 00:45:25.140
I could bear that it is not my foe who Vaughn's himself against me.

742
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:28.800
I could hide from him,
but it is you.
My equal,
my companion,

743
00:45:28.801 --> 00:45:33.030
my friend sweet was our fellowship.
We walked together in God's house.

744
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.510
Let him insight death against them.
May they go down alive and just shake.

745
00:45:36.511 --> 00:45:40.560
Oh for where they dwell.
Evil is he harmed his ally.
He broke his,

746
00:45:40.561 --> 00:45:44.160
packed his talk with smoother than butter.
Yet his mind was on war.

747
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.640
His words were more soothing than oil,
yet they were drawn swords.

748
00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.850
Cast your burden upon the Lord and he shall sustain you.

749
00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.910
He will never let the righteous man collapse.
Very personalized.
Um,

750
00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:59.310
laments supplements are pleased for forgiveness of personal sins.

751
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.310
This one is attributed in the psalm itself.
At that the,

752
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.860
the superscription to the Somme.

753
00:46:04.861 --> 00:46:08.940
It's attributed to David after the Prophet Nathan rebukes him for his illicit

754
00:46:08.941 --> 00:46:12.750
relationship with Best Sheva.
And listen to the striking parallelism.

755
00:46:12.751 --> 00:46:16.350
You hear the poetic parallelism in this psalm.
Psalm 51 again,

756
00:46:16.351 --> 00:46:20.160
using the RSV translation,
have mercy on me.
O God,

757
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:23.850
according to thy steadfast love,
according to thy abundant mercy,

758
00:46:23.851 --> 00:46:27.330
blot out my transgressions.
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,

759
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:28.800
and cleanse me from my sin.

760
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.040
For I know my transgressions and my sin is ever before me,

761
00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:36.870
against thee only have I sinned and done that which is evil in thy sight so that

762
00:46:36.871 --> 00:46:40.770
thou aren't justified in I sentence and blameless and I judgment created me a

763
00:46:40.771 --> 00:46:43.620
clean heart,
oh God.
And put a new and right spirit within me.

764
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:47.310
Cast me not away from thy presence,
and take not thy Holy Spirit from me.

765
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:51.450
Restore to me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with a willing spirit.

766
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.860
But communal,
lament,
slander.
These are individual but communal laments,

767
00:46:56.070 --> 00:47:01.070
but whale Israel's misfortunes and urge God's vengeance upon Israel suppressors,

768
00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:05.430
sometimes reminding God of his historic relationship with Israel and his

769
00:47:05.431 --> 00:47:08.460
covenantal obligations.
Let me just finish by reading.

770
00:47:08.461 --> 00:47:10.440
Psalm 74 is a case in point.

771
00:47:10.441 --> 00:47:13.260
It makes explicit reference to the destruction of the sanctuary,

772
00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:18.000
so it's clearly postings Zelig and as a response to the catastrophe,

773
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.170
it gives expression to despair and be wilderness and even anger that God has

774
00:47:22.171 --> 00:47:26.580
forgotten his obligations to Israel.
Why?
Oh God,
do you forever reject us?

775
00:47:26.581 --> 00:47:31.030
Do you fume and anger at the flock that you to remember the community you made

776
00:47:31.031 --> 00:47:33.670
yours as long ago,
your very own tribe that you redeemed,

777
00:47:33.671 --> 00:47:35.080
Mount Zion where you dwell,

778
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:38.990
be stir yourself because if the perpetual to mode two mouth,

779
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.530
all the outrageous of the enemy in the sanctuary,

780
00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:46.090
your foes roar inside your meeting place,
they take their signs for true signs.

781
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:50.200
It's like men wielding acts as against a gnarled tree with hatchet and pike.

782
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:54.190
They hacked away at it's carved work.
They made your sanctuary go up in flames.

783
00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:58.090
They brought low and dishonor the dwelling place of your presence.
They resolved.

784
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:01.930
Let us destroy them all together.
They burned all God's tabernacles in the land.

785
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:05.290
No signs appear for us.
There is no longer any profit.

786
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:08.890
No one among us who knows for how long till when?
Oh God,

787
00:48:08.891 --> 00:48:12.940
will the enemy forever revile your name.
Why do you hold back your hand,

788
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.250
your right hand,
draw it out of your bosom.

789
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.650
Do not deliver your dove to the wild beast.

790
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:22.120
Do not ignore forever the band of your lowly ones.
Look to the covenant rise.

791
00:48:22.121 --> 00:48:25.930
Oh God.
Champion your cause.
The psalmist is be Willard.
Why has this happened?

792
00:48:25.931 --> 00:48:28.360
Why doesn't God Act?
There's no mention of Israel sin.

793
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:31.120
There is no indication that the destruction was just punishment.

794
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:33.790
And Psalm 44 which we'll start with next time,

795
00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:37.270
goes even further and states flatly that the people haven't sinned.

796
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:38.770
It's God who's been faithless.
