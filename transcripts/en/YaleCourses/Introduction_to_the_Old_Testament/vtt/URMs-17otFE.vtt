00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.330
Today we're going to be turning to Leviticus and Leviticus is a primary document

2
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:10.500
of the priestly school and we identify this work as priestly because it deals

3
00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:14.460
with matters that were of special concern to and under the jurisdiction of

4
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.530
priests.
The sanctuary.
It's cultic rituals,
the system of sacrifices,

5
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:23.550
the distinction between the holy and the profane and the pure and the impure.

6
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.620
So the priestly materials are found as a block in Leviticus,

7
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.790
large part of numbers and then they're scattered throughout genesis and exodus.

8
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.740
And because of these common themes,

9
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:37.810
we say that they were produced by a priestly school.
Um,

10
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.750
we hypothesize a priestly school,

11
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:43.800
we don't quite clearly understand exactly what that means and who and exactly

12
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:47.700
when these materials emerged over a period of centuries that's clear.

13
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.380
They reached their final form in the exilic or post exhibit period.

14
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.940
But they certainly often preserve older Celtic traditions and priestly

15
00:00:56.941 --> 00:00:57.990
traditions as well.

16
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.310
We can break the book of Leviticus down into the units that are listed on that

17
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:06.180
side of the board.
You have in chapters one through seven,
the sacrificial system,

18
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.790
chapters eight through 10 recount.

19
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:11.960
The installation of Aaron is high priest and the era nights.

20
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.310
Then as the priestly clan within Israel,

21
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.690
chapters 11 through 15 covered the dietary system,

22
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:22.080
the dietary laws as well as the rituals,
purity laws.

23
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.540
Chapter 16 describes the procedure to be followed on the day of atonement or Yom

24
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.540
Kippor chapters 17 through 26 then our a block of material that's referred to as

25
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.740
the holiness code because of its special emphasis on holiness.

26
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.790
So most scholars think that that block of material comes from a different

27
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:45.750
priestly school.
And so we designate that h holiness,

28
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.990
the relative dates of p and h p now meaning the non h parts of the [inaudible]

29
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:54.240
materials,
they're much debated,

30
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:59.241
but I think increasingly the consensus is that h the block and material in the

31
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:03.840
video 17th through 26 and then also with its got passages scattered around other

32
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:08.220
parts of the Bible.
But the consensus increasingly is that h is later.

33
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:12.480
It's a redactor or editor of the other priestly materials.

34
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.720
So p is a difficult term of reference because p can refer to the entirety of

35
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:24.360
priestly writings all together.
But when we sing about h and talk about age,

36
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.320
then P in contrast to h means the priestly writings that are not age.

37
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.830
So maybe small p and a capital p.
I don't know.

38
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.190
Now the priestly materials have for a long time been I think a devalued part of

39
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.920
the Hebrew Bible and scholarship of the 19th century.

40
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:45.921
And most of the 20th century is generally characterized by a deep seated bias

41
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.050
that views impurity rules as primitive and irrational taboos and sacrifice as

42
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:56.400
controlled savagery that's empty of any spiritual meaning.

43
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.810
Religion without such rights is evolutionarily superior or higher and more

44
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:05.260
spiritually meaningful.
And with those kinds of attitudes,

45
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:08.160
it's not difficult to understand why,
um,

46
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.070
scholarship on Leviticus and those parts of the Bible tend to be rather

47
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:15.670
dismissive.
In the latter part of the 20th century,

48
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:20.671
this situation began to change as anthropologists and ethnographers began to

49
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:26.080
study the danger avoidance practices of many cultures,

50
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:30.640
the taboos and rituals of many cultures including modern western culture,

51
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.980
new avenues for understanding the danger avoidance practices of the Bible began

52
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:38.050
to emerge.
And the anthropologist,

53
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.080
Mary Douglas Changed Forever the way scholars would approach the impurity rules

54
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:48.520
of the Bible because she insisted on their interpretation as symbols,

55
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:52.330
symbols that conveyed something meaningful to those who followed them.

56
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.780
Biblical scholars like Jacob Milgrom and more recently,

57
00:03:55.781 --> 00:04:00.580
Jonathan [inaudible] attuned to developments in the social sciences have made

58
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:04.480
very great advances in our understanding of Israelite purity practices.

59
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.930
They've tended to view the elaborate and carefully constructed texts of p as

60
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:16.231
part of a system whose meaning derives from the larger cultural matrix or grid

61
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:18.820
in which those materials are embedded.

62
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.630
How much the system laid down by p represents what ordinary Israelite Judeans,

63
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.390
uh,
thought and did,

64
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.540
how much these rules were actually enacted and followed how much they drew upon

65
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:37.810
older random practices,
brought them together,
modified them,

66
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:40.240
and posed some semblance of order upon them.

67
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.860
How much they represent just the ideal construction or blueprint of an elite

68
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:49.300
group.
These are all unanswerable questions.
The fact is,

69
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:50.620
no one really knows,

70
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.800
but we do know from living cultures that people do engage in all kinds of ritual

71
00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.000
and symbolic actions because of genuine beliefs about the importance of those

72
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:01.834
actions.

73
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.880
Because those rituals and symbols are extraordinarily meaningful to them.

74
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.530
And in any event,

75
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.720
our primary concern is with the program of the texts as they stand before us.

76
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.670
Is there a symbolism operating here?

77
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.120
What are the key ideas and the key themes of the priestly material?

78
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.780
How do these ideas,
how,

79
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.010
how does this material jive with other aspects of Israelite religion that we've

80
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:25.180
talked about so far?

81
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.510
What ultimately is the purpose toward which these materials are aiming well,

82
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.710
like the rest of the ancient world,

83
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.300
Israel had a cultic system and that cultic system featured a sanctuary,

84
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.780
the sacred space with holy objects,

85
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.400
sacred objects where priests performed a variety of ritual acts.

86
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.850
So Israelite Judean religion on the ground shared many cultic forms and

87
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:54.760
practices and rituals with Canaanite and ancient near Eastern culture.

88
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.610
Generally sanctuaries in the ancient world were understood to be the dwelling

89
00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:03.440
place of the deity.
Sacrifices were offered to the deity in his or her sanctuary.

90
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.070
P describes a portable sanctuary and Mishcon that's used in the wilderness

91
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:13.700
period.
And if you look on your handout,
there's a reconstruction of this tent,

92
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:17.090
like a sanctuary,
um,
at the top,

93
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:19.910
as well as the Schema desertion of its contents below.

94
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.750
So woven curtains hung from wooden frames that could easily be assembled and

95
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:27.014
disassembled.

96
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.310
And these curtains surround the sacred precincts who see that in the top
picture.

97
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.550
And within those precincts,
within that enclosure,

98
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.240
there's a large open courtyard that was accessible to all Israelites.

99
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.190
The main sacrificial official alter with a large ramp stood in that courtyard as

100
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:45.350
well as a basin that was therefore ablutions.

101
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.320
And then halfway across the courtyard,

102
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.070
there was a screen that mark the entrance to another little enclosure,

103
00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:55.370
which is the shrine proper,
the sanctuary proper.

104
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.500
And only priests have access to that area.
Um,

105
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.270
the shrine or sanctuary housed and incense altar.

106
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.490
And then on one side,
a seven branched lamp stand or Menorah and on the other,

107
00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:12.230
a table which held loaves of bread that were changed on a weekly basis.

108
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.830
The back most square-shaped chamber of that inner shrine was the inner sanctum

109
00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:19.940
or the holy of holies.

110
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.110
And that was accessible only to the high priest and only on the day of atonement

111
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:29.111
following a series of heightened purity observances inside that holy of holies

112
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:32.210
was,
the Ark was about four feet by two and a half feet.

113
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.830
It was a wooden arc covered in gold on top was a kind of covering.

114
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.430
It's referred to as a corporate.
We don't really know what this word means.

115
00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:42.410
It's traditionally translated mercy seat.

116
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:47.360
I think that's how the jps might translate it.
Um,
but at some kind of gold cover.

117
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.160
And then there were two Cherubim,

118
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.900
these enormous winged lions that flanked the Ark,

119
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.970
likely they were connected to that,
that mercy seat cover.
If so,

120
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:01.040
then what they were was a throne.

121
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.640
And we have an ancient near eastern iconography Thrones of this type.

122
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:08.600
We have pictures of gods and kings seated on these seats,

123
00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:12.350
the sides of which are these giant wing to Cherubim and then their feet rest on

124
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.520
a footstool.
Likewise in some biblical verses.
God,
yeah,

125
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:20.210
halfway is described as enthroned upon the Cherubim.
Um,

126
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.090
the Ark then is said to serve as his footstool.

127
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.670
So that's sort of the box that he would have rested.
His feet on.

128
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.790
The Ark itself contained the tablets of the covenant.

129
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.490
And so it was a testament to the covenant between God and Israel.
Interestingly,

130
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.380
unlike most ancient sanctuaries,

131
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:39.800
the Israelites Sanctuary did not contain a statue of the deity.

132
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.710
And that's I think,
evidence of the very strong,

133
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.090
an iconic tendency of Israelite religion.
Nevertheless,

134
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:50.060
God was believed to be present in the sanctuary,

135
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:52.970
often in the form of a cloud that will fill,

136
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.650
it will descend to fill the tabernacle,
um,

137
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.540
particularly as it's assembled in a new encampment.
Um,

138
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.710
and then God will descend down to the cloud.
We'll fill the tabernacle.

139
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:07.340
So it is God's presence there that sanctifies,

140
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.610
which simply means makes holy,
makes sacred to sanctify,

141
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.720
to make holy the tabernacle.
And to understand this,

142
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:18.630
we need to understand the priestly conception of holiness.

143
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.010
Now the Hebrew word holy has a root meaning of separate.

144
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.870
Separate that which is holy is separate.
It's withdrawn from common,

145
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:30.840
everyday use.
In the priestly view,

146
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.120
only God is intrinsically holy.
Intrinsically Holy God.

147
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:38.160
Can Impart Holiness to,

148
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:43.080
he can sank defy persons and places and things when they're brought into a

149
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:44.820
specific kind of relationship with him.

150
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:48.300
Our relationship that's best described as a relationship of ownership.

151
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:53.010
What is holy is what is in God's realm.
Something that's separated to him,

152
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.670
that which is outside God's realm is common.

153
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.180
Or the Hebrew word for common is sometimes translated by the English word

154
00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:04.050
profane.
Um,
that has a negative connotation in English,
but in fact,

155
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:06.300
it really doesn't bear that negative connotation.

156
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.980
Profaned simply means not wholly,
not sacred.
We use it differently now.
Um,

157
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.040
but the fact is that the common or profane state is the natural default state of

158
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.910
most objects and things.
This table is,
is just profane.
It's common.

159
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.140
It's available for everyday use.

160
00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:26.530
It's not separated or marked off for special kind of treatment.
Um,
because it's,

161
00:10:26.531 --> 00:10:29.790
it's holy for a common object to become holy.

162
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.760
You need a special act of dedication to God,

163
00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:37.650
an act of sanctification to transfer the thing to God or God's realm or God's

164
00:10:37.651 --> 00:10:38.130
service.

165
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:43.130
So holiness entails necessarily separation in both its positive and negative

166
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:48.840
aspects.
That entails separation of an object to that which sanctifies it,

167
00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:49.830
which is God,

168
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:55.220
and it involves separation from in the form of safeguards against anything that

169
00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:59.490
would threaten to remove its sanctity.

170
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.650
So separation from that which threatens its sanctity.

171
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:07.370
Holy things are holy because they are removed from the realm of the common by

172
00:11:07.561 --> 00:11:12.210
means of rules or safeguards that demarcate them as different and separate and

173
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:14.070
determine that we use them differently.

174
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.760
The preservation of holy status therefore depends on those rules and safeguards

175
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.180
there.
Observance protects the holy object from profit nation,

176
00:11:24.181 --> 00:11:28.470
from being profaned,
reverting from holy status back to common status.

177
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.210
Now it's evident from the schematic representation or the way I've described the

178
00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:38.070
sanctuary that holiness increases as you move deeper into the sanctuary.

179
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:43.670
And the principle here is that holiness increases as proximity to God increases.

180
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.890
The principal is graphically demonstrated in spatial terms.

181
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.000
So in the biblical view,

182
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:56.080
if the area or the land outside the Israelite camp is just common profane land,

183
00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.650
these are like camp bears a certain degree of holiness.

184
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.810
Then as you move in the outer court yard,
the outer enclosure,
the sanctuary,

185
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.900
there's a slightly higher degree of holiness.

186
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.170
It's accessible to Israelites who are pure,

187
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.160
the sanctuary proper,
which is in closer proximity to God.

188
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.440
Bears are still higher degree of holiness.

189
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.460
It's accessible only to the priests who are said to be the holy ones within

190
00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:24.610
Israel.
And then the inner shrine is the holiest area.

191
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.780
It's accessible only to the holiest member of the nation,
the high priest.

192
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:34.180
You have similar concentric circles of holiness characterizing the priestly

193
00:12:34.181 --> 00:12:38.950
conception of time.
There are ordinary common profane days,

194
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.640
work days.
Then there are certain holy days,
for example,

195
00:12:42.641 --> 00:12:44.740
the new year or the Passover holidays.

196
00:12:44.741 --> 00:12:47.170
That's where our word holiday comes from holy days,

197
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.670
and they are separated and demarcated from common time by special rules that

198
00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:55.720
mark them as different,
holier than these days is the sabbath,

199
00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:01.080
which is demarcated by even further rules and observances and the holiest day is

200
00:13:01.241 --> 00:13:03.940
Yom Kippor known as the Sabbath of sabbaths.

201
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.240
This day is separated from all other days by additional rules and observances

202
00:13:09.251 --> 00:13:14.020
and keeping with its profound holiness,
the holiness of persons,

203
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:19.200
of objects of time and of space all converge on Yom Kippor because it's only on

204
00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:24.250
this most holy day that the most holy person,

205
00:13:24.251 --> 00:13:29.110
high priest enters the most holy of holies,
the inner most shrine,

206
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.620
and performs a ritual upon the most holy of objects,

207
00:13:32.621 --> 00:13:35.530
the mercy seat and Ark itself once a year.

208
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.300
Well now we need to consider the deep connection that exists between holiness

209
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:45.220
and purity because the two are not identical despite massive amounts of

210
00:13:45.221 --> 00:13:49.180
scholarship that confuses this issue.
Thinks holy means pure,

211
00:13:49.181 --> 00:13:51.730
thinks common means impure,
and it just doesn't.

212
00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:53.800
These are different binary oppositions.

213
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:59.700
The two are not identical to be holy means to belong to or to be in the realm of

214
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:00.544
God.

215
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.940
Things can't become holy and can't come into contact with the holy or the sacred

216
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.530
if they are not first pure purity,

217
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.930
which is the absence of impurity,

218
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.450
is a prerequisite for access to the holy or for holy status.

219
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.670
To be in a state of purity simply means that one is qualified to contact the

220
00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:27.460
sacred right to enter the sacred precincts,

221
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.740
to handle sacred objects and so on.

222
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:35.370
To be in a state of impurity simply means that one is not qualified to contact

223
00:14:35.591 --> 00:14:39.040
the sacred.
So if you're an impure at home and just minding your own business,

224
00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:39.874
it's no big deal.

225
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.040
It's only a problem if you decide you want to go to the sanctuary.

226
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.640
So purity and impurity are states of qualification or disqualification for

227
00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:49.420
contact with Sancta.

228
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:55.740
The holy is by definition pure by definition only that which is free of impurity

229
00:14:57.171 --> 00:15:01.160
can contact the holy if an impure object.

230
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:04.430
And you'll see here these overlapping pairs,
which are also in your handout.

231
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.540
If you could imagine the lower pair of sort of being clocked down on top of this

232
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:11.720
pair,
that will give you an idea of what we're trying to convey with this image.

233
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.700
Okay.
Things are either wholly or common,
but if they're holy,

234
00:15:16.701 --> 00:15:19.880
they must be pure.
Common objects can be pure impure.

235
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.760
Just depends whether or not they've been in contact with a source of impurity or

236
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:24.740
not.
All right,
if,

237
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:28.190
but notice that the holy and the impure or never conjoined.

238
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.750
If an impure object comes in contact with a holy object,

239
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:35.630
then the holy object is immediately defiled.

240
00:15:35.631 --> 00:15:39.650
It's immediately rendered and pure that were defiled means to take on some form

241
00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:43.160
of ritual impurity,
and it loses its holy status automatically.

242
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:48.410
So it becomes both impure and profane
to be restored.

243
00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:50.960
Then you're going to have to have two things happening.
First of all,

244
00:15:50.961 --> 00:15:53.630
it's gotta be purified.
Got To get rid of the ritual impurity.

245
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.950
So they'll have to be some ritual procedure that purges the impurity.

246
00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:02.360
So once you've done that,
you've made it pure,
but it's still common profane.

247
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.500
So it has to,
if it's to be made holy again,
it has to be read,
dedicated,

248
00:16:06.501 --> 00:16:10.850
or given over to God.
Again,
re sanctified,
maybe a little holy anointing oil,

249
00:16:10.851 --> 00:16:14.960
pour it on it.
That's one means of sanctification.
Simply handing it over to God,

250
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.110
elevating it towards God is another way of re sanctifying something.

251
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.720
But it there has to be two steps,
uh,

252
00:16:20.721 --> 00:16:23.930
purification and then a sanctification to make it holy again.

253
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.400
Increased access to the holy requires increased an increased degree of purity.

254
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.830
It's the connection between holiness and purity.

255
00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.780
So the purity that's required of a priest who has access to the sanctuary proper

256
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:43.670
is higher than that of an Israelite who has access to the outer courtyard.

257
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.480
Only the purity required of the high priest is even greater.

258
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.670
So to be pure,
one must separate oneself from sources of impurity.

259
00:16:52.671 --> 00:16:56.390
What are the sources of impurity?
And I hope you've had a chance to look at,
um,

260
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.630
the reading material because I'm going to go through this relatively quickly.

261
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:05.240
Jonathan [inaudible] has been the most vocal proponent of the claim that

262
00:17:05.241 --> 00:17:09.410
biblical texts speak of two distinct types of impurity,
ritual,

263
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:14.020
impurity and moral impurity,
which I have up here.
Um,

264
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:17.420
you've read this short article he has in the Jewish Study Bible,

265
00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:20.390
but he's also written about this at great length in other places.

266
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.610
And according to klons and others,

267
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:27.410
ritual impurity arises from physical substances and states which are not in

268
00:17:27.411 --> 00:17:30.530
themselves sinful.
There's no intimate connection with sin.

269
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.570
When we're talking about ritual impurity,
in fact,

270
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.400
a lot of ritual impurity is unavoidable and sometimes even obligatory,
right?
Um,

271
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.290
sexual contact makes one ritually impure,

272
00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:43.460
and yet God commands humans to be fruitful and multiply.
I'm burying the dead.

273
00:17:43.461 --> 00:17:46.100
Makes one ritually impure,
but God commands proper care of the debt.

274
00:17:46.101 --> 00:17:49.830
So there's nothing inherently sinful about contracting.
Ritual,
impurity,

275
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.630
ritual,
impurity,
um,

276
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.070
which is generally permitted is distinguished by the characteristics I've

277
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:01.950
quickly jotted down here.
It's contagious.
That is,

278
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:05.670
it's transferred to other persons or objects.
Um,

279
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.180
depending on how receptive they are.
Um,
perhaps by physical touch,

280
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:13.050
perhaps in the case of severe impurity,
by sharing an enclosed space,

281
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:17.820
by being together of,
over and under an overhanging roof or tent.

282
00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.450
Um,
ritual impurity is also impermanent.

283
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.540
It can be removed or reduced through rituals of,

284
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:29.541
of ablutions or just the passage of time or other sorts of ritual observances.

285
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:35.250
Ritual,
impurity also defiles or renders and pure sancta.

286
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.280
And so it has to be kept separate from sancta in very severe cases,

287
00:18:40.681 --> 00:18:44.100
it can even to file some common objects.
And in those cases,

288
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:48.900
the source of impurity might have to be isolated or excluded,
um,
if necessary.

289
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:49.981
Now,

290
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:54.840
the concept of ritual impurity was a central and integral feature of most,

291
00:18:54.841 --> 00:18:59.400
if not all ancient religions and the biblical laws of purity and impurity

292
00:18:59.401 --> 00:19:02.760
strongly resemble those of other ancient near eastern cultures,
Egyptian,

293
00:19:02.761 --> 00:19:05.130
Mesopotamia,
and even Hittite culture.

294
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:10.020
And certainly there are ancient near eastern and Canaanite routes for Israelite

295
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.220
purity practices.

296
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:16.020
But the system of ritual purity and impurity that is crafted in the priestly

297
00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:20.430
writings of the Hebrew Bible represents an attempt to monetize the eyes,

298
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.370
to monitor the eyes,
Israelite purity practices,

299
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.640
and to create a system that differentiated Israel from her close neighbors.

300
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.270
So for example,

301
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:35.690
impurity was often connected with belief in evil spirits and impure demons.

302
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:41.750
It's quite possible that Israel's purification rituals may have originated and

303
00:19:42.061 --> 00:19:44.470
even long endured as,
um,

304
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:49.380
rituals of exorcism that expelled a demon or who was believed to be causing the

305
00:19:49.381 --> 00:19:53.100
affliction and question that may be their origin as source.

306
00:19:53.101 --> 00:19:54.960
But in the priestly writings,

307
00:19:55.770 --> 00:20:00.300
impurity is generally divorced from any association with evil spirits.

308
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:05.640
Some scholars theorize that the ritual purity system reflects an original

309
00:20:05.641 --> 00:20:09.780
concern with health or hygiene,
but this isn't very convincing.

310
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:13.290
Only one set of diseases is said to generate ritual,

311
00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:18.291
impurity and many substances that are widely considered unhygienic by most

312
00:20:18.331 --> 00:20:21.150
cultures.
For example,
human and animal excrement.

313
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.900
And these are not sources of ritual impurity to Israel's priests.

314
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:30.650
So [inaudible] is among those who insist that any effort to understand the

315
00:20:31.351 --> 00:20:36.351
purpose and the meaning of Israelite purity practices as schema ties by the

316
00:20:37.051 --> 00:20:41.580
monetizing priestly writers in Leviticus 12 through 16.
And again,

317
00:20:41.581 --> 00:20:45.000
whether actual Israelite Judeans did this or understood things this way,

318
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.460
we'll never know.
But to understand the schema causation of,

319
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.120
of the monetizing scheme,
mitigation of Israel's purity practices,

320
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:57.330
we would do better to ignore questions of origins and to attend to the larger

321
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:02.800
symbolism of impurity and holiness.
In these writings in particular,

322
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.760
we need to try to understand the antithetical relationship between impurity and

323
00:21:06.761 --> 00:21:08.680
holiness.
The two are opposites.

324
00:21:08.681 --> 00:21:11.170
They are opposed and antagonistic towards one another.

325
00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.280
So [inaudible] points out as you know that there are three main sources of

326
00:21:15.281 --> 00:21:19.090
impurity in p,
first of all,
um,
corpses.

327
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.380
And certain carcasses are a source of ritual impurity Sarrah Act,

328
00:21:23.381 --> 00:21:28.240
which is this,
we translate it scale disease,
it's been called leprosy.

329
00:21:28.241 --> 00:21:30.050
It's definitely not leprosy.
Um,

330
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:35.460
people who know such things have read the details in the biblical text and it's

331
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:40.660
not what is truly known as leprosy,
but at some sort of skin disease,

332
00:21:40.661 --> 00:21:43.170
flaking,
skin disease or other sorts of boils and,

333
00:21:43.171 --> 00:21:46.480
and skin states that seem to be associated,

334
00:21:46.481 --> 00:21:49.510
at least in the Israelite mind with decomposition and death.

335
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.970
We have a couple of passages.
One in the book of numbers,

336
00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:55.910
one in the book of job which described this condition in a way that identifies,

337
00:21:55.911 --> 00:21:58.220
that identifies it with death.
Um,
uh,

338
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.660
an aborted fetus is often described as looking like it has this condition.

339
00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:04.600
For example,
I'm not often happens once in the book of job,

340
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.420
but the point is there's a connection between this condition,

341
00:22:07.421 --> 00:22:11.110
the skin condition and its decomposition and death.

342
00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.400
The third source of ritual impurity would be genital discharges,

343
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:19.990
both normal and diseased [inaudible] notes in the article you read that the

344
00:22:19.991 --> 00:22:24.670
physical substances and states that are labeled impure and are therefore

345
00:22:24.671 --> 00:22:28.750
designated as antithetical to the realm of holiness are states that are

346
00:22:28.751 --> 00:22:31.840
associated with death on the one hand and procreation on the other.

347
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.100
Why should this be the priestly conception of God?

348
00:22:36.101 --> 00:22:40.990
You will recall is of an immortal and asexual being.

349
00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.380
Think back to the first creation story,
which is the priestly creation story.

350
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:49.990
To enter the realm of the holy in which there is neither death nor procreation

351
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.250
requires a separation from death and procreation.

352
00:22:55.030 --> 00:23:00.030
It is association with death and sexuality that renders one impure and

353
00:23:00.251 --> 00:23:03.190
disqualifies one from entering the holy sanctuary.

354
00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:08.530
That is not to say that one shouldn't deal with death or sexuality in the

355
00:23:08.531 --> 00:23:11.380
ordinary course of life.
On the contrary,

356
00:23:11.381 --> 00:23:14.530
God explicitly commands humans to be fruitful and multiply,

357
00:23:14.531 --> 00:23:17.260
and he does that in the piece source,
right?
In genesis one,

358
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:22.030
he commands proper care of the dead and he also does that in the piece source.

359
00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.840
It simply means that one cannot enter the holy sanctuary.

360
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:30.760
God's realm when impure through contact with death or sexuality.

361
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.230
So according to [inaudible],

362
00:23:32.231 --> 00:23:37.030
ritual purification involved separation from those aspects of humanity,

363
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:42.480
death and sex that are least godlike to enter God's realm requires imitation of

364
00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:46.850
God or imitates c o d right?

365
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.150
An idea that I've put up here imitates dod imitation of God,

366
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.680
and Cohen's further argues that the concept of [inaudible] Day,

367
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:57.740
he also explains the practice of sacrifice,

368
00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.920
which on the face of it contradicts the idea that you must avoid death and

369
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:04.760
connection with the holy,
right,

370
00:24:04.761 --> 00:24:09.590
because sacrifice entails killing right in the sanctuary killing of animals,

371
00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:12.830
right in the sanctuary.
So [inaudible] argues,
and I quote,

372
00:24:12.831 --> 00:24:17.831
that sacrifice involves in part the controlled exercise of complete power over

373
00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:20.600
an animal's life and death,

374
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:25.460
which is he says precisely one of the powers that Israel's God exercises over

375
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:28.640
human beings as God is to humanity.

376
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:33.170
Humans in imitation of God are towards their domesticated animals.

377
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:36.350
So the process of sacrifice,
I won't go into his argument here,

378
00:24:36.351 --> 00:24:40.580
but flow ons develops a strong argument that the process of sacrifice can be

379
00:24:40.581 --> 00:24:45.581
understood itself as an act of [inaudible] because sacrifice involves a variety

380
00:24:45.891 --> 00:24:50.891
of behaviors in the biblical texts that are analogous to behaviors attributed

381
00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:54.080
elsewhere in the biblical text to God.

382
00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.950
I'm the care and feeding and raising of domestic animals,

383
00:24:57.951 --> 00:25:02.900
the selection of one that is deemed a perfect control over it's life and death

384
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:03.620
and so on.

385
00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:07.490
And these were all spoken of in terms that are analogous to terms used to

386
00:25:07.491 --> 00:25:11.510
describe God as the shepherd of his flock of Israel and in control of life and

387
00:25:11.511 --> 00:25:15.710
death and so on.
So Colandra I used at the process of sacrifice,

388
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.680
which grants the offer a complete control over life.

389
00:25:18.681 --> 00:25:23.680
And death is a kind of imitates cod.
But Kawana also asserts,

390
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:25.460
and I quote,
that emitted CEO Day,

391
00:25:25.461 --> 00:25:29.810
he does not exhaustively explain sacrifice in ancient Israel.
And in fact,

392
00:25:29.811 --> 00:25:34.811
we should be surprised if any one single theory would indeed explain sacrifice.

393
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.170
So he just says that there are really two organizing principles are overriding

394
00:25:39.171 --> 00:25:42.740
concerns in the priestly traditions and the priests in materials regarding

395
00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:46.360
sacrifice.
The first,
as we've seen is [inaudible],

396
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:51.700
but the second is a desire to attract and maintain the divine presence,

397
00:25:52.461 --> 00:25:54.950
the continued presence of God in the sanctuary.

398
00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.990
The majority of the sacrifices that are described in the opening chapters of

399
00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:04.010
Leviticus in Leviticus one through seven are voluntary sacrifices.

400
00:26:04.011 --> 00:26:08.510
These are sacrifices that are offered as gifts or in times of celebration.

401
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:11.410
Put a little list of them up here,
but uh,

402
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.300
the first three are the ones that will concern is now we have,
first of all,

403
00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.270
the whole offering or burnt offering.
It's sometimes called,

404
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:21.800
this is when an animal is entirely burned to create,
as the text says,

405
00:26:21.801 --> 00:26:25.340
a pleasant smelling odor or pleasant smelling smoke that ascends to God.

406
00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:27.680
So according to p,

407
00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:33.220
the priests are to offer to such burnt offerings with pleasing smelling odors to

408
00:26:33.651 --> 00:26:35.000
the Lord every day,

409
00:26:35.001 --> 00:26:38.750
one in the morning and one in the evening on a regular basis from the community.

410
00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.080
The second kind of offering that's described as the grain offering.

411
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.990
This is a gift of flour and oil and incense,

412
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:50.310
which is burned after a portion is removed for for the priests as dues to the

413
00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:51.060
priest.

414
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:55.740
The rest is burned on the altar again with a sweet smell from the incense.
Third,

415
00:26:55.741 --> 00:26:59.820
we have a set of offerings known as well being offerings,
peace offerings.

416
00:26:59.821 --> 00:27:01.530
It's sometimes translated.

417
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:06.870
These offerings are generally consumed by the offer and the F and his family.

418
00:27:06.871 --> 00:27:11.871
Very often in a festive or situation as a big feast after certain portions are

419
00:27:12.211 --> 00:27:16.680
donated to the priest.
Again,
wellbeing offerings,
sort of three main types.

420
00:27:16.681 --> 00:27:18.390
You had the Thanksgiving offering,

421
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.950
you have a freewill offering just because someone wants to do this,

422
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.310
a freewill offering and you have a vow offering that would be offered on the

423
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:28.860
successful completion of a vow,
for example,

424
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.900
and these sacrifices are all entirely optional.
They were offered in celebration.

425
00:27:33.901 --> 00:27:38.400
They were offered at Thanksgiving or upon the successful completion of a vow.

426
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:43.650
In other words,
the sacrificial cult was primarily a vehicle for worshipers,

427
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:48.720
expression of a wide range of emotions,
joy over the birth of a child,
um,

428
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:52.410
thankfulness for a good harvest and so on.
Now,

429
00:27:52.411 --> 00:27:57.120
texts from ancient near eastern cultures suggest that essential function of the

430
00:27:57.121 --> 00:28:02.121
rituals that were performed in sanctuaries was to secure the perpetual aid and

431
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.280
blessing of a well disposed deity and in important ways,

432
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.400
the Israelite cult is strikingly similar,

433
00:28:08.401 --> 00:28:11.160
particularly in the sacrifices I've just described.

434
00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:16.610
The Israelites certainly hoped to secure the perpetual aid and blessing and

435
00:28:16.621 --> 00:28:21.360
protection of a well disposed deity blessing and benefaction flow from God's

436
00:28:21.361 --> 00:28:25.230
presence in the midst of the community,
in his sanctuary.
When he is there,

437
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.100
there is blessing.

438
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.030
So [inaudible] follows earlier scholars in suggesting that the rituals and

439
00:28:30.031 --> 00:28:32.100
sacrifices performed in the sanctuary,

440
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:37.050
we're designed to ensure God's continued residents within and blessing of the

441
00:28:37.051 --> 00:28:39.030
community.
In particular,

442
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:44.060
the daily burnt offerings sacrificed by the priests twice each day and emitting

443
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.810
this pleasing odor.
These were an effort to attract the deity.
Likewise,

444
00:28:48.811 --> 00:28:49.590
the gifts,

445
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:53.160
the other foods and pleasing odors of the sacrifices brought by individual

446
00:28:53.161 --> 00:28:55.770
worshipers attracted and maintained.

447
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.410
The continued presence of God in the sanctuary.

448
00:28:58.411 --> 00:29:02.700
So this is the second overriding concern,
organizing principle of the sacrifice,

449
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.360
not simply that there should be in potassium a day within God's realm,

450
00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:10.440
but also that the activities there should attract and maintain the presence of

451
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.690
the DVD for the wellbeing of the community,

452
00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.980
but just as God is attracted by certain kinds of behaviors.

453
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:21.390
So he is repelled by others and in the priestly system,

454
00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.600
grave sins generate and impurity.

455
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:29.310
Now a moral impurity.
So now we're coming to the second kind of impurity,

456
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:33.300
a moral impurity that repels the divine presence.

457
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.860
Okay,

458
00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:39.570
so moral impurity is the second kind of impurity that's described by [inaudible]

459
00:29:39.571 --> 00:29:43.600
and others.
In contrast to ritual,
impurity,

460
00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:49.030
moral impurity does arise from the commission of sins.
Ritual impurity does not.

461
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:53.110
It's nothing that's prohibited about it's you never told not to become ritually

462
00:29:53.111 --> 00:29:57.490
impure,
okay?
There's nothing sinful about it inherently,

463
00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:01.870
but moral impurity arises specifically from the commission of certain heinous

464
00:30:01.871 --> 00:30:06.310
sins.
Specifically the three that I've listed here are the biggies.

465
00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:11.320
Idolatry,
alright,
homicide and sexual transgressions.

466
00:30:11.321 --> 00:30:14.980
These are spelled out in Leviticus 18 and Leviticus 20.

467
00:30:14.981 --> 00:30:18.970
Those two chapters besides defiling,
the sinner,

468
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.500
moral impurity symbolically defiles various sancta,

469
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:25.240
especially the sanctuary,

470
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:29.050
but also God's name and also the Holy Land itself.

471
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.280
Moral impurity differs from ritual,
ritual,
impurity,

472
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.770
not simply because of its origin and sin,

473
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.280
but also in the fact that it's not contagious,
right?

474
00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.130
You don't contract impurity by touching a murderer.

475
00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.800
The way that you can tract ritual impurity by touching somebody,
um,

476
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.980
with the gonorrhea,
okay?
Also,

477
00:30:50.981 --> 00:30:55.220
moral impurity is not removed or we do civil through rituals through washings

478
00:30:55.221 --> 00:30:57.810
and launderings ritual,
ablutions and the like.
Um,

479
00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:03.390
that does not touch moral impurity and a person moral purity of persons can be

480
00:31:04.031 --> 00:31:08.980
achieved only by punishment for heinous sins.
Uh,
for example,

481
00:31:08.981 --> 00:31:12.060
the punishment of corate or cutting off is a divine punishment.

482
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.150
Being extricated from the house of Israel or death,
right?

483
00:31:16.151 --> 00:31:20.020
That's one way to be rid of moral impurity.
Um,

484
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:21.581
also,

485
00:31:21.581 --> 00:31:26.581
it can be achieved or by simply avoiding or abstaining from the filing immoral

486
00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:31.240
acts in the first place.
That's another way to achieve,
um,
moral purity.

487
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.690
Also,
if you atone for,
um,

488
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:38.200
unwitting sins that you perhaps later realize and regret,

489
00:31:38.201 --> 00:31:39.400
acknowledge and confess,

490
00:31:39.401 --> 00:31:43.420
then that can also have reduced moral impurity.

491
00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:48.730
Very severe moral impurity defiles the innermost,

492
00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.510
the inner most areas of the sanctuary as well as the land.
Now,

493
00:31:52.511 --> 00:31:54.850
the sanctuary can be purified of moral impurity,

494
00:31:54.851 --> 00:31:57.010
and I'll come back and talk about that in a second.

495
00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:02.370
But the land really cannot land that is repeatedly defiled or the Holy Land of

496
00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:07.170
God that is repeatedly defiled by sexual transgressions,
for example,
um,

497
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.590
cannot be purified.

498
00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:12.490
Eventually it will simply vomit out the from the biblical text says,

499
00:32:12.491 --> 00:32:16.930
it will simply vomit out those who dwell on it as a reference to exile.

500
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:19.040
This is consistent with,
um,

501
00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.630
the representation of the expulsion of the Canaanites from God's land.

502
00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.990
Remember when God said the sin of the Amorites is not yet complete?

503
00:32:25.991 --> 00:32:28.600
When they have sinned so much into to such a degree,

504
00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.930
they will be vomited out and then your tendency can begin.

505
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:35.530
The land will purge itself of the impurity by vomiting them out.

506
00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:36.850
And this is consistent.

507
00:32:36.851 --> 00:32:41.450
Then with the repeated warnings in Leviticus to the Israelites not to engage in

508
00:32:41.451 --> 00:32:45.470
similar abominable and sinful practices.
The sexual transgressions,
the bloodshed,

509
00:32:45.471 --> 00:32:49.910
the idolatry because they too will pollute the land until it vomits them out.

510
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:51.050
They will be expelled.

511
00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:55.520
The land is also defiled by elicit homicide.

512
00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.060
There is legal homicide of course,
judicial death and so on in the Bible,

513
00:32:59.061 --> 00:33:02.570
but elicit homicide,
whether intentional or unintentional,

514
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.610
tensional murder or accidental homicide.

515
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.440
The man's slayer bears blood guilt.
What is referred to as blood guilt.

516
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:12.980
That's a kind of moral impurity and his life,
his forfeit.
Because of that,

517
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.980
in cases of deliberate murder,

518
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.270
blood gill and impurity are removed only by the death of the murderer himself,

519
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.970
only blood atones for blood.

520
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.210
In cases of accidental homicide,

521
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:31.630
the perpetrator can take refuge in one of five cities that are designated for

522
00:33:31.941 --> 00:33:34.430
this purpose,
the five cities of refuge,

523
00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:39.020
they can live there until the death of the high priest and the death of the high

524
00:33:39.021 --> 00:33:44.021
priest symbolically serves to purge or remove the blood guilt or impurity of the

525
00:33:44.421 --> 00:33:45.680
accidental homicide.

526
00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:51.380
Idolatry also to files the land offenders are subject to stoning and the divine

527
00:33:51.381 --> 00:33:56.381
penalty of carrot of cutting off the Bible repeatedly warns that idols and their

528
00:33:57.231 --> 00:34:00.830
cultic appurtenances must be completely destroyed from the Holy Land,
right?

529
00:34:00.831 --> 00:34:03.350
The Israelites have to eradicate that they're polluting the land.

530
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:05.600
Now in contrast to the land,

531
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:10.430
God's sanctuary can be purified from moral impurity by means of a special

532
00:34:10.431 --> 00:34:14.590
sacrifice.
And this is the fourth sacrifice listed here.
The Habitat,
um,

533
00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.420
which is uh,
the purification sacrifice.

534
00:34:17.421 --> 00:34:20.900
It's often erroneously translated as a sin offering.

535
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.930
It's better translated as a purification offering.

536
00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:27.680
How does it operate the blood of the animal?

537
00:34:27.681 --> 00:34:30.200
The blood of the sacrifice is the key to the whole ritual.

538
00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:34.070
Remember that impurity and sin are often associated with death.

539
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:38.060
Holiness that which is holy is often associated with life.

540
00:34:38.061 --> 00:34:40.130
And if the two are antithetical,
then it makes sense.

541
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:43.010
If impurity is associated with death,
it makes sense that it's antipathy.

542
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:43.903
Antithesis.

543
00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:49.060
Holiness would be associated with life according to the priestly source blood,

544
00:34:49.281 --> 00:34:53.840
the blood that courses through one's veins represents the life force.

545
00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.070
Remember in the Noaa Hide Covenant in Genesis nine,
which is a priestly passage,

546
00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:59.840
the priestly blood prohibition,

547
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:05.150
you may not spill human blood and you may not eat animal flesh that has the

548
00:35:05.151 --> 00:35:09.020
lifeblood in it because the blood is the life and that belongs to God.

549
00:35:09.021 --> 00:35:12.740
That's wholly right.
So the life force is holy and the life forces in the blood.

550
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:15.260
Leviticus 17 verse 11 says this,

551
00:35:15.261 --> 00:35:19.820
it repeats the blood prohibition and then it offers a rationale for the life of

552
00:35:19.821 --> 00:35:21.320
the flesh is in the blood.

553
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:26.030
And I have assigned it to you for making expiation for your lives upon the

554
00:35:26.031 --> 00:35:29.690
altar.
I've assigned it to you to use in sacrificial practices.

555
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:34.730
It is the blood as life that affects expiation,
purging and atonement.

556
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:39.300
So the priestly texts couldn't be clearer.
Blood represents life.

557
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:43.620
The blood of sacrificial animals is assigned by God as a detergent,
if you will,

558
00:35:43.621 --> 00:35:48.621
to cleanse the sanctuary of the impurities that are caused by the sinful deeds

559
00:35:48.661 --> 00:35:49.620
of the Israelites.

560
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:54.480
Sacrifices at purge the sanctuary of ritual impurity and primarily the hot tub.

561
00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:58.710
Um,
always involve the manipulation of the animal's blood,

562
00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:03.390
dabbing it on the altar and on Yom Kippor actually entering the innermost shrine

563
00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:07.620
and sprinkling it on the throne of God and the footstool,
the Ark itself,

564
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.370
it symbolizes the victory of the forces of life,

565
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.670
of and holiness over death and impurity.

566
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.540
Other purified Tory rights that are listed in the Bible will sometimes involve

567
00:36:18.541 --> 00:36:21.960
the use of reddish substances as a kind of surrogate of blood.

568
00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:24.620
It's a widely,
um,

569
00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:29.810
and it is widely and mistakenly thought that the purification offering purifies

570
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:35.220
the sinner or the impurity bear or the offer.
This can't be true.

571
00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:36.770
The habitat,

572
00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:40.740
the purification offering doesn't rid a ritually impure person of their ritual.

573
00:36:40.741 --> 00:36:41.574
Impurity,

574
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:45.450
you can't even offer a sacrifice unless you're already ritually pure because you

575
00:36:45.451 --> 00:36:48.480
couldn't get in to the sanctuary to offer your sacrifice if you weren't ritually

576
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:52.650
pure.
You can't approach to offer a sacrifice if you're not in a state of ritual

577
00:36:52.651 --> 00:36:53.490
purity already.

578
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:59.090
So purification offerings are brought after the genital g discharge has,

579
00:36:59.361 --> 00:37:04.230
has healed and passed after the scale disease has healed and passed after the

580
00:37:04.231 --> 00:37:07.680
appropriate ablutions have been observed.
And the person is essentially pure,

581
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.710
but there's one more step they have to take before they're integrated back into

582
00:37:10.711 --> 00:37:11.544
the community.

583
00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:16.200
But cut tat also does not rate a sinner of their moral impurity because the

584
00:37:16.201 --> 00:37:20.160
offering is brought after the center has confessed after the sinner has
repented.

585
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:24.030
The purification offering acts on the sanctuary not on the offer.

586
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.350
It purges the sanctuary of the defilement that is symbolically.

587
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.640
It has symbolically suffered from the offers state of ritual,

588
00:37:32.641 --> 00:37:37.110
impurity or sinfulness.
Once the sanctuary is purged,

589
00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.770
the offer has settled his debt.
He's repaired the damage he caused.

590
00:37:40.771 --> 00:37:45.771
He's fully atoned at one again with God and God is no longer at repelled by the

591
00:37:46.621 --> 00:37:48.390
impurity that marred his sanctuary.

592
00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:54.180
The defiling effect of lesser transgressions is calibrated to the sinners

593
00:37:54.181 --> 00:37:57.780
intentionality and the presence or absence of repentance.

594
00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:01.600
So inadvertent sins can be purged.

595
00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:05.010
The this sanctuary defilement that they cause can be purged by bringing a

596
00:38:05.011 --> 00:38:08.490
purification sacrifice.
What about deliberate sins?

597
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.080
As long as there is repentance,

598
00:38:10.081 --> 00:38:14.160
the biblical text says then they are converted into inadvertent sins and they

599
00:38:14.161 --> 00:38:19.080
also can be purged or the impurity they cause can be purged with a purification

600
00:38:19.081 --> 00:38:23.130
sacrifice,
but brazen,
unrepentant sins,

601
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.000
unrepented sins or unintentional sins that are never realized.

602
00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:30.780
These stand on remedied and they defile the sanctuary.

603
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:36.110
So for this reason the sanctuary has to be regularly purged of the accumulated

604
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.180
defilements accruing to it.
As a result of such.

605
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:45.181
Since Leviticus 16 describes the annual ritual which is carried out on the day

606
00:38:47.021 --> 00:38:50.650
of Atonement or day of purgation,
it can be called Yom Kippor.

607
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:56.140
When a coup d'etat sacrifice of purification sacrifice is brought on behalf of

608
00:38:56.141 --> 00:39:00.880
the community to purify the sanctuary of the impurities that have been caused by

609
00:39:00.881 --> 00:39:05.881
Israel's sin and the high priest loads all of the sins and impurities of the

610
00:39:06.011 --> 00:39:07.660
Israelites on the head of a goat,

611
00:39:07.661 --> 00:39:11.680
which then carries them off into the wilderness away from the sanctuary.

612
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.670
Purification of the sanctuary was believed to be critical to the health and the

613
00:39:15.671 --> 00:39:19.690
wellbeing of the community.
If the sanctuary is not purged of impurity,

614
00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:24.250
it can become polluted to the point when God is driven out entirely.

615
00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:28.240
Jacob Milgrom has argued that there's a kind of archimedean principle at work

616
00:39:28.241 --> 00:39:28.990
here.

617
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:33.400
Every sin creates an impurity that encroaches upon the realm of holiness and

618
00:39:33.401 --> 00:39:35.440
displaces a certain amount of holiness,

619
00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:39.610
and eventually God will be completely displaced and the community will be left

620
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:43.270
in a godless state without blessing or protection.

621
00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:47.320
So Milgrom sees the symbolic function of the purity system.
This way,

622
00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:50.530
if the sanctuaries symbolizes the presence of God,

623
00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:54.190
and if impurity represents the wrongdoing of persons,

624
00:39:55.030 --> 00:40:00.030
then by saying that impurity is anathema to God and pollutes his temple,

625
00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:05.920
the priests are able to graphically convey the idea that sin forces God out of

626
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:07.780
his sanctuary and out of the community.

627
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:14.010
Jacob Milgrom sees a moral message at the base of this complex symbolic picture,

628
00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:20.160
and that is that human and humans and humans alone are responsible for the reign

629
00:40:20.381 --> 00:40:23.290
of wickedness and death or the reign of righteousness in life.

630
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:27.340
Human actions determine the degree to which God can dwell on earth among his

631
00:40:27.341 --> 00:40:28.174
people.

632
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.740
So the goal or the objective of the priestly construction or representation of

633
00:40:32.741 --> 00:40:37.741
Israel's impurity laws was in Milgram's view to sever impurity from the demonic

634
00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:42.760
and to reinterpret it as a symbolic system,

635
00:40:42.761 --> 00:40:46.840
reminding Israel of the divine imperative to reject sin,

636
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:51.010
to behave in ways that attract the presence of God and do not repel him.

637
00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:56.910
You also read an article by Milgrim where Milgrom talks about,
um,

638
00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:01.900
priestly cultic imagery serving as a kind of theodicy,
a theodicy of course,

639
00:41:01.901 --> 00:41:05.650
as a response to the problem of evil.
How can an all powerful,

640
00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:10.150
good God allow so much evil to exist and even go unpunished?

641
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:13.120
And according to Milgrom,
this is the priestly answer.

642
00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:18.550
Every sin pollutes the sanctuary.
It may not mark the sinner,

643
00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:22.240
but it does mark the sanctuary.
It scars the face of the sanctuary.

644
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:24.220
You may think you've gotten away with something,

645
00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.530
but every act of social exploitation,

646
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:31.570
every act of moral corruption pollutes the sanctuary more and more until such

647
00:41:31.571 --> 00:41:35.120
time as God is driven out and human society is,

648
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:39.410
is devoured by its own viciousness and death dealing.
So again,

649
00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:44.390
the ethical message here is that humans are in control of their destiny and they

650
00:41:44.391 --> 00:41:48.710
action of every individual affects and influences the fate of society.

651
00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:53.450
This is really the priestly version of an old biblical doctrine of doctrine,

652
00:41:53.451 --> 00:41:55.130
of collective responsibility.

653
00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:00.080
Sin Affects individual sin affects the entire fabric of society.

654
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:04.190
There's no such thing as an isolated evil.
Our deeds affect one another,

655
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:08.030
and when evil doers are finally punished,
they bring down others with them.

656
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:11.000
Those others,
however aren't.
So blameless Milgram's says,

657
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:14.720
because they allowed the wicked to flourish and contribute to the pollution of

658
00:42:14.721 --> 00:42:16.610
the sanctuary,
the corruption of society.

659
00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:22.060
So ps cultic imagery is informed according to Milgram by the same communal ethic

660
00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:25.400
that we will see running through the Bible.

661
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:30.050
Much of the Bible until a later period is simply conveying that ethic in its own

662
00:42:30.051 --> 00:42:33.470
modality.
Through the symbolism of the sanctuary and the cult.

663
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:37.670
The 11th chapter of Leviticus deals with the dietary laws.

664
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:39.830
We don't have time to go into them at any great length.

665
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:44.630
I will say that Milgrom has also argued that the dietary laws of Leviticus are

666
00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:48.650
similarly part of a symbol system that emphasizes life over death.

667
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.220
This is his file.
The following evidence that he cites.

668
00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.820
The mainstays of the dietary laws are these first the prohibition against eating

669
00:42:58.851 --> 00:43:03.470
animal blood from genesis nine,
um,
which symbolizes the life.

670
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:09.130
We also in Leviticus 11 meet dietary laws that are governed by criteria such as

671
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:13.550
cud chewing and having a split hoof.

672
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:16.910
You can only have eight animals that chew the Cud and have a split hoof.

673
00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:21.350
And those criteria seem arbitrary and meaningless in and of themselves.

674
00:43:21.351 --> 00:43:22.184
And he says they are.

675
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:26.780
But look at their practical effect that limits the number of animals that one

676
00:43:26.781 --> 00:43:30.710
can eat to a mere handful out of the hundreds upon hundreds of creatures on the

677
00:43:30.711 --> 00:43:35.120
earth.
That basically leaves you with my animal.
Husbandry is not good here,

678
00:43:35.121 --> 00:43:38.260
but it leaves you with a bovine and the Ovi classes I guess.
Oh,

679
00:43:38.261 --> 00:43:40.280
and our goats and,
and some such.

680
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:44.350
So it leaves you basically with goats and sheep and cattle.
Um,

681
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:49.930
some have hypothesized that whatever the origin of various food taboos in

682
00:43:51.171 --> 00:43:52.004
Israel,

683
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:56.930
the priestly techs have tried to create a dietary discipline that drives home

684
00:43:56.931 --> 00:44:01.931
the point that all life shared also by animals is inviolable except in the case

685
00:44:02.541 --> 00:44:02.961
of meat,

686
00:44:02.961 --> 00:44:07.310
which has been conceded by God and provided that the animals are slaughtered

687
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:10.370
properly,
painlessly,
uh,
and that their blood,

688
00:44:10.371 --> 00:44:14.060
which is symbolic of the life is not appropriated but returned to God.

689
00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:16.970
It's sacred source.
So perhaps as it stands,

690
00:44:16.971 --> 00:44:20.750
this system of dietary laws does in fact emphasize reverence for life,

691
00:44:20.751 --> 00:44:23.990
but they also serve another very important function.

692
00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:28.310
And that was the formation and maintenance of a differentiated ethnic identity.

693
00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:30.800
Or in priestly parlance,

694
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.980
the formation and maintenance of a holy people separated out from other nations

695
00:44:34.981 --> 00:44:37.080
by rules that marker as God's people,

696
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:42.480
it's surely significant that the dietary laws are followed by a powerful

697
00:44:42.481 --> 00:44:45.150
exhortation to be holy in imitation of God.

698
00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:50.150
Leviticus 1143 45.
So we've just had the prohibition of,

699
00:44:50.151 --> 00:44:54.930
of not eating certain kinds of small animals designated here as anything that's

700
00:44:54.931 --> 00:44:56.640
swarms.
And the tech says,

701
00:44:56.641 --> 00:45:00.090
you shall not draw Obama nation upon yourselves through anything that's swarms

702
00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:03.820
you shall not make yourselves in pure there with and that's become impure for I

703
00:45:03.821 --> 00:45:07.740
the Lord your God.
You shall sanctify yourselves and be holy.
For I am holy.

704
00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.920
You shall not make yourselves in pure through any swarming thing that moves upon

705
00:45:10.921 --> 00:45:14.460
the earth for I the Lord and he who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be

706
00:45:14.461 --> 00:45:18.450
your God.
You shall be holy for I am holy.
That how much this is emphasize,

707
00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:22.770
the dietary laws are presented by the priests,
not as a hygienic regimen.

708
00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.450
Who knows if that's how they started,

709
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:28.410
not as a sensible way to avoid various diseases that are caused by the lack of

710
00:45:28.411 --> 00:45:30.060
refrigeration in the desert.

711
00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:33.990
Whatever the actual origin of these various dietary to booze,

712
00:45:33.991 --> 00:45:38.910
they are here embedded in a larger ideological framework concerning the need for

713
00:45:38.911 --> 00:45:42.360
the Israelites to separate themselves and to be holy like their God.

714
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:47.460
The dietary laws are connected then with this theme of [inaudible] Day of

715
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:52.080
Imitation of God as God is holy,
separate and distinct,
so you shall be holy.

716
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:57.710
He just want to take too last minutes to quickly point to this theme of holiness

717
00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:03.000
that continues in the section I'm referred to as the holiness code cause this

718
00:46:03.001 --> 00:46:07.680
theme and the exportation you shall be holy for I the Lord your God am Holy.

719
00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:11.100
They find their fullest expression in the block of texts,

720
00:46:11.101 --> 00:46:15.030
Leviticus 17 through 26 that's referred to as the holiness code.

721
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:19.230
There's an important difference between Leviticus one through 16 and the

722
00:46:19.231 --> 00:46:20.100
holiness code.

723
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:24.750
According to Leviticus one through 16 Israel's priests are designated as holy,

724
00:46:24.751 --> 00:46:27.090
a holy class within Israel singled out,

725
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:31.230
dedicated to the service of God and demarcated by rules that apply only to them.

726
00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:36.660
Israelites may aspire to holiness,
but it's not assumed.
However,

727
00:46:36.661 --> 00:46:37.950
in the holiness code,

728
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:43.880
we have texts that come closer to the idea that Israel itself is wholly by

729
00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:48.270
virtue of the fact that God has set Israel apart from the nations to himself to

730
00:46:48.271 --> 00:46:49.050
belong to him.

731
00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:53.010
Just as he set apart the seventh day to himself to belong with him.

732
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:58.860
Holy things only exist because of safeguards.

733
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.220
Rules that keep them separate,
the demarcate them.

734
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:06.960
And these safeguards and rules are naturally addressed to human beings.

735
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:11.220
They are the ones charged with the task of preserving the holy in its residents

736
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.460
on earth.
So although holiness derives from God,

737
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:19.050
humans have a crucial role to play in sanctification and sanctifying the world.

738
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:22.620
That's illustrated in the case of the Sabbath.
God's sanctified the sabbath,

739
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:24.990
that creation,
he demarcated it as holy,

740
00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:29.890
but Israel is the one to affirm its holiness by observing the rules that make it

741
00:47:29.891 --> 00:47:31.840
different to that market office.
Holy.

742
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.680
So Israel doesn't just affect affirm the holy status of the Sabbath.

743
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:38.230
They actualize the holy status of the Sabbath.

744
00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.230
If Israel doesn't observe the prohibitions that distinguished the Sabbath of Sa

745
00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.100
as sacred,
it's automatically desecrated.

746
00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.860
You shall keep the Sabbath for it is holy for you.

747
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:51.130
He who pro feigns it shall be put to death.
Whoever does work on it,

748
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:54.370
that person is cut off from among his kin.
You automatically,

749
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:57.730
it is automatically desecrated and profaned if you don't observe its rules.

750
00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:01.780
So there are two components,
integral and inseparable,

751
00:48:01.781 --> 00:48:03.130
and the concept of holiness.

752
00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:08.110
Initial assignment of Holy Status by God and establishment of rules to preserve

753
00:48:08.111 --> 00:48:10.390
that holy status.
And secondly,

754
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:14.500
actualization of that holiness by humans through the observance of the

755
00:48:14.501 --> 00:48:17.290
commandments and rules that marks that thing off his holy.

756
00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:21.700
That's going to lead us very nicely into an understanding of the laws that mark

757
00:48:21.701 --> 00:48:25.750
off Israel's status and keep Israel distinct among the nations,

758
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.220
which we'll be looking at on Wednesday.

759
00:48:27.221 --> 00:48:30.010
So please take a look at the materials that were sent out,

760
00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:32.980
the ancient near eastern collections and some of the questions to guide you

761
00:48:32.981 --> 00:48:33.880
through this material.
