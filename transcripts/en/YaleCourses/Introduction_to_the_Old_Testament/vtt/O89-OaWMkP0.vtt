1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.390
So last time we had started discussing the historical merits of the Biblical

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.110
Stories of the Patriarchs and the matriarchs.

3
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:12.111
And these are contained in genesis 12 through 50 and scholarly opinion on this

4
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:16.020
matter is seriously divided.
Something you need to know.

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.180
Some scholars were point to internal biblical evidence for the authenticity and

6
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:24.270
the antiquity of the patriarchal stories.
So for example,

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.420
narco knock him Sarna argues that a representing Abraham and Isaac and Jacob as

8
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:34.170
foreigners and strangers in Canaan is hardly a convenient tradition for a people

9
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:38.250
who are seeking to establish their claim to uh,
to its homeland.

10
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.210
And if this myth of origins where the fabrication of a later writer then surely

11
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:46.760
they would have written the story in such a way as to give their ancestors,
uh,

12
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.310
a less tenuous hold or claim connection to the land.

13
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.700
He also notes that some of the material in the patriarchal stories would be

14
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:56.130
offensive to later religious sensibilities.

15
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.740
Jacob is married to two sisters simultaneously.

16
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:01.920
That is something that is explicitly forbidden in the book of Deuteronomy.

17
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.940
So why wouldn't a later right or have cleaned up this,
uh,

18
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.080
ancestral record,
uh,
if this were in fact something composed at a later period.

19
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.011
Also,

20
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:15.000
he notes that the representation of interethnic relationships in the patriarchal

21
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:19.050
stories,
um,
do not accord with the reality of a later period.

22
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.100
So for example,
the Arameans are considered close kin to the Israelites.

23
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:27.990
So wandering Arameans was my father.
It says,
uh,
and uh,

24
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.730
spouses are always chosen.

25
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.630
Daughters for sons are always chosen by going back to the Armenian people and

26
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:38.070
choosing someone,
some close kin,
but in the period of the monarchy,
right?

27
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:42.270
So that's going to be after 1000 in the period of the monarchy.
Um,

28
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.080
there were very poor relations with the Armenians.
They were bitter enemies.

29
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.040
So why,

30
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.540
according to scholars like Sarna would a biblical author from that period

31
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:56.541
portray the Arameans as close kin unless they had some older tradition

32
00:01:56.701 --> 00:01:59.220
established tradition that reflected that fact.

33
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.970
So Sarna and other scholars hold that the patriarchal traditions are not

34
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:07.590
entirely fabricated.
Retro ejections from a later period.

35
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.780
They contain authentic memories of an earlier historic situation.

36
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.650
The patriarchs,
it's maintained.
We're semi nomads.

37
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.600
They lived in tents from time to time.

38
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:22.830
They wander to Egypt or Mesopotamia often in search of pasture for their animals

39
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.930
and various details of their language,
their customs,
their laws,
their religion.

40
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.730
It's argued seem to fit well into the period of the late bronze age of giving

41
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:36.240
you three.
I'm giving you the,
the periods at the top of the chart.

42
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.260
Early Bronze Age,

43
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.290
Middle Bronze Age from about 2100 to 1550 we date the late bronze age from about

44
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:47.520
1550 until 1200 the introduction of iron and the beginning of the Iron Age in

45
00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:51.540
1200 prior to that,
the Bronze Age,
which is divided into these three periods,

46
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.190
so that's on the one hand scholars who see these stories as reflecting

47
00:02:56.191 --> 00:02:58.890
historical memories and having a certain authenticity to them.

48
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.360
Then on the other hand,
at the other extreme,

49
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.290
you have scholars who see the patriarchal stories is entirely fabricated,

50
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:10.240
retro ejections of a much later age and they varied significantly as to when

51
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:13.600
they think these stories were written anywhere from the period of a monarchy all

52
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:15.580
the way down to the fourth century.

53
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:20.581
Some of them works published in the 1970s by authors like Thomas Thompson,

54
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.371
John Mann,

55
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:26.371
cedars take the position that these stories are filled with anachronisms.

56
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:28.450
There chronologies are confused.

57
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.640
These anachronisms and confused chronologies in the patriarchal stories are the

58
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:36.250
rule rather than the exception in their view.

59
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.700
And they are evidence of a very late date of composition.

60
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.110
So you have these two extremes based on the internal evidence of the Bible

61
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:44.944
itself,

62
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.870
but you also have the same two extreme positions reflected in the discipline of

63
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:52.750
archeology.
In the early days,
uh,

64
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:57.751
archeology of the region tended toward credulity and it was explicitly referred

65
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:03.580
to as biblical archeology and interesting name because it suggests that the

66
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:07.720
archeologists were out there searching for evidence that would verify the

67
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:10.770
details of the biblical text.
We're doing biblical archaeology,
archaeology,

68
00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:14.320
and support of,
of the biblical text.
I mentioned last time,

69
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:17.230
William f all bright and American archeologist.

70
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.280
He believed strongly that archeological findings were important external

71
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:25.270
evidence for the basic historicity and authenticity of,
for example,

72
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:26.740
the patriarchal stories.

73
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.210
And certainly some archeological findings were quite remarkable.
Um,

74
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.770
scholars of the Albright School pointed to texts and clay tablets that were

75
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:38.830
discovered in second millennium sites.
So you see it on the bottom,

76
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.940
second millennium,
BC obviously going down to 1001st millennium,

77
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:44.890
1000 to zero.

78
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:47.740
And the second millennium really wasn't longer than the first millennium is just

79
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:49.090
that I ran out of board.

80
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.470
But specifically cites like newsy and Mari,

81
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.290
I've placed them in their approximate places on the timeline.

82
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.310
New Zealand Maori were sites that are near the area that's identified in the

83
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:04.720
Bible as being the ancestral home of the Patriarchs and Mesopotamia or on the

84
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.010
highway from there to Canaan.

85
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.720
And these texts and clay tablets were believed to aluminate many biblical

86
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:14.180
customs in institutions.
So in the newsy techs,

87
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.270
which are from about the middle of the second millennium,

88
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.110
we learned that the custom of adoption for purposes of inheritance,

89
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.480
particularly the adoption of a slave in the absence of offspring and biblical

90
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:27.100
scholars got very excited about this.

91
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:31.810
They point to the biblical passage in which Abraham expresses to God his fear

92
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:33.070
that his servant Eliezer,

93
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.020
we'll have to be the one to inherit God's promised because Abraham has no a son.

94
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.160
Also,
according to the new z texts,
if a wife is barren,

95
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.330
she is to provide a maid servant as a substitute to bear her husband's children.

96
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.900
And this is something that happens with three out of the four matriarchs who are

97
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.190
afflicted with infertility,
Sarah,
Rachel and Leah.

98
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.450
There are other parallels in family and marriage law that correlate with certain

99
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:03.710
biblical details.
And the 18th century,
the texts from Mari,

100
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.980
they contain names that correspond to Israelite names.

101
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.090
Benjamin,
Laban,
Ishmael.
So Biblical scholars,
uh,

102
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.110
Boyd up by these correlations between the archeological finds,

103
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:21.860
the texts found by archeologists and Biblical stories asserted that the

104
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:26.861
Patriarchs were real persons and their customs and their legal practices and

105
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:30.770
their social institutions could be verified against the backdrop of second

106
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:34.880
millennium of the second Millennium as revealed by archeological findings.

107
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.493
However,

108
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.720
it's been argued that some of these ancient sources have been misread or

109
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:46.040
misinterpreted in an effort to find parallels with biblical institutions.

110
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:49.670
A lot of gap filling is going on to make these texts look as though they

111
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:54.671
correspond to biblical institutions and skeptics like Thomas Thompson and John

112
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.790
Van Cedar's.

113
00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.790
Point out that many of the biblical customs which are paralleled in ancient near

114
00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:05.060
eastern sources were still alive and well down in the first millennium.

115
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.400
So references to these customs and the patriarchal stories really doesn't tell

116
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:14.150
us anything about dating they could derive from anywhere in the second or first

117
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:16.580
millennium.
And for other reasons,

118
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:21.050
they think it is much more reasonable to date the composition of these stories

119
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:26.030
to the first millennium in some cases quite late first millennium.
Furthermore,

120
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:26.990
over time,

121
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.700
many discrepancies between the archaeological record and the biblical text

122
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:36.701
became apparent and increasingly practitioners of what was now being termed

123
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.860
Palestinian archeology or ancient near eastern archeology or archaeology of the

124
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:45.380
Lavant rather than biblical archeology.

125
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:50.090
Some of these archeologists grew disinterested in pointing out the correlations

126
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:54.440
between the archeological data and the biblical stories are trying to explain

127
00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:57.560
away any discrepancies in order to keep the biblical texts intact.

128
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.210
And they began to focus on the best possible reconstruction of the history of

129
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:05.210
the region on the basis of the archaeological evidence,

130
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.720
regardless of whether or not those results would confirm the biblical texts,

131
00:08:09.721 --> 00:08:10.730
the biblical account,

132
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.650
and in fact this reconstruction often does contradict biblical claims.

133
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.900
We're going to see this quite clearly,
um,

134
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.560
in a few weeks when we consider the book of Joshua and it story of Israel's

135
00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:23.720
lightening invasion of the land of Canaan,

136
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.730
the archeological record just doesn't support such a such a story still,

137
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.030
uh,

138
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:34.030
many people have clung to the idea of the Bible as a historically accurate

139
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.060
document.
Many times out of ideological necessity.

140
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.620
Many fear that if the historical information in the Bible isn't true,

141
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:47.660
then the Bible is unreliable as a source of religious instruction or
inspiration.

142
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.820
And that's something they don't want to give up.

143
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:55.930
And this is all really a very unfortunate and heavy burden to place on this

144
00:08:56.851 --> 00:09:00.330
fascinating little library of writings from late antiquity.

145
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:06.150
People who equate truth with historical fact will certainly end up viewing the

146
00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:11.151
Bible dismissively as a naive and unsophisticated web of lies since it is

147
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:14.340
replete with elements that cannot be literally true.

148
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.020
But to view it this way is to make a genre mistake.

149
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:25.100
Shakespeare's hamlet while set in Denmark and actual place is not historical

150
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:27.270
fact,

151
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.560
but that doesn't make it a naive and unsophisticated web of lies because we

152
00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:36.561
accept when we read or watch hamlet that it is not a work of historiography or

153
00:09:37.471 --> 00:09:39.300
work of writing about history.

154
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:44.690
It is a work of literature and in deference to that genre and it's conventions

155
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:49.950
we know and accept that the truth it conveys are not those of historical fact,

156
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.180
but our social,
political,
ethical,
existential truths.

157
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.770
And the Bible deserves at least the same courteous attention to its genre.

158
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:04.140
The Bible doesn't pretend to be and it shouldn't be read as what we would call

159
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.810
objective history.
And then to see the scare quotes,

160
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:09.930
you should be looking up there.
So you see the scare quotes,
objective history,

161
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:14.760
in other words,
perhaps a bear narration of events.
Um,
to be sure,

162
00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:18.600
we do find that some events that are mentioned in the biblical texts correlate

163
00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:23.070
to events that we know of from sources outside the Bible.
So for example,
Faro,

164
00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:26.130
she shacks,
invasion of Palestine,
and nine 24.

165
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.330
This is mentioned in the biblical text.
It's mentioned in the Egyptian sources.

166
00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:31.500
There's a nice correlation,

167
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.530
the destruction of the northern Kingdom of Israel and seven 22,
um,

168
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.080
the capture of Jerusalem and five 97 the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem

169
00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:41.100
and five 86.

170
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:45.030
These are all recorded in the biblical text and they are in a Syrian and

171
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:46.650
Babylonian records as well,

172
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:51.390
as well as other events from the period of the monarchy.
So as a result,

173
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:52.950
because of these correlations,

174
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.980
many scholars are willing to accept the general biblical chronology of the

175
00:10:58.111 --> 00:11:01.020
period from the monarchy on deciding about a thousand on.

176
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:04.980
They accept that general chronology,
the sequence of kings and battles and so on.

177
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.380
But ultimately it is a mistake,
I think,
to read the Bible as a historical record.

178
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:11.790
The Bible is literature.

179
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:16.940
It's composition is influenced and determined by literary conventions and goals.

180
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.310
Now,
of course we all know that there is no such thing as purely objective,

181
00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:25.590
purely objective history anyway.

182
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.640
We have no direct access to past events.

183
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.670
We only ever have mediated access in material archaeological remains that yield

184
00:11:36.271 --> 00:11:40.980
information to us only after a process of interpretation or in texts that are

185
00:11:40.981 --> 00:11:44.640
themselves already an interpretation of events and must still be interpreted by

186
00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:45.474
us.

187
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:50.780
The biblical narrative is an interpretation of events that were held by

188
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:56.530
century's long tradition to be meaningful in the life of the people and to the

189
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:57.640
biblical narrators.

190
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:02.790
These events known perhaps from ancient oral traditions pointed to a divine

191
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:08.460
purpose and the narrative is told to illustrate that basic proposition.

192
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.840
The biblical narrators are not trying to write history as a modern historian

193
00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:15.790
might try to do write history.

194
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.800
They are concerned to show us what they believe to be the finger of God in the

195
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:23.050
events and experiences of the Israelite people.

196
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.960
A one scholar Mark Brittler whose name I've also put up here.
Um,

197
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.220
mark rettler notes that in the Bible,

198
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:35.080
the past is refracted through a theological lens,
if not a partisan political,

199
00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:39.280
ideological lens.
But then all ancient historical narrative is written that way.

200
00:12:39.281 --> 00:12:43.480
And one could argue all contemporary historical narrative is written that way.

201
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.250
With due caution,
we can still learn things from texts,
ancient and modern.

202
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.000
We can still learn things about Israel's history from the biblical sources.

203
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.080
Just as classical historians have learned a great deal about classical history,

204
00:12:56.081 --> 00:12:56.950
Greece and Rome,

205
00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.520
despite or through the tendentious partisan and ideologically motivated writings

206
00:13:02.801 --> 00:13:04.360
of classical writers.

207
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.040
So our discussion of the patriarchal stories is going to bear all of these

208
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:10.300
considerations in mind.

209
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.600
We're not going to be asking whether these stories are historically accurate.

210
00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:15.070
I'm going to assume they are not.

211
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.240
And once we rid ourselves of the burden of historicity,

212
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.380
we're free to appreciate the stories for what they are.
Powerful,

213
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:27.430
powerful narratives that must be read against the literary conventions of their

214
00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:32.080
time and whose truths are social,
political,
moral,

215
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.040
and existential.

216
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.780
So what are these truths will begin to answer this question,

217
00:13:37.781 --> 00:13:39.310
begin to answer this question.

218
00:13:39.311 --> 00:13:42.460
You'll spend the rest of your life finishing the process of answering this

219
00:13:42.461 --> 00:13:43.240
question,

220
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.470
but we'll begin by identifying some by no means all of the major themes of

221
00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:51.040
genesis 12 through 50 and we're going to begin with a story of [inaudible] rock

222
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:51.880
and his family.

223
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:57.220
This is a story that's marked by the themes of divine command and divine
promise.

224
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:02.880
Now,
the biblical writer represents the emigration of Terex son,

225
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.110
a brother whose name will be changed to Abraham.

226
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.360
So sometimes I'll say one and sometimes the other,

227
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:11.320
but they represent his immigration as divinely commanded.

228
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.460
It's the first step in a journey that will lead ultimately to the formation of a

229
00:14:15.461 --> 00:14:19.390
nation in covenant with God.
And first we meet our cast of characters.

230
00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:24.391
This is in genesis 11 versus 27 on through chapter 12 verse three.

231
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.930
Now these are the generations of Tara [inaudible],

232
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.810
Abraham Nahor and Haran and Heran.

233
00:14:31.811 --> 00:14:35.170
We got lot and her Ron died in the presence of his father,

234
00:14:35.171 --> 00:14:40.030
Tay Rock in the land of his birth in or of the deans and Abraham and the whore

235
00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.350
took them wives,
the name of Abram's wife.
With Sarah,

236
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.880
we will become Sara and the name of for his wife Milkah and Sarah was barren.

237
00:14:48.881 --> 00:14:52.990
She had no child.
Tareq took Abraham,
his son and lot the son of Heran,

238
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.300
his grandson and Sarah,
his daughter in law,
his son,

239
00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:58.490
Abram's wife getting confused yet.

240
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.360
And they went forth together from the or from or of the Kelty ins to go into the

241
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:04.790
land of Canaan.
But when they came to her,
Ron,

242
00:15:04.791 --> 00:15:09.530
they settled there in the days of Terah were 205 years than t rock died in
Haran.

243
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:11.450
And now the Lord said to Abraham,

244
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:16.310
go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I

245
00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:17.144
will show you.

246
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.500
I will make of you a great nation and I will bless you and make your name great

247
00:15:21.501 --> 00:15:22.850
so that you will be a blessing.

248
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.690
I will bless those who bless you and him who curses you.
I will curse.

249
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.830
And by all by you all the families of the earth shall bless themselves.

250
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:36.340
So Abraham is commanded to go forth from his home and family to a location to be

251
00:15:36.951 --> 00:15:41.390
named later.
Alright,
a location that remains for now unspecified,

252
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:45.320
and this is a fact that it's caused commentators for centuries to praise him for

253
00:15:45.321 --> 00:15:47.720
his faith,
and that is a virtue.

254
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.020
Faith is a virtue that is connected or associated with Abraham,

255
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:55.160
Abraham in other biblical context and also in later religious tradition.

256
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:59.420
He is seen as the paradigm,
the paradigmatic exemplar of a man of faith.

257
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.320
The command is coupled with a promise.
I will make a view.

258
00:16:03.321 --> 00:16:05.420
God says a great nation and I will bless you,

259
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:09.410
but we have just learned in chapter 11 that Sarah is barren.

260
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.600
It was a seemingly irrelevant detail.
Who's import is suddenly clear.

261
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:19.970
How clever of the narrator to plant the information.

262
00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:24.971
We need to realize that Abraham has to take God's word on faith and how

263
00:16:24.981 --> 00:16:29.810
perfectly the narrator's sets up the dramatic tension and the great confusion

264
00:16:29.811 --> 00:16:34.670
that is going to run through the next several chapters because Abraham doesn't

265
00:16:34.671 --> 00:16:38.690
seem to understand that the progeny will come from Sarah and you have to read

266
00:16:38.691 --> 00:16:40.640
these stories as if you're reading them for the first time.

267
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.830
You have the great disadvantage of knowing the ending.

268
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:44.840
It's a terrible disadvantage.

269
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.870
You have to discipline yourself to read these stories as if you don't know

270
00:16:47.871 --> 00:16:48.710
what's coming next.

271
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.850
And put yourself in the position of the character evens just been told he's

272
00:16:52.851 --> 00:16:57.230
going to be the father of great nations and he has a barren wife.
Right?

273
00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.630
Why should he think?

274
00:16:59.631 --> 00:17:02.700
He doesn't seem to understand that the project he's going to come from Sarah,

275
00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:07.370
and why should he think that it would?
God wasn't specific.
He simply says,

276
00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:10.640
I shall make a view a great nation.
He says nothing of Sarah.
And after all,

277
00:17:10.641 --> 00:17:11.474
she's barren.

278
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.530
So Abrah may be forgiven for thinking that perhaps some other mate awaits him.

279
00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:19.340
And so he surrenders her easily to other men,
to Pharaoh of Egypt.

280
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:22.280
Immediately following this scene in the next chapter in chapter,
um,

281
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.520
this scene in chapter 11,
immediately after that in Egypt,
he surrenders her,

282
00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:30.170
he willingly accept Sarah's offer of a handmaid,
Hagar to bear a child,

283
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.450
Ishmael in Sarah's place.

284
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.780
How cleverly the narrator leads us with Avram to pin our hopes on your smile as

285
00:17:37.821 --> 00:17:39.110
the child of the promise.

286
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.980
And how cleverly is the carpet pulled out from under our feet?

287
00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:47.981
In genesis 17 when God finally perhaps impatiently talk specifics.

288
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.110
No,

289
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:53.640
I meant that you would father a great nation through Sarah and Abraham as he is

290
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:55.830
now called is incredulous.

291
00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.980
She's past the age of bearing Lord and he laughs and God is silent and in that

292
00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:05.820
silence I always imagined that this light goes on this click,

293
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:09.240
this awful sickening light,
and Abraham says,
oh,

294
00:18:09.241 --> 00:18:13.050
that Ishmael might live in your site or something like that.

295
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:16.080
I think I probably misquoted,
oh,
that Ishmael might live by your favor.
Sorry,

296
00:18:16.081 --> 00:18:19.080
that's the actual words.
But God is determined.

297
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.580
Sarah will bear Isaac and with him,
God will make an everlasting covenant.

298
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:28.970
All of this drama through the first five chapters made possible by a seemingly

299
00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:33.990
irrelevant line and 1130 sort of throw away datum and a family list that one

300
00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:37.020
might gloss over and Sarah was barren.
She had no child.

301
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.290
And that's the power and beauty of biblical narrative and you have to get

302
00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:42.900
yourself into the mindset to read it that way.

303
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:49.130
A few verses later when Abraham and his wife Sarah and his nephew lot and those

304
00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:54.240
traveling with them all reach Canaan,
God makes an additional promise.

305
00:18:54.241 --> 00:18:58.020
He says in verse seven I will assign this land to your offspring.

306
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.720
So in just a few short verses,
right,

307
00:19:00.721 --> 00:19:04.980
we've just gone from 12 and just gone seven versus now into chapter 12 in just a

308
00:19:04.981 --> 00:19:05.970
few short verses,

309
00:19:05.971 --> 00:19:10.380
the writer has established the threefold promise that underpins the biblical

310
00:19:10.381 --> 00:19:15.381
drama that's about to unfold the promise of progeny of blessing and of land,

311
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.250
and that establishes a narrative tension for the stories of the patriarch,

312
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.600
but also for the story of the nation of Israel in subsequent books,

313
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.270
because in the patriarchal stories,

314
00:19:27.271 --> 00:19:31.110
there is this suspenseful vacillation between episodes that threatened to

315
00:19:31.111 --> 00:19:35.130
extinguish God's promise and episodes that reaffirm them.

316
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:40.050
Israelite matriarchs seem to be a singularly in fertile group.

317
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.650
The lines of inheritance defy our expectations.

318
00:19:43.651 --> 00:19:45.090
It doesn't seem to go to the person.

319
00:19:45.091 --> 00:19:49.500
We think that it's going to go to the process by which the promise is fulfilled,

320
00:19:49.501 --> 00:19:51.810
his halting and torturous at times.

321
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:56.700
We're going to look at one example of an episode in which the promise is

322
00:19:56.701 --> 00:19:59.790
affirmed and uh,
or confirmed,

323
00:19:59.791 --> 00:20:04.500
reaffirmed and an example of an episode in which the promises supremely

324
00:20:04.501 --> 00:20:08.430
threatened.
In Genesis 15,

325
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:13.230
God's promise to Abraham is formalized in a ritual ceremony.

326
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.780
God and Abraham are said to cut a covenant.

327
00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:17.700
That's the verb that's used in making a covenant.

328
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.440
And Covenant is Essential Biblical concept.
The Hebrew word for covenant,

329
00:20:22.441 --> 00:20:26.760
which I've written over here is breached means vow,
promise,

330
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:31.820
perhaps contract agreement or packed parallels to the biblical covenant have

331
00:20:33.421 --> 00:20:38.010
been pointed out by many ancient near eastern historians and scholars.
Um,

332
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:39.960
we have in our ancient near eastern texts,

333
00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:43.350
and we'll come back to these in more detail when we get into exodus,

334
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.810
but we have in our ancient near eastern texts,
two types,

335
00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:50.620
two main types of Covenant Suzerainty Covenant and a parity covenant.

336
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:54.850
As you can imagine from the name as suzerainty covenant is the Covenant in which

337
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:59.851
was Superior Party as Susan dictates the terms of a political treaty usually,

338
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.340
um,
and in a farrier party obeys them.

339
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.230
And the arrangement primarily serves the interests of the Susan.
Right.

340
00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:12.010
And not not the vassal or the subject.
In a parity covenant,

341
00:21:12.011 --> 00:21:16.900
you have really two equal parties who both agree to observe the provisions of

342
00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:17.890
some kind of treaty.

343
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:22.120
Now there are four major covenants in the Hebrew Bible.

344
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.620
They're initiated by yeah,

345
00:21:23.621 --> 00:21:27.670
way as expressions of divine favor and graciousness.

346
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.850
And two of these appear in Genesis.
We've already seen one,

347
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.740
the Noaa Hide Covenant and the Abrahamic Covenant,
which we're looking at now.

348
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:41.270
Now the Noaa Hide Covenant in Genesis nine verses one through 17 is universal in

349
00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:44.590
scope that encompasses all life on earth.

350
00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.280
It stresses the sanctity of life.
And in this covenant,

351
00:21:48.281 --> 00:21:51.220
God promises never to destroy all life.
Again.

352
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.560
By contrast,

353
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.520
the Abrahamic Covenant is a covenant with a single individual.

354
00:21:57.521 --> 00:22:01.510
So we've gone from a covenant with all of humanity to a covenant with a single

355
00:22:01.511 --> 00:22:02.344
individual,

356
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.430
and it looks very much like in ancient near eastern suzerainty covenant.

357
00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:10.870
God appears as a Susan.
He's making a land grant to a favorite subject,

358
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:13.570
which is very often how these work.
And,
uh,

359
00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:18.100
there's an ancient ritual that ratifies the oath.
Um,
in general,

360
00:22:18.101 --> 00:22:20.290
a suzerainty in,
in this kind of covenant.

361
00:22:20.291 --> 00:22:25.291
The parties to the oath would pass between the split carcass of a sacrificial

362
00:22:26.231 --> 00:22:29.620
animal as if to say that they agree they will suffer the same fate as this

363
00:22:29.621 --> 00:22:31.570
animal if they violate the covenant.

364
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:37.220
So in Genesis 15 Abraham cuts sacrificial animals and to and God,

365
00:22:37.331 --> 00:22:40.240
but only God passes between the two halves.

366
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:46.120
The striking thing about the Abrahamic covenant is it's unilateral character

367
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:47.351
only.

368
00:22:47.351 --> 00:22:52.351
God seems to be obligated by the covenant obligated to fulfill the promise that

369
00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:56.740
he's made.
Abraham doesn't appear to have any obligation in return,

370
00:22:57.490 --> 00:22:59.350
and so in this case,
it is the subject,

371
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:04.380
Abraham and not the Susan God who is benefited by this covenant.

372
00:23:04.481 --> 00:23:07.420
That's a complete reversal of our expectation.

373
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.430
Note also that the biblical writer goes out of his way to provide a moral

374
00:23:12.431 --> 00:23:16.300
justification for this grant of land to Israel.

375
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:21.100
In the biblical writers view,
God is the owner of the land,

376
00:23:21.101 --> 00:23:26.101
and so he is empowered to set conditions or residency requirements for those who

377
00:23:27.311 --> 00:23:28.990
would reside in it like a landlord.

378
00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:32.200
The current inhabitants of the land are polluting it,

379
00:23:32.201 --> 00:23:34.750
filling it with bloodshed and idolatry,

380
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:38.560
and when the land becomes so polluted,
completely polluted,

381
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:43.630
it will spew out its inhabitants.
That process,
God says,
isn't complete,

382
00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:46.400
so Israel is going to have to wait,
right?
The least isn't up yet,

383
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.960
and the Israelites will have to wait.

384
00:23:47.961 --> 00:23:52.100
He says in Genesis 15 verse 16 the Iniquity of the Amorites will not be

385
00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:56.840
fulfilled until then.
So here and in other places in the Bible,

386
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.510
it's clear that God's Israel,

387
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:04.690
God's covenant with Israel is not due to any special merit of the Israelites or

388
00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:08.600
favoritism.
This is actually said explicitly in Deuteronomy.
Rather,

389
00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:12.710
God is seeking replacement tenants who are going to follow the moral rules of

390
00:24:12.711 --> 00:24:15.380
residents that he has established for his land.

391
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.150
Genesis 17 seems to be a second version of the same covenant.

392
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:24.770
This time of scholars attributed to p,
the priestly writer,
the piece source,

393
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.340
and there are some notable differences emphasizing themes that were important to

394
00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:29.300
the priestly writer.

395
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:34.930
So God adds to the promises in genesis 17 that align of kings will come forth

396
00:24:35.871 --> 00:24:40.871
from Abraham and then that Abraham and his male descendants be circumcised as a

397
00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:45.470
perpetual sign of the covenant.
So here there is some obligation for Abraham.

398
00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:50.540
Thus shall my covenant be marked in your flesh as an everlasting packed.

399
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:55.010
Failure to circumcise is tantamount to breaking the covenant according to the

400
00:24:55.011 --> 00:24:59.390
text.
Now,
circumcision is known in many of the cultures of the ancient near east.

401
00:24:59.391 --> 00:25:03.840
It's generally a rite of passage that was performed at the time of puberty,
um,

402
00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.950
rather than a ritual that was performed at birth eight days after birth.

403
00:25:06.951 --> 00:25:11.660
So that's unusual and the Israelite context to have it occur with infants.
Um,

404
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:16.900
but as is the case with so many biblical rituals or institutions or laws,

405
00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:20.900
whatever their original meaning or significance in the ancient world,

406
00:25:20.901 --> 00:25:25.890
whether this was originally a puberty rite or fertility,
right of some kind,
um,

407
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:30.530
the ritual has been suffused with a new meaning in our texts.

408
00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:33.530
And so circumcision is here infused with a new meaning.

409
00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:37.550
It becomes a sign of God's eternal covenant with Abraham and his seed.

410
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.760
So these texts are typical of affirmations of God's promise,
but despite them,

411
00:25:43.761 --> 00:25:48.260
the patriarchal episodes or stories are peppered with episodes in which the

412
00:25:48.261 --> 00:25:52.730
realization of the promise and blessing is threatened.
In Chapter 12,

413
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.930
Avram surrenders his wife,
Sarah,

414
00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.270
to Pharaoh in order to advance his position among the Egyptians plausibly not

415
00:25:59.271 --> 00:26:03.470
knowing that it is Sarah who was supposed to bear the child of God's promises.

416
00:26:03.471 --> 00:26:07.160
I said,
that's left unclear until chapter 17,
when God says,
no,
no,
no,

417
00:26:07.161 --> 00:26:10.820
you misunderstood.
I met Sarah.
God intervenes,
however,

418
00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:15.290
and returns Sarah to Abraham.
Sarah is barren.

419
00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:19.040
State really casts a shadow over the promise from the very beginning of the

420
00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:22.250
story of Abraham and Sarah.
Desperate,

421
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:26.720
Sarah takes advantage of the custom that is a tested in the ancient world of

422
00:26:26.721 --> 00:26:31.400
giving her Egyptian handmaid,
Hagar,
to Abraham to bear a child in her stead.

423
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.810
But Hagar Apparently Lourdes this over her mistress and,

424
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:40.130
and embittered Sarah forces her from the house.
Hagar and her child is my smile.

425
00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:44.340
Cry Out to God in the wilderness.
And God assures Hagar that Ishmael,

426
00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:47.990
who is regarded by Muslims is the ancestor of the Arabs.
And uh,

427
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.960
the inheritor of the blessing and the promise addition,

428
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.070
my El shall become a great nation too.

429
00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.870
But really the greatest threat to the promise comes from God himself.

430
00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.090
And that is in genesis 22,

431
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:05.250
when God tests Abraham with the most horrible of demands,

432
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.040
the child of the promise,
Isaac,

433
00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:12.360
who's born miraculously to Sarah when she was no longer of child bearing age,

434
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.260
is to be sacrificed to God by Abraham's own hand.

435
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:21.090
And the story of the binding of Isaac is one of the most powerful,

436
00:27:21.091 --> 00:27:24.360
most riveting stories,
not only in the Bible,

437
00:27:24.361 --> 00:27:26.550
but some have claimed in all of world literature.

438
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:32.270
The story is a marvelous examplar exemplar of the biblical narrator's literary

439
00:27:33.241 --> 00:27:34.890
skill and artistry.

440
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:39.150
This week's assigned reading includes selections from Robert Alters Book.

441
00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.500
The Art of Biblical narrative,

442
00:27:40.501 --> 00:27:43.200
which I heartily recommend to read in its entirety.

443
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:48.830
Alter describes the extreme economy of Biblical narrative economy in the

444
00:27:49.141 --> 00:27:52.620
description of physical settings and character,
as well as speech.

445
00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:57.840
Rarely does their narrator comment on or explain a character's actions or

446
00:27:57.841 --> 00:28:01.980
thoughts or motives.
There's only the barest minimum of dialogue.

447
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:06.180
And on the few occasions that the Bible will violate this principle of verbally

448
00:28:06.181 --> 00:28:09.960
economy.
For example,
if two characters converse at length,

449
00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.170
you can be sure it's significant.
You want to pay extra attention,

450
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.270
the biblical narratives,

451
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.320
concealing of details and the motives of the characters,

452
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:24.470
God and Abraham and Isaac leads to ambiguity and the possibility of very many

453
00:28:25.741 --> 00:28:30.270
interpretations.
And that is a striking characteristic of biblical prose.

454
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:35.340
It's suppression of detail.
It's terse,
laconic style that makes the little,

455
00:28:35.341 --> 00:28:37.500
that is given so powerful.

456
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.570
So fraught with background to use the phrase of Erich Auerbach,
uh,

457
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.610
whose article you are also to read this week.

458
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:49.680
Auerbach contrasts the literary style of homer with the biblical writers style,

459
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.010
specifically in connection with the story of genesis 22,

460
00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:57.780
the ambiguities and the indeterminacy of the story.

461
00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:01.170
Make it one of the most interpreted texts of all time.

462
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:03.810
Why is God testing Abraham?

463
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.230
Does God really desire such a sacrifice?

464
00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:12.150
What is Abraham thinking and feeling as he walks for three days,

465
00:29:12.151 --> 00:29:17.151
already walks with his son and bearing the wood and the fire for the sacrifice.

466
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:22.650
Does he fully intend to obey this command to and the covenantal promise with his

467
00:29:22.651 --> 00:29:23.484
own hand,

468
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.780
or does he trust in God to intervene or is this a paradox of faith?

469
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:32.880
Does Abraham intend faithfully to obey all the while trusting faithfully that

470
00:29:32.881 --> 00:29:36.810
God's promised will nevertheless be fulfilled?
What's Isaac thinking?

471
00:29:36.811 --> 00:29:39.540
Does he understand what is happening?
How old is he?

472
00:29:39.541 --> 00:29:43.120
Is this a little boy or a grown man?
Is He prepared to obey?

473
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.730
He sees the wood and the Firestone in his father's hand.
Clearly a sacrifice.

474
00:29:47.731 --> 00:29:51.370
His plant,
he's got three days to figure that out.
He asks his father,

475
00:29:51.371 --> 00:29:55.060
where is the sheep for the burnt offering?
Does he know the answer?

476
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.290
Even as he asks,

477
00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.150
does a here the double entendre and his father's very simple and solemn reply,

478
00:30:01.151 --> 00:30:03.460
which in the unpunctuated Hebrew might be red?

479
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:07.000
The Lord will provide the sheep for the offering.
My son,

480
00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.280
does he struggle when he's bound?
Does he acquiesce?

481
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.880
The beauty of the narrative is it's sheer economy.

482
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:21.580
It offers so little that we as readers are forced to imagine the innumerable

483
00:30:21.581 --> 00:30:22.510
possibilities.

484
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:26.890
We play out the drama in countless ways with an Abraham who is reluctant and an

485
00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:31.570
Isaac was ignorant or an Abraham who's eager to serve his God to the point of

486
00:30:31.571 --> 00:30:35.980
sacrificing his own son and an Isaac who willingly bares his neck to the knife.

487
00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.610
Read the story one verse,
one phrase,
one word at a time.

488
00:30:39.611 --> 00:30:44.020
There were so few words that you can be sure that they were chosen with care.

489
00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:48.940
You'll be looking at genesis 22 closely in your section discussions and as you

490
00:30:48.941 --> 00:30:52.180
read the story,
remember it's larger context.

491
00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:56.710
God's promise to make Abraham the father of a great people through his son
Isaac.

492
00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:00.760
It's in this context,
it's this context,

493
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.570
this promise that gives the story.
It's special power and Pathos,

494
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.890
but of course the story can be contextualized in a number of different ways.

495
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.271
For example,

496
00:31:10.271 --> 00:31:14.410
one can read the story in its historical context of child sacrifice in the

497
00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:15.280
ancient near east.

498
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:21.030
Although child sacrifice was adamantly condemned in various later layers of the

499
00:31:21.161 --> 00:31:21.994
Bible,

500
00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:26.380
there's plenty of evidence that it was probably practiced in different quarters

501
00:31:26.381 --> 00:31:28.030
throughout the period of the monarchy.

502
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:33.990
Does genesis 22 assume or reject the practice of child sacrifice?

503
00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:39.450
Some scholars argue that a core story promoting child sacrifice has been edited,

504
00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:45.040
so as to serve as a polemic against child sacrifice.
Now in its final form,

505
00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:49.600
do you think so can you see the seams and feel the narrative tensions that would

506
00:31:49.601 --> 00:31:50.710
support such a claim?

507
00:31:50.711 --> 00:31:55.711
Does the story pull in more than one direction or we can read the story in its

508
00:31:55.751 --> 00:31:57.760
immediate literary context.

509
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.900
Abraham has just permitted the expulsion of Ishmael,

510
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.300
the only beloved son of Hagar.

511
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.560
And now God demands that he sacrificed his beloved son.

512
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.810
What might he be trying to teach Abraham?

513
00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:16.260
Is this a trial in the sense of a test or a trial in the sense of a punishment?

514
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.480
The Hebrew term can tolerate both meanings or genesis 22 can be contextualized

515
00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:23.223
another way.

516
00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:27.370
And at this point we need to backtrack a little bit to the story of Sodom and

517
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.720
Gomorrah,
which is in genesis 18 and 19,
uh,

518
00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.150
to contextualize the story a little bit.
Um,

519
00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:36.310
in terms of Abraham's character development,

520
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:42.850
in the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in genesis 18 and 19,
Yahweh,

521
00:32:42.851 --> 00:32:47.851
he tells Abraham of his plan to investigate reports of the wickedness of the

522
00:32:48.171 --> 00:32:52.700
city.
Uh,
the Canaanite city of Saddam Saddam.
Um,

523
00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.940
it's violence,
it's cruelty to strangers and to destroy it.

524
00:32:56.810 --> 00:33:00.020
And Abraham's reaction comes as something of a surprise.

525
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:03.410
He objects to the plan and he starts to argue with God.

526
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.880
Will you sweep away the innocence along with the guilty shall not the judge of

527
00:33:07.881 --> 00:33:11.630
all the earth deal justly.
That's in genesis 18 verses 23 to 25.

528
00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:14.720
The question is,
of course,
rhetorical.

529
00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:19.670
Abraham is evidently quite confident that God,
God would not act unjustly,

530
00:33:19.671 --> 00:33:23.690
but not destroy the innocent along with the wicked.
Indeed,

531
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:27.620
Abraham is banking on the fact that God is merciful and will overlook evil for

532
00:33:27.621 --> 00:33:29.180
the sake of righteous individuals.

533
00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:33.680
And so Abraham haggles with God for the lives of the innocent shall not the

534
00:33:33.681 --> 00:33:36.740
judge of all the earth deal justly.
And the Lord answered,

535
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.460
if I find within the city of Sodom 50 innocent ones,

536
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.290
I will forgive the whole place for their sake.
Abraham spoke up saying,
here,

537
00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:48.170
I'd venture to speak to my Lord I who am but dust and ashes.

538
00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:53.150
What if the 50 innocent should lack five would you destroy the whole city for

539
00:33:53.151 --> 00:33:55.640
want of the five?
And he answered,

540
00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:00.890
I will not destroy it if I find 45 there.
But he spoke to him again and said,

541
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.280
what a 40 should be found there?
And he answered,

542
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.100
I will not do it for the sake of the 40 and he said,

543
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:11.120
let not my Lord be angry if I go on,
but what if 30 should be found there?

544
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.901
And in this way,

545
00:34:11.901 --> 00:34:16.340
Abraham manages to widdle the number down to 10 and God answers,

546
00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.650
I will not destroy for the sake of 10 men,

547
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:24.770
but 10 innocent men are not found.
The narrator makes that very clear.

548
00:34:24.771 --> 00:34:29.090
He takes pains to point out that the mob that comes to abuse the to divine

549
00:34:29.091 --> 00:34:33.590
visitors includes all the people to the last man,
very clear statement.

550
00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.440
And so Saddam and his four sister,

551
00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:39.350
cities of the plain around the Dead Sea are destroyed.

552
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:43.400
But out of consideration for Abraham Abraham's nephew,

553
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:44.720
lot is saved.

554
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.960
Genesis 19 Verse 29 God was mindful of Abraham and we moved a lot from the midst

555
00:34:50.661 --> 00:34:52.820
of the upheaval.
Now,

556
00:34:52.821 --> 00:34:57.710
this text is often identified as the source for the doctrine of the merit of the

557
00:34:57.711 --> 00:34:58.544
righteous,

558
00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:13.320
which is the idea that someone who is not righteous is spared for the sake of or

559
00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:18.760
on a crown,
on account of the accrued merit of one who is righteous.

560
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:23.770
So lot himself is no prize,
but he is spared on Abraham's account.

561
00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:28.180
It's an idea that will have repercussions in later biblical thought.

562
00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.610
In this story,

563
00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:35.230
we see Abraham rising to the defense of a thoroughly wicked and reprehensible

564
00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:39.510
group of people arguing quite pointedly that the innocent should never be

565
00:35:39.511 --> 00:35:40.780
wantonly destroy.

566
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.650
Can this be the same Abraham who a few chapters later when told to slaughter his

567
00:35:46.651 --> 00:35:47.520
only son,

568
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.880
his perfectly innocent and presumably deeply loved son not only makes no

569
00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:53.910
objection,

570
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:57.930
but rises early in the morning to get started on the long journey to the

571
00:35:57.931 --> 00:35:59.190
sacrificial site.

572
00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:04.550
What are we to make of the juxtaposition of these two stories which represents

573
00:36:04.891 --> 00:36:07.980
behavior more desirable to God

574
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.980
before leaving the story?
I just want to make two quick comments.
First,

575
00:36:13.981 --> 00:36:17.640
I've included in your a reading packet and it's uploaded on the website.

576
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:22.890
Very interesting article by a writer who relates her efforts since childhood to

577
00:36:22.891 --> 00:36:27.460
understand why lot's wife should have been turned into a pillar of salt,
um,

578
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:31.800
as,
uh,
as punishment for looking back as she fled from her burning home.

579
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.180
It's not a biblical scholar,

580
00:36:33.181 --> 00:36:36.540
but someone who simply reacting to reading the text and reacting to the text.

581
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:41.760
Was this in fact a punishment or was it a mercy?
Second,

582
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
the story of Sodom and Gomorrah has often been cited as a biblical condemnation

583
00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:52.680
of homosexuality as if the sodomites were condemned to destruction because of

584
00:36:52.681 --> 00:36:55.380
homosexual behavior and affect the very terms.

585
00:36:55.381 --> 00:36:59.040
Sodomy and sodomized represent this interpretation,

586
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:04.760
but the idea that the fundamental sin of Sodom was homosexual behavior is not

587
00:37:05.131 --> 00:37:06.630
present in the Hebrew Bible.

588
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:10.860
It appears only in later documents it's found in the Christian New testament in

589
00:37:10.861 --> 00:37:12.900
the book of Jude,
Chapter Seven,
verse two,

590
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:17.970
look at Peter Chapter Two verses six through 10 and subsequent interpretations.

591
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:21.720
The sodomites like the generation of the flood stand,

592
00:37:21.721 --> 00:37:25.620
condemned by the outcry against them to get a Hebrew word that's used to refer

593
00:37:25.621 --> 00:37:29.450
to outcry.
It's a term that's generally associated with the Ph.

594
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:33.870
The appeal of victims of violent oppression,
bloodshed,
injustice,

595
00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:38.760
the sodomites.
God hears this outcry of victims against the sodomites,

596
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:42.030
the sodomites,
violation of the unwritten desert,

597
00:37:42.031 --> 00:37:43.980
law of hospitality to strangers.

598
00:37:43.981 --> 00:37:46.830
They're violent desire to abuse and getting ranked,

599
00:37:46.831 --> 00:37:49.200
the strangers that they should have been sheltering,

600
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:53.310
and this is merely one instance of a pattern of violence brutality.

601
00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.483
Well,
Isaac,

602
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:04.890
who was the child of God's promised Abraham is often described as the most

603
00:38:04.891 --> 00:38:08.310
invisible of the Patriarchs are the most passive of the Patriarchs,

604
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:13.470
perhaps is passive acceptance of his father's effort to sacrifice him serves as

605
00:38:13.471 --> 00:38:18.420
the key to the biblical narrators perception of his character.
By contrast,

606
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:19.710
his wife,
Rebecca,

607
00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:23.940
is often described as the most determined and energetic of the matriarchs.

608
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:27.450
She runs to accent,
extend hospitality to a stranger.

609
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:29.460
She quickly draws water for him.

610
00:38:29.461 --> 00:38:33.180
She quickly draws water for his camels and waters them all.

611
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:35.830
She seems to run everywhere and she does all this.

612
00:38:35.831 --> 00:38:40.600
Not knowing that the man she greets is a servant of Abraham who's come to seek a

613
00:38:40.601 --> 00:38:43.000
wife for his master's son Isaac.

614
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:48.210
Rebecca herself personally accepts the offer of an unknown bridegroom in a far

615
00:38:48.211 --> 00:38:52.570
away land and overrides the urgings of her mother and her brother to delay her

616
00:38:52.571 --> 00:38:55.210
departure.
No,
she says,
I'm ready to go.
I'll go.
Now.

617
00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:59.530
There's a very moving conclusion to the [inaudible] story.
Um,

618
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.560
we read in Genesis 24 verse 67 that Isaac brought Rebecca into the tent of his

619
00:39:05.771 --> 00:39:08.440
mother's Sarah,
and he took Rebecca as his wife.

620
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.980
Isaac loved her and thus found comfort after his mother's death.

621
00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:15.520
But like the other matriarchs,
Rebecca is barren.

622
00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:20.260
So Isaac pleads with the Lord for a child on her behalf and Rebecca becomes

623
00:39:20.261 --> 00:39:23.910
pregnant with twins.
The older child is Esau.

624
00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.110
Esau will be the father of the Edomites,

625
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:31.390
and the younger is Jacob who will be the father of the Israelites.
Now,

626
00:39:31.391 --> 00:39:35.440
Jacob is the most fully developed,
the most colorful,

627
00:39:35.441 --> 00:39:38.530
and the most complex of the Patriarchs.

628
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:44.080
Jacob has long been identified by commentators as the classic trickster,

629
00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:46.020
a type that we know from folklore.

630
00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.200
Mark Brittler has described the Jacobs stories as a kind of morality tale.

631
00:39:50.350 --> 00:39:53.710
The main message of which is trick and you shall be tricked.

632
00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:59.020
Jacob tricks his brother out of his birthright and in turn is tricked by his

633
00:39:59.021 --> 00:40:02.290
brother in law,
his wife and later his own sons.

634
00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:07.600
How much of Jacob's trickery is really necessary after all,

635
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:08.111
Rebecca,

636
00:40:08.111 --> 00:40:13.111
who suffers tremendous pain during her pregnancy is told by God that the twins

637
00:40:13.841 --> 00:40:18.790
who are fighting and struggling for priority in her womb will become two
nations.

638
00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:19.540
The younger,

639
00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.980
the older of which will serve the younger that happens in genesis 25 verse 23

640
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:28.450
two nations are in your room to separate peoples shell issue from your body.

641
00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.260
One people shall be mightier than the other and the older shall serve the

642
00:40:32.261 --> 00:40:35.080
younger and indeed the real life.

643
00:40:35.081 --> 00:40:40.081
Nations of Israel and he dom were longtime enemies because Esau is the father of

644
00:40:41.051 --> 00:40:41.561
the Itta Mites.

645
00:40:41.561 --> 00:40:45.760
According to the biblical text and for a time Aidan was subjugated by Israel.

646
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.030
According to the biblical text under David King David,

647
00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.820
some scholars like knock him Sarna,

648
00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:56.860
have argued that this announcement that the older shall serve the younger,

649
00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:01.870
um,
if the narrator's way of establishing for the reader that the younger child,

650
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.960
Jacob is the son who will inherit the divine blessing.

651
00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:10.770
And that that then raises serious questions about Rebecca and Jacobs morally

652
00:41:11.891 --> 00:41:16.390
dubious efforts to rest the blessing and birthright from Esau.

653
00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.920
Are we supposed to be comforted by the fact that they are fulfilling a divine

654
00:41:20.921 --> 00:41:21.754
plan?

655
00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:25.570
Are we supposed to conclude that it's all right to fulfill a divine plan by any

656
00:41:25.571 --> 00:41:26.980
means,
fair or foul?

657
00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:31.840
Or are we to conclude as Sarna and others suggest that Jacob's possession of the

658
00:41:31.841 --> 00:41:35.870
birthright was predetermined.
It was disengaged from all of his acts of trickery.

659
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.220
And if so,

660
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:42.370
then Jacob's efforts are indicative of a deceitful and narcissistic personality.

661
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:45.830
He takes advantage of Esau as hunger,

662
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:50.060
offering him a pot of lentil stew and exchange for the birthright.

663
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:55.690
He and Rebecca plot to deceive Isaac in his dotage into bestowing the blessing

664
00:41:55.881 --> 00:42:00.881
of the first born on Jacob instead of you saw so perhaps by informing us that

665
00:42:01.131 --> 00:42:03.110
Jacob had been chosen from the womb,

666
00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:07.970
the narrator is able to paint a portrait of Jacob at this stage in his life as

667
00:42:07.971 --> 00:42:12.110
grasping and faithless a great contrast to his grandfather Abraham.

668
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:17.090
Now Jacobs poor treatment of his brother Esau earns him.

669
00:42:17.091 --> 00:42:22.091
Esau is enmity and Jacob finds it expedient to leave Canaan and remain at the

670
00:42:22.761 --> 00:42:24.080
home of his mother's brother.

671
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:29.320
Laban on his way east back to Mesopotamia from Canaan where leave and resides in

672
00:42:31.641 --> 00:42:32.474
Mesopotamia.

673
00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:36.950
Jacob has an encounter with God at a place called lose.

674
00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:39.560
Jacob lies down to sleep,
um,

675
00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:44.620
resting his head on a stone and he has a dream in which he sees a ladder.

676
00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:49.700
The ladders feet are on the earth.
It reaches to heaven.

677
00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:54.320
And there are angels ascending and descending on the ladder.
And in the dream,

678
00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:54.511
yeah,

679
00:42:54.511 --> 00:42:59.511
halfway appears or God appears to Jacob and reaffirms the Abrahamic or

680
00:42:59.811 --> 00:43:04.250
patriarchal covenant.
He promises land posterity.
And in addition,

681
00:43:04.251 --> 00:43:07.210
Jacobs own safety,
his own personal safety.
Uh,

682
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:10.520
until he returns to the land of Israel.
And Jacob is stunned.

683
00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:13.970
We read in Genesis 28 versus 16 and 17,

684
00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:18.230
Jacob woke from his sleep and said,
surely the Lord is in this place.

685
00:43:18.231 --> 00:43:21.770
And I did not know it.
Shake.
And he said,
how awesome is this place?

686
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:25.670
This is none other than the abode of God.
And that is the gateway to heaven.

687
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.740
The stone that served as his pillow.
Um,

688
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:32.930
he then sets up as a cultic pillar,
some sort of memorial stone.

689
00:43:32.931 --> 00:43:37.760
He sanctifies the stone with oil and he renames the site,
Beth El Bait l,

690
00:43:37.761 --> 00:43:39.800
which means the house of God.

691
00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:45.320
But it's significant that despite this direct vision,
Jacob,

692
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.790
so unlike Abraham,

693
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:50.930
is still reluctant to rely on God and his promise,

694
00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:55.580
and he makes a conditional vow.
If God remains with me,

695
00:43:55.581 --> 00:43:59.990
and if he protects me on this journey that I am making and gives me bread to eat

696
00:43:59.991 --> 00:44:04.040
and clothing to wear,
and if I returned safe to my father's house,

697
00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:08.750
the Lord shall be my God.
And this stone which I have set up as a pillar,

698
00:44:08.751 --> 00:44:11.150
shall be God's boat and have all that you give me.

699
00:44:11.151 --> 00:44:15.860
I will set aside a time for you.
So where once God had tested Abraham,

700
00:44:15.861 --> 00:44:20.510
it seems now that Jacob is almost testing God.
If you can do all this fine,

701
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:22.970
you can be my God.
Well,

702
00:44:22.971 --> 00:44:27.050
Jacob's spins some 14 years in the household of his uncle,

703
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:30.620
his mother's brother,
Laban and Jacob Meets Layman's two daughters.

704
00:44:30.621 --> 00:44:35.621
Leah is the elder daughter and Rachel is the younger and he soon loves Rachel.

705
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:40.290
He agrees to serve Laban for seven years for the hand of the younger daughter.

706
00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:42.930
Rachel.
When the seven years pass,

707
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:47.880
Laban deceived Jacob and gives him the elder daughter,
Leah.
Jacob.

708
00:44:47.881 --> 00:44:51.030
The trickster is furious at having been tricked himself.

709
00:44:51.031 --> 00:44:55.160
And in much the same way,
an older and a younger sibling,
um,

710
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:59.860
are one disguised as the other or wearing the covering of the other justice.

711
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:01.380
He tricked his own father,

712
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.460
but he is willing to give seven years more service for Rachel,

713
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.170
Rachel,
Leah,

714
00:45:07.171 --> 00:45:11.730
and they're two handmaidens will conceive one daughter and 12 sons from whom

715
00:45:11.731 --> 00:45:15.870
will come.
The 12 tribes of Israel,
but it's the two sons of Rachel,

716
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:19.770
the beloved wife,
the two sons of Rachel Joseph and Benjamin,

717
00:45:19.771 --> 00:45:21.750
who are the most beloved to Jacob.

718
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:26.880
Jacob determines finally to leave Laban and returned to Canaan.

719
00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:32.010
And there's one final remarkable incident in Jacob's life that occurs on his

720
00:45:32.011 --> 00:45:32.880
return journey.

721
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:37.200
It's an incident that most readers associated with a significant transformation

722
00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:38.040
in his character,

723
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:43.350
and that is Jacob's nighttime struggle with a mysterious figure who in some way

724
00:45:43.351 --> 00:45:45.000
is representative of God.

725
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:50.220
And this struggle occurs as he is about to cross the river Jabbok and reconcile

726
00:45:50.221 --> 00:45:53.070
himself with his former rival and enemy.
Uh,
Esau.

727
00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:57.930
Jacob has set everyone on a head.
His wives,
his children,
his household,

728
00:45:57.931 --> 00:46:01.710
his possessions,
he standing alone at the river.
And we read

729
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:08.300
Genesis 32 verses 25 to 33 a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn when

730
00:46:09.331 --> 00:46:11.010
he saw that he had not prevailed against him.

731
00:46:11.011 --> 00:46:15.030
He wrenched Jacob's hip at its socket so that the socket of his hip was strained

732
00:46:15.031 --> 00:46:18.390
as he wrestled with him.
And then he said,
let me go for dawn is breaking.

733
00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:21.960
But he answered,
I will not let you go unless you bless me,
said the other.

734
00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:26.580
What is your name?
He replied.
Jacob said,
he,
your name shall no longer be Jacob,

735
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:31.620
but Israel,
Israel,
for you have striven with God and men and have prevailed.

736
00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:35.580
Jacob asked to pray,
tell me your name,
but he said,
you must not ask my name,

737
00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:36.870
and he took leave of him there.

738
00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:41.970
So Jacob named the place Peniel meaning I have seen a divine being face to face,

739
00:46:41.971 --> 00:46:43.410
yet my life has been preserved.

740
00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:47.910
The Sun rose upon him as he passed Peniel limping on his hip.

741
00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.430
Many scholars,

742
00:46:50.431 --> 00:46:55.431
Michael Kuvan and others see this story as an Israelite adaptation of popular

743
00:46:55.681 --> 00:46:59.820
stories of river gods who threaten those who wished to cross the river or trolls

744
00:46:59.821 --> 00:47:03.900
or Ogres who I'm guard rivers and have to be defeated by a hero,

745
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:08.550
making the river safe to cross.
And in its Israelite version.
However,

746
00:47:08.551 --> 00:47:12.750
this story is historicized.
It serves an ideological function.

747
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:16.140
So it's associated with one particular character and a historical time.

748
00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:19.530
And it serves to explain why the Israelites,

749
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:24.500
it's abstain from eating the sciatic nerve of an animal.
Even to this day.
Um,

750
00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:28.560
we also learn how [inaudible] gets its name.
We learned how Israel gets his name.

751
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:33.790
Names aren't important.
Theme of this story in the biblical context,

752
00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:37.090
names encapsulate the essence of their bearer.

753
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:41.470
Naming something or knowing the name of something gives one control over or

754
00:47:41.471 --> 00:47:42.790
power over that thing.

755
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
And that's why the stranger will not reveal his name to Jacob.

756
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:47.770
It would give Jacob power over him.

757
00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.940
Jacob's own name is the occasion for some punning in this story.

758
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:54.460
His name is built on this route.

759
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:58.300
Yacov it means to supplant or uproot.

760
00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:01.330
He emerges from the womb.
Grasping his brothers.

761
00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:03.640
He'll give here.

762
00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.490
They worked for heal is a based on that route.

763
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.550
It's part of his effort to supplant Issar right at birth.

764
00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:12.580
And he continues that effort.
It's a planting through his early life.

765
00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:17.590
The writer makes that explicit in genesis 27 verse 36 when Esau cries out,

766
00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:22.040
what's he then named the alcove that he might supplant me these two times.
Um,

767
00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:26.080
yes.
And in this chapter,
Jacob wrestles,

768
00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:30.280
the word for wrestle is Ja is built on this route.
Just switching to letters.

769
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:35.530
He wrestles with the mysterious divine being at the yacht buck river.

770
00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:40.510
So you see all of these,
these,
this punning with the name,
Jacob's very name,

771
00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:43.690
hints at and foreshadows the struggling,
the wrestling,

772
00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.180
the trickery that are the major themes of his life.

773
00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:49.420
But his striving has reached a climax here.

774
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:52.390
And so the angel named him Israel,
Israel,

775
00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:56.830
which means he who has striven with God because as a stranger says,

776
00:48:56.831 --> 00:49:00.220
he has striven and wrestled all his life with men,
particularly as brother.

777
00:49:00.221 --> 00:49:02.380
And now with God.
El Means God.

778
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:06.820
It's the name of the chief God of the Pantheon of Canaan.
You strike l,

779
00:49:06.821 --> 00:49:08.110
he who has struggled with God.

780
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:11.800
We'll talk about the way in which the change of name means a change of
character,

781
00:49:11.801 --> 00:49:14.770
change of essence for the patriarch when we return.
