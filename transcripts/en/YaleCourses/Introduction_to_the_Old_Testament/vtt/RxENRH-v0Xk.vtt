1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.040
When the book had nits are a Babylon burned the temple and destroyed Jerusalem.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.260
The initial reaction was one of overwhelming grief and sadness.

3
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:13.080
And that's represented primarily in the book of lamentations.

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.510
It's a very short book of Durgin that lament the loss of Jerusalem,
um,

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.900
as the death of a beloved person.

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.570
And it's traditionally attributed to Jeremiah.

7
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:27.990
The Bible itself doesn't make this claim.
It's an old tradition.

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.050
It may have a risen,
however,
because of all of the prophets,

9
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:34.920
Jeremiah is the one who reveals the most to us about his personal suffering and

10
00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:38.940
grief.
And because he was present as an eye witness at the destruction,

11
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.050
there's no real logical development of ideas in limitations,

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.800
primarily because it's structured by an artificial device.

13
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.090
There are five chapters and four of the chapters are acrostic poems.

14
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:55.470
This means that each verse,

15
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.430
or sometimes a series of verses begins with a letter of the alphabet and

16
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:03.240
sequence.
So in chapter three you have three versus per letter of the alphabet.

17
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.250
But this kind of a cross stick poetic formation gives the poem a kind of formal

18
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:13.251
unity at the same time that it has no logical unity or logical flow.

19
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.210
And it's been pointed out that that a form is particularly appropriate for an

20
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:23.190
expression of grief that is too profound or too all encompassing to be logical.

21
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.690
The limitations over Jerusalem resemble very much David's limitations.

22
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:32.550
Oversaw the mourner spends time contrasting the former splendor of the beloved

23
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.320
to his or her presence state.

24
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.040
And we have lots of ancient near eastern prototypes or this kind of limitation

25
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.080
limitations over destroyed cities,

26
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:45.081
which are understood as the result of the deities decision to abandon the city

27
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.200
and in limitations were given a very detailed picture of the great suffering

28
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:55.990
that accompanied the final collapse.
Limitations.
One one.
Alas,

29
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.490
lonely sits the city once great with people.
She,
that was great.

30
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:01.500
Among nations is become like a widow.

31
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.590
The princess among states is become a thrall.
A chapter four.
Um,

32
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.680
alas,
the gold is dulled,
debased.
The finest gold,

33
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.650
the sacred gems are spilled at every street corner.

34
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.730
The Precious Children of Zion once valued as gold,
alas,

35
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.600
they are accounted as earthen pots,
work of a potter's hands.

36
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.510
Even jackals offer the breast and suckle.
They're young,

37
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:28.050
but my poor people has turned cruel like ostriches of the desert.

38
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.650
The tongue of the suckling cleaves to its Palette for thirst.

39
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:35.240
Little children beg for bread,
none.
Give them a morsel.

40
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.520
Those who feasted on Dante's life famished in the streets,

41
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.420
those who were reared in purple have embraced refuse heaps.

42
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.810
The guilt of my poor people exceeded the inequity of Saddam,

43
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.250
which was overthrown in a moment without a hand striking it.
Her elect,

44
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.480
we're pure than snow,
wiser than milk.
Their limbs were readier than Carl.

45
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.730
Their bodies were like Sapphire again,

46
00:02:56.731 --> 00:03:00.070
the description of the physical beauty of the beloved and now their faces are

47
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:03.070
blacker than suit.
They are not recognized in the street.

48
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:05.140
Their skin has shriveled on their bones.

49
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:09.190
It has become dry as would better off where the slain of the sword.

50
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:14.170
Then those slain by famine who pined away as the wounded for lack of the fruits

51
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:16.270
of the field with their own hands.

52
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:19.060
Tenderhearted women have cooked their children,

53
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.840
such became their fare in the disaster of my poor people.

54
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.140
The poet here though does adopt the standard Deuteronomistic interpretation of

55
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:34.141
events which infers sin from suffering and therefore harps on the sin and the

56
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:39.070
uncleanness of Jerusalem that brought on this calamity and there their guilt

57
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:41.470
exceeded the iniquity of Sodom in the passage we just read,

58
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.560
and this is a strategy that of course justifies God.

59
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.150
The poet singles out the corrupt priests,
the corrupt profits for blame.

60
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.560
He attacks the popular ideology of the Inviolability of Zion.

61
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.490
Israel's many sins or what caused the off way to pour out his wrath and

62
00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:02.410
destroyed Jerusalem utterly and the descriptions of Yahweh's wrath,
anger,

63
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:05.990
his consuming rage.
These are some of the most powerful and most violent,
uh,

64
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.840
poetry in the Hebrew Bible.
They tend to divert attention,
in fact,

65
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:14.350
from the People's guilt and focus attention on their suffering.

66
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:18.700
Children crying for bread,
children starving to death.
Women raped men abused.

67
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.990
In chapter three the poet's switches into the first person.

68
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:26.680
So Jerusalem is speaking like one who's pursued and abused,

69
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.080
beaten by an angry and violent master.

70
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:34.081
Chapter three I am the man who has known affliction under the Rod of his wrath.

71
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.440
Me.
He drove on and on and unrelieved darkness on none but me.

72
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:41.250
He brings down his hand again and again without cease.

73
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.790
He has worn away my flesh and skin.
He has shattered my bones all around me.

74
00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:47.710
He has built misery and hardship.

75
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.950
He has made me dwell in darkness like those long dead.

76
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.410
He has walled me in and I cannot break out.

77
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.920
He has weighed me down with chains and when I cry and plead,

78
00:04:56.921 --> 00:05:01.330
he shuts out my prayer.
He has walled in my ways with human blocks.

79
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.380
He has made my pads Amaz.
He is a lurking bear to me,

80
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:09.730
Elian in hiding.
He has forced me off my way and mangled me.

81
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.850
He has left me numb remarkably violent passage and in another remarkable

82
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:19.450
passage,
the poet describes God as refusing to hear the prayers of Israel.

83
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.120
He no longer can forgive.
He simply has to punish.

84
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:27.121
This is in a chapter three as well versus 42 to 45 we have transgressed and

85
00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:29.740
rebelled,
but you have not forgiven.

86
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.970
You have clothed yourself in anger and pursued us.
You have slain without pity.

87
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.750
You have screened yourself off with a cloud that no prayer may pass through.

88
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.010
You have made us filth and refuse in the midst of the peoples,
right?

89
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.950
So God is simply refusing to even hear Israel's prayers.

90
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.770
So there's this emphasis,
not so much on Israel's guilt,

91
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:50.650
but on Israel's tremendous suffering.
God's hardheartedness.

92
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.770
The poem ends with a plea of reconciliation and Chapter Five Verses 19 to 22 but

93
00:05:57.231 --> 00:06:01.580
you,
oh Lord are enthroned forever.
Your throne endures through the ages.

94
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.830
Why have you forgotten us?
Utterly forsaken us for all time.
Take us back,

95
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.760
oh Lord to yourself and let us come back.
Renew our days as of old.

96
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.200
For truly you have rejected us,
bitterly raged against us.
Take us back,

97
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.360
oh Lord to yourself and let us come back.

98
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.600
Renew our days as of old limitations represents one response to the fall of

99
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:27.410
Jerusalem.
It's an overwhelming sense of loss.
Grief,
misery.

100
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.920
I'm sort of shocked.
Um,
a sense of shock to it.

101
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:33.350
Guts treatment and also a longing to return,

102
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.630
a longing for renewal and reconciliation.

103
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.060
But the 200 years of following the destruction would prove to be a time,

104
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:43.070
a very critical time of transition.

105
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.820
And Israelite literature in this period reflects the Israelites struggle with

106
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:52.010
the philosophical and religious challenge of the destruction.

107
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.710
How could the disastrous events be explained?

108
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.010
We've already seen the response of the Deuteronomistic school.

109
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.870
Israel was collectively punished for idolatry.
We've seen,
uh,

110
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.020
that history simply reflects justice on a national and international level in

111
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:09.010
this view.
We've also seen the response of a zeal.
He,

112
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.070
he promoted the idea of a continued relationship with God in exile and was

113
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:18.740
awaiting a fantastic restoration,
a redesign of human nature.

114
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.900
We've seen the response of Second Isaiah,

115
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:25.670
which emphasizes the universal significance of Israel suffering universal

116
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:30.671
mission for Israel for both Zq and the author of Second Isaiah Israel surface.

117
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.170
Uh,
suffering is serving a purpose in the divine plan.
It's necessary.

118
00:07:36.171 --> 00:07:40.400
Israel needs purification and redemption and that will prepare her for a new

119
00:07:40.401 --> 00:07:44.270
role in world history.
But there are other responses as well,

120
00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:47.420
and they're found in the material that's collected in the third section of the

121
00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:48.254
Hebrew Bible.

122
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.580
That's the section referred to really is to have him and Hebrew simply means

123
00:07:52.581 --> 00:07:56.690
writings,
written things.
So it's,
it's sort of a miscellanea catchall phrase.
Uh,

124
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.540
and the final portion of the course is going to be devoted now to that third

125
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:04.220
section.
So Tara Nivi more profits and neck to Veeam or writings.
Um,

126
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.120
next time I'm going to discuss the problem of dating many of the works that are

127
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:09.620
in this third section.

128
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:14.621
The writings for now will suffice it to say that while some of the books in this

129
00:08:15.291 --> 00:08:18.470
third section of the Bible may have predated the exile,

130
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.360
they became canonical.

131
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.950
They became authoritative for the community in the Postig Zelig period,

132
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.960
and therefore served as a prism through which to view and come to grips with

133
00:08:29.961 --> 00:08:34.280
Israel's history.
So we're going to turn today,
first of all,

134
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:39.200
to an examination of the book,
three books that represent the wisdom tradition,

135
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:42.770
what's referred to as a wisdom literature,
a wisdom tradition in ancient Israel.

136
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.850
And the wisdom books of the Hebrew Bible are proverbs,
job and Ecclesiastes.

137
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:48.050
These,
um,

138
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:53.240
Israelite wisdom literature belongs to a much wider,
uh,

139
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.560
and broad,
broad wisdom legacy or tradition in the ancient near east.

140
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.540
There's very little in biblical wisdom literature apart from its monotheism that

141
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:07.740
lacks a parallel in the wisdom literature of Egypt or Mesopotamia.

142
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:13.040
So ancient near eastern wisdom literature is literature that's characterized by

143
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:17.880
a praise of human intelligence applied to understanding the ways of the world,

144
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:22.470
the ways of society.
It tends to contain a traditional advice,

145
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.900
advice that's been found to be tried and true.

146
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.610
It tends to be very individually oriented,
right?
But at the same time,

147
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:33.810
quite universal and humanistic in its orientation as well.

148
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.850
And in keeping with this style Israelite wisdom literature doesn't really speak

149
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:41.730
to the particular historical condition of Israel.

150
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.490
It speaks to the general human condition.

151
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.690
It makes no claim to having been divinely revealed,

152
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:52.710
no special claim to having been conveyed by a prophet or by Moses.

153
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.820
It's simply observational wisdom.
All right,
uh,

154
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.880
advice and counsel that can be weighed or confirmed or disputed by experience.

155
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:03.271
And again,

156
00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:06.570
if you were to simply to open up the book of proverbs and read something in

157
00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:08.410
there,
unless it had the word,
yeah way,

158
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.590
you wouldn't know that it didn't come from some Egyptian wisdom literature of

159
00:10:12.591 --> 00:10:17.330
Mesopotamian wisdom literature.
There are various types of wisdom material,
um,

160
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.570
scholars of sort of classified the wisdom material into three main categories.

161
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.810
The Hebrew word for wisdom,
which is a word [inaudible].

162
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:29.910
It literally means skill and probably refers to the skill of living well or

163
00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:30.840
living properly.

164
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.830
And the three types of wisdom literature that we find are what we would call

165
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:36.600
clan or family wisdom.

166
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:42.170
These materials tend to be common sense aphorisms and observations,

167
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.600
the kinds of things that are common to all cultures.

168
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.220
They're scattered around the Hebrew Bible,
but most of them,
um,

169
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:54.150
are contained in the book of proverbs.
So,
for example,
proverbs 15,
17,

170
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:58.260
better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened docs where there

171
00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:00.690
is hate,
right?
It's kind of thing you can imagine,
you know,

172
00:11:00.691 --> 00:11:05.310
your grandmother saying Chapter 20,
verse 14,
bad,
bad,
says the buyer,

173
00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:09.480
but having moved off,
he congratulates himself or 26,
14,

174
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.990
the door turns on its hinge and the lazy man on his bed,
right?

175
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.050
And neither of them really gets anywhere.
And 25,

176
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:19.610
25 like cold water to a parched throat is uh,

177
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.600
is good news from a distant land.

178
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.320
And many of the proverbs we classify as clan or family wisdom are,
are very,

179
00:11:25.321 --> 00:11:29.360
are parental right.
They tend to sound as if they're being said to a son.
Uh,

180
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.930
not so much a daughter,
but to a son.

181
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:35.700
The second category of wisdom literature is what we call court wisdom.
And,
uh,

182
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.780
we have a lot of this from Egypt.
A great deal of court wisdom came from Egypt.

183
00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:43.260
It served the needs of the court.
It tends to be bureaucratic advice,

184
00:11:43.261 --> 00:11:47.790
administrative advice,
career advice,
instruction on manners or tact,

185
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:52.110
how to be diplomatic,
how to live well on prosper,
practical wisdom.

186
00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:57.040
So for example,
proverbs 24 27 puts your external affairs in order,

187
00:11:57.041 --> 00:12:02.041
get ready what you have in the field and then build yourself a home or 2123 he

188
00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:05.650
who guards his mouth and tongue guards himself from trouble,
right?

189
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.790
Tact 1114 for want of strategy and army falls.

190
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:14.791
But victory comes with much planning or 12 one he who loves discipline,

191
00:12:14.831 --> 00:12:18.490
loves knowledge.
He who spurns reproof is a brutish man.

192
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:23.050
And then the third category of wisdom literature is what we might call more

193
00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:27.670
freewheeling,
um,
existential reflection or,
or probing reflection,

194
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.300
reflective probing into the critical problems of human existence.

195
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.260
And I'm going to talk about that in much more detail as we get to the book of

196
00:12:35.261 --> 00:12:37.600
job.
Now,
as I mentioned before,

197
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:41.380
all of these types of wisdom literature tend to be very universalistic,

198
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.030
humanistic,
a historical,

199
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:46.240
there's nothing particularly is particularly Israelite about them.

200
00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:47.440
There's no mention of the exodus.

201
00:12:47.441 --> 00:12:50.110
There's no mention of Sinai or Moses or covenant or,

202
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.240
or any of the early narratives of the nation.

203
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.290
And they are paralleled in great abundance in the writings of other ancient near

204
00:12:56.291 --> 00:12:57.430
eastern cultures.

205
00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:02.060
Sometimes there's an attempt to connect wisdom specifically with belief and your

206
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.280
way.
Um,

207
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:08.340
but biblical wisdom like ancient near eastern wisdom generally grounds morality

208
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:14.610
on nonspecific notions of prudence and God fearing and a sort of nonspecific way

209
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.400
rather than on the historical covenant with Yahweh.

210
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.500
So let's look into a little more detail.

211
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.350
Look at the book of proverbs and a little more detail.

212
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.770
Proverbs is the classic book of Wisdom.

213
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.980
It contains some material of great antiquity,

214
00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:33.760
even though the book in its final probably reached its final form only and

215
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:38.020
Postig Zelig Times.
Surely a great deal of it is a much older,

216
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:43.290
there are many affinities between proverbs and Egyptian and Canaanite wisdom

217
00:13:43.631 --> 00:13:46.730
literature.
So it suggests that Israel,
uh,

218
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:50.680
assimilated wisdom material from the wider environment.

219
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:51.940
Um,

220
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.940
the chief aim of proverbs seems to be the inculcation of wisdom as the means to

221
00:13:57.941 --> 00:14:00.700
social tranquility and a happy life.

222
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.970
Young people should learn to master their impulses.

223
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.970
They should lead productive and sensible lives.

224
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.210
Many of the maxims are intended to educate sons.

225
00:14:10.211 --> 00:14:11.770
There's no mention of daughters here.

226
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.020
And a good deal of the first nine chapters is formally pedagogical,

227
00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:18.340
clearly pedagogical.

228
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.640
And it can be compared quite productively with some Egyptian writings that we

229
00:14:24.341 --> 00:14:25.810
have from the third millennium,

230
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:31.260
the Egyptian teaching of a minimum oh pit or the Babylonian councils of wisdom.

231
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.510
Tremendous,
uh,
parallels among these works.

232
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:39.510
But these first nine chapters warn against the seductions of foreign women and

233
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.520
they urge young men to pursue wisdom and wisdom here is figured almost type

234
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.540
hypothesized,
right?

235
00:14:46.541 --> 00:14:51.320
Almost at an attribute or characteristic that's almost put into a concrete human

236
00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:52.100
form.

237
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.690
Wisdom is figured as a virtuous woman who promises insight and council.

238
00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:01.870
This woman was created before all other created things and wisdom again,

239
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:06.020
figured as a woman assisted,
yeah,
way in the creation and the ordering,

240
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:09.650
I should say the ordering of the universe.
Wisdom was with God at that time.

241
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.980
Proverbs values hard work and diligence and warns against excessive sleep and

242
00:15:15.741 --> 00:15:17.060
sex and wine.

243
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:21.230
And proverbs recommends honesty in your business affairs and kindness and

244
00:15:21.231 --> 00:15:22.890
loyalty and impartiality.

245
00:15:22.891 --> 00:15:27.470
And sobriety and humility and restraint and sincerity.
Wealth is very nice,

246
00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:31.520
but it's not to be desired at the,
uh,
at the cost of calmness and peace.

247
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:36.450
The wisdom sayings that appear in proverbs are usually these short two lines

248
00:15:36.451 --> 00:15:41.210
sentences in which the second line runs parallel in some way to the first.
Um,

249
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.690
some scholars have classified the different kinds of parallelism you find in the

250
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:47.480
book of proverbs,
and I've,
I've written the three main forms up here,

251
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.830
an example of synonymous parallelism where the second line is essentially

252
00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:54.620
synonymous with the first that's found in proverbs 22.
One.

253
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.140
It's a classic feature of Biblical poetry in general.

254
00:15:57.141 --> 00:15:59.630
We'll see it in the psalms for an example.

255
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:04.460
A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches and favor,

256
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:07.280
parallel to good name is better than silver and gold,

257
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.220
right parallel to great riches.
So the two lines are,

258
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.760
are somewhat synonymous in antithetical parallelism.

259
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.560
The two lines form a balanced pair of opposites.
So in proverbs 10,
one,

260
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:23.690
a wise son makes a glad father,
but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother.

261
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:28.610
When the second line seems to complete the thought of the first,

262
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.760
it's called ascending parallelism.
Um,

263
00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:36.761
we find that in proverbs 1122 like a gold ring in the snout of a pig is a

264
00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:40.100
beautiful woman bereft of sense.

265
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:46.630
Another feature of proverbs is that wisdom itself is established as a religious

266
00:16:48.081 --> 00:16:50.270
concept.
It seems to have some religious value.

267
00:16:50.271 --> 00:16:55.271
Proverbs tries to link wisdom with reverence for God and obedience to God.

268
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.180
In proverbs one seven,
the fear of the Lord of the reverence,

269
00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.580
the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

270
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:06.350
Fools despise wisdom and discipline.
Or chapter three verses five through eight.

271
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.520
Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not rely on your own understanding.

272
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.310
Wisdom guards one from evil.

273
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.990
The wise person accepts the sufferings with which God is disciplining him.

274
00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:19.640
So in proverbs three 12,

275
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:24.740
four Yahweh reproves or disciplines him whom he loves as a father,

276
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.480
the son in whom he delights.

277
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:31.510
Keep that in mind as we turn to joke because I think the most important thing

278
00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:36.761
about the book of proverbs is it's almost smug certainty that the righteous and

279
00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:41.060
the wicked of the world receive what they deserve in this life.

280
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.510
There's a complacency here and optimism.

281
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:50.130
God's just providence and a moral word or world order our presuppositions that

282
00:17:50.131 --> 00:17:53.640
it just doesn't seem to question the wise persons.

283
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:57.060
Deeds are good and will bring them happiness and success.

284
00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.560
The foolish persons deeds are evil and they're going to lead to failure and
ruin.

285
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:06.890
The key idea is that a truly wise person knows that the world is essentially

286
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.790
coherent.
It's ethically ordered.

287
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:12.360
There are clear laws of reward and punishment that exists in the world.

288
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:17.630
Proverbs 26 verse 27 he who digs a pit will fall into it and a stone.

289
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:19.380
We'll come back upon him.

290
00:18:19.381 --> 00:18:23.700
Who starts it rolling or 13 six righteousness protects him.

291
00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:26.850
Whose way is blameless?
Wickedness subverts the sinner.

292
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.040
If the righteous suffer,

293
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:32.910
then they're being chastised or chastened by God just as a son,

294
00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:36.270
as disciplined by his father,
and he shouldn't reject this reproof.

295
00:18:36.271 --> 00:18:37.110
He should welcome it.

296
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:42.410
And this insistence on the basic justice of the world and the power of wisdom or

297
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:46.110
fear of the Lord to guarantee success.

298
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:49.680
And security was one strand of ancient Israelite thought.

299
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.200
It reaches crystallization in the book of proverbs.

300
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.110
It was available as a response to,

301
00:18:55.111 --> 00:18:58.800
or an explanation of the catastrophes that had befallen the nation.

302
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.690
We've seen it at work and the Deuteronomistic school unwilling to relinquish the

303
00:19:03.691 --> 00:19:07.950
idea of a moral God in control of history and preferring,

304
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:13.040
preferring to infer the nations sinfulness from its suffering and calamity

305
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.900
better to blame the sufferer Israel.

306
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:20.370
And so keep God and the system of divine,
retributive justice intact.

307
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:26.030
But it's precisely this formulaic and conventional piety that is challenged by

308
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.070
two other remarkable wisdom books in the Bible,

309
00:19:29.071 --> 00:19:32.490
the book of Job and the book of Ecclesiastes and enjoy.

310
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:36.090
We find the idea that suffering is not always punitive.

311
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.930
It is not always a sign of wickedness.
It's not always explicable.

312
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.790
And this is the first of several subversions of fundamental biblical principles

313
00:19:44.791 --> 00:19:49.740
that we encounter in the book of job.
The book of job,
we really don't know,

314
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.000
uh,
it's date.
It's probably no earlier than the sixth century BCE.

315
00:19:54.001 --> 00:19:57.750
But scholars disagree and there are portions of it that seemed to reflect a very

316
00:19:57.751 --> 00:19:59.550
old and ancient,
very ancient tradition.

317
00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:04.230
It's one of the hardest books of the Bible for moderns to read and I think

318
00:20:04.231 --> 00:20:08.130
that's because its conclusions to the degree that we can agree on what the

319
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:09.150
conclusions might be,

320
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.330
but its conclusions seem to fly in the face of some basic religious convictions.

321
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.330
You have to allow yourself,
I think,
to be surprised,
to open your mind,

322
00:20:18.331 --> 00:20:22.290
to allow yourself to take job's charges against God seriously.

323
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.540
After all the narrator,
it makes it clear that God does take them seriously.

324
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.673
God,

325
00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:33.980
nowhere denies job's charges and in fact at one point the narrator has gods say

326
00:20:34.261 --> 00:20:35.880
that job has spoken truly.

327
00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.480
So no matter how uncomfortable job may make you feel,

328
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.050
you need to understand his claims and not condemn him.

329
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:49.490
Job is going to attack the optimistic conventional piety that is typified in the

330
00:20:50.201 --> 00:20:50.960
book of proverbs.

331
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.160
He's going to challenge the assumption that there is a moral world order.

332
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.450
The issues that are raised in this book are two fold.
First,

333
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.460
why God permits blatant injustice and undeserved suffering and evil to exist in

334
00:21:03.461 --> 00:21:05.500
the world.
And second of all,

335
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:10.360
whether people will be virtuous when they are afflicted and suffering.

336
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:15.370
In other words,
are people righteous only because God will reward them for it?

337
00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:19.180
Or are they righteous because of the intrinsic and inherent value of

338
00:21:19.181 --> 00:21:19.811
righteousness?

339
00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:24.811
Those are the two issues that literarily the book contains two primary elements.

340
00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:30.370
First,
we have a pros story and that provides a framework for the book.

341
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.690
That's chapters one and two,

342
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:35.380
and then it returns in chapter 42 at the end of the book,
uh,

343
00:21:35.381 --> 00:21:39.340
and into this prose narrative,
this,
this pros framework,

344
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.410
a large poetic section of dialogue and speeches has been inserted.

345
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.380
Okay,
so there are two main literary components.
Now,

346
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.980
the pros framework concerning a scrupulously righteous man named job afflicted

347
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:58.780
by horrendous calamity was probably a standard ancient near eastern folk tale of

348
00:21:58.781 --> 00:22:02.320
great antiquity.
The story isn't set in Israel.
It's not about an Israelite.

349
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:07.530
It's set in Edam job is an eastern magnate who dwells in the country of ooze.

350
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.920
Uh,
not an Israelite,
but the Israelite author has used this older,

351
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:16.840
ancient near eastern legend about a man named job for his own purposes.

352
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:20.510
Then named job,
which in Hebrew is pronounced Yoav,
um,

353
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.950
is sort of by Vaillant in meaning it can mean enemy and Hebrew,
um,

354
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:29.170
by changing vowels around.
But it's the route is the route for enemy or you have,

355
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:34.660
or if we take it in Aramaic,
it can mean one who repents a repentant one.

356
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.340
And as we're going to see,
um,

357
00:22:36.341 --> 00:22:40.300
the name will be appropriate in both senses as the story progresses.

358
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.240
I've given,
oh,
there's a handout on the side of the room.

359
00:22:43.241 --> 00:22:44.800
I'm not sure everyone took them when they came in.

360
00:22:44.801 --> 00:22:47.170
I'm wondering if it could be distributed please.
I'm sorry.

361
00:22:47.171 --> 00:22:49.630
It's going to help you chart,
uh,
what goes on in job.

362
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.250
But this handout contains an outline of the book structure on one side.

363
00:22:54.251 --> 00:22:56.200
So that's mapped out on one side.
On the other side,

364
00:22:56.201 --> 00:22:58.870
I have some important versus in terms,

365
00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.750
but we'll see from the outline of the structure.

366
00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:06.810
Chapters one and two have this pros prologue about the price and prosperous job.

367
00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.220
And his devastation,
which result,
which is the result of a challenge,

368
00:23:12.221 --> 00:23:17.050
which is put to God at the end of that prologue.
So at the end of chapter two,

369
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:22.150
he has three friends who come to sit with him in silence for seven days.

370
00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:24.800
Silence doesn't last very long.
Um,

371
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.930
because we move then into the large poetic section and that extends from chapter

372
00:23:28.931 --> 00:23:32.200
three all the way to chapter 42 verse seven.
All right,

373
00:23:32.201 --> 00:23:34.510
so you'll see that structure on the handout,

374
00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:39.370
there are many ways to map the structure of the,
of the book of job.

375
00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.870
Um,
your handout charts.
I think one of the more common and and,

376
00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:44.560
and clearer representations.

377
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:48.500
I'm looking now specifically at the poetic section.

378
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:53.540
First you have a dialogue between job and his three friends that goes from
third,

379
00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:56.480
from chapter three to chapter 31 verse 40.

380
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.690
And it can be divided into three cycles of speeches.

381
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:03.770
Job Opens each cycle.
So the first speech in each cycle is by job.

382
00:24:03.771 --> 00:24:06.830
And then his friends speak in a regular pattern.
First,

383
00:24:06.831 --> 00:24:10.910
Ellie fas with Joe Responding and then bill Dodd with Joe responding.

384
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.540
And then so far,
and you have this pattern of six speeches,

385
00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.940
it occurs three times,
but in fact,
the third time,
um,

386
00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:23.900
the reply by it so far is omitted and that deviation ensures the job has the

387
00:24:23.901 --> 00:24:25.940
first and the last word.
Um,

388
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:30.830
he has a summation speech in chapters 29 to 31.
At first,

389
00:24:30.831 --> 00:24:35.150
the friends seek to comfort job,
uh,
and to explain his suffering,

390
00:24:35.151 --> 00:24:37.940
but they become increasing increasingly harsh,

391
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:43.080
ultimately bearing a callous contempt for job's condition.
Um,

392
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.690
now this section closes with the long speech by job,
as I said,
29 to 31.

393
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:52.070
He's lamenting the loss of his past pleasant life.
He protested his innocence,

394
00:24:52.071 --> 00:24:55.580
he calls on God to answer,
but then Ellie,

395
00:24:55.581 --> 00:24:58.970
who this previously unannounced fourth friend appears,

396
00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:03.890
he gives four speeches from chapters 32 to 37.
He admonishes job,

397
00:25:03.891 --> 00:25:05.600
he defends God's justice.

398
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.900
And then this is followed by a poetic discourse between God and Job God who

399
00:25:11.391 --> 00:25:16.130
poses a series of rhetorical questions and Jobe who appears contrite.

400
00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:19.400
And that section also falls into four parts.

401
00:25:19.401 --> 00:25:23.300
Rather like Ellie who's speech you have two long speeches by halfway,

402
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.090
two short ones by job.
Finally,

403
00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:29.450
there's a concluding pros epilogue that vindicates job,

404
00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:34.940
God criticizes job's friends,
and then in a rather unexpected happy ending,

405
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:40.010
we have job restored to his fortunes and finally experiencing a peaceful death.

406
00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.740
So let's look at the contents in greater detail.

407
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.260
Now that we've reviewed the structure,
the story opens by introducing us to job.

408
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:51.230
He said to be a blameless and upright man.
He fears God and he shuns evil.

409
00:25:51.231 --> 00:25:52.850
That is chapter one verse one.

410
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:58.310
So the moral virtue and innocence of job is established in the opening line as a

411
00:25:58.311 --> 00:26:01.730
narrative fact,
a non negotiable narrative fact.

412
00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:07.150
And yet this job is to become the victim of a challenge issued by the Sutton in

413
00:26:07.641 --> 00:26:11.570
the heavenly council.
I say,
thus the time deliberately,
the Sutton,

414
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:13.790
that's the tongue is certainly not the devil.

415
00:26:13.791 --> 00:26:17.030
There's no such notion in the Hebrew Bible.
The phrase,

416
00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:22.060
thus aton occurs four times in the Hebrew Bible here and in numbers 22 and in

417
00:26:22.851 --> 00:26:27.020
Zechariah three thus a ton is simply a member of the divine council,

418
00:26:27.021 --> 00:26:32.021
one of God's minions whose function it is to investigate a on earth and to act

419
00:26:32.751 --> 00:26:34.520
as a kind of prosecuting attorney.

420
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:39.680
He has to bring evildoers to justice and it's only in later Jewish and

421
00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:43.860
especially Christian thought that the term loses the definite article from the

422
00:26:43.861 --> 00:26:45.300
Sutton,
which means the prosecutor,

423
00:26:45.301 --> 00:26:48.690
essentially the prosecuting attorney and becomes a proper name,

424
00:26:48.691 --> 00:26:52.470
capital s Satan for an enemy or opponent of God.

425
00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:58.010
This later concept of Satan develops as a means of explaining evil without

426
00:26:59.071 --> 00:27:02.850
attributing it to God,
but that isn't the function of the Sutton.

427
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.880
Here he works for God and when Cafe boasts of his pious servant Jobe,

428
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:13.850
the prosecuting Angel wonders as his portfolio requires him to do whether job's

429
00:27:14.311 --> 00:27:18.150
piety is sincere,
perhaps he's motivated by self interest.

430
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:21.750
Since he's been blessed with such good fortune and prosperity,

431
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.630
he's naturally enough pious and righteous,

432
00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.260
but would his piety survive affliction and suffering,

433
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.610
deprived of his wealth?
Wouldn't he curse God to his face?

434
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.390
And you have to notice as you're reading the the euphemistic use of blessed God

435
00:27:36.391 --> 00:27:39.690
instead of curse God.
Ancient writers did not want to write down curse God.

436
00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:42.270
So they wrote,
bless God,
but we need to understand that.

437
00:27:42.271 --> 00:27:47.250
So euphemistic way of avoiding writing curse got so wouldn't he curse God to his

438
00:27:47.251 --> 00:27:51.750
face?
And God is quite confident that job's piety is not superficial.

439
00:27:51.751 --> 00:27:54.000
It's not driven by the desire for reward.

440
00:27:54.001 --> 00:27:57.150
And so he permits this aton to put job to the test.

441
00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:01.710
Job's children are killed,
his cattle are destroyed,
his property is destroyed,

442
00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:05.550
but job's response in chapter one verse 21 is naked.

443
00:28:05.551 --> 00:28:08.670
I came from my mother's womb and naked I shall return.

444
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:13.260
God gives and God takes away.
May the name of the Lord be blessed.

445
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:17.940
And the narrator then adds in verse 22 in all this,
and if you flip over,

446
00:28:17.941 --> 00:28:21.270
I've got some of these key versus on the back of your handout to help you keep

447
00:28:21.271 --> 00:28:21.661
track.

448
00:28:21.661 --> 00:28:26.661
But in all this job did not sin or impute anything unsavory to God and God

449
00:28:28.351 --> 00:28:31.500
again,
praises job to the Satan.
This aton excuse me,

450
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:35.100
saying and still he holds onto his integrity.

451
00:28:35.101 --> 00:28:39.990
So you incited me to destroy him for nothing.
That's chapter two verse three.

452
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:44.970
So this aton proposes increasing the suffering and God agrees on the condition

453
00:28:44.971 --> 00:28:46.290
that job's life be preserved.

454
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.620
So this baton strikes job's body with these terrible,

455
00:28:49.621 --> 00:28:54.390
painful sores trying to crush his spirit and job's wife rages.

456
00:28:54.391 --> 00:28:58.050
Do you still hold on to your integrity?
Bless God,

457
00:28:58.051 --> 00:29:03.000
curse God and die.
Chapter two verse nine but still,
Joe will not sin.

458
00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:07.380
He will not curse God.
He insists on remaining virtuous and he responds,

459
00:29:07.381 --> 00:29:10.950
shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall We not receive evil?

460
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.470
So at first glance,
it would appear that job accepts his bitter fate.
But note,

461
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:18.630
after the first round of suffering,

462
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:23.130
the narrator observed that in all this job did not sin with his lips or impute

463
00:29:23.131 --> 00:29:24.690
anything unsavory to God.

464
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:29.460
But now he merely observes in all this job did not sin with his lips,

465
00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:34.920
not with his lips perhaps,
but in his heart did he impute unsavory things to God?

466
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:40.400
And if we were to move directly to the conclusion of the folktale in chapter 42

467
00:29:40.891 --> 00:29:44.590
if jumped from this point just to the conclusion in 42 verse seven is where the

468
00:29:44.591 --> 00:29:45.520
conclusion begins,

469
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:50.050
we would find that job is rewarded fully for his patients and his steadfast

470
00:29:50.051 --> 00:29:55.051
loyalty and his household and his belongings are restored to him twice over the

471
00:29:55.301 --> 00:30:00.301
folktale standing alone could be read as the story of an innocent man tested who

472
00:30:01.001 --> 00:30:03.250
accepts his faith.
He have his fate,

473
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:06.970
he retains his faith and he's rewarded standing alone.

474
00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:11.170
The tail appears to reflect the values and the conventional piety of the wisdom

475
00:30:11.171 --> 00:30:13.360
literature and of the Deuteronomistic school.

476
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:16.210
But the folktale doesn't stand alone.

477
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:21.630
The anonymous author of job uses this earlier legend concerning the righteous

478
00:30:22.121 --> 00:30:24.820
man job as a frame for his own purposes.

479
00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.250
And the hint at the end of the prologue,

480
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:32.280
that job perhaps is beginning to impute unsavory things to God points forward to

481
00:30:32.441 --> 00:30:35.830
this extensive poetic dialogue.
Um,
that's following.

482
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.150
And here our job's unsavory accusations against God.

483
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:44.890
Here we have a most impatient and furious job who will charge God with gross

484
00:30:44.891 --> 00:30:46.300
mismanagement of the world.

485
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:50.230
And eventually deny the existence of a moral order altogether.

486
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:55.270
So reading the book of job is a fascinating exercise because the two types of

487
00:30:55.271 --> 00:30:59.200
material in the book,
the pros frame and the poetic dialogue in the middle,

488
00:30:59.201 --> 00:31:03.490
they appear to be intention and yet interwoven as they are.

489
00:31:03.491 --> 00:31:07.630
Now they work together and the one shapes our reading of the other,

490
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:13.230
our reception of the accusations of job's friends in the poetic dialogue,

491
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:17.590
our reception of those words is determined by the pros frameworks assertion that

492
00:31:17.591 --> 00:31:20.410
Joe was innocent.
That's a nonnegotiable narrative fact.

493
00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:23.650
And because of that fact of job's righteousness,

494
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:27.970
we know job's friends are lying when they say Joe must be suffering for some

495
00:31:27.971 --> 00:31:28.804
hidden sin.

496
00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:33.040
And we know that job's self defense that he hasn't deserved the suffering is

497
00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:33.874
correct.

498
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.630
We're going to rehearse some of the arguments that are advanced in the central

499
00:31:37.631 --> 00:31:39.730
core of the poetic core of the book.
Um,

500
00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.160
and here I think a helpful guide through the argument.
There are lots of,

501
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:44.260
lots of commentaries on the book of job.
Um,

502
00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:48.040
but one commentary that I think is helpful in just sort of working through some

503
00:31:48.041 --> 00:31:51.850
of the arguments of the interlocutors is the analysis of Edwin.
Good.

504
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:56.680
Although job doesn't exactly curse God in his first speech,

505
00:31:56.681 --> 00:32:01.681
he does curse the day of his birth and in a passage that alludes repeatedly to

506
00:32:01.751 --> 00:32:06.430
creation job essentially curses all that God has accomplished as creator of the

507
00:32:06.431 --> 00:32:07.264
cosmos.

508
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:11.680
He wishes he were dead and at this point he doesn't even ask why this has

509
00:32:11.681 --> 00:32:12.460
happened to him.

510
00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:17.460
He only asks why he should be alive when he prefers death and Eleaf has his

511
00:32:17.591 --> 00:32:21.580
reply is long and elaborate and he seems to offer comfort.

512
00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:25.780
He seems to offer comfort until he injects a new element in the discussion.

513
00:32:25.781 --> 00:32:27.550
And that's the element of justice.

514
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:32.650
Job hasn't mentioned the issue of justice at this point,
but Ellie fas says,

515
00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.040
think now what innocent man ever perished?

516
00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.380
Where have the upright been destroyed?

517
00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:42.500
As I seen those who plow evil and so mischief reap them.
Chapter four,

518
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:45.380
verses seven and eight.
So eleaf has his hand in job.

519
00:32:45.381 --> 00:32:50.030
The Standard Line of Biblical wisdom literature as exemplified by something like

520
00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:54.500
the book of proverbs,
belief in a system of divine retro,
retributive justice,

521
00:32:54.501 --> 00:32:54.800
right?

522
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:59.800
That retribution is just by definition there can be no undeserved suffering.

523
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:03.680
The implication is that job has deserved this suffering.

524
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.050
A thought that apparently hadn't occurred to Joe,

525
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.010
and the question of undeserved suffering is now going to dominate the rest of

526
00:33:10.011 --> 00:33:14.480
the discussion and job.
Second speech is very disorderly.
It's full of wild,

527
00:33:14.481 --> 00:33:18.890
contradictory images that may reflect the shock and the pain and the rage that

528
00:33:18.891 --> 00:33:19.910
now overwhelmed him.

529
00:33:19.911 --> 00:33:23.630
He seems to be haunted by Eleaf has his connection of his suffering with some

530
00:33:23.631 --> 00:33:28.040
sin,
and so he turns to address God directly.
He admits he's not perfect,

531
00:33:28.041 --> 00:33:31.250
but surely he objects he doesn't deserve such affliction.

532
00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:37.080
And in Chapter Eight we have Bill Dad's speech and it's tactless and unkind.

533
00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.540
He says,
well,
God,
pervert the right will,
the Almighty pervert justice.

534
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:45.320
If your son's sinned against him,
he dispatched them for their transgressions.

535
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:49.370
In other words,
God is perfectly just and ultimately all get what they deserve.

536
00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:53.210
Indeed your children job must've died because they sinned.

537
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.730
So just search for God and ask for mercy.

538
00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:01.870
The friends speeches lead job to the conclusion that God must be indifferent to

539
00:34:01.911 --> 00:34:06.410
moral status.
God doesn't follow the rules that he demands of human beings.

540
00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:11.411
It's chapter nine verse 22 he finishes off both perfect and wicked when job

541
00:34:11.931 --> 00:34:14.780
complains,
he wounds me much for nothing.

542
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:19.970
Chapter nine verse 17 he's echoing God's own words to the Sutton in the

543
00:34:19.971 --> 00:34:22.850
prologue.
Remember,
when God says to this,
it's on,

544
00:34:22.851 --> 00:34:25.400
you have incited me to destroy him for nothing.

545
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:29.810
And we suspect by this verbal coincidence that job is right.

546
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:35.800
Legal terms dominate as job calls for the charges against him to be published.

547
00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:39.020
And then he hurls countercharges in a suit against God,

548
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:43.790
charges of unworthy conduct of spurning his creatures while smiling on the

549
00:34:43.791 --> 00:34:47.480
wicked on scrutinizing job,
even though he knows job to be innocent.

550
00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:52.840
And this too is a subversion of a comic common prophetic literary genre that

551
00:34:53.001 --> 00:34:53.661
we've seen,
right?

552
00:34:53.661 --> 00:34:57.680
The Reeve or the Covenant lawsuit in which God through his prophets charges

553
00:34:57.681 --> 00:35:02.681
Israel with flagrant a flagrant violation of the terms of the covenant and warns

554
00:35:02.961 --> 00:35:05.390
of inevitable punishment here in job.

555
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:10.250
It's a man who arranged God and yet job asserts.

556
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.100
Since God is God and not a human adversary,

557
00:35:13.101 --> 00:35:17.360
there's really no fair way for the lawsuit between them to be tried or

558
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.300
arbitrated.
Man Cannot win a suit against God.

559
00:35:20.301 --> 00:35:24.650
Chapter nine verse two job is powerless in the face of this injustice.

560
00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.120
These ideas,

561
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:31.270
I'll find expression in job 10 verses one through seven I am disgusted with

562
00:35:31.341 --> 00:35:36.080
life.
I will give rain to my complaints,
speak in the bitterness of my soul.

563
00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:40.740
I say to do not condemn me.
Let me know what you charge me with.

564
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:42.930
Does it benefit you to defraud,

565
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:47.220
to despise the toil of your hands while smiling on the counsel of the wicked?

566
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.290
Do you have the eyes of flesh?

567
00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:53.830
Is your vision that of mere man are your days,
the days of a mortal?

568
00:35:53.831 --> 00:35:54.601
Are Your years,

569
00:35:54.601 --> 00:35:58.440
the years of a man that you seek my iniquity and search out my sin?

570
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:03.300
You know that I am not guilty and that there is none to deliver from your hand.

571
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:09.090
Joe Repeats his wish to die this time less because of the suffering and more

572
00:36:09.091 --> 00:36:11.310
because his worldview has collapsed.

573
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
He sees that divine power is utterly divorced from justice and that's a second

574
00:36:17.311 --> 00:36:20.070
fundamental biblical assumption.
Subverted,

575
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.760
but job's words only seem to egg his interlocutors.
On eleaf.

576
00:36:25.761 --> 00:36:28.140
Oz had implied that Joe was a sinner.

577
00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:32.420
Bill Dodd had baldly asserted that his son had died for their sins and now it's

578
00:36:32.421 --> 00:36:35.880
so far it's going to claim that actually job is suffering less than he deserves

579
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.040
and job isn't persuaded.

580
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:41.430
He hasn't persuaded that he has sinned or more precisely that he has sinned in

581
00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:45.540
proportion to the punishment.
He is now suffering.
God is simply unjust.

582
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:51.230
The job of this poetic dialogue portion of the book is hardly patient or pious.

583
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.770
He is angry,
he's violent.
He argues,
he complains,

584
00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:00.890
and he vehemently insists upon his innocence in the fourth speech by job.

585
00:37:01.501 --> 00:37:04.320
Now this is the speech that opens the second cycle of speeches.

586
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.780
Job Appeals to creation.

587
00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:11.790
God's controlling power is arbitrary and unprincipled.

588
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:15.900
He interferes with the natural order.
He interferes with the human order.

589
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:21.140
And this is itself a subversion of the genesis portrait of creation as a process

590
00:37:21.331 --> 00:37:25.050
whose goal and crown is humankind.
Again,

591
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:26.850
job demands a trial.

592
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:30.570
He demands a trial in the widely quoted and miss translated verse.

593
00:37:30.571 --> 00:37:35.550
This is job 13,
verse 15.
He may well slay me.
I have no hope,

594
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.150
but I must argue my case before him.
In other words,

595
00:37:39.151 --> 00:37:42.720
job knows that he can't win,
but he still wants his day in court.

596
00:37:42.721 --> 00:37:45.420
He wants to make his accusation of God's mismanagement.

597
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:49.620
He wants to voice his protest even though he knows that we'll gain him nothing.

598
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:54.390
And in a pun on his name,
Yoav Job Asks God,

599
00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.320
why do you hide your face and treat me like an enemy?

600
00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:59.140
Treat me like an oh you have.
Um,

601
00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:02.820
13 verse 28 in his second speech,

602
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.270
job fully expects to be murdered,
not executed,

603
00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:11.280
but murdered by God and hopes only that the evidence of his murder will not be

604
00:38:11.281 --> 00:38:13.770
concealed.
He says in 16 verse 18,

605
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.910
Earth do not cover my blood and job's third speech.

606
00:38:17.911 --> 00:38:19.080
Reiterate this desire,

607
00:38:19.081 --> 00:38:23.220
the desire that the wrong against him not be forgotten would that my words were

608
00:38:23.221 --> 00:38:27.240
written would that they were engraved in an inscription with an iron stylists

609
00:38:27.241 --> 00:38:30.060
and led forever in rock.
They were incised.

610
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:35.210
Chapter 19 Verses 23 to 24 job's three speeches in the second cycle become

611
00:38:37.121 --> 00:38:39.550
increasingly emotional and for their part,

612
00:38:39.551 --> 00:38:44.440
the speeches of his friends in this cycle become increasingly cruel.

613
00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:48.540
Their insistence that suffering is always a sign of sure.

614
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:52.160
A sure sign of sin seems to justify,
um,

615
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.850
hostility towards and contempt for job.

616
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:59.770
He's now depicted as universally mocked and humiliated and despised and abused

617
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.450
and one cannot help but see in this characterization of job's friends,

618
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.500
so-called friends and incisive commentary on the Callus,

619
00:39:08.501 --> 00:39:11.560
human propensity to blame the victim and to do so.

620
00:39:11.561 --> 00:39:15.460
Let's start tidy and comfortable picture of a moral universe in which the

621
00:39:15.461 --> 00:39:18.910
righteous do not suffer,
should come apart at the seams.

622
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:23.800
As job's has job opens the third cycle of speeches,

623
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:28.750
urging his friends to look to really see his situation.
Because if they did,

624
00:39:28.751 --> 00:39:29.800
they would be appalled.

625
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:35.280
Job's situation looked at honestly requires the admission that God has done this

626
00:39:35.411 --> 00:39:38.690
for no reason and that the friends understanding of the world is a lie.

627
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:42.550
Job Asserts baldly.
There is no distributor of justice.

628
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:47.580
There's no coherent or orderly system of morality in this life or any other.

629
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:52.780
There is no principle of afterlife after all in the Hebrew Bible Chapter 21

630
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:58.440
verses seven through 26 why do the wicked live on prosper and grow wealthy?

631
00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:02.590
Their children are with them always and they see their children's children.

632
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:06.640
Their homes are secure without fear.
They do not feel the rod of God,

633
00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.270
their children's skip about.
They sing to the music of Timberland,

634
00:40:10.271 --> 00:40:12.340
loot and revel to the tune of the pipe.

635
00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:16.630
They spend their days and happiness and go down to Shay,
Ole and peace.

636
00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:20.800
How seldom does the lamp of the wicked fail does the calamity they deserve

637
00:40:20.801 --> 00:40:25.120
befall them?
You say God is reserving his punishment for his sons.

638
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:29.650
Let it be paid back to him that he may feel it.
One man dies and robust,

639
00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:31.480
healthful,
tranquil and untroubled.

640
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:35.710
His pails are full of milk is the marrow of his bones.
His juicy.

641
00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.550
Another dies embittered,
never having tasted happiness.

642
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:42.760
They both lie in the dust and are covered with worms,

643
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:47.470
but the friends can't look honestly at job.
They can't allow that.

644
00:40:47.471 --> 00:40:52.471
Indeed a righteous man suffers horribly by the end of the third cycle.

645
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:57.160
Job is ready and eager for his trial,
but he can't find God.

646
00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:02.880
Job's final speech in the third cycle focuses on this theme of divine absence.

647
00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:08.220
God is irresponsibly absent from the world and the result is human wickedness.

648
00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:12.070
So from the idea that God is morally neutral or indifferent,

649
00:41:12.071 --> 00:41:16.780
job has moved to the implicit charge that God is responsible for wickedness.

650
00:41:16.781 --> 00:41:20.080
He rewards,
we can just see causes wickedness by his absence,

651
00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.240
his failure to govern properly.

652
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:26.830
He is both corrupt and a corruptor of others.
If it is not.

653
00:41:26.831 --> 00:41:30.820
So he says,
who will prove me a liar and bring my words to not.

654
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.730
And yet even in the depths of his anguish,

655
00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:39.800
and even though he is now convinced that God does not enforce a moral law in the

656
00:41:39.801 --> 00:41:43.190
uniform,
in the universe,
job clings to one value.

657
00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:48.920
Righteousness is a virtue in and of itself.
And even if it brings no reward,

658
00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:54.070
job will not give up his righteousness face to face with a shocking insight that

659
00:41:54.291 --> 00:41:57.050
good and evil are met with indifference by God.

660
00:41:57.051 --> 00:42:01.310
That righteousness brings no reward and wickedness.
No punishment job,

661
00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:05.030
although bitter refuses to succumb to a moral neorealism.

662
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:10.300
Chapter 26 verses two through six by God who has deprived me of justice by Shit,

663
00:42:11.711 --> 00:42:16.711
die who has embittered my life as long as there is life in me and God's breath

664
00:42:16.881 --> 00:42:17.870
is in my nostrils,

665
00:42:17.871 --> 00:42:22.871
my lips will speak no wrong nor my tongue utter deceit far be it from me to say

666
00:42:23.271 --> 00:42:27.260
that you are right until I die,
I will maintain my integrity.

667
00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:30.680
I persist in my righteousness and will not yield.

668
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.650
I shall be free of reproach as long as I live.

669
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.680
And these last lines recall called the words of God.

670
00:42:36.681 --> 00:42:40.910
And this aton in the prelude at the time had said that a man will not hold on to

671
00:42:40.911 --> 00:42:43.760
virtue or to righteousness in the face of suffering,

672
00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:46.220
you'll give everything away for his life.

673
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:50.840
So this narrative setup guides or influences our interpretation of job's

674
00:42:50.841 --> 00:42:53.990
statement here.
Although he is losing his life,

675
00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:57.530
job says he will not give anything away,
but he holds on to.

676
00:42:57.531 --> 00:43:02.330
He maintains his integrity just as God had scolded this aton in chapter two

677
00:43:02.331 --> 00:43:05.960
verse three which reads still,
he holds onto his integrity.

678
00:43:05.961 --> 00:43:10.400
You have incited me to destroy him for nothing.
So in his darkest,

679
00:43:10.401 --> 00:43:13.400
most bitter hour,
with all hope of reward,
gone,

680
00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:18.080
job clings to the one thing he has his own righteousness.
In fact,

681
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:20.900
when all hope of adjust,
reward is gone,

682
00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.780
then righteousness becomes an intrinsic value.

683
00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:28.700
It has scaled Koufman writes of this moment the poet raises job to the bleak

684
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:33.680
summit of righteousness,
bereft of hope,
bereft of faith and divine justice.

685
00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:36.290
Or in the words of another scholar,
Moshe Greenberg.

686
00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:41.560
We see here the sheer heroism of a naked man for seek and by his God and his

687
00:43:41.751 --> 00:43:44.930
friends and bereft of a clue to understand his suffering,

688
00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:49.550
still maintaining faith in the value of his virtue and in the absolute duty of

689
00:43:49.551 --> 00:43:54.260
man to be virtuous.
The universe has turned its back on him.
We may add,

690
00:43:54.261 --> 00:43:56.270
he believes God has turned his back on him,

691
00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:01.250
yet Joe persists in the affirmation of his own worth and the transcendent worth

692
00:44:01.251 --> 00:44:02.780
of unrewarded.
Good.

693
00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:07.970
So in a way then for all their differences and style and manner,

694
00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:13.310
the patient job of the legend and the raging job of the poetic dialogue are

695
00:44:13.311 --> 00:44:18.311
basically the same man each ultimately remains from and his moral character

696
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:23.270
cleaned to righteousness because of its intrinsic value and not because it will

697
00:44:23.271 --> 00:44:24.104
be rewarded.

698
00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:29.350
Indeed job knows bitterly that it will not at the end of his outburst job Suze

699
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.273
God,

700
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:37.650
he issued him a summons and he demands that God revealed to him the reason for

701
00:44:37.651 --> 00:44:42.420
his suffering job pronounces a series of curses to clear himself from the

702
00:44:42.421 --> 00:44:47.040
accusations against him specifying the sins he has not committed an ending as he

703
00:44:47.041 --> 00:44:50.370
began in chapter three with a curse on the day of his birth.

704
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:52.230
And we expect to hear from God now,

705
00:44:52.231 --> 00:44:55.270
but instead we hear from an unannounced stranger Ellie,

706
00:44:55.271 --> 00:44:58.230
who I'm going to have to give Ellie who short shrift.
Um,

707
00:44:58.231 --> 00:45:02.670
he's the only one of the four interlocutors to refer to Joe by name,

708
00:45:02.671 --> 00:45:04.560
address Joe by name.
He retired.

709
00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:09.360
He repeats many of the trite assertions of job's friends.
He does hint,

710
00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.660
um,
however,
that not all suffering is punitive.

711
00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:17.880
He also hints that contemplation of Nature's elements can open the mind to a new

712
00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:21.570
awareness of God.
And in these two respects,
Ellie,

713
00:45:21.571 --> 00:45:25.500
who's speech moves us towards God's answer from the storm.

714
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.990
So in the climactic moment,

715
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:32.940
God answers job in an extraordinary theophany or self manifestation.

716
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:37.290
And Chapter 38 God speaks out of the tempest,
a whirlwind.

717
00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:41.550
Who is this who darkens counsel speaking without knowledge?

718
00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:45.930
Is he referring to Joe?
To Ellie,
who?
The three friends.
All of them,

719
00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:50.130
God has heard enough.
It's his turn to ask questions.

720
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.430
The answers to which are clearly implied.
These are rhetorical questions.

721
00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:56.580
Where were you when I laid the earth's foundations?
Speak.

722
00:45:56.581 --> 00:46:00.330
If you have understanding,
do you know who fixed its dimensions are?

723
00:46:00.331 --> 00:46:03.030
Who measured it with a line?
You did.
God.

724
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:07.470
Have you ever commanded the day to break assigned the dawn?
It's place.

725
00:46:07.471 --> 00:46:11.640
Have you penetrated to the sources of the sea or walked in the recesses of the

726
00:46:11.641 --> 00:46:13.080
deep?
No.
No.

727
00:46:13.081 --> 00:46:16.860
Human has and got continues with these rhetorical questions.

728
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:20.190
Questions regarding the animals,
they're various powers and attributes,

729
00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:24.390
but one wonders what the purpose of all these questions is.

730
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:27.450
One senses that they are irrelevant.

731
00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:33.030
Job has posed some very specific challenges to God.
Why am I suffering?

732
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:34.920
Is there a pattern to existence?

733
00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:39.720
Is God's refusal to answer these challenges a way of saying there is no answer

734
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:45.050
or is it God's way of saying that justice is beyond human understanding or is

735
00:46:45.151 --> 00:46:50.100
this the often the of God in nature and the focus on creation and implicit

736
00:46:50.101 --> 00:46:55.101
assault on the fundamental tenant of Israelite religion that God is known and

737
00:46:55.501 --> 00:46:59.630
made manifest to his interactions with humans is rewards and punishments and

738
00:46:59.631 --> 00:47:00.690
historical time.

739
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:06.960
You'll recall that the monotheistic revolution is generally understood to have

740
00:47:06.961 --> 00:47:11.490
affected a break from mythological conceptions of the gods as indistinguishable

741
00:47:11.491 --> 00:47:14.970
from various natural forces limited by Mehta,

742
00:47:14.971 --> 00:47:17.100
divine powers and forces of the cosmos.

743
00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:20.550
The biblical God wasn't another ancient near eastern or Canaanite nature,

744
00:47:20.551 --> 00:47:24.330
God ultimately,
uh,
but a wholly transcendent power.

745
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.140
He was figured this way in many parts of the Bible known not through the

746
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:30.850
involuntary and recurring cycles of nature,

747
00:47:30.851 --> 00:47:35.350
but through his freely willed and non repeating actions in historical time.

748
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:39.430
Such a view of God underwrites the whole system of divine,

749
00:47:39.431 --> 00:47:40.660
retributive justice,

750
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:45.870
only an essentially good God who transcends and is unconstrained by mechanistic.

751
00:47:46.511 --> 00:47:51.340
Natural forces can establish and administer a system of retributive justice,

752
00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:55.960
dealing out punishment and reward in response to the actions of humans in time

753
00:47:56.590 --> 00:48:00.970
is the author of job's suggesting that history and the events that befall the

754
00:48:00.971 --> 00:48:04.450
just and the unjust are not the medium of revelation.

755
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:09.630
Is God a god of nature after all encountered in the repeating cycles of the

756
00:48:10.241 --> 00:48:15.241
natural world and not in the unpredictable and incoherent arena of human history

757
00:48:15.551 --> 00:48:17.140
and action?
If so,

758
00:48:17.141 --> 00:48:21.670
then this is a third fundamental biblical assumption that has been radically

759
00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:22.563
subverted.

760
00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.880
So we'll turn now to God's direct speech to job in 48 and 40 verse eight.

761
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:31.090
Excuse me.
What do you impugn my justice?

762
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:34.990
Would you condemn me that you'd be right and God,

763
00:48:34.991 --> 00:48:38.860
I think is now getting at the heart of the matter.
Your friend's job were wrong.

764
00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:42.460
They condemned you,
they attributed sin to you so that they might be right,

765
00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.850
but you two have been wrong condemning me,

766
00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:49.060
attributing wickedness to me so that you might be right.

767
00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:53.980
Job's friends aired because they assumed that there's a system of retributive

768
00:48:53.981 --> 00:48:55.360
justice at work in the world,

769
00:48:55.361 --> 00:48:59.140
and that assumption led them to infer that all who suffer are sinful,

770
00:48:59.141 --> 00:49:02.470
and that's a blatant falsehood,
but job also heirs.

771
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:06.520
If he assumes that although there isn't a system of retributive justice,

772
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.690
there really ought to be one,

773
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:12.910
and it's that assumption that leads him to infer that suffering is the sign of

774
00:49:12.911 --> 00:49:16.420
an indifferent or wicked God,
and that's equally a falsehood.

775
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.740
Job needs to move beyond the anthropocentric,

776
00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:24.610
the anthropocentrism that characterizes the rest of scripture and the genesis

777
00:49:24.611 --> 00:49:29.611
one account of creation according to which humankind is the goal of the entire

778
00:49:29.711 --> 00:49:32.530
process of creation.
God's creation.

779
00:49:32.531 --> 00:49:37.090
The book of job seems to suggest defies such teleological and rational

780
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:39.340
categories.
In a nutshell,

781
00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:42.220
God refuses to be seen as a moral accountant.

782
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.440
The idea of God is a moral accountant is responsible for two major errors,

783
00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:52.540
the interpretation of suffering as an indicator of sin or the description of

784
00:49:52.541 --> 00:49:57.160
injustice to God and in his final speech,
job confesses to a new job,

785
00:49:57.161 --> 00:49:57.671
excuse me,

786
00:49:57.671 --> 00:50:02.470
job confesses to a new firsthand knowledge of God that he lacked before.

787
00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:05.020
And as a result of this knowledge,
job repents.

788
00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:08.410
Therefore I recant and relent being but dust and ashes.

789
00:50:08.411 --> 00:50:12.370
Chapter 42 verse six and here we see the other meaning of job's name,

790
00:50:12.371 --> 00:50:17.200
one who repents suddenly leap to the fore.
What is he repenting of?

791
00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:21.620
Certainly not of sin.
God has not upheld the accusations against job.
Indeed,

792
00:50:21.621 --> 00:50:25.150
he states explicitly in a moment that the friends were wrong to say he had

793
00:50:25.151 --> 00:50:28.580
sinned,
but he has indicated that guilt and innocence,

794
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:31.790
reward and punishment are not what the game is all about.

795
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.960
And while job had long been disabused of the notion that the wicked and the

796
00:50:35.961 --> 00:50:37.760
righteous actually get what they deserve,

797
00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:41.360
he nevertheless had clung to the idea that ideally they should,

798
00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:43.100
and it's that mistaken idea,

799
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:46.100
that idea that led him to a scribe wickedness to God,

800
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:51.250
that job now recants with this new understanding of God job is liberated from

801
00:50:51.771 --> 00:50:56.390
what he would now see as a false expectation raised by the Deuteronomistic

802
00:50:56.391 --> 00:51:00.410
notion of a covenant relationship between God and humankind and forced by a

803
00:51:00.411 --> 00:51:03.230
system of divine justice.
They end of the story.

804
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:07.550
Job is fully restored to his fortunes.
God asserts he did no evil,

805
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:12.740
and the conventional impeccably Deuteronomistic view of the three friends is

806
00:51:12.741 --> 00:51:16.040
clearly denounced by God.
He says of them,
they have not spoken of me.

807
00:51:16.041 --> 00:51:19.490
What is right as my servant job has?
For some,

808
00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:22.040
the happy ending seems anticlimactic,

809
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:26.630
a capitulation to the demand for a happy ending of just desserts that runs

810
00:51:26.631 --> 00:51:29.390
counter to the whole thrust of the book,
and yet in a way,

811
00:51:29.391 --> 00:51:31.280
I think the ending is superbly fitting.

812
00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:36.140
It's the last in a series of reversals that subverts our expectations.

813
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:40.580
Suffering comes inexplicably sodas,
restoration.
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

814
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:44.960
God doesn't attempt to justify or explain job's suffering.

815
00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:48.740
And yet somehow by the end of the book are grumbling,
Dis dis,
um,

816
00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:53.420
disable are grumbling,
embittered,
raging job is satisfied.

817
00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:58.040
Perhaps he's realized that an automatic principle of reward and punishment would

818
00:51:58.041 --> 00:52:02.030
make it impossible for humans to do the good for purely disinterested motives.

819
00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:06.050
It's precisely when righteousness is seemed to be absurd and meaningless,

820
00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:09.710
that the choice to be righteous paradoxically becomes meaningful.

821
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:14.330
God and job,
however we are to interpret their speeches are reconciled.

822
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:19.130
The suffering and injustice that characterize the world have baffled humankind

823
00:52:19.131 --> 00:52:19.850
from Millennia.

824
00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:24.080
And the book of job provides no answer in the sense of an explanation or a

825
00:52:24.081 --> 00:52:26.450
justification of suffering and injustice.

826
00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:31.660
But what it does offer is a stern warning to avoid the Scylla of blast feeling

827
00:52:32.121 --> 00:52:36.080
against the victims by assuming their wickedness and the Caribbeans of

828
00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:41.220
blaspheming against God by assuming his nor his moral Neil ism and option as our

829
00:52:41.811 --> 00:52:46.430
hero yearning for,
but ultimately renouncing divine order.

830
00:52:46.431 --> 00:52:50.960
And justice clings to his integrity and chooses virtue for nothing.
