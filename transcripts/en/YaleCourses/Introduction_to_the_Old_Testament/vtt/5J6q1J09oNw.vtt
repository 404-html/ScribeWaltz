1
00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.360
Yeah,
let's go ahead and get started.
There's a lot to cover,

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.430
but I want to try to unite a lot of these disparate parts of the Bible,

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.160
the mini small books clustered here at the end that we'll be considering.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.370
I'm going to try to unite them by elaborating certain themes as we move through

5
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:18.780
them.
Um,
but as you can see from this giant chart,
um,
there's quite a bit.

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.420
First,
let's begin with the book of Ruth.

7
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.050
The book of Ruth is set in the days of the judges,
right?

8
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:27.930
That's the opening line of the book tells you that this happened in the days of

9
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:30.420
the judges,
but it was certainly written later.

10
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.800
And whether it was post exists or preexist like is not certain.

11
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:38.520
So we're going to be asking the questions of a canonical critic,

12
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.620
whatever its origin.
How did this book function for Second Temple Jews?

13
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.960
As the story of a foreign woman who's foreign status is continually emphasized

14
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.740
throughout the book,
Ruth the Moabite,
Ruth the Moabite mobike tests,
um,

15
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.020
as a foreign woman who acts no bleed and enters the community of Israel by

16
00:00:58.021 --> 00:00:58.854
choice,

17
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.420
this story would have stood in opposition to the negative view of foreigners,

18
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:08.160
the ban on intermarriage and the purely geological definition of Israelite

19
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:12.780
identity that was promulgated by Ezra and Nehemiah in the post exhilarate
period.

20
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.450
So in the story,
you have a famine in Judah and that causes a Bethlehemite man,

21
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.310
Ellie Mellon,
uh,
and his wife,
no,
me and their two children to leave Judah.

22
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:27.660
They're going to reside in the country of Moab where the Moabites live and their

23
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:32.010
two sons marry Moabite women,
Orpah and Ruth.

24
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.570
You have to consider the effect that these opening verses would have had on an

25
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:38.970
ancient Israelite listener or reader.

26
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.110
Moab was a hostile neighbor on Israel,
south eastern boarder,

27
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.160
and the Moabites were hated for their ill treatment of the Israelites when they

28
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:49.620
were traveling to the promise land.

29
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.970
Their lack of hospitality had already led to a prohibition of intermarriage in

30
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:54.721
the Torah itself.

31
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:58.230
So the Moabites and the ammonites are two foreign groups that are explicitly

32
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:02.730
prohibited from entering the congregation in Deuteronomy 23 and these are
lights,

33
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:07.731
low opinion of the Moabites is also expressed in genesis in the very degrading

34
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.640
story of moabs dissent from the incestuous relationship between lot and one of

35
00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:16.800
his daughters after the fall of Saddam.

36
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.650
And yet here we read in the opening lines of this story,

37
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:24.510
a man from Bethlehem who travels to Moab and his two sons marry Moabite women.

38
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.150
And then in short order Ellie Malik and his two sons who are appropriately named

39
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:33.030
sickness and death by the way,
in Hebrew,
um,
they die.

40
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.260
And the Israelite widow Naomi is left now with no blood relation,

41
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:38.460
no blood male relation,

42
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.110
only her two Moabite daughters in law and the Omi,
we,

43
00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:47.550
Billy tells the girls that they should return to their father's home.
She's poor,

44
00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:49.680
she'll never be able to support them as a poor widow.

45
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.620
She has no further sons to give to them.

46
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:57.621
And clearly they have no legal or moral obligation or tie to Naomi.

47
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.680
And we'll pick up the story then in chapter one verse 11 but Naomi replied,

48
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:05.170
turn back my daughters,
why should you go with me?

49
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.410
Have I any more sons in my body who might be husbands for you?

50
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.020
Turn back my daughters.
Why am too old to be married?

51
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.730
And even if I thought there was hope for me,

52
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:15.580
even if I'm married tonight and I also bore sons,

53
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.700
should you wait for them to grow up?
Should you on their account?

54
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.940
Debar yourselves from marriage.
Oh No,
my daughters,

55
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.720
my lot is far more bitter than yours for the hand of the Lord has struck out

56
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:29.960
against me and they broke into weeping again and Orpah kissed her mother in law,

57
00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:34.060
a farewell.
But Ruth Clung to her.
So she said,
see,

58
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:36.790
your sister in law has returned to her people and her gods.

59
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.640
Go follow your sister in law.
But Ruth replied,

60
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:44.350
do not urge me to leave you to turn back and not follow you for wherever you go.

61
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:46.420
I will go wherever you lodge.

62
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.620
I will lodge your people shall be my people and your God,
my God,

63
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.520
where you die,
I will die and there I will be buried thus and more.

64
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:57.400
May the Lord do to me if even death parts me from you.

65
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.280
And when Naomi saw how determined she was to go with her,

66
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:04.990
she ceased to argue with her.
And the two went on until they reached Bethlehem.

67
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.640
All of the names in the story are wonderfully.

68
00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:10.480
Symbolic is a sickness and death is like they walk on the stage with a big sign

69
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:12.220
saying I'm in a bit part and I'm ready to die.

70
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.050
Or Ppas name means the back of the neck because she turns her back on on her

71
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:17.884
mother-in-law.
Uh,

72
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.180
as well as the wonderful story with lots of names symbolisms but by the force of

73
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:23.140
sheer conviction,

74
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.000
Ruth joints herself to the people of her mother in law and back in Judah.

75
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.470
Ruth supports her mother in law and herself by gleaning the fallen.

76
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.010
She leaves behind the reapers in the field because according to the pentitude,

77
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.850
the sheaves that fall behind the reapers must be left for the poor to collect.

78
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:41.050
You don't go back and collect them.

79
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.730
So Ruth gleans and she gleans in the field of a kinsmen named bars,

80
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.930
and he's a man of,

81
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.070
he's described as a man of substance and she's very diligent and she soon comes

82
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:54.090
to his attention and he's very kind for her.
He,

83
00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:55.840
he looks out for her safety among the,

84
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.260
the rough fieldworkers he provides water for her.

85
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.310
He's heard of what Ruth has done for an Omi,

86
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.220
how she left her home and left her family to come to a people that she really

87
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:09.790
didn't know.
And he blesses her.
He says,
may the Lord reward your deeds.

88
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.030
May you have a full recompense from the Lord,
the God of Israel,

89
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.040
under whose wings you have sought refuge chapter two verse 12 and he increases

90
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:19.630
his generosity,
generosity.

91
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:24.631
He shares his meal with Ruth and gives her from the heaps of green in addition

92
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.770
to the gleanings that she's collecting.

93
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.610
So Naomi is very delighted with a reus gleanings.

94
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:32.410
They more than suffice for their needs,

95
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:37.411
but she's even more learn to please at Ruth's seems to have found favor in the

96
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:41.290
eyes of Boaz.
He's being very kind and generous and she points out,
you know,

97
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:45.430
he is among our redeeming kinsmen.
Now the term here,

98
00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:49.060
the Hebrew term is go l go l means redeemer.
In fact,

99
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:50.830
in a lot of the Christian language later,

100
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.770
this is the word they're using when they talk about my redeemer liveth.

101
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:55.950
It's simply this word go l and the go.

102
00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.710
Al Is a person who as the nearest relative or as a close relative,

103
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.370
has certain legal legal obligations to another person.

104
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.260
And those obligations,

105
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:11.261
the primary obligations are three to redeem the person or their property if

106
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:14.000
they've been sold to a stranger due to poverty.

107
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.120
So to be deemed them from debt servitude essentially.

108
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.390
So you're go else should do that for you to marry a childless widow might.

109
00:06:22.891 --> 00:06:27.250
So if a man dies and his wife,
his child list the go,
Al is supposed to marry her,

110
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.490
provide seed,
and the firstborn son will be named after the man who is dead.

111
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:34.820
So he's supposed to marry a childless widow and produce offspring for the

112
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:37.160
deceased.
Usually that falls first to the brother.

113
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.640
And then in the case of the blood redeemer,
uh,

114
00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:43.670
also the redeemer is supposed to avenge the blood of a kinsmen.

115
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:47.060
So if you are killed,
your redeemer is supposed to seek vengeance for you.

116
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.030
Boss is a somewhat distant relative,

117
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.060
but now only believes he's the answer to their dual problem of poverty on the

118
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:58.190
one hand and Ruth's widowhood on the other hand.

119
00:06:58.191 --> 00:07:00.350
So in chapter three,

120
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.650
she urges Ruth to make a visit to boss.

121
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:07.820
He's winnowing barley on the threshing floor and Ruth is supposed to bathe

122
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:09.840
herself,
anoint herself,
um,

123
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.550
dress up and go out at night to the threshing floor.
Um,

124
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.360
you should know that in biblically threshing floor floors tend to be places of

125
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.890
revelry,
um,

126
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.880
at the end of the harvest time and they are often frequented by prostitutes.

127
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.230
But now me seems to be planning Ruth's seduction of boss.

128
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.230
She Instructs Ruth to,
uh,

129
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.710
not to reveal herself until blahs has finished eating and drinking.

130
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.300
And when he lies down,
Ruth is to approach him and uncover his feet.

131
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:43.160
This is possibly a sexual euphemism and lie down and he will tell her what she

132
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:46.380
is to do.
So Ruth follows these instructions exactly.

133
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:51.430
Chapter three verses seven to 11 boy as ate and drank and in a cheerful mood

134
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:56.000
went to lie down beside the grain pile and then she went over stealthily and

135
00:07:56.001 --> 00:07:58.100
uncovered his feet and lay down.

136
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.070
In the middle of the night the man give a start and pulled back.

137
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:05.120
There was a woman lying at his feet.
Who are you?
He asked and she replied,

138
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:06.470
I am your handmaid,
Ruth.

139
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.180
Spread your robe over your handmade for you are a redeeming kinsmen ago,

140
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.250
AOL and he exclaimed,
be blessing of the Lord daughter,

141
00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:17.420
your latest deed of loyalty is greater than the first and that you have not

142
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:22.160
turned to younger men,
whether poor or rich and now daughter have no fear.

143
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.710
I will do in your behalf.
Whatever you ask for.

144
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:27.530
All the elders of my town know what a fine woman you are.

145
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:33.130
So Ruth's request is that molars act as her redeemer and spread his robe over

146
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:33.620
her,

147
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:38.620
which is a a formal act of protection and a spousal and boas assures her that he

148
00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:43.310
will redeem her.
He then goes on to point out however,

149
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:48.311
that there is another kinsmen who is actually a closer relation and therefore

150
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:53.471
has the first right of refusal and Boaz will settle the matter legally in the

151
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.570
morning.
And we're left wondering what transpired in the night.
Uh,

152
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:02.571
in chapter four we read the legal proceeding by which the other kinsmen is freed

153
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:06.690
of his obligation and his claim to Ruth.
And this then clears away,

154
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:11.520
enables bylaws to marry her.
But the punchline to the whole story is yet to come.

155
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.410
And that occurs in chapter four verses 13 to 17.
So Boaz married Ruth,

156
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.420
she became his wife and he'd cohabited with her and the Lord let her conceive

157
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:24.040
and she bore a son.
And the women said to Naomi,

158
00:09:24.041 --> 00:09:27.540
bet blessed it'd be the Lord who has not withheld a redeemer from you today.

159
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.090
May His name be perpetuated in Israel.

160
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.380
He will renew your life and sustain your old age for he is born of your daughter

161
00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:37.740
in law who loves you and is better to you than seven sons.

162
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.940
And now me took the child and held it to her bosom.
She became,
it's foster.

163
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:46.140
Mother and the women neighbors gave him a name saying a son is born to Naomi.

164
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.160
They named him over head.
He was the father of Jesse,
father of David.

165
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.480
So David God's anointed king over Israel.

166
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.280
David with whom God covenanted,
that his house should reign forever.

167
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.480
David from WHO's line would come the messianic king to rule in the final age.

168
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.440
[inaudible]
this David is said to be the direct descendant,

169
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.120
the great grandson of a foreign woman from a country of idol worshipers and a

170
00:10:12.121 --> 00:10:13.770
Moabite tests no less.

171
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:19.500
So it seems that this very short and very moving story represents a strand of

172
00:10:19.501 --> 00:10:22.950
thought that stood in opposition to the line of line of thinking found,

173
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:23.790
for example,

174
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.530
and Ezra as call for a ban on intermarriage as the only means of ensuring

175
00:10:28.531 --> 00:10:30.120
faithfulness to Israel's God.

176
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:34.920
Not only is Ruth the Moabite test not guilty of abominable practices,

177
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.920
she's the ancestors.
If y'all always chosen monarch.

178
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.280
And she's praised in the story by all who know her as a paragon of crested,

179
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.980
this quality of,
of steadfast love and um,
Kevin dental loyalty,
um,

180
00:10:46.981 --> 00:10:51.090
that binds the members of the Covenant Community to one another and to God.

181
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.720
Ruth the Moabite tests stood by an elderly widow to whom she had no real legal

182
00:10:57.151 --> 00:11:00.570
obligation and she was accepted into the covenant community.

183
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.360
The acceptance of foreigners is well documented in post exit like Judaism,

184
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.070
despite as polemical efforts to exclude foreigners from the community,

185
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.160
it's important to remember that as,

186
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:18.190
as reforms never became normative for the entire community posting Zelig and

187
00:11:18.541 --> 00:11:23.541
later Rabbinic Judaism never adopted the purely geological definition of Jewish

188
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:24.180
identity.

189
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:28.620
They allowed for the phenomenon of conversion and marriage into the covenant by

190
00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:31.140
persons of Foreign Birth who accepted the god of Israel.

191
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.310
A possibility that as her completely forecloses,
as,

192
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.420
as extreme views were popular among sectarian groups.

193
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.450
So as Ryan exclusivism is champion for example,

194
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:44.850
in writings that are found at Qumran,
um,

195
00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:48.090
it exerted some influence on early Christian bans on marriage,

196
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.000
absolute bans on marriage between believers and unbelievers.

197
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.300
But it's a book of Ruth that features prominently in the Jewish conversion

198
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:56.500
ceremony.
To this day

199
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:02.920
you have a different kind of acceptance of foreigners that's voiced by profits

200
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.160
of the restoration period.
So these are profits,
um,

201
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.200
fifth century and we'll look slate late sixth and fifth century.
Um,

202
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:16.270
we're going to look now briefly at some of the last prophetic books and these

203
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:20.050
are writings that dated that date to the time of the first generations of

204
00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:25.051
returned exiles and on earlier profits and the pre exhilarate period,

205
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:28.030
right?
The classical profits we've already looked at,

206
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.620
they had spoken of a remnant that would be restored and would be restored

207
00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:34.210
gloriously to its land.

208
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.350
But the returned exiles faced a life of great hardship,

209
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.580
the reality of poverty and the difficulties in rebuilding the temple and the

210
00:12:42.581 --> 00:12:44.470
hostility of the Judeans who,
um,

211
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:49.110
had remained behind as well as the hostility of the surrounding peoples.
Um,

212
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.900
the absence of any real political independence under a Davidic king.

213
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:57.850
All of these things fell far short of the profits,
the early prophets,

214
00:12:57.851 --> 00:13:00.880
glorious descriptions of this restored remnant.

215
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.810
And so new profits in the period of the restoration have to address the

216
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:06.310
community's disappointment.

217
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:11.730
And the short book of High Guy Contains the words of the Prophet Haggai,
um,

218
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.800
spoken primarily to [inaudible] is the governor of Judea and High Guy prophesies

219
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:23.620
around five 20 and he declares that all of the difficulties the community was

220
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:26.590
facing,
the agricultural setbacks and the famines,

221
00:13:26.591 --> 00:13:30.430
these were all signs of God's displeasure that the temple,
um,

222
00:13:30.431 --> 00:13:34.270
hadn't been completed.
As the robot Velez convinced by this,

223
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:38.320
the people return to their task enthusiastically.
And as we know,

224
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.510
the temple is rebuilt as high guy promised.
Um,
he says it's a humble structure,

225
00:13:43.511 --> 00:13:48.070
but soon it's going to be filled with treasures flowing in from all nations and

226
00:13:48.071 --> 00:13:51.940
the promises of the restoration that were made by the prophets of old or just

227
00:13:51.941 --> 00:13:56.680
around the corner.
So high guy longed for a rebuilt temple,
but not only that,

228
00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:01.270
also for the reestablishment of Judah's independence under a Davidic king.

229
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.940
And he held out hope for Zerubbabel,

230
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:09.090
the governor who was after all a descendant of David through the last king that

231
00:14:10.331 --> 00:14:15.010
went into exile.
He hoped that he would serve as God's Messiah or appointed King.

232
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.660
That hope is even stronger in the work of high guys.

233
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:23.920
Contemporary the Prophet Zechariah,
um,

234
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:28.950
securize 14 chapters long and the first eight chapters contain the prophecies of

235
00:14:29.981 --> 00:14:34.570
the historical Zechariah around five 20 or so.
The last chapters,

236
00:14:34.571 --> 00:14:38.200
chapters nine through 14.
This is known as Second Zechariah.

237
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:43.410
These chapters contain obscure writings from a later hand and they are of a very

238
00:14:44.741 --> 00:14:48.520
different type or genre.
They are written in the apocalyptic vein,

239
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.950
so we won't talk about those.
Now we'll consider momentarily.

240
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:54.950
I'm going to be talking about apocalyptic for the last half of the lecture.

241
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.260
So for right now I'm interested,
however,

242
00:14:57.261 --> 00:15:01.340
in the first eight chapters which represent the oracles of the historical

243
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.470
Prophet Zechariah,
around five 20,

244
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:08.660
you preached and prophesied for about two years.
He urges in these chapters,

245
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.250
the rebuilding of the temple.

246
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:15.920
The first six chapters contain a series of elaborate and symbolic visions,

247
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:20.270
eight different visions that are revealed by an angel or a divine messenger.

248
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:24.860
That's a mode of revelation that's going to be standard in apocalyptic

249
00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:27.230
literature.
As we'll soon see,
um,

250
00:15:27.231 --> 00:15:30.340
earlier prophets received a word or a vision,
but,
uh,

251
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.110
as we move towards apocalyptic literature and later literature,

252
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:37.550
profits often receive messages from God through an angel or a messenger.

253
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:42.500
Um,
these visions,
uh,
focus hope on Zerubbabel,

254
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.130
the governor and on the priest Joshua the high priest Joshua.

255
00:15:46.131 --> 00:15:50.540
And the idea is that they'll rule in a kind of Dye Archi as monarch and priest

256
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.600
at the same,
at some point,
however,

257
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.420
it seems that the Persians got rid of his Aruba Vail.

258
00:15:56.421 --> 00:16:01.421
He was ousted perhaps because a messianic hope was starting to gather around

259
00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:03.374
Zerubbabel.

260
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.910
So Zechariah's prophecy seem to be adjusted to refer solely to Joshua,

261
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.510
although they originally referred to Zerubbabel.

262
00:16:11.511 --> 00:16:13.190
And although chapter six in particular,

263
00:16:13.191 --> 00:16:15.500
it seems to refer originally to Zerubbabel,

264
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:20.610
it is altered so that it now depicts Joshua as a shoot or a branch from Jessie's

265
00:16:20.611 --> 00:16:24.680
stock.
Jesse stock meaning a David died.
David's father was Jesse.
So to say,

266
00:16:24.681 --> 00:16:27.650
a route from Jesse stuck is to say,
uh,
David died.

267
00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:32.480
It says that Joshua will rebuild the sanctuary.
He will wear the royal insignia,

268
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:36.560
although he is the priest.
So the elevation,
however,

269
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:38.970
of the high priest in,
um,

270
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.050
is a feature of the post exhilarate period.

271
00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:44.780
It's a feature of Judah in the post exhilarate period.

272
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.900
High priest coming to take some of the,
um,

273
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:53.140
the trappings of royal office chapters seven and eight.

274
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:58.130
Declare God's promise to turn and to do good things in Jerusalem and the house

275
00:16:58.131 --> 00:17:02.570
of Judah.
So long as the people will turn from they're unjust and evil ways.

276
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:07.250
And Zechariah points forward to the Glorious Day when all the nations of the

277
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:12.060
world will eagerly come to seek the Lord in Jerusalem and to entreat his favor.

278
00:17:12.061 --> 00:17:16.460
So we read in Zechariah eight 23,
thus said the Lord of hosts.

279
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:21.200
In those days,
10 men from nations of every tongue will take hold.
They will,

280
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:25.520
each team,
they will take hold of every Jew by a corner of his cloak and say,

281
00:17:25.521 --> 00:17:28.640
let us go with you.
For we have heard that God is with you.

282
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.980
And thus a this restoration period,
you can see,
um,
features,
profits.

283
00:17:33.981 --> 00:17:38.150
Who envisions other nations joining Israel in the worship of Yahweh?

284
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:42.230
They will come to rally around and join Israel in the worship of God in

285
00:17:42.231 --> 00:17:43.064
Jerusalem.

286
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:49.420
The last wave of prophetic writings that we have addresses the disappointment

287
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:55.370
and the disillusionment of the late sixth and fifth century Judeans.

288
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.960
What was the message of these writings?

289
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.860
The basic message was that the earlier profits there promises of future glory

290
00:18:05.281 --> 00:18:08.430
for the restored remnant.
Um,
these were all true.

291
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.980
The future just isn't.
Now,

292
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.200
it's only going to happen in the Eschaton.
The final day.

293
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.920
Only then will the glory of Jerusalem and a messianic ruler be restored.

294
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.850
And the hope that has to sustain the community through the bleak present is

295
00:18:26.851 --> 00:18:29.040
therefore an eschatological hope,

296
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.630
a hope that focuses on an ideal account of the end eschatology and account of

297
00:18:33.631 --> 00:18:37.830
the end.
Because in the end of days,
everything will be set right.

298
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.600
So as we move later into the period,
we find increasingly,
um,

299
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:46.020
the hope for the community is thrust off into the future in an eschatology.

300
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:49.760
Parts of third,
Isaiah,
um,

301
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.660
depict the bitter reality of life in Postig,
Zelig,
Judah,

302
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.470
and advanced and eschatology.
You remembered the book of Isaiah,

303
00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:01.050
which is 66 chapters.
We divide into three parts,

304
00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:03.420
one through 39 which is the historical Isaiah.

305
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.350
Then we have second Isaiah and then third Isaiah we're dealing with now that's

306
00:19:07.351 --> 00:19:12.351
chapters 56 to 66 the anonymous prophetic author of these chapters denounces the

307
00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:18.870
failings of the exiles but does hold out and eschatology a doctrine of final

308
00:19:18.871 --> 00:19:22.230
things that depicts what's going to happen in the end of days.

309
00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.990
This kind of eschatology differs from the depiction of Zions future glory that

310
00:19:27.991 --> 00:19:30.660
we had in the early classical profits.

311
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:36.350
The earlier prophetic pronouncements generally referred to a re reestablishment

312
00:19:36.631 --> 00:19:39.180
of Judas fortunes in historical time,

313
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.120
but eschatological works like third.

314
00:19:42.121 --> 00:19:45.210
Isaiah look beyond historical time.

315
00:19:45.211 --> 00:19:48.270
They're looking to a time of a new heaven and a new earth.

316
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.640
When Judah's sins will be forgotten,

317
00:19:50.641 --> 00:19:55.110
the land will become an earthly paradise transformed and blessed with peace and

318
00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:57.210
prosperity and length of days.

319
00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:01.770
This is from Isaiah 65 verses 17 to 25 for behold,

320
00:20:01.771 --> 00:20:04.290
I am creating a new heaven and a new earth.

321
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:07.650
The former things shall not be remembered.
They shall never come to mind.

322
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:12.030
Be Glad then and rejoice forever in what I am creating for I shall create

323
00:20:12.031 --> 00:20:14.550
Jerusalem as a joy and her people as a delight.

324
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:19.050
Never again shall there be heard shall be heard there the sounds of weeping and

325
00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:19.710
wailing.

326
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:24.030
No more shall there be an infant or gray beard who does not live out his days.

327
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.350
He who dies at a 100 years shall be wrecking to youth and he who fails to reach

328
00:20:28.351 --> 00:20:29.670
a hundred shall be reckoned.

329
00:20:29.671 --> 00:20:33.780
A cursed for the days of my people shall be as long as the days of the tree.

330
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.930
My chosen ones shall outlive the work of their hands.

331
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:41.760
They shall not toil to no purpose.
They shall not bear children for terror,

332
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:45.450
but they shall be a people blessed by the Lord and their offspring shall remain

333
00:20:45.451 --> 00:20:47.620
with them before they pray.

334
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.550
I will answer while they are still speaking,
I will respond,

335
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:56.850
but wolf and the lamb shall graze together and the lion shall eat straw like the

336
00:20:57.191 --> 00:21:01.030
ox and the serpents.
Food shall be earth in all my sacred mount.

337
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.300
Nothing evil or vial shall be done,
said the Lord.

338
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.620
See this interesting notion of a completely new transformed heaven and earth.

339
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.000
The lion is vegetarian.
Again,
the serpent,
no longer is,
is,
is,

340
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.570
there's not this animosity between the serpent and humans as was decreed at the

341
00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:18.580
end of genesis with the curse on the snare serpent.

342
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.050
They're going to just be eating earth.
Um,
and there will be no,
no danger.

343
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:27.790
Third,
Isaiah also sounds this theme of Openness,
um,

344
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:32.290
reassuring foreigners and Unix who have joined themselves to y'all way that

345
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:36.880
there'll be welcomed in the holy temple to serve God and to offer sacrifices.

346
00:21:36.881 --> 00:21:39.670
Now,
this is significant.
Again,
remember that Deuteronomy 23,

347
00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:41.980
right in the heart of the pentitude bands,

348
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:46.790
Unix specifically and certain foreigners,
Moabites ammonites,
uh,

349
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.430
from entering the congregation.

350
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.630
Remember also that [inaudible] explicitly excluded foreigners from the restored

351
00:21:52.631 --> 00:21:55.150
temple in his visions at the end of the book.
Um,

352
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:59.200
and this is also clearly the policy of Ezra and Nehemiah.
They had,
um,

353
00:21:59.201 --> 00:22:04.000
an ammonite who had,
uh,
his,
uh,
lodgings or office or room in the temple.

354
00:22:04.001 --> 00:22:07.810
They had him thrown out of,
of that area in the temple.
But third,

355
00:22:07.811 --> 00:22:12.640
Isaiah seems to oppose such restrictions.
Isaiah 56 verses three to seven,

356
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.480
let not the foreigner say who has attached himself to the Lord.

357
00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:21.250
The Lord will keep me apart from his people and let not the eunuch say I'm a

358
00:22:21.251 --> 00:22:25.960
withered tree,
for thus said the Lord.
As for the Eunuchs who keep my sabbath,

359
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.720
who have chosen what I desire and hold fast to my covenant,

360
00:22:28.721 --> 00:22:31.660
I will give them in my house and within my walls,

361
00:22:31.661 --> 00:22:34.570
a monument and a name better than sons or daughters.

362
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.570
I will give them an everlasting name,
which shall not perish.

363
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.300
As for the foreigners who attach themselves to the Lord,

364
00:22:40.301 --> 00:22:43.570
to Minister to him and to love the name of the Lord,
to be his servants,

365
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.680
all who keep the sabbath and do not profane it,
and who hold fast to my covenant,

366
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.640
I will bring them to my sacred mountain.
Let them rejoice in my house of prayer.

367
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.190
Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be,

368
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.180
shall be welcome on my altar for my house shall be called a house of prayer for

369
00:22:58.181 --> 00:23:00.220
all peoples.
So on this issue,

370
00:23:00.221 --> 00:23:03.910
clearly the post exhibit community was quite divided

371
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.720
and there's only one,
um,
biblical book,

372
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:12.130
which pretty much in its entirety belongs to a genre of literature,

373
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.830
a known as apocalyptic,
and that in its entirely entirety,

374
00:23:14.831 --> 00:23:18.760
but it is the most significant and thorough going apocalyptic book in the Bible.

375
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.580
The term apocalyptic derives from the Greek word apokalypsis.
Um,

376
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.290
and apokalypsis is a revealing,
all right?

377
00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:31.291
So something that's apocalyptic is a revealing apocalypse is a revelation of

378
00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:32.620
things to come.

379
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.630
And as apocalypses generally predict the end of historical time and the

380
00:23:37.631 --> 00:23:41.770
beginning of a new world order,
they are generally concerned with eschatology.

381
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.650
So apocalyptic works tend to be eschatological.
All right?

382
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:51.010
That doesn't mean all eschatological work is apocalyptic apocalyptic literature

383
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.250
within the Bible.

384
00:23:52.251 --> 00:23:56.840
And then much more significantly outside of the Hebrew Bible is characterized by

385
00:23:56.841 --> 00:24:01.070
certain,
um,
distinguishing features which I've thrown up in,

386
00:24:01.071 --> 00:24:03.410
in brief note form over here.
All right?

387
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:06.950
So apocalyptic literature is always eschatological deals with the in time.

388
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:11.390
But to be apocalyptic or work has to have certain kinds of,
uh,
features.

389
00:24:11.391 --> 00:24:14.540
And not all this fatalities have these features.
This is what they are.

390
00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.630
Most apocalyptic writings are pseudonymous.

391
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.600
They're generally attributed to important figures of the past,
right?
He,

392
00:24:21.601 --> 00:24:23.180
doc or Abraham or someone,

393
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:29.870
they tend to also feature a revelation by a heavenly messenger,

394
00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:34.610
an angel who comes in a vision or a dream to deliver some sort of message.

395
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.750
In general,
the message is highly symbolic.
It's coated,

396
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.530
and often the symbolism is quite bizarre.

397
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:47.660
You'll have surreal images of beasts and monsters and usually these depict

398
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.680
foreign nations.

399
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.970
The visions tend to be chronological.

400
00:24:52.971 --> 00:24:57.020
They tend to be a systematic chronology of,
um,
past,
present,

401
00:24:57.021 --> 00:25:01.520
and future events that represent the march of history in coded form again,

402
00:25:01.521 --> 00:25:03.830
and so it tends to require interpretation.

403
00:25:03.831 --> 00:25:07.790
And that's usually given by the divine messenger who reveals the symbolic

404
00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.230
chronological code.

405
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:14.810
A fourthly apocalypses tend to predict a series of catastrophes.

406
00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.660
These are signs of the coming of the end,
right?

407
00:25:17.661 --> 00:25:20.630
That that final point in the march of history that's being laid out.

408
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.680
You have motifs from ancient myths very often used to describe these

409
00:25:24.681 --> 00:25:28.500
catastrophes.
I'll come back to that in a minute.
A Po.

410
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.700
Apocalypse is also tend to be what I call morally dualistic.

411
00:25:31.701 --> 00:25:36.701
They tend to divide humankind into two mutually exclusive groups.

412
00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.550
The righteous,
which is always a tiny minority and the wicked,

413
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.180
which is always the vast majority.
Um,

414
00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:48.220
and there's going to be some final public judgment and the righteous will be

415
00:25:48.291 --> 00:25:53.291
saved and the wicked will be destroyed in this respect,

416
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.170
especially later apocalypses show the influence of Persian thought.

417
00:25:57.171 --> 00:26:01.790
Persian thought is also quite dualist in nature with oppositions of light and

418
00:26:01.791 --> 00:26:04.940
darkness or good and evil and light and death and so on.

419
00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:07.010
So there does seem to be some Persian influence.

420
00:26:07.011 --> 00:26:11.450
And of course we were well into the Persian period at this point.
Um,

421
00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:15.830
six feature is that God generally appears and apocalyptic literature as an

422
00:26:15.831 --> 00:26:17.030
enthroned king.

423
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:22.220
He brings all of history to a crashing end and demonstrates his sovereignty.

424
00:26:22.221 --> 00:26:26.310
He confounds the wicked,
he does all the things things at the same time,
you know,

425
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:29.630
he confounds the wicked and establishes himself as the sovereign and and throne

426
00:26:29.631 --> 00:26:33.470
King in control.
Seventh apocalyptic literature,

427
00:26:33.471 --> 00:26:34.970
as I briefly mentioned before,

428
00:26:34.971 --> 00:26:38.330
often incorporates mythological motifs and imagery,

429
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:43.510
especially the Motif of a battle between God and primordial chaotic elements.

430
00:26:44.251 --> 00:26:46.180
And that will often be,
um,

431
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.040
the imagery that's used in depicting the final battle with the godless are the

432
00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:55.041
wicked apocalypse is also generally depict a judgment of the individual dead,

433
00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:01.860
um,
followed by everlasting life or punishment.
So again,

434
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:05.250
apocalypse has developed quite substantially outside the writings of the Hebrew

435
00:27:05.251 --> 00:27:06.990
Bible.
In the Bible,

436
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.640
we have a few scattered apocalyptic elements and then much of the book of
Daniel.

437
00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:13.080
Um,
and so we,

438
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:17.670
we don't see the idea of life after death really in the Hebrew Bible until this

439
00:27:17.671 --> 00:27:20.130
very late apocalyptic book of Daniel.

440
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.930
The idea is very influential in the Dead Sea Scrolls.
They are very dualist.
Um,

441
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:27.840
and in the writings of the New Testament,
of course,

442
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.410
so our belief in personal immortality,

443
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.820
it belief in a general resurrection of the dead.

444
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:37.500
These arise from a negative view of this world as a place where justice can be

445
00:27:37.501 --> 00:27:38.334
obtained.

446
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:42.210
So apocalyptic writers examine the world they lived in and they drew the

447
00:27:42.211 --> 00:27:46.230
conclusion that reward and punishment,
we're going to be made in an afterlife.

448
00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:49.500
They were certainly not doled out in this life as Israel suffered.

449
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.700
And this is a marked break from the general conviction of the Hebrew Bible,

450
00:27:53.701 --> 00:27:58.140
that human life is limited to this world and that the fundamental concern of

451
00:27:58.141 --> 00:28:02.520
humans and God is morality in this life and not in mortality.
In another.

452
00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.530
You think apocalyptic literature can be described as a literature of hope and

453
00:28:07.531 --> 00:28:08.364
despair.

454
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:13.080
It's a literature of despair or pessimism because it's basic premise is that

455
00:28:13.081 --> 00:28:16.170
this world holds out no promise for the righteous.
Um,

456
00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:21.060
it's a literature of hope or optimism because it affirms that God will

457
00:28:21.061 --> 00:28:24.450
intervene,
he will intervene in human history.
He'll set everything right.

458
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.370
He'll interrupt the natural order.

459
00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:30.870
He's going to destroy this broken world as we know it,
and he'll do soar.

460
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:34.440
Do so in order to rescue the righteous and humiliate the wicked.

461
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:37.410
And if you've already died,
don't worry,
there'll be a resurrection.

462
00:28:37.411 --> 00:28:38.670
It will all be made right?

463
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:43.970
But this hope for supreme and ultimate vindication is thrust off into the

464
00:28:44.221 --> 00:28:45.054
future.

465
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:50.330
So apocalyptic constitutes yet one more response to the traumatic events,

466
00:28:50.791 --> 00:28:54.180
the crises,
and the disappointments of Israel's history.

467
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:58.530
Um,
in a second we'll get to Daniel,
but there are a few,

468
00:28:58.531 --> 00:29:02.850
I'm apocalyptic passages of varying lengths in other post exhilarate books.

469
00:29:02.851 --> 00:29:07.320
I'll just touch on them very quickly.
Second,
a second,
Zechariah and a little bit,

470
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:12.300
uh,
the book of Joe Just to prepare us for Daniel.
So Second Zechariah.

471
00:29:12.301 --> 00:29:14.040
Now these are chapters nine through 14.

472
00:29:14.041 --> 00:29:16.710
We talked about the historical Zechariah chapters one through eight.

473
00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:20.490
So this is second Zechariah chapters nine through 14.

474
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:25.790
And it's a collection of diverse Oracle's probably fifth century or later that

475
00:29:26.041 --> 00:29:29.520
contain these strange visions and predictions.
Um,

476
00:29:29.521 --> 00:29:31.900
their meanings cannot always be fathomed,

477
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.990
but they seem to focus on the day of the Lord and the restoration of Jerusalem

478
00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:41.991
and the rise of a new and humble king who will reign and piece over a new world

479
00:29:42.671 --> 00:29:43.504
order.

480
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:48.510
Chapter 14 is a vision of this global battle that will bring history to an end.

481
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:55.600
Um,
God's going to bring all the nations to Jerusalem where they will plunder the

482
00:29:55.601 --> 00:29:58.000
city.
They will kill almost all of the inhabitants.

483
00:29:58.001 --> 00:30:01.930
And then at the last moment when things look the most desperate,

484
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:06.910
God will intervene and he'll fight for Israel and exact revenge on her enemies.

485
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:11.410
And it's after this final battle that God will transform the earth into a

486
00:30:11.411 --> 00:30:15.610
paradise.
So Israel's enemies will rage against one another.

487
00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.840
The surviving nations will pilgrimage to Jerusalem again.

488
00:30:19.841 --> 00:30:22.510
Jerusalem now is elevated above all cities.
Um,

489
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:26.680
and these nations will come to Jerusalem to worship your way at his temple.

490
00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:30.550
And yeah,
we'll be sovereign over the world.
Joel,

491
00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:35.560
very short little book.
Um,
probably the latest prophetic book.
Um,

492
00:30:35.561 --> 00:30:38.110
it also contains apocalyptic material.

493
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:43.320
The versification of Joel is a v varies tremendously in different English

494
00:30:43.571 --> 00:30:46.570
translations.
So I'm using the verse markings that are in the Bible you have,

495
00:30:46.571 --> 00:30:49.390
but if you consult another Bible,
some of them have only three chapters,

496
00:30:49.391 --> 00:30:53.890
some have four.
It can be confusing.
Well,
we can divide Joel into two parts,

497
00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:59.110
up to chapter two,
verse 27.
So that's the first part from one,

498
00:30:59.111 --> 00:31:01.510
one to two 27 or one to really,

499
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:06.100
and that contains a description of a military invasion.

500
00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.780
It's symbolized by an army of locusts and this invasion,
this,

501
00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:15.840
this army of locus is interpreted as a divine punishment that is necessary or

502
00:31:16.211 --> 00:31:19.750
that must come before the day of the Lord.
The second part of Joel,

503
00:31:19.751 --> 00:31:24.751
which begins in Verse 28 of chapter two is a fully apocalyptic,

504
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:26.900
um,
description of the,
the,

505
00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.780
the final day of terror reading from chapter three verses three and four before

506
00:31:31.781 --> 00:31:34.780
the great and terrible day of the Lord comes,

507
00:31:34.781 --> 00:31:37.360
I will set portents in the sky and on earth,

508
00:31:37.361 --> 00:31:40.090
blood and fire and pillars of smoke.

509
00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:43.870
The Sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and

510
00:31:43.871 --> 00:31:47.500
terrible day of the Lord comes,
but the righteous are going to survive.

511
00:31:47.501 --> 00:31:48.880
This is pointed out in chapter three,

512
00:31:48.881 --> 00:31:53.290
verse five but everyone who invokes the name of the Lord shall escape for the
Sh,

513
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:57.550
there shall be a remnant on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem as the Lord promised.

514
00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.400
As we move into chapter four of Joel,

515
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:04.570
the day of the Lord is envisaged as a judgment day for all peoples,
right?

516
00:32:04.571 --> 00:32:07.450
So this is increasingly the view of the Eschaton,
a final battle,

517
00:32:07.451 --> 00:32:12.130
and also a judgment day.
And that Judgment Day will then issue in a new age.

518
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:16.360
This is an idea that the book of Daniel we'll elaborate on in a minute,

519
00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:20.470
not to mention the apocalyptic writings that are outside of the Hebrew Bible.

520
00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.510
In this Judgment Day,

521
00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:27.370
God will summon all of the godless nations to the Valley of Judgment.

522
00:32:27.371 --> 00:32:29.470
Jehoshaphat's which means God will judge.

523
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.680
So the Valley of Jehoshaphat and here,

524
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:37.030
the final battle between good and evil will take place.
And after that,

525
00:32:37.031 --> 00:32:42.031
God's people will be blessed and the holy city will never again suffer shame for

526
00:32:42.321 --> 00:32:43.520
low in those days.

527
00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:46.730
And in that time when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,

528
00:32:46.731 --> 00:32:50.540
I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat.

529
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:54.260
And there I will contend with them over my very own people,
Israel,

530
00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:58.760
which they scattered among the nations.
Towards the end then of the book we read,

531
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:02.630
let the nations rouse themselves and March up to the valley of Jehoshaphat.

532
00:33:02.631 --> 00:33:06.800
For there,
I will sit in judgment over all the nations.
Roundabout swing.

533
00:33:06.801 --> 00:33:10.970
The sickle for the crop is ripe.
Come and tread for the wine presses full.

534
00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.120
The vats are overflowing for great as their wickedness,

535
00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:18.170
but the Lord will be a shelter to his people of refuge to the children of
Israel.

536
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:22.190
And Jerusalem shall be holy nevermore shall strangers pass through it.

537
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.490
And in that day,
the mountains Sheldrick with wine,

538
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.480
the hills shall flow with milk and all the water courses of Judah shall flow

539
00:33:29.481 --> 00:33:30.450
with water,
uh,

540
00:33:30.451 --> 00:33:33.740
spring shell issue from the House of the Lord and shall water the Wadi of a

541
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:38.390
Casey as and Judah shall be inhabited forever.
And Jerusalem.
Throughout the ages,

542
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.780
we see a lot of eschatological features.
In the book of Joel,

543
00:33:41.781 --> 00:33:46.100
you have first of all,
a series of disasters,
a signal,
the impending wrath of God.

544
00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:51.460
You have a cosmic battle in which y'all way triumphs over Israel's enemy.

545
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.400
Um,
and we've seen in apocalyptic literature in general,

546
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:57.710
a facilely equation of the righteous.

547
00:33:57.711 --> 00:34:01.160
And the wicked with Israel and F and other nations.
Um,

548
00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:06.140
and then also we have this outpouring of blessings on God's people,

549
00:34:06.141 --> 00:34:08.360
city and land.
And finally,

550
00:34:08.361 --> 00:34:13.250
God's continued protection and presence and nations who are not Israel's
enemies,

551
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:17.480
uh,
join in the worship of God.
And that final time,
again,

552
00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:21.650
note the important difference between classical prophecy and the apocalyptic

553
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.770
literature.
Both of them speak about final things.

554
00:34:24.771 --> 00:34:26.570
Both of them speak about an end time,

555
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.950
but the classical prophets did not in general expect that the course of human

556
00:34:30.951 --> 00:34:33.260
affairs would come to an end,
right?

557
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.430
Only that Israel's rebellion would end or that Israel would live under a perfect

558
00:34:37.431 --> 00:34:41.330
king,
anointed by God in the apocalyptic imagination.

559
00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:45.980
History itself is a closed process.
It will end and then a new age,

560
00:34:45.981 --> 00:34:50.420
a new world order would begin in the present age and the new age or

561
00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:52.010
qualitatively distinct,

562
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.460
the present age is under the dominion of evil powers.

563
00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.900
We see it particularly in the apocalyptic writings outside of the Bible and in

564
00:34:59.901 --> 00:35:03.560
the New Testament that that power that has dominion over the present age is

565
00:35:03.561 --> 00:35:06.620
Satan.
Satan is the arch enemy of God.
All right?

566
00:35:06.621 --> 00:35:11.570
The age to come will be free of all,
more evil,
moral corruption and death.

567
00:35:11.571 --> 00:35:14.900
Satan will be defeated,
but God himself is the one who has to do this.

568
00:35:14.901 --> 00:35:19.610
God must intervene to bring the present age to a crashing halt and initiate this

569
00:35:19.611 --> 00:35:20.450
new world order.

570
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:26.170
So let's turn now to Daniel for a full apocalyptic work.
Um,

571
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:31.030
Daniel also can be divided really into two parts.
And the first six chapters,
um,

572
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.490
have often been described as heroic fiction.

573
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:37.500
They're a bit like the book of Esther that we'll be talking about on Wednesday.

574
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:42.570
Um,
just a,
a good story.
Um,
Esther's particularly has a lot of irony and is very,

575
00:35:42.571 --> 00:35:44.790
very funny,
but like the book of Esther,

576
00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:49.791
Daniel Features a Jew who lives in a gentile court and he's saved from disaster.

577
00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.820
And I've listed the kings who are discussed in the book of Daniel.

578
00:35:53.821 --> 00:35:58.821
I'm these chapters tell of Daniel's adventures under back to Babylonian kings

579
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.320
notebook had nets are,
and Belshazzar,

580
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:05.550
that's the text says to Babylonian Kings in a book or nets or in Belshazzar,

581
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:10.440
a Medean King Darrius who happens to be unknown to history.
Um,

582
00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:14.840
Persian King Cyrus,
that's a whole lot of years.
Um,

583
00:36:14.841 --> 00:36:18.090
and the historical inaccuracy of the work,
right?

584
00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:21.720
You have the chronology of more than a century being telescoped here.
Um,

585
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.320
there's other inaccuracies.
Belshazzar was actually never a king.

586
00:36:25.321 --> 00:36:29.880
He was sort of a prince regent.
Um,
he was defeated by Cyrus,
not by Darrius.

587
00:36:29.881 --> 00:36:32.880
So they're,
they're tremendous historical inaccuracy.

588
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.490
And this is a sign that this was written at a much later time.

589
00:36:35.491 --> 00:36:40.110
Looking back when the history of the period 300 years ago was very confused.
Um,

590
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:44.040
there's no clear historical knowledge of this Persian period,

591
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:48.150
Babylonian and Persian period.
Um,
and so the book we,

592
00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:51.780
we know was written quite late,
um,

593
00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.960
perhaps the end of the third century,
those first six chapters,

594
00:36:54.961 --> 00:36:57.480
we have a better idea about the remainder of the book.

595
00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.620
Chapters seven through 12 are fully apocalyptic in genre,

596
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:05.760
and they were composed between one 67 and one 64.

597
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:09.660
I don't know if I wrote that up there.
Yeah.
One 67 and one 64 BCE.

598
00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:15.090
This was a time when Jews were suffering intense persecution at the hands of the

599
00:37:15.091 --> 00:37:16.890
solution.
King of Syria.

600
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:21.990
Antiochus Epiphanes Antioch is the fourth.
Um,

601
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.920
and so Daniel is the latest book of the Hebrew Bible,
right?
It was,

602
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:29.720
it was chronologically the latest book written between one 67,

603
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:33.330
one 64 BCE.
But the author writes in code,

604
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.730
he writes and code so that,
you know,

605
00:37:35.731 --> 00:37:39.030
some hostile person would not be able to understand,
right?

606
00:37:39.031 --> 00:37:44.031
The author disguises his references to contemporary historical events and

607
00:37:44.941 --> 00:37:49.260
personalities in these visions,
these symbolic visions,
uh,

608
00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:53.810
that are attributed to a remote era of the past.
Right.

609
00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:57.990
Let's go back and look at the contents of these two sections in chapters one

610
00:37:57.991 --> 00:37:58.824
through six.

611
00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:03.210
Daniel is represented as a loyal Jew who's living in the exile and Babylonia,

612
00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.430
right?
Sixth Century exhilarate period among idol worshipers.
Um,

613
00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.010
he refuses to bow down to any other God.

614
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.510
He observes the dietary laws and he prays facing Jerusalem.

615
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:19.830
He seems to occupy,
occupy a position of some honor in the court.

616
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:24.290
He has the power to interpret dreams and to predict the future.
Um,

617
00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.010
and although he's severely tested,

618
00:38:26.011 --> 00:38:29.190
he remains true to your way and Yahweh aids him.

619
00:38:29.191 --> 00:38:32.040
And more than one miraculous escape from danger.

620
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.300
The main themes of this first section,
the book of Daniel.
Um,

621
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:39.940
our Daniel's interpretations of the dreams of,
of these kings.

622
00:38:39.941 --> 00:38:44.230
I'm new book had Ned Sir and,
and his,
uh,
allegiance to his God.

623
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:49.120
In chapter two,
Nebuchadnezzar has a dream of a huge statue.

624
00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.900
It has a head of gold,
has a torso and arms of silver,

625
00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:55.210
the belly and the thighs of bronze,

626
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.570
the legs of iron and the feet are of mixed iron and clay.

627
00:38:58.571 --> 00:39:01.090
I've kind of given you a little grid and in a minute we're going to have
another,

628
00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:06.100
um,
symbolic dream that's gonna use animals to represent the same things that are

629
00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:07.930
being represented here by the metals.

630
00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.550
So you had this statue with these metal and iron and clay feet.

631
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:17.050
Then a great stone that's uncut by human hands,

632
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:22.260
flies from heaven and smashes the clay feet of the statue and the statue

633
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:23.433
crumbles.

634
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:28.090
And this stone becomes a mountain that fills all the earth.

635
00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:33.490
Daniel decodes the dreams symbolism.
And it's a historical symbolism.

636
00:39:33.491 --> 00:39:34.720
The march of history.

637
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:38.950
Each metal represents a kingdom that ruled the ancient near east.

638
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.430
Daniel only explicitly mentions gold as Babylon,

639
00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:46.360
but we can figure out the rest.
Um,
silver is Medea,

640
00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.290
bronze is Persia,
and iron is Alexander's Grease,
right?

641
00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:53.920
Macedonia and Greece that conquered the ancient Near East in the three thirties

642
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.650
and brought Hellenism and,

643
00:39:55.651 --> 00:39:59.380
and introduce the Hellenistic period into ancient near eastern history.

644
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.960
After Alexander's death,

645
00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:06.520
his empire was divided into smaller Hellenistic Kingdoms,
right?

646
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:10.960
The ones of greatest relevance to us,
our Ptolemaic Egypt,

647
00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:14.590
and saluted Syria.
Because as you can imagine,

648
00:40:14.591 --> 00:40:17.110
Palestine is caught between those two great powers.

649
00:40:17.111 --> 00:40:19.840
So it's going to be fought over by those two great powers.

650
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:24.820
So you have Egypt ruled by the Telemis.
You have Syria rule by the solutions.

651
00:40:24.821 --> 00:40:26.830
They're wrangling for control of the land of Israel,

652
00:40:26.831 --> 00:40:28.360
that that's lying between them.

653
00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:33.460
So the iron and clay feet of the statue in Daniel's dream represent these lesser

654
00:40:33.461 --> 00:40:38.461
Hellenistic kingdoms of Egypt and Syria that succeeded Alexander's Empire in our

655
00:40:38.501 --> 00:40:40.960
mix of Hellenistic and,
and eastern elements.

656
00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.740
The stone from heaven represents the future Kingdom of God.

657
00:40:44.741 --> 00:40:48.520
It's going to come and destroy these godless kingdoms and fill all of the earth

658
00:40:48.521 --> 00:40:49.354
forever.

659
00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:55.350
Chapter three tells the story of Daniel's three companions who refuse to worship

660
00:40:55.690 --> 00:41:00.340
a giant gold statue and they get themselves thrown into a fiery furnace.

661
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:04.120
When they emerge unscathed,
the king is greatly impressed.

662
00:41:04.121 --> 00:41:08.980
And so he acknowledges the God of Israel.
In chapter four,
there's a second dream.

663
00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:09.700
Um,

664
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.270
it's interpreted by Daniel as a sign that in a book had Ned sir will be struck

665
00:41:13.271 --> 00:41:15.850
down seven times.
He's going to lose his reason.

666
00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:20.410
He's going to lose his throne until he realizes that God is the source of all

667
00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:24.740
divine and human power.
And when this in fact comes to pass and look,

668
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:28.930
Nebuchadnezzar's seems to suffer the fit of insanity that drives him from

669
00:41:28.931 --> 00:41:29.764
society.

670
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:33.950
The king then praises the God most high as the king.

671
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:35.720
In chapter five,

672
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:40.560
Daniel's enemies at court trick the Medean King.
Now Daria,

673
00:41:40.561 --> 00:41:42.490
so we're moving to different kings.
Um,

674
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:46.520
they trick him into issuing an edict against those who pray to anyone.

675
00:41:46.521 --> 00:41:49.280
But the king,
uh,
this is a problem for Daniel.

676
00:41:49.281 --> 00:41:51.200
Daniel violates the edict of course,

677
00:41:51.201 --> 00:41:53.780
and he's arrested and he's thrown into a den of lions.

678
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:57.530
But he emerges unharmed and the result is again,

679
00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.370
that the foreign king in this case,
Dari is now recognized as the supremacy.

680
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:05.780
If Galloway and orders all in his kingdom and his kingdom to revere the Jewish

681
00:42:05.781 --> 00:42:06.614
God.

682
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:11.840
There is of course no historical merit to these stories of Babylonian and

683
00:42:11.841 --> 00:42:16.580
Persian kings acknowledging or adopting the god of the Jews who lived in exile

684
00:42:16.581 --> 00:42:17.414
among them.

685
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:22.960
These stories seem to give voice to the hope or the fantasy that accrual and

686
00:42:23.031 --> 00:42:26.370
impious monarch might be taught humility by Yahweh.

687
00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:30.320
They also provide a model for life in the diaspora.

688
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:35.480
Jews can live in the gentile world,
but they must never forget God and his laws.

689
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:40.730
And then we move into the second half of the book of Daniel Chapters seven to
12.

690
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:44.510
This.
Um,
as we move into this part of Daniel,

691
00:42:44.511 --> 00:42:48.050
we switch from the third person into the first person.

692
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.740
So Daniel Seven to 12 was written in the first person and it's fully
apocalyptic.

693
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:52.461
And here.

694
00:42:52.461 --> 00:42:57.461
Daniel has a series of visions and dreams that are interpreted for him by an

695
00:42:57.561 --> 00:43:02.510
angel.
And again,
that's a classic feature of the apocalyptic genre.
And these,

696
00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:07.430
uh,
these visions again survey ancient near eastern history from the sixth to the

697
00:43:07.431 --> 00:43:12.170
second centuries.
Chapter Seven,
again represents the succession of kingdoms,

698
00:43:12.171 --> 00:43:15.440
the Babylonian,
the Medea,
and the Persian,
the Macedonian empires.

699
00:43:15.441 --> 00:43:19.400
But this time as beasts.
So you have a lion,
a bear,

700
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:21.380
a winged leopard,
and an ogre.

701
00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:27.270
The ogre has horns and the horns of this ogre then represent these two lesser

702
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:31.430
Hellenistic kingdoms,
the Ptolemies of Egypt and the solutions of Syria.

703
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.330
The boastful little horn is the Syrian king.

704
00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:39.860
Antioch is Epiphany's himself in a second vision.

705
00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.520
The ancient of days.
This is the term that's used.

706
00:43:43.521 --> 00:43:48.521
It seems to be God in a white robe and a beard seated on a fiery chariot throne.

707
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:54.190
But the ancient of days confers glory and kingship on one like a son of man.

708
00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:00.800
Now in Daniel,
this phrase,
the son of man,
which generally means mortal,
uh,

709
00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:04.460
um,
as opposed to divine in the Bible.
But in Daniel,

710
00:44:04.461 --> 00:44:08.060
the phrase seems to refer to a figure that's in human form,

711
00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:12.050
but more than a human,
probably an angel like Michael or Gabriel.

712
00:44:12.051 --> 00:44:17.051
Both of them are represented as leaders against the forces of Persia and Greece.

713
00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:22.370
And this figure establishes as everlasting kingdom to replace the Beastie all

714
00:44:22.371 --> 00:44:24.740
kingdoms that have preceded it.

715
00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:30.340
So the son of man overwhelms the little horn and to focus who is said to be

716
00:44:30.591 --> 00:44:32.520
making war on saints.

717
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:37.380
That's a code for loyal Jews who says to who is said to have been trying to

718
00:44:37.381 --> 00:44:39.600
change their law and abolish their religion.

719
00:44:39.601 --> 00:44:43.770
And we know that these were parts of the persecution in one 67 to one 64 by

720
00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:46.350
Antiochus.
Um,
he,
you know,

721
00:44:46.351 --> 00:44:51.351
he tried to stop a worship in the sanctuary and so on in a third vision then the

722
00:44:52.141 --> 00:44:54.510
horn that represents Antioch as is said,

723
00:44:54.511 --> 00:44:59.511
to trample the land of splendor Israel to challenge the Army of Heaven to remove

724
00:45:00.061 --> 00:45:03.330
the perpetual sacrifice.
Antioch is,
did halt the sacrifice,

725
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.070
the sacrificial service in the temple,

726
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:10.430
and to set up an abomination of desolation on the sacrificial altar.

727
00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:14.610
And we know that Antioch is set up some kind of pagan altar on the sacrificial

728
00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:19.020
altar in the temple in Jerusalem and erected a statue of Zeus in the sanctuary.

729
00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:23.940
So this depiction of the persecution under Antioch,

730
00:45:23.941 --> 00:45:27.900
this is presented here,
but it's presented in veiled form for reasons of safety.

731
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:33.480
In chapter nine we have a moving prayer for deliverance and the Angel Gabriel

732
00:45:33.481 --> 00:45:38.100
assures Daniel that the end is near and that the end was even predicted by

733
00:45:38.101 --> 00:45:42.900
Jeremiah who had said that Jerusalem would lie desolate 70 years.

734
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:47.880
You will recall now,
Jeremiah prophesied,
I'm going to do some math now.

735
00:45:47.881 --> 00:45:48.691
So this is dangerous.

736
00:45:48.691 --> 00:45:53.550
Jeremiah prophesied in the early sixth century and the chapters of Daniel we'll

737
00:45:53.551 --> 00:45:55.320
written many centuries later.

738
00:45:55.350 --> 00:46:00.090
Someone can figure it out in the one sixties so was Jeremiah prophesied falsely

739
00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:04.380
when he said that God would deliver Israel from her enemies and establish a

740
00:46:04.381 --> 00:46:06.840
kingdom of Judah and 70 years?
No,

741
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:10.860
not according to the book of Daniel because in the book of Daniel it said that

742
00:46:10.861 --> 00:46:13.050
Jeremiah also was speaking in a code.

743
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:16.140
Jeremiah meant the 70 weeks of years,

744
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:21.170
which is to say 490 years would pass before the consummation of all things.

745
00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:26.840
And the last week was the reign of Antioch Ihss Epiphany's.

746
00:46:27.271 --> 00:46:29.550
We are in the last week of these years now.

747
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:34.530
So the writer's maintaining that he's living in the last days and the final

748
00:46:34.531 --> 00:46:36.600
moments of the last week of years.

749
00:46:36.601 --> 00:46:40.560
And this is very typical of apocalyptic literature.
The time is at hand.

750
00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:44.100
We are in the final stages,
is now all the birth pangs of the Messiah,

751
00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.380
these terrible things that are being visited upon us.

752
00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:50.520
And God is soon going to win victory through a mighty act and introduced the

753
00:46:50.521 --> 00:46:55.380
messianic age ending Israel's long years of desolation,
uh,

754
00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:00.930
of desolation.
So apocalyptic literature sees history as determined.

755
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:03.780
It's a closed drama that must be played out.

756
00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:08.730
I'm requiring no action on the part of humans except faithful waiting.

757
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:11.790
God's kingdom will come solely by God's power,

758
00:47:11.791 --> 00:47:14.160
but it has to be proceeded by this time of trouble.

759
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:18.240
These troubles are nothing but the birth pangs of the Messianic Age and the

760
00:47:18.241 --> 00:47:21.960
faithful whose names are recorded in God's book will be rescued.

761
00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:27.350
Chapter 1212 imagines a resurrection of the dead as a compensation to those who

762
00:47:27.691 --> 00:47:30.130
died under the of Antioch.
This,

763
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:33.490
it's a clear attempt to deal with the injustice that Mars,
this world,

764
00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:37.480
and it's the only passage of the Bible to explicitly espouse the idea of an

765
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:40.180
individual life after death.
And as I say,

766
00:47:40.181 --> 00:47:44.560
breaks with a longer Israelite tradition that's vague or silent on this issue.

767
00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:46.750
Not all Jews accepted the idea,

768
00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:49.510
but it would be essential to the rise of Christianity,

769
00:47:49.511 --> 00:47:52.240
which is deeply indebted to apocalyptic thinking.

770
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:56.830
And through Christianity it came to have a very far reaching impact on Western

771
00:47:56.831 --> 00:47:57.664
civilization.

772
00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:03.280
The book of Daniel is a response to specific historical circumstances.

773
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:08.140
It's a response to the crisis of persecution and martyrdom that was going on in

774
00:48:08.141 --> 00:48:09.100
the second century.

775
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:13.000
That was a new kind of crisis that led to a new kind of response.

776
00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:18.070
Because the earlier crises of seven 22 and five 86 they could be explained as

777
00:48:18.071 --> 00:48:22.390
punishment for sin and faithlessness.
But now in the second century,

778
00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.910
Jews were dying,
not because they were faithless,

779
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:27.460
but precisely because they were faithful,

780
00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:31.690
because they refused to obey the decrees of Antioch Ihss and to violate their

781
00:48:31.691 --> 00:48:33.760
law and covenant,
and they were dying.

782
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.260
So this new phenomenon of martyrdom really for the first time required new

783
00:48:38.261 --> 00:48:42.160
responses.
And the book of Daniel provides a fully apocalyptic response.

784
00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:44.800
Remain Faithful.
Wait,
Daniel urges.

785
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:48.460
Know that this will all be set right by God,
not in this world,

786
00:48:48.461 --> 00:48:51.550
but in an ultimate and cataclysmic triumph of life and death,

787
00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:56.510
life over life and faith over death and evil.
And it will be soon.
And God,

788
00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.500
Daniel emphasizes God's from control of history.

789
00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:04.150
And so bull bolsters loyal Jews who are suffering indignities and torture and

790
00:49:04.151 --> 00:49:06.910
even death all around him because of their faith.

791
00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.230
So we've seen the zealous fifth century,

792
00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:13.630
fifth century response of Ezra and Nehemiah to the fateful events of Israel's

793
00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:14.673
history.

794
00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:19.270
They believed as Israel's rededication to God and the covenant involved as a

795
00:49:19.271 --> 00:49:22.840
first step,
cessation of intimate relations with foreigners,

796
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.300
separation from their abominable practices.

797
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:28.840
We've seen very different views that would integrate foreigners in the worship

798
00:49:28.841 --> 00:49:29.674
of Yahweh way.

799
00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:34.770
We've seen also the later emergence of apocalyptic as an expression of present

800
00:49:34.841 --> 00:49:39.841
despair and future hope that entailed the divinely orchestrated and cataclysmic

801
00:49:39.881 --> 00:49:43.780
defeat of the wicked enemies who persecuted Israel.
And in the last lecture,

802
00:49:43.781 --> 00:49:46.810
we're going to look at two books of the Hebrew Bible that take very different

803
00:49:46.811 --> 00:49:49.570
approaches.
The book of Esther and the book of Jonah.
