1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.910
Today,
what I'd like to do is begin our survey of Genesis one through 11,

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.360
uh,

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.360
in order to illustrate the way that biblical writers and precisely who we think

4
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:14.220
they were and when they lived is something we'll talk about later.

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.050
But the way biblical writers drew upon the cultural and religious legacy of the

6
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:21.700
ancient Near East that we've been talking about,
um,

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.460
its stories and its imagery even as they transformed it,
uh,

8
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:30.570
in order to conform to a new vision of a non mythological God,

9
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:34.680
we're going to be looking at some of Caltrans ideas as we read some of these

10
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:39.480
texts.
Um,
now one of the scholars who's written quite extensively

11
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.823
<v 1>okay</v>

12
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.480
<v 0>and eloquently on the adaptation of ancient near eastern motifs in Biblical</v>

13
00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:52.620
literature,
come on and you can family,
um,
is uh,

14
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.750
a scholar by the name of knock him Sarnai highly recommend,
uh,

15
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.420
his book and appears on your optional reading list.

16
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.810
And I'll be drawing very heavily on Sarnia's work as well as the work of some

17
00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:06.040
other scholars who have spent a great deal of time comparing is relayed in

18
00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:10.010
ancient near eastern stories,
particularly these opening chapters.
Um,

19
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.720
in order to see the features that they share and to wonder if perhaps there

20
00:01:13.721 --> 00:01:14.531
isn't after all,

21
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:19.210
a chasm that divides them quite deeply in our consideration of genesis one and

22
00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:23.530
two,
we first need to consider a Babylonian,
epic,

23
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.340
and epic that is known by its opening words at the top of the column over there.

24
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.580
They knew my alias,
which means when on high,

25
00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:35.581
the opening words of this epic and the epic opens before the formation of heaven

26
00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:41.350
and earth,
nothing existed except water and water existed.

27
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.090
In two forms.
There's the primeval fresh water,
fresh water ocean,

28
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.620
which is identified with a male divine principle,
a male God up.

29
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:53.380
So you have a prime evil saltwater ocean,

30
00:01:53.381 --> 00:01:55.960
which is identified with a female divine principle.

31
00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.270
Tmr TMR appears as this watery,
uh,
ocean,

32
00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:05.410
but also as a very fierce dragon like monster.
Uh,

33
00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:10.411
I will be reading sections from Spicer's translation of a pneuma alien,

34
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.710
part of the anthology put together by Pritchard.

35
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.470
It begins when on high,

36
00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:21.430
they haven't had not been named from ground below,

37
00:02:21.431 --> 00:02:26.080
had not been called by name,
not but primordial Appsu there.

38
00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:28.350
Begetter and Moomoo Tiamat.

39
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.830
She who bore them all their water's commingling as a single body.

40
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.300
No Reed Hut had been matted,
had no marshland,
had appeared when no gods,

41
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:40.030
whatever had been brought into being uncalled by,

42
00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:42.190
name their destinies undetermined.

43
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.700
Then it was that the gods were formed within them.

44
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.440
So there's some sort of commingling or union of this male and female divine,

45
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.360
these male and female divine principles,

46
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:57.220
a sexual union of opposite and TMF that begins a process of generation and it

47
00:02:57.221 --> 00:03:00.070
produces first demons,
monsters.

48
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.220
Eventually God's will begin to emerge now in time Tiamat and ops who are

49
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.990
disturbed by the den and the tumult of these younger gods,

50
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.930
the divine brothers banded together.

51
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.260
They disturbed Tiamat as they surged back and forth.
Yeah,

52
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:20.740
they troubled the mood of Tiamat by their hilarity and the abode of heaven.

53
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.520
Absolute opening his mouth said unto resplendent Tiamat there ways are very

54
00:03:26.521 --> 00:03:30.640
lazy.
Load some unto me by day I find no relief nor proposed by night.

55
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.480
I will destroy you.
I will wreck their ways.
That quiet may be restored.

56
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:38.080
Let us have rest.
Then answered.
Miu Miu Miu Miu Tiamat,

57
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.490
giving counsel to up Sue Ellen wishing and ungracious was mama's advice.

58
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.170
Do destroy my father.

59
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:48.280
The mutinous ways then shalt thou have relief by day and rest by night.

60
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.960
When absolute heard this,

61
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.220
his face grew radiant because of the evil he planned against the gods,

62
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.173
his sons.

63
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.020
So he decides to destroy the gods and he is thwarted by a water God named Ia and

64
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:03.070
earth.
Earth,
water gods,
sorry,

65
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:08.071
he's a combination earth water God named Ian and [inaudible] was killed.

66
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.370
Tiamat now is enraged and she's bent on revenge.

67
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.450
She makes plans to attack all of the gods with her assembled forces.

68
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:20.920
The gods are terrified and they need a leader to lead them against her army.

69
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.170
And they turn to Marduk.

70
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.030
Marduk agrees to lead them in battle against [inaudible] and her assembled

71
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:32.620
forces.
Uh,
her forces are under the,
I guess,
general ship of Kingo.

72
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.170
Uh,
and uh,

73
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.920
he agrees to lead them against Tiamat and Kangoo unconditioned that he be

74
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:42.880
granted sovereignty,
right.
And he sets terms

75
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.940
his heart exalting.
He said,
creator of the God's destiny of the great gods.

76
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.970
If indeed I as your avenger am to vanquish Tiamat and save your lives and set up

77
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:57.820
the assembly,
proclaim supreme my destiny.

78
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.880
Let my word instead of you determine the fates.
Unalterable Shelby,

79
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.610
what I may bring into being neither recalled nor changed shall be the command of

80
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:07.444
my lips.

81
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.140
And the agreement is struck and Marduk fells Tiamat in battle.

82
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.691
Uh,

83
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:18.691
it's a fierce battle and there is in fact a memorable passage that um,

84
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.480
details her demise in fury.

85
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:25.030
Tiamat cried out allied to the roots.

86
00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:29.570
Her legs shook both together and then joined issue tms and Marta.

87
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.350
They strove in single combat Lockton battle.

88
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.820
The Lord Marduk spread out his net to enfold her the evil wind which followed

89
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:41.530
behind.
He let loose in her face when TMR opened her mouth to consume him,

90
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.070
he drove in the evil wind that she closed,
not her lips,

91
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.590
and that's the fierce winds charged her belly.

92
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.970
Her body was distended and her mouth was wide open.
He released the Arrow,

93
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.210
it tore her belly.
It cut through her inside,
splitting the heart,

94
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.400
having thus subdued her,
he extinguished her life.

95
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.230
He casts down her carcass to stand upon it.
Well,

96
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.580
what do you do with a carcass of a ferocious monster?

97
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.470
You build a world and that's what mark did.
He takes the carcass,

98
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.420
you slices it into two halves rather like a clam shell and out of the top half

99
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.340
he creates the ferment,
the heaven with the other half.
He creates the land,

100
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:22.640
the earth.
He split her like a shellfish into two parts.

101
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:25.040
Half of her he set up and sealed as a sky,

102
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.680
pulled down the bar and posted guards.

103
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.480
He bade them to allow not her waters to escape,
right?

104
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:37.481
So he has used her body to press back her waters and that's what the ceiling is.

105
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.510
The firmament,

106
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:43.511
a firm beaten the sheet or or or a structure that's holding back waters.

107
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.680
One little holes come along,

108
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:49.610
that's rain coming through and the bottom part is the land which is pressing

109
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:50.540
down waters below.

110
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.540
They come up every now and then in springs and rivers and seas and lakes and

111
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:56.240
things.
That is the creative word but world.

112
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:59.360
But he doesn't stop there and he creates various heavenly bodies at this point.

113
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.060
He constructed stations for the great gods.

114
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.330
The heavenly bodies are understood a stations for the great gods fixing their

115
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:07.430
astral likenesses as constellations.

116
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.130
He determined the year by designating the zones.

117
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.030
He set up three constellations for each of the 12 months.
The moon,

118
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:19.031
he caused to shine the night to him and trusting and then the complaints begin

119
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:19.904
to roll in.

120
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.840
The gods are very unhappy because they have now been assigned specific duties in

121
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:25.700
the maintenance of the cosmos.
You know the Moon,

122
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:28.730
God has to come up at night and hang around for a while and go back down and the

123
00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:32.570
sun has to trundle across the sky and they're pretty unhappy about this and they

124
00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:36.380
want relief from working and laboring at their assigned stations.

125
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.170
And so Marduk seeds to this demand,

126
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.980
he takes blood from the slain general Kingo,

127
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.430
the leader of tms army,
the rebels,

128
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.890
Andy fashion's a human being with the express purpose of freeing the gods from

129
00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:56.480
menial labor.
Blood.
I will mass and caused bones to be,

130
00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:01.070
I will establish,
establish a savage man shall be his name,

131
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.910
barely savage man.
I will create,
he shall be charged.

132
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:07.940
But the service of the gods that they might be at ease.

133
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.380
It was Kingo who can tribe the uprising and made Tiamat rebel and joined battle.

134
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.670
So they bound him,
holding him before Ia and out of king goes blood.

135
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:21.170
They fashioned mankind and IA impose the service and let free the gods.

136
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.830
So the grateful gods now recognize the sovereignty of Marduk and they build him

137
00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:31.100
a magnificent shrine or temple in Babylon

138
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:37.370
pronounced about l,
which simply means gateway of the gods,

139
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.470
the gate of the god Babylon meets the city.

140
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:44.471
That is the gateway of the gods and a big banquet follows and mark mark is

141
00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:49.640
praise for all that he's accomplished in his kingship is confirmed and a Pneuma,

142
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:50.720
a leash ends.

143
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:56.020
It was the great national epic of the city of the bell or Babylon.

144
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.530
It was recited during the New Year festival,

145
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:02.580
which was the most important festival on the cultic calendar and not come Sarna

146
00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:06.450
points out that it had four main functions,
which I've listed over here.

147
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.760
The first of those functions is the organic.

148
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:12.300
It tells us a story of the birth of the gods,
where they came from.

149
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:17.550
It's second function is cosmological.
It's explaining cosmic phenomena,

150
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.090
the land,
the sky,
the,
the,
the heavenly,
um,
uh,

151
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.120
bodies and so on and uh,
and their origins.

152
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.950
It also serves a social and political function because the portrait or picture

153
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:33.660
of the universe or the world and its structure corresponds to and legitimates

154
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.790
the structure of Babylonian society.

155
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.200
The position and the function of the humans in the scheme of creation

156
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.250
corresponds or parallels precisely the position of slaves and Mesopotamian

157
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:45.084
society.

158
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.290
The position and function of look at the top of the hierarchy of authority,

159
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.700
parallels and legitimates the Babylonian King and with others are,
you know,

160
00:09:53.701 --> 00:09:57.990
arranged within this pyramid that falls below.
Um,
it also,

161
00:09:57.991 --> 00:10:02.991
the epic also explains and mirrors the rise of Babela is one of the great cities

162
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.520
in the ancient Near East that explains its rise to power and mark ducks rise

163
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:12.810
from being a city God to being at the head of the Pantheon of,
of a large empire.

164
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:17.760
This also had a Celtic,
um,
function,
um,
as a,
as well,

165
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.510
according to Sarna and some other scholars,
the conflict,

166
00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:25.710
that battle scene between Tiamat and Marduk,
which is described at some length,

167
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.270
symbolizes the,

168
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.780
the conflict or the battle between the forces of chaos and the forces of,

169
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.580
of Cosmos or cosmic order.
And that's a perpetual conflict.
Um,
uh,

170
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:39.030
each year it's a dramatized by the cycle of the seasons.

171
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.810
And at a certain time of the year it seems that the forces of darkness and
chaos,

172
00:10:42.811 --> 00:10:46.800
our prevailing,
but each spring,
once again,
cosmic order and life return.

173
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:52.010
So the epic served as a kind of script for the reenactment of the primeval

174
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.780
battle in a cultic or temple setting.

175
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.660
And that reenactment helped to ensure the victory of the forces of,

176
00:10:58.661 --> 00:11:03.510
of Cosmos and life each year over the forces of chaos and death.

177
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.950
So if we recall now some of the things we were talking about last time in the

178
00:11:07.951 --> 00:11:10.260
theories of Kauffman,
um,

179
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.550
we might describe the world view that's expressed by a pneuma elite in the

180
00:11:14.551 --> 00:11:18.960
following way.
And this is certainly what Sarna does.
We're going to consider,

181
00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:22.950
first of all,
the view of the gods,
the view of humans and the view of the world,

182
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.040
right?
Three distinct categories.
First of all,
the gods,

183
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.890
the gods are clearly limited,
right?

184
00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:32.550
The God to make a plan and they're sorted by another God who then murders that,

185
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:37.110
that God,
um,
they are a moral,
some of them are,
are nicer and better than others,

186
00:11:37.111 --> 00:11:41.040
but they're not necessarily morally good or or righteous.

187
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.160
They emerge from this indifferent,
primal realm,
these,

188
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:48.990
this w a mixture of salt and sea waters that is the source of all being in the

189
00:11:48.991 --> 00:11:50.310
source of ultimate power,

190
00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.290
but they age and they mature and they fight and they die.

191
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.820
They're not wholly good,
not wholly evil,
and no one's got one.
No one.

192
00:11:57.821 --> 00:11:59.440
God's will is absolute.

193
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:05.130
The portrait of humans that emerges is that humans are unimportant meals.

194
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.690
They are the slaves of the gods.

195
00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:12.340
The gods have little reciprocal interest in or concern for them and they create

196
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:16.270
human beings to do the work of running the world.
To some degree,

197
00:12:16.271 --> 00:12:20.170
they look upon them as slaves or pawns the picture of the world.

198
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:24.910
That would seem to emerge from this story is that it is a morally neutral place.

199
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.320
That means that for humans it can be a difficult and hostile place.

200
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.620
The best bet perhaps is to serve the god of the day,

201
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:37.000
whatever God might be ascendant to earn his favor and perhaps his protection.

202
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.410
But even that God will have limited powers and abilities and may in fact be

203
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:46.390
defeated or may turn on his devotees.
Now if we turn to the creation story,

204
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:48.760
the first of the two creation stories that are in the Bible,

205
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:51.700
because in fact there are two creation stories with quite a few contradictions

206
00:12:51.701 --> 00:12:52.534
between them.

207
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.700
But if we turn to the first creation story in genesis one it concludes in

208
00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.970
genesis two verse four.
And not for nothing,

209
00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:03.790
but everyone understands that the function of the colon,
right?

210
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.110
So if we say genesis one one,
I mean chapter one,

211
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:13.000
verse one and then it goes to genesis two,
chapter two verse four,

212
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:16.030
left side of the colon is chapter,
right side of the colon is verse.

213
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.900
And every sentence has a verse number in the Bible.
Okay,
approximately sentence.

214
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.620
Um,
if we look now,
we'll see a different picture emerging.

215
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.560
The biblical God in this story,
which I hope you have read,
um,

216
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.640
is presented as being supreme and unlimited.

217
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.660
That's connected with the lack of mythology in genesis one,

218
00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:36.610
or rather the suppression of mythology.
Okay.

219
00:13:36.611 --> 00:13:39.520
There's a distinction between the two and we'll have to talk about that and hope

220
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.440
that you'll get into some of that in section as well.

221
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.910
I'm using the term mythology now the way we used it in the last lecture when we

222
00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:47.320
were talking about Calvin work,

223
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.850
the theology is used to describe a stories that deal with the birth,

224
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:55.480
the life events of,
of Gods and demigods,
sometimes legendary heroes,

225
00:13:55.481 --> 00:13:57.790
but narrating a sequence of events.

226
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.320
The biblical creation account is non mythological because there is no biography

227
00:14:02.321 --> 00:14:06.390
of God in here.
God simply is.
There's no theater agony,

228
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:10.450
no account of his birth.
Um,
there's no story out of,
through,

229
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:15.280
by means of which he emerges from some other realm in the Mesopotamian account.

230
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.460
The gods themselves are created and then not even created first.
Actually,

231
00:14:18.461 --> 00:14:22.600
the first generation of beings creates these odd demons and monsters.

232
00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:24.820
And God's only are created after several generations.

233
00:14:24.821 --> 00:14:29.440
And the god of Creation Marduk is actually kind of a latecomer in the picture.

234
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:30.670
Um,

235
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:34.780
and this is also a good time for us to draw a distinction between mythology and

236
00:14:34.781 --> 00:14:37.030
myth.
Um,

237
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:41.500
Calvin and others have claimed that mythology is not in certainly this biblical

238
00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:45.200
story or if it's not there,
it's at least suppressed.
Um,

239
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.340
but in contrast,
myth is not mythology.

240
00:14:48.341 --> 00:14:52.460
Myth is a term we use to refer to a traditional.
Um,

241
00:14:52.461 --> 00:14:53.870
it's often fanciful.

242
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.980
It relates imaginatively events,
which it,

243
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.980
it claims happen in historical time,

244
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:03.650
not in a primordial realm before time.

245
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:09.130
And a myth is designed to explain some kind of practice or ritual or custom or

246
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:13.970
natural phenomenon.
And that is why to this day,
you know,
there,
I don't know,

247
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.160
give me some myths that we all know of,
you know,

248
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:20.690
of Paul Bunyan's acts or handle is some something in American nature,

249
00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:23.930
which I now no longer remember.
But myths are fanciful,

250
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:27.860
imaginative tales that are trying to explain the existence of either a thing or

251
00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:31.760
a practice or even a belief.
Sometimes it's a story that's,
um,

252
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:36.260
availed explanation of,
of a truth.
We think of parables perhaps or allegories.

253
00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.320
Um,
and so the claim that's often made is that the Bible,

254
00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:40.880
it doesn't have full blown mythology.
It's,

255
00:15:40.881 --> 00:15:44.610
it doesn't focus on stories about the lives and deaths and interactions of,

256
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.240
of Gods,
but it does certainly contain myths.

257
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.790
It has traditional stories and legends,

258
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:54.950
some quite fanciful whose goal it is to explain how and why something is what it

259
00:15:54.951 --> 00:15:58.130
is.
So we turned into genesis one,

260
00:15:58.131 --> 00:16:02.120
we have an absence of Thiago Annie and mythology in the sense of a biography of

261
00:16:02.121 --> 00:16:06.920
God in this opening chapter.
And that means the absence of a met a divine realm.

262
00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:08.660
If you remember nothing else from this course,

263
00:16:08.661 --> 00:16:10.130
and certainly for the midterm exam,

264
00:16:10.131 --> 00:16:12.380
you should remember the words met a divine realm.

265
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.770
If there's a little hint for you there,
okay.
It's an important concept.

266
00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:19.550
I don't have to buy into it.
You just have to know it.
Okay?
Um,

267
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:23.470
but there is an absence of what Calvin would call this Metta divine round,

268
00:16:23.471 --> 00:16:26.180
this primordial realm from which the gods emerge.

269
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.540
We also therefore have no sense that God is imminent in nature or tied to

270
00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:33.980
natural substances or for not or phenomena.

271
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:39.730
So the biblical God's powers and knowledge do not appear to be limited by the

272
00:16:40.011 --> 00:16:42.980
prior existence of any other substance or power.

273
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.650
Nature also is not divine.

274
00:16:45.651 --> 00:16:48.710
It's Demythologize d divinized if that's a word.

275
00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.320
The created world is not divine.

276
00:16:51.321 --> 00:16:55.400
It is not the physical manifestation of various deities and earth got a water

277
00:16:55.401 --> 00:16:56.480
God and so on.

278
00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:02.150
The line of demarcation there for between the divine and the natural and human

279
00:17:02.151 --> 00:17:06.500
worlds would appear to be clear.
So to summarize in genesis one,

280
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:07.730
um,

281
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.810
the view of God is that there is one supreme God who is Creator and sovereign of

282
00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:14.000
the world who simply exists,

283
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:18.110
who appears to be in corporeal and who,
um,

284
00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:23.300
and for whom the,
the realm of nature is,
um,
is separate and subservient.
Um,

285
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:27.620
he has no life story,
know mythology and his will is absolute indeed.

286
00:17:27.621 --> 00:17:30.740
Creation takes place through the simple expression of his will.

287
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.410
When God began to create heaven and earth.

288
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.890
And then there's a parent's thetical clause,
God said,
let there be light.

289
00:17:36.891 --> 00:17:39.080
And there was light.
He willed,

290
00:17:39.081 --> 00:17:41.060
expressed his will that there'd be light and there was light.

291
00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:44.680
And that's very different from um,
many ancient near eastern cause magnesium,

292
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.960
which there's always a sexual pre a principle at work in creation.

293
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.030
Creation is always result of procreation in some way.

294
00:17:51.031 --> 00:17:53.830
Male and female principals combining,
um,

295
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.240
there's a very similar Egyptian creation story actually in which the god Pathak

296
00:17:57.241 --> 00:18:00.900
just wills let this be less very reads very much like genesis one.

297
00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:05.100
And yet even so there's still a sexual act that follows the expression of those

298
00:18:05.101 --> 00:18:07.230
wills.
Um,
so it,
it is still different.

299
00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.200
Consider now the portrait of humans,

300
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:14.370
humankind that emerges from the biblical creation story in contrast to

301
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:19.050
[inaudible] a leash in genesis,
humans are important.
Genesis one,

302
00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:21.870
humans are important and in fact,
the biblical view of,

303
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.220
of humans really emerges from both of the creation stories if they're,

304
00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.340
when they're read together.

305
00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:30.510
The story here in genesis one and then the creation story that occupies much of

306
00:18:30.511 --> 00:18:34.020
of two and three.
The two accounts are extremely different,

307
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:38.640
but they both signaled the unique position and dignity of the human being.

308
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.950
And the first account in genesis one the creation of the human is clearly the

309
00:18:43.951 --> 00:18:46.030
climactic divine act.
Um,

310
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.050
after this God can rest and a sign of the humans.

311
00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:53.430
Importance is the fact that humans are said to be created in the image of God.

312
00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:53.701
Right?

313
00:18:53.701 --> 00:18:58.701
This occurs in Genesis one verse 26 let us make man in our image after our

314
00:18:58.891 --> 00:19:01.290
likeness.
What might that mean?

315
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.320
Looking at the continuation of the verse of the passage,

316
00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:09.270
we have some idea because humans we see are going to be charged with specific

317
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:14.510
duties towards and rights over the created world and it seems therefore that the

318
00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:19.650
idea of being created in the image of God is connected with those special rights

319
00:19:19.651 --> 00:19:20.484
and duties.

320
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:25.140
A creature is required who was distinguished in certain ways from other animals.

321
00:19:25.141 --> 00:19:27.420
How are humans distinguished from other animals?

322
00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:30.540
You could make a long list but it might include things like the capacity for

323
00:19:30.541 --> 00:19:33.930
language and higher thought or abstract thought conscience.

324
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.150
I'm self control free will.

325
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:41.420
So if those are the distinctive characteristics that earn the human being

326
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.010
certain rights over creation,

327
00:19:44.011 --> 00:19:47.910
but also give them duties towards creation and the human is distinct from

328
00:19:47.911 --> 00:19:49.920
animals and being created in the image of God.

329
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.820
Now there's perhaps a connection to be godlike is to perhaps possess some of

330
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:57.960
these characteristics and being created in the image of God carries a further

331
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:03.140
implication and implies that human life is somehow sacred and deserving of

332
00:20:03.391 --> 00:20:05.220
special care and protection.

333
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:10.820
And that's why in genesis nine verse six we read whoever sheds the blood of man

334
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:17.450
in exchange for that man shall his blood be shed for in the image of God was man

335
00:20:17.911 --> 00:20:18.570
created.

336
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:23.570
Invoke that rationale from Genesis one in the absolute prohibition on on murder.

337
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:28.050
There is no way to compensate or punish someone for murder.

338
00:20:28.051 --> 00:20:31.530
It's simply means forfeiture of one's own life.
That's how secret human life is.

339
00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:35.880
That's the biblical view.
So the concept of the divine image in humans,

340
00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:37.530
uh,
right,
that's a,

341
00:20:37.531 --> 00:20:42.060
that's a powerful idea that there is a divine image in humans and that breaks

342
00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:45.120
with other ancient conceptions of the human.

343
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.990
In genesis one humans are not the meals of God and in fact,

344
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:52.330
genesis expresses the antithesis of this.

345
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.560
We're in a new [inaudible] service was imposed upon the God on the human,

346
00:20:56.561 --> 00:20:57.640
so the gods were free.

347
00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:01.740
You don't have to worry about anything that humans would take care of gods in.

348
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.890
We have the reverse.

349
00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:06.250
It's almost like a polemic Olin version and genesis one the very first

350
00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:10.300
communication of God to the human that's created is concerned for that

351
00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:12.130
creature's physical needs and welfare.

352
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.720
He says in Genesis One verses 28 and 29 he blesses them.

353
00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:20.200
God blessed them and God said to them,
be fertile and increase.

354
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.720
Fill the earth and master it.
Rule the fish of the sea,

355
00:21:22.721 --> 00:21:25.540
the birds of the sky and all the living things that creep on earth.

356
00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:30.640
In Genesis two verse 16 after the creation story there and the Lord God

357
00:21:30.641 --> 00:21:33.520
commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden,
you are free to eat.

358
00:21:33.521 --> 00:21:35.110
His first thought is,
what are you going to eat?

359
00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:37.090
I want you to be fruitful and multiply and so on.

360
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:42.870
So humans and genesis are not presented as the helpless victims of blind forces

361
00:21:42.911 --> 00:21:46.120
of nature.
They're not the meals and servants of capricious gods.

362
00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.330
They are creatures of majesty and dignity,

363
00:21:49.331 --> 00:21:54.331
and they are of importance to objects of concern for the God who has created

364
00:21:54.581 --> 00:21:57.130
them.
At the same time.

365
00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:01.240
And I think very much in line with the assertion that humans are created in the

366
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.410
image of God.
Humans are not in fact gods.

367
00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:10.990
They are still creatures in the sense of created things and they are dependent

368
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:15.670
on a higher power.
So in the second creation story beginning in Genesis two,

369
00:22:15.671 --> 00:22:16.504
four,

370
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:21.570
we read that the first human is formed when God fashions it from the dust of the

371
00:22:21.731 --> 00:22:23.660
earth or clay.
Um,

372
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.760
there are lots of ancient near eastern stories of gods fashioning humans from

373
00:22:27.761 --> 00:22:28.271
clay.

374
00:22:28.271 --> 00:22:31.630
We have depictions of gods as potters at a potter's wheel just turning out lots

375
00:22:31.631 --> 00:22:35.260
of little humans.
Um,
but the biblical account,

376
00:22:35.261 --> 00:22:37.900
as much as it borrows from that Motif,
again,

377
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:43.020
takes pains to distinguish that and elevate the human first.

378
00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.990
The fashioning of the human from clay is again,
in that story.

379
00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:51.310
It's the climactic or uh,
well,
not quite climactic.
Um,

380
00:22:51.311 --> 00:22:53.980
it's the penultimate I suppose moment in the story.

381
00:22:53.981 --> 00:22:58.540
The final climactic act of creation is the creation of the female from the male

382
00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.390
that is actually the peak of creation.
What can I say?

383
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.350
Second is significantly not an afterthought.

384
00:23:05.351 --> 00:23:08.030
It's the peak of creation a second and significantly.

385
00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.410
God himself blows the breath of life into Adam's nostrils.

386
00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:14.830
So while he fashions this clay figure,
all right,
this,

387
00:23:14.831 --> 00:23:18.610
this carcass actually and then reads life his own life into it.

388
00:23:18.611 --> 00:23:21.700
So in the second creation story,
just as in the first,

389
00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.960
there's a sacred imprint of some kind that distinguishes the human creation from

390
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:30.880
the other creatures.
So this idea that the human being is a mixture of,
um,

391
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.840
uh,
of clay.
He's molded from clay,
but enlivened by the breath I've got.
Um,

392
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.920
it captures that paradoxical mix of sort of earthly and divine elements,

393
00:23:40.991 --> 00:23:45.010
dependence and freedom that marks the human as unique.

394
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.660
It should further be noted that in the creation first creation account,

395
00:23:50.661 --> 00:23:54.290
there's no implication that man and woman are in any kind of unequal

396
00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:56.270
relationship before God.

397
00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:01.750
The Hebrew word that designates the creature created by God is the word a dumb.

398
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:07.490
It's actually not a proper name,
small lay.

399
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.220
It is a dumb,
it's a generic term.

400
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:15.110
It's simply means human or more precisely earthling because it comes from the

401
00:24:15.111 --> 00:24:17.300
word [inaudible],
which means the ground or earth.

402
00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.500
So this is an a dumb and earthling,
a thing that has been taken from the earth.

403
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.610
Genesis one states that God created the,

404
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:29.030
a dumb with a definite article.
This is not a proper name.

405
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:34.100
God created the a dumb,
the earthling male and female created he them.

406
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.480
That's a line,
that's vex commentators for centuries,
um,

407
00:24:38.481 --> 00:24:42.620
and has spawned many very fascinating interpretations and you will be reading

408
00:24:42.621 --> 00:24:46.370
some of those in the readings that are assigned for section discussion next
week.

409
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:50.960
Um,
and I think having a great deal of fun with them more over this,

410
00:24:50.961 --> 00:24:55.220
this earthling seems that seems to include both male and female is then said to

411
00:24:55.221 --> 00:24:56.600
be in the,
in the image of God.

412
00:24:56.601 --> 00:25:00.650
So that suggests that the ancient Israelites didn't conceive of God is gendered

413
00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.620
or necessarily gendered.
The dom,

414
00:25:03.621 --> 00:25:07.370
the earthling male and female was made in the image of God.

415
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.710
Even in the second creation account.

416
00:25:09.711 --> 00:25:13.020
It's not clear that the woman is subordinate to the man.
Um,

417
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:18.040
many medieval Jewish commentators enjoy pointing out that she was not made from

418
00:25:18.051 --> 00:25:20.810
his head so that she not rule over him,

419
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:24.650
but she wasn't made from his foot so that she would be subservient to him.

420
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:28.850
She was made from his side so that she would be a companion to him.
Um,

421
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:32.360
and the creation of women,
as I said,
is in fact the climactic creative act.

422
00:25:32.361 --> 00:25:36.500
And the second genesis account with her formation creation is now complete.

423
00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:42.280
So the biblical creation stories individually and jointly present a portrait of

424
00:25:42.501 --> 00:25:45.860
the human as the pinnacle and purpose of creation,

425
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:51.080
godlike in some way in possession of distinctive faculties and characteristics,

426
00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.250
um,
that equipped them for stewardship over the world that God has created.

427
00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:56.541
Finally,

428
00:25:56.541 --> 00:25:59.930
let's talk about the image of the world that emerges from the creation story.

429
00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:03.080
In Genesis one,
in these stories,

430
00:26:03.081 --> 00:26:07.580
there is a very strong emphasis on the essential goodness of the world.

431
00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.720
We call some of Calvin's ideas or categories.
Again,

432
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.590
one of the things he claims is that in a polytheistic system,

433
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:17.420
which is morally neutral,

434
00:26:17.421 --> 00:26:20.360
where you have some primordial realm that spawns demons,
monsters,

435
00:26:20.361 --> 00:26:23.330
gods evil is a permanent necessity.

436
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:26.580
It's just built into the structure of the cosmos.
Um,

437
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:30.710
because of the fact that all kinds of divine beings,
good and bad,

438
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.590
are generated and locked in conflict.

439
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:38.510
So the world isn't essentially good in its nature or essentially bad.

440
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.680
Note the difference in Genesis after each act of creation,

441
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.680
what does God say it is?
Good,
right?

442
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.400
Genesis one verse four,
verse 10,
verse 12,
Verse 18,
Verse 21,

443
00:26:50.401 --> 00:26:53.670
verse 25 and after the creation of living things,

444
00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:57.390
the text states that God found all that he made to be very good.

445
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:01.770
So there are seven occurrences of the word good in genesis.

446
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.300
That's something you want to watch for.

447
00:27:03.301 --> 00:27:07.200
If you're reading a passage of the Bible and you're noticing a word coming up a

448
00:27:07.201 --> 00:27:11.430
lot,
count them.
This is probably going to be seven or 10.
They loved doing that.

449
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:15.090
Um,
the seven fold or the tenfold repetition of a word,
such a word,

450
00:27:15.091 --> 00:27:17.170
is called a light works

451
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.230
recurring word that is,
becomes thematic.

452
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.290
That's a favorite literary technique of the biblical author.

453
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.310
So we read genesis one and we hear this recurring and it was good and he looked

454
00:27:29.311 --> 00:27:30.810
and it was good and he looked at it was good.

455
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.740
And we have this tremendous rush of optimism.
The world is good.

456
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.560
Humans are important.
They have purpose and dignity.

457
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:42.450
The biblical writers rejecting the concept of a primordial evil,

458
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:45.840
a concept found in the literature of the ancient Near East.

459
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:48.510
So for the biblical writer of this story,

460
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:53.550
it would seem that evil is not a metaphysical reality built into the structure

461
00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:54.630
of the universe.

462
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.900
So all signs of a cosmic battle or some primordial act of violence between the

463
00:28:00.211 --> 00:28:05.211
forces of chaos and evil and the forces of Cosmos and good are eliminated in a

464
00:28:05.881 --> 00:28:10.470
new,
my alias cosmic order is achieved only after a violent struggle with very

465
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:12.990
hostile forces.
But in genesis,

466
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:17.460
creation is not the result of a struggle between divine antagonists.

467
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:22.640
God imposes order on the d mythologized elements that he finds water,

468
00:28:23.221 --> 00:28:24.960
but it's just water.
Okay,

469
00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.310
let's look a little bit more closely at genesis one to make this case.

470
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.270
The chapter begins with a temporal clause,

471
00:28:33.271 --> 00:28:36.210
which is unfortunately often translated in the beginning,

472
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.740
which implies that what follows is going to give you an ultimate account of the

473
00:28:40.741 --> 00:28:44.790
origins of the universe.
You sort of expect something like in the beginning,

474
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.660
God created the heaven and earth like this was the first thing to happen in
time,

475
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:49.141
right?

476
00:28:49.141 --> 00:28:53.070
So that translation causes people to believe that the story is giving me an

477
00:28:53.071 --> 00:28:56.520
account of the first event in time forward.

478
00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.860
But it's actually a bad translation.

479
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:03.120
The Hebrew phrase that starts the book of Genesis is pretty much exactly like

480
00:29:03.121 --> 00:29:07.110
the phrase,
it starts a new Ma,
a leash.
When on high,

481
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.200
um,
there was a whole bunch of water and stuff.

482
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.860
Then suddenly this happened very similar in the Hebrew.

483
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.170
It's better translated this way.

484
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.620
When God began creating the heavens and the earth,

485
00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:22.620
he said,
let there be light and there was light.

486
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:27.720
And that translation suggests that the story isn't concerned to depict the

487
00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.480
ultimate origins of the universe.

488
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:34.560
It's interested in explaining how am I the world?
Got The way it is.

489
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.830
When God began this process of creating the heaven and the earth,

490
00:29:37.831 --> 00:29:40.290
and the earth was unformed and void,
and w you know,

491
00:29:40.291 --> 00:29:43.750
his wind was on the surface of the deep and so on.
He said,

492
00:29:43.751 --> 00:29:48.040
let there be light and there was light.
So we find that effect.

493
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.350
Something exists.
It has no shape.

494
00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:56.260
So creation in genesis one is not described as a process of making something out

495
00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:59.260
of nothing.
That's a notion referred to as creation.

496
00:29:59.261 --> 00:30:03.000
Ex Niccolo low creation of something out of utter nothing.
Um,

497
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:08.040
it's instead a process of organizing preexisting materials and imposing order on

498
00:30:08.201 --> 00:30:12.560
those chaotic materials.
So we begin with this chaotic mass.
Um,

499
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:16.240
and then there's the Ruach of God.
Now,

500
00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:21.241
sometimes this word Ruach is kind of anachronistically translated as spirit

501
00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:26.170
really doesn't mean that in the Hebrew Bible and later levels of Hebrew,

502
00:30:26.171 --> 00:30:30.880
it will start to mean that,
but it is really wind.
Ra is wind.

503
00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:36.130
So when God began to create heaven on earth,
the earth being unformed and void,

504
00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.240
the wind of God weeping over the deep.

505
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:45.780
Remember the cosmic battle between Marduk and Tiamat Marduk,

506
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:50.290
the storm God who released his wind against Tiamat,

507
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:54.220
the primeval,
primeval deep,
the primeval water.

508
00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:58.450
I'm representing the forces of chaos and you should immediately hear the great

509
00:30:58.451 --> 00:31:01.960
similarities.
Our story opens with a temporal clause.

510
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:05.350
When on high when God began creating,

511
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:10.680
we have a wind that sweeps over chaotic waters just like the wind of Marduk

512
00:31:10.931 --> 00:31:12.550
released into the face of tms.

513
00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:18.100
And the Hebrew term is particularly fascinating.
In fact,
the text says,

514
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:23.200
and there is darkness on the face of deep,
no definite article.

515
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.690
The word deep is a proper name,

516
00:31:25.691 --> 00:31:30.691
perhaps Hebrew word is to home means deep and etymologically.

517
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:36.610
It's exactly the same word as t on that.
The attending is just feminine.

518
00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:40.990
So TM to home,
it's the same word,
it's a related word.

519
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:45.490
So the wind over the face of deep.
Now this d mythologize.

520
00:31:45.491 --> 00:31:50.491
So it's as if they're in evoking the story that would have been familiar and yet

521
00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:51.723
changing it.

522
00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:56.080
So the storyteller has actually set the stage for retelling the cosmic battle

523
00:31:56.081 --> 00:31:57.820
story that everyone knew.

524
00:31:57.821 --> 00:32:01.540
That was a story that surely was near and dear to the hearts of many ancient

525
00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.730
Israelites and ancient near eastern listeners.

526
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:08.140
So all the elements are there for the retelling of that story.
We've got wind,

527
00:32:08.141 --> 00:32:12.070
we've got a primeval,
chaotic,
watery mass or deep and then surprise,

528
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.180
there's no battle.
There's just a word.
Let there be light.

529
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:19.420
And the ancient near eastern listener would prick up their ears.

530
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.180
And where's the battle?
Where's the violence?
Where's the Gore?

531
00:32:22.181 --> 00:32:24.610
I thought I knew this story.
So something new,

532
00:32:24.611 --> 00:32:27.850
something different was being communicated in this story.

533
00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:33.070
And don't think the biblical writers didn't know this Motif of creation

534
00:32:33.071 --> 00:32:35.500
following upon a huge cosmic battle,

535
00:32:35.501 --> 00:32:38.950
particularly a battle with a watery dragon like monster.

536
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.640
There are many poetic passages in poetic sections of the Bible that contained

537
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.820
very clear and explicit illusions to that myth.

538
00:32:46.821 --> 00:32:50.420
It was certainly known and told Israelite children.
Um,

539
00:32:50.421 --> 00:32:53.270
and part of the culture we haven't mentioned in Joe,

540
00:32:53.271 --> 00:32:57.920
we haven't mentioned in the following psalm,
psalm 74 versus 12 to 17.

541
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:01.490
Oh God,
my king from of old who brings deliverance throughout the land.

542
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:03.830
It was you who drove back the sea with your might,

543
00:33:03.831 --> 00:33:06.110
who smashed the heads of the monsters in the waters.

544
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:10.250
It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan.
A sea monster.
Um,

545
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:15.410
other psalms also contains similar lines.
Isaiah 51 verses nine through 10.

546
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:17.600
It was you that hacked Rayhab.

547
00:33:17.601 --> 00:33:20.930
This is another name of a primeval water monster in pieces.

548
00:33:20.931 --> 00:33:23.870
It was you that pierce the drag and it was you that dried up the sea,

549
00:33:23.871 --> 00:33:27.500
the waters of the great deep.
These were familiar stories.

550
00:33:27.501 --> 00:33:29.720
They were known in Israel.
They were recounted in Israel.

551
00:33:29.721 --> 00:33:34.721
They were stories of a god who violently slays the forces of chaos represented

552
00:33:35.061 --> 00:33:38.150
as watery dragons as a prelude to creation.

553
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:43.520
And the rejection of this motif for this idea in genesis one,

554
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:47.120
um,
is pointed and purposeful.

555
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:51.200
It's deemed pathologization removal of the creation account from the realm.

556
00:33:51.201 --> 00:33:55.300
And the world of mythology is pointed and purposeful.
It wants us to,

557
00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.030
to conceive of God as an uncontested God who,
through the power of his word,

558
00:33:59.031 --> 00:34:01.010
or we'll create the cosmos.

559
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:05.120
And he follows that initial ordering by setting up celestial bodies just as

560
00:34:05.121 --> 00:34:07.730
Martin did.
They're not in themselves.
However,

561
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:12.410
divinities they are merely God's creations.
In the biblical text,

562
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.840
the firmament appears to be um,
uh,
beaten.
Uh,
the,

563
00:34:16.841 --> 00:34:20.200
the word in Hebrew is something that's been beaten out like a metal worker would

564
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:23.410
a hammer out a thin sheet of metal.
And that's what the from Minot,

565
00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:25.250
this by the way is the portrait of the world.

566
00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:29.420
Looks a lot like my map of the ancient near east,
but it's not.

567
00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:34.190
So you have this firmament which is beaten back to hold back primeval waters

568
00:34:34.191 --> 00:34:38.090
that are pressing in.
You have land which is holding down the water's here.

569
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.870
We inhabit the bubble that's created in that way.

570
00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:44.660
That's the image in a new my alias.
And it's the image of genesis one.

571
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:49.100
And later on when God gets mad,
he's going to open up some windows up here,
right?

572
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:52.490
And it's all going to the flood.
That's what's going to happen in the flood.

573
00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.470
But that's the image of the world that you're working with.

574
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:59.960
So the firmament is sort of like an inverted bowl and beaten out sheet of metal.

575
00:34:59.961 --> 00:35:02.840
That's an inverted bowl.
And again,
as I said,

576
00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.920
echoes of a Ma alias where you have martik dividing the carcass of Tiamat like a

577
00:35:06.921 --> 00:35:07.754
shellfish.

578
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:12.170
He separates the waters above and the waters below and creates this,

579
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:16.400
this space that will become the inhabited world.
Okay?

580
00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:21.860
Now the story of creation in genesis one takes place over seven days and there's

581
00:35:21.861 --> 00:35:26.450
a certain logic and parallelism to the six days of creating.

582
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:31.130
And I've written those parallels here.
Um,
there's a parallel between day one,

583
00:35:31.131 --> 00:35:35.960
day four,
they two and five,
they three and six on Day One,

584
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:40.350
light and dark are separated.
On Day four,

585
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:44.490
the heavenly bodies that give off light by day or night or created.

586
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:49.950
On Day two,
the firmament is established,
that water is separated,

587
00:35:49.951 --> 00:35:51.090
that bubble is opened up.

588
00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:55.410
So we've got sky created and we've got the water's collected in certain areas

589
00:35:55.411 --> 00:35:59.790
down here,
right water down here,
and we've got sky on day five,

590
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.690
the inhabitants of the skies and the waters are created birds and fish.

591
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.580
On Day three,

592
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.570
land is formed to make dry spots from the waters below.

593
00:36:09.571 --> 00:36:13.860
So you have land being formed in day three it's separated out from the sea and

594
00:36:13.861 --> 00:36:17.790
on day six you have the creation of land animals,

595
00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:22.200
but days three and six each have an extra element.

596
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:27.210
And the fact that the first elements here pair up nicely with each other.

597
00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:31.770
Suggest that the extra element on day three and the extra element on day six

598
00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:35.550
might also be paired in some important way.
On Day three,

599
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.140
vegetation is produced,

600
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:41.760
is created and on day six humans are created after the creation of the land

601
00:36:41.761 --> 00:36:42.594
animals.

602
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:47.220
So the implication is that the vegetation is for the humans and indeed it's

603
00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:52.221
expressly stated by God that humans are to be given every fruit bearing tree and

604
00:36:54.571 --> 00:36:58.260
seed bearing plant fruits and grains for food.

605
00:36:58.261 --> 00:37:01.710
That's in genesis one 29.
That's what you are going to eat.

606
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:06.540
There's no mention of of um,
chicken or beef.

607
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.600
It's no mention made of animals for food.

608
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.330
In Genesis one verse 30,

609
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.330
God says that the animals are being given the green plants,

610
00:37:15.331 --> 00:37:19.380
the grass and herbs for food.
In other words,

611
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.540
there should be no competition for food.

612
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.990
Humans have fruit and grain bearing vegetation.

613
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.630
Animals have the erbium [inaudible] and the grasses.

614
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:32.790
There is no excuse to live in anything but a peaceful coexistence.
Therefore,

615
00:37:32.791 --> 00:37:36.720
humans,
according to genesis one,
were created vegetarian.

616
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.940
And in every respect,

617
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:44.270
the original creation is imagined as free of bloodshed and violence of every

618
00:37:44.311 --> 00:37:48.360
kind.
And God saw that it was very good.
So on the seventh day,

619
00:37:48.361 --> 00:37:49.980
God rested from his labors.

620
00:37:49.981 --> 00:37:53.730
And for this reason he blessed the seventh day and declared it holy.

621
00:37:53.731 --> 00:37:57.480
This is a word we'll be coming back to in about five or six lectures talking

622
00:37:57.481 --> 00:37:59.010
about what it is to be holy.

623
00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:02.340
But right now it essentially means that belongs to God.
Something's holy.

624
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:04.570
It doesn't belong to you,
it belongs to God.
Okay?

625
00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:09.540
And part of the purpose of this story is to explain the origin of the observance

626
00:38:09.541 --> 00:38:12.120
of the Sabbath.
The Sabbath.
The seventh day is a holy day.

627
00:38:12.121 --> 00:38:16.110
So this is a myth in that sense that it's explaining some customer ritual among

628
00:38:16.111 --> 00:38:16.944
the people.

629
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:22.700
So Israelite accounts of creation contained clear illusions to and resonances of

630
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.680
ancient near eastern cause manganese.

631
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:30.420
But perhaps Dan assist one can best be described as d mythologizing what was a

632
00:38:30.421 --> 00:38:32.370
common cultural heritage?

633
00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:37.150
There's a clear tendency in this story towards monotheism and the abstract terms

634
00:38:37.151 --> 00:38:39.820
at Calvin described,
um,
uh,

635
00:38:39.821 --> 00:38:44.821
transformation of widely known stories to express a monotheistic worldview was

636
00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.650
clearly important to these particular biblical writers.

637
00:38:47.651 --> 00:38:50.110
And we'll be talking later about who these writers were,

638
00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:52.870
who wrote Genesis one as opposed to genesis two and three.

639
00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:58.180
But these stories rival and implicitly polemicizing against the myths or

640
00:38:58.181 --> 00:39:01.300
mythologies of Israel's neighbors.
They reject certain elements,

641
00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.580
but they almost reject them by incorporating them,
right?

642
00:39:03.581 --> 00:39:05.050
They incorporate and modify them.

643
00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:11.730
So one of the things I've tried to claim in describing genesis one is that in

644
00:39:12.521 --> 00:39:16.480
this story,
evil is represented not as a physical reality.

645
00:39:16.481 --> 00:39:20.080
It's not built into the structure of the world,
right?
When God rests,

646
00:39:20.081 --> 00:39:22.840
he's looking at the whole thing.
It's very good.
It's set up very well.

647
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:26.780
And yet we know that evil is a condition of human existence.
It's a,

648
00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:29.500
it's a reality of life.
So how do we account for it?

649
00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:33.060
And the Garden of Eden Story I think seeks to answer that question.

650
00:39:33.061 --> 00:39:36.170
They actually,
there's a whole bunch of things,
but one thing it does,
I think is,

651
00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:41.210
is try to answer that question and to assert that evil stems from human

652
00:39:41.561 --> 00:39:44.170
behavior.
God created a good world,

653
00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.590
but humans in the exercise of their moral autonomy,

654
00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:49.690
they have the power to corrupt the good.

655
00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:55.290
So the garden of Eden story communicates with Kauffman would identify as a basic

656
00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.800
idea of a monotheistic worldview.
That evil isn't a metaphysical reality,

657
00:39:59.801 --> 00:40:01.150
it's a moral reality.

658
00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:06.640
What that means ultimately is that evil lacks inevitability depending on your

659
00:40:06.641 --> 00:40:09.940
theory of human nature,
I suppose,
but it awesome it in.

660
00:40:09.941 --> 00:40:13.690
It also means that that evil lies within the realm of human responsibility and

661
00:40:13.691 --> 00:40:18.400
control.
Now,
not whom Sarna the scholar whose work I referred to earlier,

662
00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.060
he points out that there's a very important distinction between the garden of

663
00:40:22.061 --> 00:40:25.900
Eden Story and it's ancient near eastern parallels.
He says,

664
00:40:25.901 --> 00:40:30.901
the Motif of a tree of life or a plant of life or a plant of eternal youth.

665
00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:35.350
That's a motif that we do find in other ancient,
near eastern literatures in,

666
00:40:35.351 --> 00:40:39.790
in ancient near eastern myth and ritual and iconography and the quest for such a

667
00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:43.590
plant or the quest for immortality,
um,

668
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:47.530
that the plant promises that these were primary themes in,
um,

669
00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:50.230
in the Mesopotamian epic of Gilgamesh

670
00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:56.530
will have occasion to talk in great depth about this story next time.

671
00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.990
But by contrast,
Sarna says,

672
00:40:58.991 --> 00:41:03.550
we haven't as yet uncovered a parallel in ancient near eastern literature to the

673
00:41:03.551 --> 00:41:06.970
biblical tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
It's not the tree of knowledge.

674
00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:10.450
It's a tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
So the longer phrase,

675
00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:15.850
what is the significance of the fact that the Bible mentions both of these
trees?

676
00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:18.760
It mentions a tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,

677
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.600
and then goes on to just focus on the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

678
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:25.990
It virtually ignores the tree of life until we get to the end of the story.

679
00:41:25.991 --> 00:41:28.480
And that's important.
But this tree of life,

680
00:41:28.481 --> 00:41:32.720
which seems to be central to many other myths of this time and uh,

681
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:33.980
this of the world.

682
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:39.790
Sarna argues that the subordinate role of the tree of life signals the biblical

683
00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:45.791
writers dissociation from a preoccupation with immortality.

684
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:52.070
The Biblical writer insists that the central concern of life is not mortality,

685
00:41:52.071 --> 00:41:57.071
but morality and the drama of human life should revolve not around the search

686
00:41:57.741 --> 00:41:58.970
for eternal life,

687
00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:04.540
but around the moral conflict intention between a good God's designed for

688
00:42:04.761 --> 00:42:09.500
creation and the freewill of human beings that can corrupt that good design.

689
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:16.030
The serpent tells eve that if she eats the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of

690
00:42:16.071 --> 00:42:18.650
good and evil,
she will become like God.

691
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:25.190
And he's really not telling a lie in a certain respect and God knows that the

692
00:42:25.191 --> 00:42:28.760
human beings will become like gods knowing good and evil.

693
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.950
It's one of the things about,
uh,

694
00:42:30.951 --> 00:42:35.540
about God knows good and evil and has chosen the good,
right,
the Israelite,

695
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:39.050
the biblical writers,
sorts of this God that he is absolutely good.

696
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:42.530
The humans will become like gods,
knowing good and evil,

697
00:42:42.531 --> 00:42:44.720
not because of some magical property in this fruit.

698
00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.900
And it's not an apple by the way.
That's based on an interesting Mrs Translation.

699
00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.690
Did we know what the fruit is?
Nobody.
I don't think we really know,

700
00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.510
but it's definitely not an apple that's comes from the Latin word,

701
00:42:53.511 --> 00:42:54.670
which sounds like apple.

702
00:42:54.671 --> 00:42:58.520
The word Muslim for evil is close to the Latin word for apple,

703
00:42:58.521 --> 00:43:02.210
which if anybody knows whatever.
And uh,

704
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:04.100
and so for the history,
you know,

705
00:43:04.101 --> 00:43:06.680
our iconography began to represent this trees and apple tree and so on.

706
00:43:06.681 --> 00:43:09.950
But it's not an apple tree.
I don't know if they had apple trees back then there.

707
00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:15.010
Um,
but it's not because of some magical property in the fruit itself.
Um,

708
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:18.380
but because of the action of disobedience itself,

709
00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.410
by choosing to eat of the fruit in defiance of God,
right?

710
00:43:21.411 --> 00:43:23.330
This is the one thing God says,
you know,
don't do this.

711
00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.610
You can have everything else in this garden.

712
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:29.300
Presumably even you can eat of the tree of life,
right?

713
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:30.650
It doesn't say you can't eat of that.

714
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.350
Who's to say they couldn't eat event and just live forever.

715
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:36.410
Don't eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

716
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:45.030
God says you can't eat of this tree when he's given all of that.

717
00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:51.410
There has been about how many thousands of years of speculation on what's going

718
00:43:51.411 --> 00:43:54.110
on and you're going to be reading a wonderful and interesting gnostic

719
00:43:54.111 --> 00:43:56.750
interpretation.
So yeah,
there have been,

720
00:43:56.810 --> 00:44:00.050
there's been lots of interesting and this is all in the realm of literary

721
00:44:00.051 --> 00:44:02.150
interpretation.
Read the story closely.

722
00:44:02.151 --> 00:44:04.940
See if you can figure out what's going on here.
Why does God do this?

723
00:44:04.941 --> 00:44:09.200
Why isn't this in a way putting an obstacle in front of someone almost ensuring

724
00:44:09.201 --> 00:44:10.550
they're going to trip over it.
Um,

725
00:44:10.551 --> 00:44:13.580
that's been an argument that some commentators have made others see it

726
00:44:13.581 --> 00:44:18.560
differently.
Um,
so keep that thought.
Take it to section and read.
Um,

727
00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.080
Elaine Pagels work and some of the other interpretations.

728
00:44:21.081 --> 00:44:23.780
That's something people have struggled with for centuries,
right?

729
00:44:23.781 --> 00:44:25.700
Where does this come from?
Who is the serpent?
What's he doing there?

730
00:44:25.701 --> 00:44:28.400
They're all very important.
It is true.

731
00:44:28.401 --> 00:44:32.100
And maybe this will go a little bit of the distance towards answering it.
Um,

732
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.670
it's by eating of the fruit in defiance of God.

733
00:44:35.671 --> 00:44:38.100
Human beings learned that they were able to do that,

734
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:40.380
that they are free moral agents.
They find that out.

735
00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:44.400
They're able to choose their actions in conformity with God's will or in

736
00:44:44.401 --> 00:44:49.200
defiance of God's will.
So paradoxically they learn that they have more autonomy.

737
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:52.980
Remember they were made in the image of God and they learned that they have

738
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:57.930
moral autonomy by making the defiant choice,
right?
The choice for disobedience.

739
00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.420
The argument could be made that until they wants disobeyed,

740
00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:04.830
how would they ever know that?
And then you raise all sorts of questions about,

741
00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:05.071
well,

742
00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:08.370
was this part of God's plan that they ought to know this and should know this so

743
00:45:08.371 --> 00:45:10.470
that their choice for good actually becomes meaningful?

744
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:13.620
Is it meaningful to choose to do the good when you have no choice to do

745
00:45:13.621 --> 00:45:16.020
otherwise or aren't aware that you have a choice to do otherwise?

746
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.590
So it was a wonderful 13th century commentator that says that God needed

747
00:45:19.591 --> 00:45:21.900
creatures who could choose to obey him.

748
00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:25.030
And therefore it was important for,

749
00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.470
for Adam and Eve to do what they did and to learn that they have the choice not

750
00:45:28.471 --> 00:45:32.010
to obey God so that their choice for God would become endowed with meaning.

751
00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:33.360
That's one line of interpretation.

752
00:45:33.361 --> 00:45:36.810
That's a gone through many theological systems for hundreds of years.

753
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:42.540
So the very action that brought them a god like awareness of their moral

754
00:45:42.541 --> 00:45:46.170
autonomy was an action that was taken in opposition to God.

755
00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:51.090
So we see them that having knowledge of good and evil is no guarantee that one

756
00:45:51.091 --> 00:45:53.010
we'll choose or inclined towards the good.

757
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:56.970
That's what the serpent omitted in his speech,
right?
He said,

758
00:45:56.971 --> 00:46:00.660
if you eat of that fruit,
of that tree of the knowledge of good and evil,

759
00:46:00.661 --> 00:46:04.830
you'll become like God.
It's true in one sense,
but it's false.
In another,

760
00:46:04.831 --> 00:46:06.810
he sort of admitted to point out,

761
00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:11.490
he implies that it's the power of moral choice alone that is God like,

762
00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:13.850
but the biblical writer will claim and uh,

763
00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:18.240
many places that true godliness isn't simply power the power to do what one

764
00:46:18.241 --> 00:46:23.070
wishes.
True Godliness means imitation of God.
The exercise of one's power.

765
00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:27.030
In a manner that is God,
like good life affirming and so on.

766
00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:31.500
So it's the biblical writers contention that the God of Israel is not only all

767
00:46:31.501 --> 00:46:34.380
powerful,
but is essentially and necessarily good.

768
00:46:34.381 --> 00:46:36.550
Those two elements cannot become disjoined.

769
00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.870
They must always be conjoined in the biblical writers view.
And finally,

770
00:46:39.871 --> 00:46:44.250
your humans will learn that the concomitant of their freedom is responsibility.

771
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:46.650
Their first act of defiance is punished harshly.

772
00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:51.150
So they learn in this story that the moral choices and actions of humans have

773
00:46:51.151 --> 00:46:55.860
consequences that have to be borne by the perpetrator.
So just to sum up,

774
00:46:55.861 --> 00:46:59.910
Sarna sees in the garden of Eden story as I've just explained it,

775
00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:04.110
a message that's in line with Calvin's thesis about the monotheistic worldview.

776
00:47:04.111 --> 00:47:04.831
He says,

777
00:47:04.831 --> 00:47:09.570
the story conveys the idea that quote evil is a product of human behavior,

778
00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.790
not a principal inherent in the cosmos.

779
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.790
Man's disobedience is the cause of the human predicament.

780
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.730
Human freedom can be at one in the same time,

781
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.730
an omen of disaster and a challenge and opportunity.

782
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.070
We've looked at genesis two and three,

783
00:47:23.071 --> 00:47:26.670
a little bit as an attempt to account for the problematic and paradoxical

784
00:47:26.671 --> 00:47:30.390
existence of evil and suffering in a world created by a good God.

785
00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:34.170
And that's a problem.
Monotheism really never completely conquers.
Um,

786
00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.540
but other perspectives on this story or possible,

787
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:38.310
and when we come back on Monday,

788
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:40.920
we're going to look at it from an entirely different point of view and compare

789
00:47:40.921 --> 00:47:42.180
it with the epic of Gilgamesh.
