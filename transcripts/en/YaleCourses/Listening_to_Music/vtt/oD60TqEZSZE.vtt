1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.210
Okay,
let us start,
ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:06.570
we're going to pursue the issue of musical form today.

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.590
It's an important thing to talk about because it allows us to follow a

4
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:15.591
particular piece of music and we'll be using this metaphor of a musical journey

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.520
and wanting to know where we are in music throughout today.

6
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:25.521
Today form is particularly important in all types of music,

7
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:29.460
popular music as well as classical music.

8
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.110
And we have this complex of material coming at us,
the sonic material,

9
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.530
and we try to make sense of it and we say that it has a particular form and we

10
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.520
say it could have a particular structure even.

11
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:45.600
So we tend to use metaphors having to do with architecture and things such as

12
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:46.650
this.
Uh,

13
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:50.640
what we are really doing here is taking all of this sonic information that's

14
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:54.420
coming into our brain and getting sorted and makes us want to dance around or

15
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:59.421
clap or be sad or happy and make sense of it in terms of a few rather simple

16
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:03.420
patterns.

17
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.860
And musicians like to have forms because oftentimes it sort of tells them what

18
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:10.700
they ought to do next.
And we're here,
I'm here.
But what,

19
00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:13.170
what ought to happen next?
Well,
if you've got a,
uh,

20
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.040
a tried and true musical form that other musicians have used over the years,

21
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.580
you might be inclined to use it too because you're no,
you know,

22
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:25.470
your listener will be able to follow you.
Now the other day I ask,
uh,

23
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.340
early on in the course about the form in popular music,

24
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:32.130
and I threw this out not really knowing what the answer would be.

25
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.170
What's the most common form that one encounters when dealing with pop songs?

26
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.940
And for the most part,
there was silence across the room,
but one student,
uh,

27
00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:43.920
of I've tracked him down,
uh,

28
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.980
Fredrick Evans gave a very good answer of really have a better answer than I

29
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:50.424
could have given.

30
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.580
So clearly Frederick knew something about this idea of what he,

31
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.890
I think referred to as verse and chorus structure.

32
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.130
I might call it strokey and refrain,

33
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.960
but it's the same thing whether you have it in the lead of Franz Schubert or in

34
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.120
a piece that I know nothing about.

35
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.030
And Frederick is going to show us,

36
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.640
introduce us to a piece that I know nothing about.

37
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.510
I sent him an email last night saying,
Frederick,
you gave a really good answer.

38
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:21.210
Why don't you pick a piece,
come up and demonstrate this.

39
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.160
So this is Frederick Evans.
We're going to,
excuse me.
Yeah,
Fredric [inaudible].

40
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:28.920
He's going to come up here.
I'm told we have to give him a microphone.
And he is,

41
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.260
he is going to uh,
introduces to this particular p piece.

42
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.870
Now you probably all know what this piece is.

43
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:39.210
How many of you have heard the piece?
We were just listening to?

44
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.300
Everybody knows it.
Who's the one person in the room?

45
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.550
It's never heard this piece before.
It has no clue what's happening.
Wa Okay,

46
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.730
so Frederick,
tell me about this piece please.

47
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.700
Really like the archetype

48
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.650
<v 1>of a lot of popular sons.
It's half of the half of the course are so inspiring.</v>

49
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.260
So then there's first chorus,
first chorus,
and then when I call the bridge,

50
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.430
which is like an emotional climax.

51
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:16.720
And then the last one is a really powerful course where they just bring it home.

52
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.650
<v 0>Okay.
So it's this idea of changing tax than coming back to familiar texts and</v>

53
00:03:22.651 --> 00:03:24.100
familiar music and changing,

54
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:28.660
going back to the unf familiar new tax and then coming back to the familiar in

55
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:33.220
terms of the chorus.
Is that a fair shake?
Yes sir.
Okay.
Uh,
so,
uh,

56
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.980
shall we play,
what are we going to hear first?

57
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.300
<v 1>I,
so first you'll hear from seconds 24 to 40.</v>

58
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.930
This is an example of the verse where they have the beginning of the plan and

59
00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:46.350
then you have the chorus and second slower than about 56.

60
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.660
And that's where you're getting a repeating idea,

61
00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:51.810
which is like what the piece is based on.
And then last but not least,

62
00:03:51.811 --> 00:03:56.250
you have the emotional buildup where the background and the chord progression

63
00:03:56.251 --> 00:03:57.810
changes a little more solidly.

64
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.240
And then there's the last quarter just brings it home.

65
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.410
<v 0>Okay,
great.
Let's listen to the,
yeah,</v>

66
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.630
<v 2>probably gone
notice.</v>

67
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.660
Hey Baby.

68
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.200
<v 0>Okay.
That was good.</v>

69
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.150
<v 1>Yeah.
So that was the first,
first.</v>

70
00:04:24.151 --> 00:04:27.350
And that's where they really get you into what you're talking about.

71
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.133
<v 3>Okay.</v>

72
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.840
<v 0>What really interests me is what they're using is a baroque ostinato lament</v>

73
00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:01.880
based,
but that's okay.
That's we'll get,

74
00:05:01.881 --> 00:05:05.600
we'll get onto that in another week or so.
So that's okay.

75
00:05:05.601 --> 00:05:06.920
Now we're go to the bridge Frederick.

76
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.740
<v 1>Yes.
[inaudible] is where they really,</v>

77
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.410
some of the body emotions and they really just want to tell you what they're

78
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.244
building towards

79
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.233
<v 2>game.</v>

80
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.680
<v 3>We're back court.</v>

81
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.620
<v 0>Okay,
that's wonderful.
Thank you Fredrik.
That's exactly what I wanted.</v>

82
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.883
<v 3>Okay.</v>

83
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.390
<v 0>How many want Craig to continue teaching this course and how many want
Frederick,</v>

84
00:05:44.391 --> 00:05:49.050
let's hear it for Craig.
Let's hear it for Fredric [inaudible].

85
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:51.403
Okay.

86
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.750
But that's a good way of getting introduced to the idea of musical form.
Uh,

87
00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.210
let's about form.
Now in classical music,

88
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.960
the forms are a little more difficult in classical music because the music is

89
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:06.380
more complex.
And before we launch into a discussion of,

90
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:08.840
of these musical forms,

91
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.020
I want to talk about the distinction between genre in music and form in music.

92
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:17.870
So we're going to go over to the board over here and you can see that I've

93
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:22.640
listed the standard classical genres.
What do we mean by genre in music?

94
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:24.860
Wealth simply musical type.

95
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.550
So we've got this type called a symphony in this type of music called a string

96
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:31.280
quartet and concerto.
So on.
We could add other types,

97
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:35.570
ballet opera things such as that.
In the pop realm we've got genres too.

98
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.310
We've got a,
uh,
classical new Orleans jazz would be a genre blues with G,

99
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.540
B,
uh,
uh,
a genre of grunge rock would be another sort of genre.

100
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.710
It's a genre,

101
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:50.240
presupposes a particular performing force,

102
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.450
a particular links of pieces and even dress and mode of behavior of the

103
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.630
auditors.
The listeners,
uh,
if we are going to listen to the genre of a symphony,

104
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.030
we would dress up one particular way,

105
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.680
go to Woolsey Hall and expect to be there from eight o'clock till 10 o'clock.

106
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.220
Uh,

107
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.810
if you were going to hear the rolling stones play at toads where they do play,

108
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.750
uh,
uh,
occasionally,
uh,

109
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.840
obviously one would not come at eight o'clock when we'd come later,

110
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.740
one would dress in a particular sort of way and one would behave presumably,
um,

111
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.670
in a,
in a different sort of way.
So that's what we mean by genre,

112
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.440
kind of tight general type of music.

113
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.370
Now today we'll start to talk about form in music.

114
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.400
And what I need to say here is that each of these genres is made up of a,

115
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.740
of movements and each of the movements is informed by a particular form.

116
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.790
So with the symphony we have four movements.
They're fast,

117
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:54.650
slow than either minuet or a sketch show and a final fast movement.

118
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.860
And each of these movements can be in one of a number of different forms and

119
00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:03.320
we'll talk about what they are and just,
just a moment.
So,
uh,

120
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.890
when we come to the string quartet,
same sort of thing,
fast,
slow minuet,

121
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.120
sketchup fast.

122
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:12.080
Any one of those can be in a particular form concerto generally,

123
00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:16.910
as mentioned before,
has just three movements and Sanada a piano sonata,

124
00:08:16.911 --> 00:08:21.770
something played on a piano or a Violin Sonata with violin and piano

125
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:24.890
accompaniment,
they generally have just three movements.
Fast,

126
00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:29.630
slow fash okay,
let's talk about our forms.
Now.

127
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.910
In classical music,

128
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.650
things go by very quickly and it's difficult to kind of get a handle on it.

129
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.280
And we generally in life don't like to be lost.

130
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.870
We'd like to know where we are,

131
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.900
we like to know what is happening and this is what form allows us to do so that

132
00:08:47.811 --> 00:08:50.870
if we're hearing a piece of music and all this stuff is coming at us,

133
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.530
we want to make sense of it.
By knowing approximately where we are,

134
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.810
it's still towards the beginning.
Am I in the middle of this thing?

135
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.410
Am I getting anywhere near the end of it?
How should I,

136
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.500
how should I respond at this particular point?
Well,

137
00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:09.210
if we have in mind what I've identified here and we will be referring to as our

138
00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:11.220
six formal types,

139
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:16.790
and we can think of these as templates that when we're hearing a piece of music,

140
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:22.731
we make an educated decision about which formal type is in play and then we drop

141
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:28.851
down the model of this formal type or the template of this formal type.

142
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:34.610
And we sort of filter our listening experience through this template or through

143
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.420
this model.
So here are our six models,

144
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.900
ternary form,
Sonata,
allegro form,

145
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.200
theme and variations,
Rondo,

146
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.390
fugue and Ostinato.

147
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.540
And they developed at various times in the history of music theme and variations

148
00:09:54.211 --> 00:09:55.021
is very old.

149
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:59.340
Sonata Allegro is a lot more recent now of these,

150
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:04.341
the ones that we'll be working with day are ternary form and Sonata Allegro form

151
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.970
a and Sonata Allegro is the hardest,
the most complex,

152
00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:10.890
the most difficult of all of these forms.

153
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:16.340
It's so called because it usually shows up in the first movement of a Sonata

154
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.800
Concerto string,
Quartet symphony.
So,
and the first moments are fast.

155
00:10:22.801 --> 00:10:27.150
So that's why we have a lay grow out there and it,
most is,

156
00:10:27.151 --> 00:10:31.110
most is associated with this idea of the Sonata.
Um,

157
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.150
it didn't necessarily originate,
they're originated there and in the symphony,

158
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.261
uh,

159
00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:42.261
but for historical reasons we call this Sonata because of its association with

160
00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:46.890
the Sonata.
And the fast that it goes in the fact that it goes fast.

161
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.670
Sonata Allegro form,
so that in a symphony,

162
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:55.730
usually your very first movement will be in Sonata Allegro form your slow

163
00:10:55.741 --> 00:11:00.090
movement.
Well that could be in theme and variations.
It could be in Rondo,

164
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.720
could be internal reform,
your minuet and scared.

165
00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:06.390
So it was almost always internal reform.

166
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.800
And your last fast movement could be in Sonata Allegro form.

167
00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:15.540
You could also be in theme and variations could be in Rondo,
could be infused.

168
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.090
Sometimes it's even in Austin auto form.

169
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.960
So you can see that these forms can show up,
uh,

170
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.270
and sort of control,

171
00:11:24.271 --> 00:11:28.860
regulate what happens inside of each of these movements.

172
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:34.110
Okay.
Are there questions about that?
Does that seem straightforward enough?

173
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.200
We have big,
big picture of jewelry here,

174
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:42.350
movements within genre and then forms informing each of the movements.

175
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:43.523
Yes.

176
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.960
No,
uh,
uh,
um,
uh,
I said it's possible that it is,

177
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.100
could be used for the second movement.

178
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.740
I turn reform is one of the forms that could be used with the SEC,

179
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:02.980
the slow second movement.
Uh,
we could also have theme and variations.

180
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:06.050
We're going to hear one of those later in our course.
Uh,

181
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.800
it could also be a sort of slow Rondo,
um,

182
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.870
is so it's just one of,
of really three possibilities there.

183
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.200
But thanks for that question.
Anything else?

184
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:20.560
Okay.
If not,

185
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:25.561
let's talk then about ternary form because ternary form has much in common with

186
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:31.120
what we experience in Sonata Allegro form.

187
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:35.810
Let me take a very straight forward example of Turner reform.
Uh,

188
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.300
it's from Beethoven's for Elise,
that piece,

189
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:41.290
that piano piece,

190
00:12:41.291 --> 00:12:46.180
the Beethoven wrote for one of his para Moore's at one time or another.

191
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.170
Whoops,
I knew this would happen.

192
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.760
I'm going to tell you a story about this.
My cell phone broke the other day,

193
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.600
go away.
My cell phone broke the other day,

194
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.940
so I had to buy a new one that was really happy about that.

195
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:06.780
I hate that he did to lose my old Mozart,
a theme.
But,
um,

196
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.600
I then had to find a new Mozart theme.

197
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.680
And nowadays my selections are more limited.

198
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:19.240
So when you go on to these things,
and in truth,

199
00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:22.720
I actually had my youngest son do this because I'm hopelessly in competent with

200
00:13:22.721 --> 00:13:27.460
this kind of thing.
You go onto these things and now they only have one option,

201
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.010
one option for classical music,
one option for it,

202
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:35.920
but it's called Mozart.
So good choice.

203
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.170
Mozart has become the icon of classical music.
And I think it it,

204
00:13:40.171 --> 00:13:44.140
it's the individual that should be the icon for classical music.

205
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:48.850
All classical music now has been reduced down to just Mozart.
Okay.

206
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.680
I had no idea what that was about,
but uhW,
who's calling?
All right.
Um,

207
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:55.900
so we have this piece,

208
00:13:55.910 --> 00:14:00.010
internal reform by Beethoven and turn reform is conveys to,

209
00:14:00.011 --> 00:14:04.090
is simply the idea of presentation,
diversion,

210
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.340
re presentation or statement,
digression,
restatement,

211
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.840
anything like this.

212
00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.710
We like to diagram these in terms of alphabetical letters.

213
00:14:14.711 --> 00:14:16.180
You can think of just a be a,

214
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.123
<v 4>Oh,</v>

215
00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.730
<v 0>all right.
I'm going to pause here.
We started out right</v>

216
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.593
<v 4>here.</v>

217
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:43.450
<v 0>We are in this key major or minor.
What do you think,
Mike?
All right,</v>

218
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.990
so we were coming to the end of this a section here.

219
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:47.320
The age section is very short.
Okay.

220
00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.293
But then

221
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:05.370
we made your minor major.
Wow.
So what happened there?
What do we call this?

222
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:11.430
It's a very quick modulation.
Very quick modulation.

223
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:16.230
We've changed keys and I'm going to digress here just for a moment to talk about

224
00:15:16.231 --> 00:15:20.550
this,
which is this concept of relative major and minor.

225
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:24.900
You may have noticed in music,
and it's discussed briefly in the textbook,

226
00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.410
that there are payers of keys,

227
00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.540
pairs of keys that have something in common.

228
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.800
The members of the payers have the same key signature.

229
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:39.210
We could take any key signature,
three flats or or two sharps,
whatever.

230
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:44.270
But there's going to be one major key with three flats and one minor key with

231
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.070
three flats.
Uh,

232
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.010
and I think we have up on the board here an example of just that.

233
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.400
So you can see written in here the three flats,

234
00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:57.210
and this is a minor scale with three flats.

235
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.490
Now we could also have three flats over here,

236
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.210
but we encounter three flats when we'd have the major scale.

237
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.660
This happens to work out so that it's pitched on.

238
00:16:06.661 --> 00:16:10.110
See if we come up three half steps in the keyboard,

239
00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:14.190
we come up to e flat.
So the relative major,

240
00:16:14.191 --> 00:16:18.270
the major key,
and this pair is always three half steps.

241
00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.200
One,
two,
three,
three,

242
00:16:22.201 --> 00:16:26.070
half steps up above,
it's paired minor.

243
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.850
Here's another one down at the bottom.
Happens to have one sharp in it.

244
00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.120
We have the key of g major here with one sharp,

245
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:38.150
but if we come down three half steps we get it's relative minor down here.

246
00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:44.160
And the reason I mentioned this is not because we actually hear this very much,

247
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.720
I'm not sure that I hear modulations to relative major because I don't have

248
00:16:48.721 --> 00:16:52.520
absolute pitch and I'm not tracking keys.
When I listened to pieces,

249
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.060
my guess is you're not either.

250
00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:59.330
So for the average listener we may not hear that the actual pitch relationship,

251
00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:03.390
but we may hear that we've had a modulation and you can kind of make an educated

252
00:17:03.391 --> 00:17:07.500
guess that about 50% of the time if it's going minor to major,

253
00:17:07.501 --> 00:17:10.770
it's coming in this relative arrangement or major down to minor.

254
00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:14.640
It's going in this relative arrangement.
So this happens,
this happens a lot.

255
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.880
So here we are in the mid section of our ternary form a be a here's the a B

256
00:17:21.961 --> 00:17:22.794
party

257
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.310
and then back to the minor.
Hmm.

258
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.880
Well that's just the opening section of this piece.

259
00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:45.470
It goes on to do other things,

260
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:50.620
but it is a very succinct example of Turner for and turn reform is a useful way

261
00:17:55.201 --> 00:18:00.201
of introducing a larger concept which is Sonata Allegro form.

262
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.580
So let me flip the board here

263
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:13.530
and here we go.
On to this rather complex diagram.
As I say,

264
00:18:13.531 --> 00:18:18.531
it's the most complex one of all the six forms that we'll be working with.

265
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.770
It consists of three essential parts,

266
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.710
exposition development and recapitulation.

267
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:29.460
So you could think of your coming out of ternary form.
You've got an a here,

268
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:33.960
you've got to be idea here and then you've got an a return back here.

269
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.800
But this is a lot more complicated.
The things,
lots of things going on.

270
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:43.040
And I should say also in terms of fairness in advertising that this is a model.

271
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.030
This is also something of an abstraction or an ideal,

272
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:53.210
not every piece written in Sonata Allegro form conforms to this diagram in all

273
00:18:54.451 --> 00:18:57.360
particulars.
You know,
composers wouldn't want to do that.

274
00:18:57.361 --> 00:19:02.070
They'd have to assert their independence or originality in one way or another.

275
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.370
But it's a useful sort of model.
It tells us what the norm is,

276
00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:07.260
what we can generally expect.

277
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.880
So we've got these three sort of CNA quad known here,

278
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.160
and then we've got two optional,
uh,

279
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:18.090
parts of this that we'll talk about as we proceed.

280
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:22.350
So this is the layout then for Sonata,
Allegro form,

281
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.100
exposition development,
recapitulation.

282
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:31.080
So we start out with the first theme in the tonic key.
Of course,

283
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:31.770
uh,

284
00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:36.450
it might even have subsets to it so that we can have one a and one B and one c

285
00:19:36.451 --> 00:19:38.550
up here.
I won't put them up there,
but it can happen.

286
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:44.120
Then we have a transition in which we have a change of key moving to the

287
00:19:45.421 --> 00:19:49.720
dominant key transitions tend to be rather unsettled.

288
00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.100
It gives you the sense of moving somewhere,
going somewhere.

289
00:19:53.101 --> 00:19:55.220
That's why it's called a transition.
Uh,

290
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:59.370
it could also musicians like quickly like to call it a bridge.

291
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.510
It's sort of leading you somewhere else.
It may be it in that way.

292
00:20:03.511 --> 00:20:08.070
It is similar to the type of bridge that Frederick was talking about earlier.

293
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.140
So we have a transition or bridge.

294
00:20:10.141 --> 00:20:14.880
It takes us to the second theme in now in the dominant key.
If,
however,

295
00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.600
our symphony happened to begin in a minor key,

296
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:22.170
then the second theme,
we'd come in,

297
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.300
in the relative major.

298
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:29.490
So if we had a c minor as Beethoven does in his Fifth Symphony,

299
00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:35.460
so there we are there and c minor,
but the second theme

300
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:43.850
is in the relative major of e flat.

301
00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.680
Both have three flats in it.

302
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.800
So if you happen to start in and composers traditionally modulate not to the

303
00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:55.300
dominant but to the relative major which is up on the third degree of the scale,

304
00:20:55.301 --> 00:20:59.050
that's why there's a big three there.
So then the second theme comes in,

305
00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:04.040
it's usually contrasting,
lyrical,
sweeter.
You heard the difference there.
Um,

306
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:05.980
more song like in the Beethoven,

307
00:21:05.981 --> 00:21:10.450
not so much of that musical punch in the nose as I like to refer to it,
but,
uh,

308
00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:13.270
um,
uh,
more,
uh,
relaxed,

309
00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:17.680
sort of second theme and there's oftentimes some filler or what we might call an

310
00:21:17.681 --> 00:21:22.180
interest to see.
And we come to a closing theme that's abbreviated up here.

311
00:21:22.181 --> 00:21:27.181
Just the t closing theme of the exposition closes the exposition closing themes

312
00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:32.290
tend to be rather simple and which they rock back and forth between dominant and

313
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:37.060
tonic so that you can end on the tonic and that gives you a sense of conclusion

314
00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.180
of the exposition.
Now what happens,

315
00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:43.930
will you see these dots up on the board?
Anybody know what these dots mean?

316
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.460
I think we actually,
we talk about this.
If you read ahead in the textbook,
uh,

317
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.820
somebody tell me what the dots mean.
Um,

318
00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:57.610
Jerry.
Okay,
repeat.
Okay,
so that's what Dotson music.

319
00:21:57.611 --> 00:21:59.860
We have these double bars and dots.
That means repeat,

320
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.900
so we got to repeat the whole exposition.
It didn't like it.

321
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:06.550
First Time we get a second pass at it in the repeat.

322
00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:10.540
Then we'd go on to the development and as the term development suggest,

323
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.520
we're going to develop the theme here.
But it is oftentimes more than that.

324
00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:18.520
It could be something other than just the development and the expansion.

325
00:22:18.521 --> 00:22:20.110
It could actually be a contraction.

326
00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:25.140
Beethoven likes to strip away things and sort of play with a particular subsets

327
00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.990
of themes or play with parts of motives.

328
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.120
Generally speaking,

329
00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:35.050
your development is characterized by tonal instability,

330
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:39.880
moves around a lot.
You can't tell what key you're in tonal in stability,

331
00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.610
and it also tends to be in terms of texture,

332
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.390
the most polyphonic of any section in the piece.

333
00:22:46.391 --> 00:22:50.590
There's a lot of counterpoint usually to be found in the development section.

334
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.050
Then towards the end of the development section,

335
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:58.230
we want to get back here to the return and we want to get back to our first

336
00:22:58.601 --> 00:23:01.120
theme and our tonic key.

337
00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:06.370
So composers oftentimes will sit on one chord.

338
00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.940
What they will sit on will happen to be the dominant,

339
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.890
so I could put that up here.

340
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:17.830
We could put a five up here because we want a long period of dominant

341
00:23:17.831 --> 00:23:18.700
preparation.

342
00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.550
<v 7>Bob [inaudible]</v>

343
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.750
<v 0>bom is where we're going back over here,</v>

344
00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.590
but we're going to set this up with preparation in terms of the dominant that

345
00:23:28.591 --> 00:23:31.190
wants to push us into the tunnel.

346
00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:36.060
So there we are back in the tonic now and all the first themes come back as they

347
00:23:36.061 --> 00:23:38.580
did before.
We also have a bridge,

348
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:43.320
but this time it does not modulate.
It stays in the tonic key.

349
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:46.790
We don't want it to modulate because we've got to finish in the tonic here.

350
00:23:46.791 --> 00:23:50.990
So I was thinking just a moment ago,
it's kind of the bridge to nowhere.

351
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:55.190
It really is a bridge to nowhere.
You stay right back where you are.

352
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:58.670
You stay in that tonic key and the second theme material comes in,

353
00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:03.260
you're closing theme comes in and you could end the composition here.

354
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:06.560
Sometimes Mozart,
as we will see in our course,

355
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:10.030
we'll end a piece right at this point.
Uh,

356
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:15.230
the end right there.
Uh,
but more often than not,
composers,

357
00:24:15.231 --> 00:24:19.930
we'll throw on a coat off.
What's a coated do?
Well,
it really,
uh,

358
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:24.110
says to the listener that hey,
the pieces sort of at an end here,

359
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:28.470
code is generally are very static harmonically.

360
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.030
There's not a lot of movement.
It's an eye I keep,

361
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.400
maybe I should have got to come up with a different metaphor here.

362
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.270
The idea of throwing an anchor over,
slowing the whole thing down,

363
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.940
simplifying it to say we're at the end.
So you get a lot of the

364
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:46.940
<v 2>bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
bom,</v>

365
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:47.710
bom,
bom

366
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.740
<v 0>kind of things in a Coda just to,
to tell the listener,</v>

367
00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:54.640
it's time to think about clapping.
At this point we're reaching for your coat.

368
00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:59.750
And the other optional Coda,
what's,
I'd come from,
uh,
the Latin,
uh,

369
00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:04.690
Kauders cow.
Dot.
Aghast Cada Italian Coda,
um,

370
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.140
means tail.
And these can be like all tails,
longs or shorts.

371
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:12.940
Mozart happened to like short code is a Beethoven liked Wonger COTAs.

372
00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:17.890
And the other optional component here is the introduction.
My guess is Jacob,

373
00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:21.670
what would you guess how many,
what portion of classical symphonies,

374
00:25:21.671 --> 00:25:22.900
you're an orchestral player,

375
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:26.710
but portion of classical symphonies would begin with an introduction.

376
00:25:26.711 --> 00:25:27.544
Would you say

377
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:31.143
<v 2>most of them?</v>

378
00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.630
<v 0>Well,
we'll,
we'll,
we'll,
we'll consider that.
Let's,
let's go for 50% at the,</v>

379
00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:41.700
at the moment we'll consider a a 50% at the moment.
Um,
so we'll see.

380
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.640
We'll sit,
now let's jump into

381
00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:49.590
a classical composition.

382
00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:52.890
The begins with a movement and snot allegro form.
We're going to close.

383
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.260
We're going to open here with Mozart's,

384
00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.110
I declined to knock music a little night music.

385
00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:01.620
This is sort of serenade stuff that he wrote,
uh,

386
00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:06.510
for um,
for uh,

387
00:26:06.511 --> 00:26:10.320
Vienna sort of night music,
evening music.

388
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.710
Let's listen to a little of it.
Um,
Linda,
just start out here.

389
00:26:13.711 --> 00:26:16.650
We're going to start with the first theme idea and before she does,

390
00:26:16.651 --> 00:26:17.484
let me play this.

391
00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:23.400
What about that conjunct or disjunct melody

392
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:28.770
this junk.
Yeah,
there's a lot of jumping around here kind of thing.

393
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:33.760
Notice it's mostly
just a major triad with underneath.

394
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.730
So if we were at a concert and we wanted to remember this,

395
00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.850
we'd probably having a lot of skippy x's here.

396
00:26:39.851 --> 00:26:42.010
We don't have time to get into the particulars of this,

397
00:26:42.011 --> 00:26:44.670
but that's why we're doing of this diagramming stuff.

398
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.700
If you've got a lot of these skippy excess.
Um,
all right,

399
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:51.050
so let's listen to the first name of Mozart and a kind of knock musique

400
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.220
to this.
So maybe we've got a couple little ideas in here.
A,
B and c.

401
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:23.340
<v 3>Ah,</v>

402
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.990
<v 0>agitation,
mood</v>

403
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:33.820
<v 3>knows the base</v>

404
00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:42.580
<v 0>pause.
So we had a cadence there.
Dee Tee,
tee,
tee tee.</v>

405
00:27:42.581 --> 00:27:44.130
That will be the end of the musical phrase,

406
00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:45.850
a cadence and the music actually stopped.

407
00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.970
I should like to think of this in terms of it almost a drama.

408
00:27:48.971 --> 00:27:51.000
We've got a change of scene here.
The,

409
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:54.880
there's some characters have gone off to stages now clear and other characters

410
00:27:54.881 --> 00:27:57.880
are going to come on.
So what character is going to come on?
Well,

411
00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.900
a more lyrical second theme.
I'm going to play just a bit of it for you.

412
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:10.300
What about this?
Is this a conjunct melody?

413
00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:12.560
Obviously it's descending conjunct or discharge.

414
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.850
Very conjunct.
Actually it's just running down the scale now.

415
00:28:17.851 --> 00:28:20.700
We don't have time because this music is going by so fast.

416
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:24.120
We've got her skippy opening theme going around like that.

417
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.740
We don't have time to sort of write down all those x's.
So maybe just,
yeah,

418
00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:33.720
pop pop and maybe some feta or something like that.

419
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.790
So this is our first skippy theme.

420
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.930
Our second theme has a nice sort of fall to it.
Okay.

421
00:28:39.931 --> 00:28:41.070
Here's the second thing.

422
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:45.743
<v 3>Repeat.</v>

423
00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:56.240
Yeah.

424
00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.640
<v 0>Closing theme already.</v>

425
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.430
<v 3>Okay.
Hmm.</v>

426
00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.820
<v 0>Okay.
Let's just pause it here for a sec.</v>

427
00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:20.890
What's the most noteworthy aspect of that theme?

428
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:25.470
<v 10>Pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop.
What do you think?</v>

429
00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:29.480
<v 0>Gotcha.
What would you remember about that?
How would you graph that?</v>

430
00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.233
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

431
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.320
<v 0>Okay.
Yeah,
let's start out with that.</v>

432
00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:41.710
It's really conjunct,
right?
Because nothing is just saying on one level,

433
00:29:41.711 --> 00:29:45.730
sort of the ultimate conjunct,
uh,
join to the point that it's,

434
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:50.320
it's a unison pitch,
that tee,
tee,
tee,
tee tee.
So I'd remember that.

435
00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:53.430
Just like this idea.
So our closing theme,
study that data,

436
00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.040
turn it into almost the,
the woodpecker idea.
Sorry.

437
00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:01.910
But think of that kind of data or maybe a machine got whatever's sort of sing a

438
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.700
silly analogy you want to construct to help you remember that.

439
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:07.810
Okay.

440
00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:12.220
So here we are almost at the end of the exposition.

441
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:15.580
Let's listen now to the end of exposition and then we'll stop.

442
00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:36.920
Okay.
So we're going to stop there.
Linda,
if now on this recording,

443
00:30:36.921 --> 00:30:41.390
what do you think?
Uh,
well,
uh,
I think reasons for time.

444
00:30:41.391 --> 00:30:46.391
Let's go ahead and we'll advance it up to the beginning of the development

445
00:30:46.791 --> 00:30:51.710
section.
So now we should listen to this whole complex.
Once again,

446
00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.430
we're not going to do that.
We're going to proceed here.

447
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:58.070
We're going to go into the development section and it's kind of fun the way

448
00:30:58.071 --> 00:31:01.250
Mozart starts to develop development section here.

449
00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:02.283
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

450
00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:06.090
<v 0>Let me ask you this.
We started here.</v>

451
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.910
The development begins higher or lower.

452
00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:19.370
Yeah.
Lower.
So he's dropped down to the dominant.

453
00:31:19.371 --> 00:31:20.204
He's known the dominant.

454
00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:25.610
And if he continued,
he as he had,
yeah,

455
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.260
that's what he would've done.
That's not what he does.

456
00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:37.343
<v 6>Okay.</v>

457
00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.113
<v 0>He's sitting</v>

458
00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:50.020
ends up there.
So we get this sort of dissonance shift and it's a signal.

459
00:31:50.021 --> 00:31:54.010
It's like the composure holding up a site development time for the development

460
00:31:54.011 --> 00:31:56.950
now.
Okay.
So something we've shifted,

461
00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:01.960
we were sort of slapping the face telling us we're at a new point in our form,

462
00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.730
a new section in our form,
the development section.
So as we listened to this,

463
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:10.060
we'll hear Mozart move quickly through some,
uh,
lots of different keys.

464
00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.830
I wouldn't be able to tell you what keys they are.
I really wouldn't.
Uh,

465
00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:17.020
but I do know that he moves through different keys.
Uh,

466
00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.270
then we will hear a retransmission start.

467
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.750
But here's my challenge to you and why I started putting all these things up

468
00:32:22.751 --> 00:32:26.770
here.
Which theme does he choose to develop here?
Kind of interesting.

469
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:31.840
Does he go with the first team?
Bomb,
bomb,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,

470
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:36.730
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop up.
So which one?

471
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.153
<v 3>Okay,</v>

472
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.080
<v 0>stop it right there.
Oh,
here's all the way.
Oh,
first of all,</v>

473
00:33:12.081 --> 00:33:14.660
what's the answer to the question?
Which theme did he use here?

474
00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.560
We're now at the retransmission or almost finished the short development.

475
00:33:18.561 --> 00:33:23.330
Which one did he use?
Who?
Who thinks they know?
Raise your hand.
Uh,
Elizabeth,

476
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:28.510
the closing Jews.
Just the closing thing.
But Dee Dee,
Dee Dee,
Dee Dee,
bup,
bup,
bup,

477
00:33:28.511 --> 00:33:32.750
bup,
bup,
bup.
So nothing but the closing team in the short development section.

478
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.220
Now we are at the retransmission and you're going to hear the violins come down.

479
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:40.280
You,
I thought thought,
but if I could sing a harmony,

480
00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:42.240
maybe we should all sing it together.
We'll be seeing

481
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:45.890
implied baseline.

482
00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:47.163
<v 6>Bob,</v>

483
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:51.970
<v 0>can I go bomb back to the tonic and when to go bomb.</v>

484
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:56.000
Then that first theme is going to come back in here.
So let's listen to Mozart,

485
00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:58.660
right?
A retransmission and I'm going to seeing the,

486
00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:03.590
the implied or been sounded dominant.
That's going to lead to the tonic.

487
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:09.230
<v 3>Ah,</v>

488
00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:26.410
all the first thing,

489
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:27.920
<v 0>material coming back,
nothing</v>

490
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:28.783
<v 3>they knew.</v>

491
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:42.220
<v 0>Here it goes.
Our Bridge now movement</v>

492
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.340
and he just cut it short is the first time he went to bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,

493
00:34:58.341 --> 00:35:01.760
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,

494
00:35:01.761 --> 00:35:01.971
bump.

495
00:35:01.971 --> 00:35:06.080
Bump is what the base yet this time he just stops the thing and stays in the

496
00:35:06.081 --> 00:35:10.110
tonic key and then the rest of the material we'll come back in,
uh,

497
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:13.760
in the proper order in the tonic key.
All right,
we need not hear that.

498
00:35:13.761 --> 00:35:18.050
Let's go on now to the Coda and we're just going to listen generally to what

499
00:35:18.051 --> 00:35:21.110
happens in a Coda here.
Typical Coda with Mozart

500
00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.453
<v 3>tonic.</v>

501
00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.520
<v 0>It's almost a stereotypical,
right?</v>

502
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:54.773
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

503
00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:59.940
<v 0>You could have written that.
I could even,
I could have written that not so hard,</v>

504
00:35:59.941 --> 00:36:00.774
but as I say,

505
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.490
it's just a load of bricks to bring this thing to a conclusion.

506
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:09.000
But it's a beautiful example of Sonata Allegro form.

507
00:36:09.001 --> 00:36:13.490
It doesn't what our model requires in all particulars in a PR,

508
00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:17.460
in an unusually a rapid rate here,

509
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:22.020
about six minutes for this particular movement.
Let's go on to a rather,

510
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:25.920
another famous example of Sonata Lake Reform and that's the beginning of your

511
00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:29.430
own Beethoven's Fifth Symphony symphony number five.

512
00:36:29.431 --> 00:36:32.730
We of course worked with this before,
uh,
and you know the beginning,

513
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:37.170
but let's listen to a bit of this and we're going to follow it through now a all

514
00:36:37.171 --> 00:36:37.931
the way to the,

515
00:36:37.931 --> 00:36:41.940
into the exposition development in terms of form and not some of the issues

516
00:36:41.941 --> 00:36:44.130
we're working with before.
But in terms of form,

517
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:51.543
<v 3>no introduction</v>

518
00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.880
<v 0>can just start you off with his first motive.
There are four note motive,</v>

519
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:10.760
<v 3>okay?</v>

520
00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.370
<v 0>And now the bridge is going to start.</v>

521
00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:18.770
You get a sense of moving from point a to point B or from first theme,

522
00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:19.753
two seconds.

523
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:37.960
<v 3>Okay.</v>

524
00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.390
<v 0>Okay.
So I'll pause it there.
And the horn sort or</v>

525
00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:48.160
something like that,
you know,
this is the end of that.
And then a new uh,

526
00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.360
lyrical theme.

527
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.433
<v 5>Oh Man,</v>

528
00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.070
<v 0>what interests always interested me here.
Sort of like the jaws movie.
You know,</v>

529
00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:00.930
you never know when it's safe to go back in the water.
Uh,

530
00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.970
you've got this nice melody up dog,

531
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:09.590
but underneath you or did you do,
do sort of lurking under.

532
00:38:09.591 --> 00:38:14.480
There is this
pernicious for note,

533
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.760
for note motive.
All right,

534
00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:20.240
so let's listen to the second theme as it starts in the violins and then we'll

535
00:38:20.241 --> 00:38:21.710
build up with Beethoven here,

536
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:41.220
<v 3>building up dynamics and kitsch.</v>

537
00:38:56.230 --> 00:39:00.100
Little bit of interest to see here our closing theme

538
00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.140
<v 0>and let's stop it right there.
A couple of points.
No,
to get,</v>

539
00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:15.230
sort of breathe the air of this particular performance.
Ah,
okay.

540
00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.790
It's because we're going to change to a different recording now.
Um,
so Linda,

541
00:39:19.791 --> 00:39:21.950
you go ahead and change to that and while you're changing,

542
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.880
let me comment on the closing theme.
Notice how in the symphony,

543
00:39:25.881 --> 00:39:29.270
Beethoven once again is obsessed with this four note motive.

544
00:39:29.271 --> 00:39:33.410
We heard it underneath
and at the end,

545
00:39:33.411 --> 00:39:35.170
how does he create a closing thing?

546
00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:47.003
<v 3>Well,</v>

547
00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:54.740
<v 0>just coming down and our page,
you'll just taking that,
that triad,</v>

548
00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:58.940
is this a major triad or minor triad?

549
00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.760
What is it in relationship to the opening tonality?

550
00:40:05.761 --> 00:40:10.450
It's the relative major.
Okay.
So he's got to come up to

551
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:21.290
sure.
Everything's sort of short,
short law.
All right.

552
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.440
So that's how he constructs the closing theme.

553
00:40:24.441 --> 00:40:29.030
Just a different configuration of that short,
short,
short,
long motive.

554
00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.000
Let's go back now and here a a different recording.

555
00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.370
And tell me what you think about this recording.
Uh,

556
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:39.230
how's it differ from the preceding one that we were listening to
at the,

557
00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:44.140
uh,
it's your left.
Let's start with,
uh,
the,
uh,
second,

558
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.340
the,
the,
uh,
repeat of the beginning.

559
00:40:47.341 --> 00:40:49.560
If you can get their repeat of the exposition.

560
00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.213
<v 3>Perfect.</v>

561
00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:05.910
<v 0>Okay.
Any thoughts about that?
Just a one playing.
I know it's hard.</v>

562
00:41:05.911 --> 00:41:08.910
I should sit the two up here and play this one four times in this room.

563
00:41:08.911 --> 00:41:11.360
Four Times back and forth.
What about this one though?

564
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.173
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

565
00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:17.020
<v 0>Second one.
Sounds faster.
Yeah,
it's a company.
I mean it's the same music.</v>

566
00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:18.580
They had the same score.

567
00:41:18.581 --> 00:41:23.170
One conductor thinks it should go yell at the T.
Dot.

568
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:25.420
T t.
T.

569
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:29.680
That's how Leonard Bernstein would do it.
And did do it.
Um,

570
00:41:29.681 --> 00:41:33.680
another conductor still living conducting a frequently in New York also Bernard

571
00:41:33.681 --> 00:41:38.500
high tank.
Yeah.
T t t t t t team [inaudible].

572
00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:41.000
If it gets through,
there's about 30,

573
00:41:41.001 --> 00:41:44.630
this exposition about 30 seconds faster than Leonard Bernstein did.

574
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:48.560
Just a difference in interpretation.
So let's listen now quickly,
uh,

575
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:51.170
because it does go quickly to Bernard high tanks,

576
00:41:51.171 --> 00:41:54.110
interpretation of the exposition of this first movement.

577
00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.353
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

578
00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:39.203
Okay.

579
00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:45.140
<v 0>Okay.
That's probably enough of that.
Let's go on to the development now.</v>

580
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:49.020
Development.
Well,
how's the development of this symphony stars?

581
00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:54.220
Which team is he using?
Well,
you can imagine,
oops,

582
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.880
I've got to get the right pages up here.

583
00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.720
It's four no motive.

584
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.430
Same thing.

585
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:14.000
Mozart did it lot a time lock music throws in a highly dissonant chord to

586
00:43:14.001 --> 00:43:16.870
announce that beginning of the development section.
Then rather quickly,

587
00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:27.330
he modulates through different keys.
Every time you hear the string sweep,

588
00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.360
moving to a new key and then

589
00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.730
modulating to a higher key there,

590
00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:42.200
then he begins to build up upside lost.

591
00:43:42.201 --> 00:43:46.280
My piece of paper here begins to build up in terms of

592
00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:03.220
taking it up higher and higher and higher.
And then we get,

593
00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.593
<v 3>Oh,</v>

594
00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:09.440
uh huh.

595
00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.490
<v 4>That's sort of say,
okay,</v>

596
00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:16.090
<v 0>well first of all,
um,
let's talk about this core.</v>

597
00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.170
What do you think about that in court?

598
00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:18.683
<v 4>Oh,</v>

599
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:24.620
<v 0>a full attention dissonance.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

600
00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:28.140
it's called a diminished triad.
And we've put this up here,
member,

601
00:44:28.141 --> 00:44:32.880
we've had major triads with a major third and a bottom minor third on the top.

602
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:34.650
And then we had minor triads.

603
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:39.630
But what would happen if you constructed a triad with just a minor third on the

604
00:44:39.631 --> 00:44:42.240
bottom and then another minor third,
two minor thirds?

605
00:44:42.241 --> 00:44:46.530
Will you get this sort of more dissonant Sam?
More biting sound.

606
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:51.530
So that's what Beethoven is using here.
Um,
this dissonance.

607
00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:52.380
Try it.

608
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:57.300
There's another thing that's quite interesting and that is that this idea of

609
00:44:57.301 --> 00:45:01.920
just pounding away on one particular,
particular core.

610
00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:02.754
This sounds,

611
00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:04.860
<v 3>uh,</v>

612
00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:11.120
<v 0>that sort of thing.
Beethoven started doing this.</v>

613
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.530
You ever have your CD player gets,
yeah.

614
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:13.793
<v 3>MMM.</v>

615
00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:19.700
<v 0>You crazy.
Right?
Uh,
why is he doing this?
And thank you.</v>

616
00:45:19.701 --> 00:45:23.900
Think about how the audience of that time would have perceived this.
You know,

617
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:24.140
the,

618
00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:29.070
what did the Germans have of 1808 sink lymphic lymphic hostels are here.

619
00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:33.800
This isn't,
my nickname was sick since he fuck click,
here's the music.

620
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:45.300
So this is a,
this kind of thing.

621
00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:50.460
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

622
00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:53.390
<v 0>it's almost like the kinds of things he used to use,
you know,</v>

623
00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:57.500
sign old silent movies and then they tied her up,
lit the fuse,

624
00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:02.230
building a pension.
If you take this diminished triad to keep placing it,

625
00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.880
it's successively higher degrees of scale,
the scale,

626
00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:08.420
you'll get this extreme of tension.

627
00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.450
And what she'd done in terms of of note values here,

628
00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.940
well we have this

629
00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:15.270
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

630
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:18.750
<v 0>it's almost as if he stripped it down to just one note,</v>

631
00:46:18.751 --> 00:46:23.310
sort of reduced it to its most elemental.
And I says,
well,

632
00:46:23.311 --> 00:46:26.730
I could give you metaphors about taking matter and reduced them down to some

633
00:46:26.731 --> 00:46:31.440
sort of their dentist potential and atomic explosions.
And things like that.
Yeah.

634
00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:35.400
It's kind of what he's done here.
He's,

635
00:46:35.401 --> 00:46:38.940
it hasn't expanded in the development section.
He's contractive.

636
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.430
He's contracted sort of to maximize the rhythmic energy,

637
00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.690
almost electrical energy,
uh,

638
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:49.320
inherit in this particular particular concept.
Well,
all right.

639
00:46:49.321 --> 00:46:50.620
So then he backs off of this

640
00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:00.960
and then he starts playing around with just two now,

641
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:04.730
why two notes?
Well,
there's original,

642
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:12.710
just two notes in it and then he breaks it down to just one note.

643
00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.440
Once again,
a reaching for the essence here.

644
00:47:15.441 --> 00:47:18.080
Now this might not sound like OneNote,
but here's what he said.

645
00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.033
<v 3>Gotcha.</v>

646
00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:27.210
<v 0>That sounds like high,
low,
high,
low.
But if you stop and think about it,</v>

647
00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:31.900
they're just coming an octave.
So he's really just working within one note.

648
00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:36.510
<v 5>Then he changes it</v>

649
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:39.790
and then the theme,

650
00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.160
<v 3>not me,</v>

651
00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:50.440
<v 5>but the diminished chord won't let it in and just sort of keeps repeating that</v>

652
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:54.560
one note idea,
hi Lo

653
00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.020
<v 0>high,
low,
high,
low,</v>

654
00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.390
my way,
this sort of insistent moda

655
00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:07.953
down the door.

656
00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:16.460
<v 6>And then the recapitulation can begin.</v>

657
00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.910
<v 0>And so the recapitulation begins at that point.</v>

658
00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:26.970
So that's the development section of the,
um,
uh,

659
00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:29.570
of the Fifth Symphony here,
first movement,

660
00:48:29.571 --> 00:48:33.040
and the fifth symphony where it puts this electrical moment right in the smack,

661
00:48:33.041 --> 00:48:36.640
in the middle of the development section in the middle of the movement.

662
00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:41.160
And then we get to the recapitulation.
So we've heard,
uh,

663
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.960
some music of Leonard Bernstein's interpretation of this.

664
00:48:43.961 --> 00:48:48.490
We've heard Bernard high tinks interpretation of this.
Now let's go on to,

665
00:48:48.491 --> 00:48:51.610
as you go out,
you can use this as kind of exit music,
silly,

666
00:48:51.611 --> 00:48:56.260
a bit of silliness here.
The BGS interpretation of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

667
00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:02.310
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

668
00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:13.340
[inaudible].
