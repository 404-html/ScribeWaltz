1
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.870
All right.
Uh,
let's,
uh,

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.210
proceed with our discussion of musical style and this is going to be mostly a

3
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:12.720
comparison of musical style in different style periods.

4
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:17.721
And we put the titles of those style periods up on the board there.

5
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:19.650
Once again,

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.270
this is a typically western exercise that we are dealing with here.

7
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.360
We love to organize materials so that we can simplify it and we can deal with it

8
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:34.190
whether it's attributing to a single individual,
what uh,

9
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.180
a large number of people do,

10
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:41.181
whether it's grouping random units of pulses into meter or whether it's taking a

11
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:46.641
highly complex group of phenomenon and putting them in a particular style

12
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:49.760
periods.
We like to do that because it allows us to,

13
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.540
to deal with the material in some kind of organized fashion.

14
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.710
So we've got our various periods up here as mentioned that we won't be going

15
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:03.540
into,
uh,
to the postmodernist in any significant way here.

16
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.260
Now,

17
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.030
what you'll be asked to do is identify the period in which a particular piece is

18
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:14.031
written and if it turns out that on our final test we happened to play for you,

19
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:19.770
a piece that's on the list of pieces that we give you,

20
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.390
then you're responsible for identifying the name of the composer and the name of

21
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:28.380
the piece.
If it's not,
if the piece we play is not on your list,

22
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.010
then all you would be asked to do is identify the style period.

23
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.090
However you're asked to do something even more important than that,

24
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.980
and that's to tell us why it's in this particular style period.
It does.
No good.

25
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.690
I don't think,
just as a romantic and then we're going to walk away from it.

26
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.290
What I would ask you to do is give us three or four,

27
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.950
uh,

28
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.950
specific points that you hear in the music that corroborate your decision with

29
00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:58.320
regard to the style period.

30
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.680
Now you may wish to take a look at your textbook there around page 67 68 69

31
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.420
where there's an introduction to a musical style and the checklist as I call it,

32
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:10.560
a checklist of musical style by period.

33
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.940
And that'll kind of get you thinking in these in these sorts of ways.

34
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:16.470
The Baroque music for example,

35
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.560
tends to have rather long asymmetrical themes but very driving sorts of rhythm.

36
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.280
So you could,
uh,
learn that checklist for each of these periods.

37
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.550
But the important thing is that when we play the music,

38
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.450
you have got to hear in that music,
that particular,
um,

39
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.160
uh,
phenomenon or characteristic that you list on your,

40
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.340
a group of three or four,
um,
uh,

41
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.910
factors that lead you to your conclusion.
For example,

42
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
you may recognize that piece of B as being of the romantic period and say that

43
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:54.960
it has lots of low brass in it and it may not have any low brass in the music

44
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:57.420
we're playing at all.
So,
uh,
that we will,

45
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.160
that wouldn't be doing much for us there.

46
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.870
So we want to hear the music and we want to take things out of the music that

47
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:07.750
we're actually hearing.
So maybe we'll start with a piece here.

48
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:11.440
Now what we've got is a series of of six,

49
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.010
seven depends on how many you want this morning.
Uh,

50
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.850
a particular piece has chosen to exemplify these various style periods.

51
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.350
So I think let's go right to my track.

52
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.060
Uh,
let's see,

53
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.180
let's go to s CD two there and I want track 10 if I may please Linda.

54
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.420
And then Linda later on is going to talk about some of this too.

55
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:42.160
She's got a surprise piece for us.
Um,
so let's start with track.

56
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.680
Uh,
10 and let's go to a,

57
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.830
at four minutes and 30 seconds there of track 10.

58
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.280
Now what are you going to be listening for here?

59
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.740
I was thinking about that this morning.

60
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.100
What's the most important thing when trying to identify style?

61
00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:00.850
What will allow you to get to the answer quickest?
What do you think it is?

62
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.770
What are you going to be listening for?

63
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.470
<v 1>Okay,</v>

64
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.490
<v 0>let's go back to the radio in the car business or you suddenly turn on some sort</v>

65
00:04:10.491 --> 00:04:12.800
of streaming FM middle of a piece.

66
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.590
What is it that's going to give you the most information?

67
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.180
Roger Instruments,
right?
Absolutely.
Okay.

68
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.240
It's the instruments because if you hear lots of percussion and xylophones and,

69
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.750
uh,
things such as that banging away in a dissonant fashion,

70
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.460
those instruments just weren't there.
And the time,
time of Mozart for example.
So,

71
00:04:34.461 --> 00:04:38.120
you know,
it's gotta be a probably late 19th century and on.

72
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.130
So dis instruments is the single most important factor.
Uh,

73
00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:44.660
but some instruments are common to many,

74
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.800
many different periods of the piano operated roughly from when to when,

75
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.780
if you hear a piano,

76
00:04:50.781 --> 00:04:55.781
what does that tell you about the time period of the music that your classical

77
00:04:55.881 --> 00:04:59.420
music that you're listening to?
It's gotta be roughly after what?

78
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.270
After or after who,

79
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.530
when did the piano,
uh,

80
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.580
really become the principal keyboard instrument in Western culture?

81
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.160
Roughly 1770 or so.
1760 1770.
As I've said,

82
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.750
Mozart was the first two.
If you really use the piano exclusively.
So,
uh,

83
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.950
if you hear a piano,
it,
it can't be renaissance or medieval,

84
00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:30.870
it can't be borough,
it could be classical romantic,
impressionist,
modern.

85
00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:35.280
And then on the basis of other things,
you would come to a conclusion about this,

86
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.300
the style periods,
what might something else be?
Roger,

87
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.523
uh,

88
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.210
with the help of Caroline there was able to tell us that instrumentation was

89
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:48.130
very important here after instrumentation.
Uh,

90
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.270
what is it that we might be listening for?

91
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.780
I'm Marcus.

92
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.270
Okay.
Yeah.
The volume of the size of it.
That in some way.
Yeah.

93
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:05.480
So this specifically speaking,
it's not just instruments,

94
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:08.680
it could be volume as well.
And the leader,
what,

95
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.440
what's the pinnacle in terms of volume?
What would you say?
Is it,

96
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:14.300
is it all just a straight line,

97
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:19.250
a scent and to present day in terms of volume wins?
The biggest orchestra around,

98
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.240
we talked about that.
Marcus.
Okay.

99
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:29.690
Romantic.
Can you refine it any further than that?

100
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.030
Late Romantic Mahler,
Strauss,
that kind of thing.
Mahler.

101
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:38.870
Roto symphony of a thousand.
He called,
he had a thousand performer in it.

102
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.310
So it's late 19th,
early 20th century.
Uh,
and then it,

103
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.200
there's sort of an odd way kind of declines thereafter.
So volume is important.

104
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.180
Um,
just to move things along here.

105
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.810
I think the harmony is important to,
uh,
uh,

106
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.360
and you can pick out sometimes chords,
not necessarily the specific courts,

107
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:01.850
but does it kind of,
so plain vanilla,

108
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.150
vanilla a harmony or does it sound a little bit surprising or shocking?

109
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:09.900
Not Shocking,
but bracing unexpected.
Well,

110
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.100
the more unexpected it becomes probably the leader you are,

111
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:17.210
the more into the romantic period you are.
And most importantly,

112
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:21.650
I think maybe even more important than that is the element of consonance versus

113
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:26.651
dissonance when we begin to get a heavy component of dissonance in high art

114
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:31.650
music in the west
classical period,

115
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.650
romantic period,
impressionist period.

116
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.840
A little bit.
Yeah,
I see Kristen
maybe.
Okay.

117
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.320
Yeah.

118
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:48.030
So a little bit in the impressionist period and then heavy in the modernist

119
00:07:48.031 --> 00:07:51.600
period and then it kind of actually a backs down in the postmodern period,

120
00:07:51.601 --> 00:07:56.370
but we're not going to get Roger.
Good point.

121
00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:01.270
Good point.
It can be present in medieval music.
So in an odd way,
yeah.
Uh,

122
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.163
the,
the,

123
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.580
the notion of continent harmonies really didn't get formed until the 15th

124
00:08:05.581 --> 00:08:08.370
century.
So if you're listening to things before the 15th century,

125
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.710
sometimes you can find rather bracing,

126
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:15.450
inviting dissonance in medieval music and then it sort of smoothed itself out

127
00:08:15.451 --> 00:08:19.080
for 500 years.
Um,
okay,

128
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.600
so I think we have our first selection queue now.

129
00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:24.750
So let's just listen to this and these are going to be rather long as they will

130
00:08:24.751 --> 00:08:25.830
be in the test.

131
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.700
Pause it here now.
Just pause it.
Okay.

132
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:25.080
So we've heard that lunch right off the bat.

133
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.440
Something should be ruled out.
So what do we want to rule out here?

134
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.500
Douglas in the back?
Picking over cold call people today.
Yes,
Doug.

135
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.730
Uh,
what would we rule?
What would we rule out there?

136
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.770
Okay.
Classical Mozart,
Haydn,
even Beethoven,

137
00:09:45.771 --> 00:09:49.130
we would rule out classical and we're ruling out classical it.

138
00:09:49.131 --> 00:09:52.940
That sort of wipes out what basically everything else before.

139
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.650
So it can't be anything after,
uh,
excuse me,
uh,
before,

140
00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.520
uh,
well,
can't be any,

141
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.520
anything really before 1800.

142
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.050
So we'll start with romantic.
So still in the game here,
romantic,

143
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:13.640
impressionist and modernist.
Any thoughts about that?

144
00:10:13.641 --> 00:10:18.380
Romantic,
impressionist,
modern Caroline?
I don't.

145
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.410
You just tell me,
don't tell me the,
what you think the answer is.

146
00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:23.690
Just tell me what you heard there.

147
00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.240
Louder please.

148
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:35.391
Okay.

149
00:10:35.391 --> 00:10:40.070
So maybe possibly some strange sounding scales and some bells you said.

150
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

151
00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.100
<v 0>W what did you hear?
Uh,
what else did you win?
Big Orchestra,
little orchestra,</v>

152
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.600
a big garden,
huge orchestra.
Huge Orchestra and huge sound.
Okay.

153
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:56.580
So where does that put us in the,
the spectrum here?
Uh,

154
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.690
1800 to 2000.

155
00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.090
<v 1>Okay,</v>

156
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:05.090
<v 0>well we talked about that probably around around 1900 or so with an orchestra</v>

157
00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:08.610
that big a and you heard voices in it,

158
00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:13.550
which is interesting to comment on all shots.
So then you might have chuffed.

159
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.060
Well,
is this Beethoven?
Oh,
it's too big for Beethoven.
It's too,

160
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.210
there's too much of,
is too rich for Beethoven.
Is it Wagner?

161
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.710
It's probably even too rich for Wagner.
It's just a bigger,
um,

162
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.450
so we're pushing on here,
uh,
after 1850.

163
00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:35.451
Let's listen to a bit more and because the excerpts that we will have on next

164
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.361
Wednesday,
we'll be longer.

165
00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:39.630
Let's listen to a bit more and see if we can gather some more information here.

166
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.250
Okay.
Just stop right there.
What are we hearing?

167
00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:08.950
They're very important piece of information.
Yeah.

168
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:16.700
What was that?
What instrument was playing?
Oboe was playing Daniel.

169
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.270
Okay.
They had the melody.
And what about that melody?
How did it go?

170
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.150
What's that?
Yes.
Kristen's got it out there.
Nice and loud please.

171
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.440
It's an Austin auto.
So what does that tell us if we're trying,

172
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:45.470
which one of the three of these style periods does that knock out of the box?

173
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.470
Romantic,
impressionist or modern?

174
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:56.870
We talked about that in a lecture on impressionism,

175
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.250
but by the same token,

176
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:03.400
you were listening exercise 42 on Stravinsky foregrounded precisely this

177
00:13:04.521 --> 00:13:06.560
phenomenon of Austin auto.

178
00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:11.860
So there we have romantic being taken out of the mix here.

179
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.790
This idea of Stacy's is not part of the aesthetic of Romanticism.

180
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:21.440
Romantic.
If flows even grows,
it expands it contracts.

181
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.000
Uh,
but it doesn't constantly reiterate one phenomenon.

182
00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:31.400
So we were down to impressionist or modern here.
Let's go on,

183
00:13:31.401 --> 00:13:33.140
listen to just a little bit more.

184
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.313
<v 1>Okay.</v>

185
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.900
Uh,

186
00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.970
<v 0>stop it there.
So what did we hear there?</v>

187
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.970
Anything more that we could add to our list of identifiers?

188
00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.080
<v 1>Um,
Oscar,</v>

189
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.880
<v 0>good parallel motion,
Yardi,
Dee Dee,
Dee Dee,
those word wins.</v>

190
00:14:50.881 --> 00:14:55.210
We're going up and down in the same direction.
Parallel motion.
Excellent.
It,

191
00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:00.220
there's one other thing here at the very end we heard what played by a harp.

192
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:01.900
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

193
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:06.130
<v 0>Caroline,
a Glissando that kind of walk.</v>

194
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:10.420
So based on that,
obviously we are dealing with a piece of impressionist music.

195
00:15:10.421 --> 00:15:15.421
This is Ravel's Daphnis and Chloe ballet music for one of those Diaghilev

196
00:15:16.151 --> 00:15:20.110
ballets that we were talking about,
uh,
in section last time.

197
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:25.330
So what would we say here?
Well,
we would say large colorful orchestra.

198
00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.910
Actually,
there was also the use of the human voice here,

199
00:15:27.911 --> 00:15:30.340
which we heard in WC as well.

200
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:35.200
We would say also that it's essentially a consonant and not a dissident,

201
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.510
essentially a consonant environment.

202
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:42.280
We would say that we have a parallel motion as Oscar pointed out,

203
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.020
we would say that we have,
um,

204
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:50.200
possibly if you wanted to throw this in a scales that are not true,
traditional,

205
00:15:50.201 --> 00:15:54.430
although that's a little bit hard to hear,
but certainly we had the Glissando.

206
00:15:54.431 --> 00:15:57.760
So if you're looking for,
for sound bites here,

207
00:15:57.761 --> 00:16:01.150
or four bullet points to put on your paper,
large,

208
00:16:01.151 --> 00:16:03.330
colorful orchestra concert,

209
00:16:03.331 --> 00:16:08.331
that backdrop parallelism and what did we say?

210
00:16:09.011 --> 00:16:13.990
The glissando at the very end and you're finished,
you're out,
you get 100%.

211
00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.110
Okay.
So that's piece number one.

212
00:16:17.111 --> 00:16:20.920
And that's sort of the thought process that I hope you would use while working

213
00:16:20.921 --> 00:16:22.540
through this particular exercise.

214
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.800
Let's go on to a piece number two,

215
00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:31.060
um,
which I think,
yeah,
let's do my track.

216
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.930
I just track one.
Let's see what we got there.
Hope or no,
no,

217
00:16:34.931 --> 00:16:39.931
let's go to on that particular wireless play track one and see what happens.

218
00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.960
Okay.
Play track.
Uh,

219
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:52.010
I believe it's track five and we'll get holish

220
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.530
right sheet.
Phooey.
Uh,

221
00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:02.600
excuse me.
Yeah,
it's on my list here.
Yeah,
track five.

222
00:17:02.601 --> 00:17:04.070
Track five.
What about this one?

223
00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:14.050
Oh,
did we switch on to the next CD?
Okay.

224
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.010
We're going to go to the next CD now.
Uh,
for another,
another piece.
Sorry,

225
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:18.903
my fault.

226
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.580
<v 1>Oh,</v>

227
00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:31.710
<v 0>uh,
let's go to track one of [inaudible] play track by,
what was that?</v>

228
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.530
Please try it with play by what you just played.

229
00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:42.623
<v 1>Oh,</v>

230
00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:44.050
<v 0>okay.
Let's stop there.</v>

231
00:17:44.051 --> 00:17:49.051
What's a good example of what Chin Gregorian chant La

232
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.520
Chad and kept it there.
Let's go on to track one.

233
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.740
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

234
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.260
okay.

235
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.430
<v 0>That's really beautiful.</v>

236
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.340
It's weird that this beautiful setting of,

237
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:10.950
well you tell me what period it comes from.

238
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:13.603
<v 1>Okay.</v>

239
00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.450
<v 0>I'm going to move skipper,
skip around a little bit.
Let me go to,
um,</v>

240
00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:22.760
Emily please.
Behind a medieval and renaissance,

241
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:26.070
we had chant there and on the same CD we have an example of,

242
00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.360
this is actually sort of right between the two,

243
00:20:28.361 --> 00:20:30.490
which are written by Thomas Tallis in England,

244
00:20:30.491 --> 00:20:33.600
but England was sort of slow to catch up to the renaissance.
So it's,
it's,

245
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.250
it's late medieval,
early,
early renaissance.

246
00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:40.270
What specifically did we hear here that leads you to,

247
00:20:40.271 --> 00:20:44.120
that can collusion?
Um,
judge.

248
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.930
Jennifer.
Jessica?
Nope.
Sorry,
what?

249
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.520
Angela?
Sorry.
Okay.

250
00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:00.180
Okay.
We heard multiple unaccompanied voices.
Uh,

251
00:21:00.181 --> 00:21:02.640
what kind of texture was being employed there?

252
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.273
<v 1>Huh?</v>

253
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.890
<v 0>Mostly polyphonic and we said we were dealing with textures.</v>

254
00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:11.490
We had imitative and non imitative polyphonic textures.

255
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.680
Was this imitative or non imitative?

256
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.220
Everybody agree with that?
Anyone disagree with it?

257
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.120
Some people are shaking their head it was non imitative.
Oh no,
excuse me.

258
00:21:24.121 --> 00:21:27.210
It was imitative.
If I had time to play it again,

259
00:21:27.211 --> 00:21:30.900
you could hear one voice would come in GP.

260
00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.770
No Man.
Tachy oh and then somebody else would come in.

261
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:39.990
He GP low man totty and then the third voice in the fourth voyage.

262
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:44.720
But you're right to say multiple voices unaccompanied.
So you,

263
00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:49.460
you sort of get two points for that.
Uh,
and um,

264
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:54.720
uh,
what do we call that?
A unaccompanied style.
Yeah.
So,

265
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.090
but when you don't get a separate point for Acappella on the company,

266
00:21:58.091 --> 00:21:59.740
acapella style would be one,

267
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:05.130
one marker there at the idea imitative voices would be another.

268
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.670
Uh,
you might even pick up on the text,
I suppose that it's in,

269
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:13.260
in what language?
Latin.
Yeah.

270
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.540
What else there that it's not particularly rhythmic.

271
00:22:16.541 --> 00:22:18.940
No strong rhythms or meters.

272
00:22:18.941 --> 00:22:23.380
It sort of flows gently like a good Gorean Chan.

273
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:28.640
And as mentioned,
we have this texture that's uh,
uh,

274
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.630
not only polyphonic but highly imitative.

275
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.080
And those are all hallmarks of late medieval and renaissance music.

276
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.010
That particular piece was written by English composer Thomas Tallis,

277
00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.660
but more interesting in a way,

278
00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:48.661
it's a setting of the old limitations of Jeremiah out of the old testament that

279
00:22:48.731 --> 00:22:52.120
laments the fall of Jerusalem.
So it's a particularly dark,

280
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:57.040
heartfelt Texas exquisitely sat there in that renaissance vocal style.

281
00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.970
Uh,
let's go on to another one now.
The next cds,

282
00:23:00.971 --> 00:23:05.560
probably CD three and four.
This,
we do have track five,

283
00:23:05.561 --> 00:23:06.394
I believe.

284
00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:14.613
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

285
00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:21.520
[inaudible]

286
00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:57.630
<v 0>sometimes you can figure this out in about three seconds.</v>

287
00:23:57.631 --> 00:24:01.230
It doesn't take much more than,
so with just that,

288
00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:03.750
and we'll be playing a lot more than three seconds,
many minutes.

289
00:24:03.751 --> 00:24:08.190
And depending upon the particular piece,
probably more than once.
So,
um,

290
00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:11.940
what did you hear there?
And we may go back and hear just that much.

291
00:24:11.941 --> 00:24:13.140
What did you hear there?

292
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.820
Let's talk about what you heard and then we'll conclude about the period in

293
00:24:17.821 --> 00:24:22.110
question.
So someone get a starter.
Uh,
Nicole.

294
00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:23.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

295
00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:27.590
<v 0>A lot of percussion.
Okay.
The uh,
very,
uh,</v>

296
00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.090
definitely particularly the tip and Marcos,

297
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.240
lot of dissonance that was very prominent.
It started out okay.

298
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.440
It could have been a kind of John Williams star wars type sound up into the,

299
00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.560
about the third iteration of one particular figure,

300
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.590
but the level of the pitches at which it was brought in,

301
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:48.390
produced a very dissonant moment there.
So,

302
00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:53.600
well maybe John Williams and romanticism knock off kind of thing.
But uh,

303
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.850
when that dissonance in the dissident enters,

304
00:24:55.851 --> 00:24:59.450
then that takes you into a slightly different realm.
Uh,
Daniel.

305
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.033
<v 1>Okay.</v>

306
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:04.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

307
00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:09.040
A lot of brass and even if they were not percussion instruments,

308
00:25:09.041 --> 00:25:13.810
those instruments were being used in a kind of percussive in your face way.

309
00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.170
Yeah.
So those are three good things.
Roger,
you've got another one.

310
00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.350
I beg your pardon?
Yes,

311
00:25:20.351 --> 00:25:23.980
there were lots of Ostinato right at the beginning and almost forgot about that.

312
00:25:23.981 --> 00:25:27.010
I may have only been just two notes going back and forth.

313
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:31.810
So though already we've got our four,
um,
and,
and maybe that's all we need.

314
00:25:31.811 --> 00:25:34.390
Let's listen to just the big,
it's not a sh a long extra,

315
00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.760
let's listen to the beginning of this again.

316
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:47.070
<v 1>[inaudible] [inaudible] right.</v>

317
00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:49.604
They're very distant.

318
00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.320
[inaudible] [inaudible]

319
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:06.640
brass is as [inaudible]

320
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:11.420
water

321
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:15.850
<v 0>music has a kind of intensity to it,
you know,
stop.
I give up,
I surrender.</v>

322
00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:20.540
It's got that element to it.
There's an intensity to it here.
So,
uh,
that,

323
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.610
that could be even the fifth component in our,
our thinking.

324
00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:29.320
So all of this leads us to the conclusion that this is a piece of 20th century

325
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.150
music by the woman composer Ellen's village.

326
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.580
And you have Ellen's village of course,
as the basis of your listening exercise,

327
00:26:36.581 --> 00:26:41.260
45 of that you've done,
this is simply another piece called celebration.

328
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:46.590
It's a pretty so far pretty celebration by Ellen's village written in 1984.

329
00:26:46.801 --> 00:26:51.801
So it's a fairly recent piece of music in the modernist style.

330
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.430
Not postmodernists but modernist.
Um,
okay,
well I'm going to,

331
00:26:56.431 --> 00:26:59.340
I think a variety is always useful in life.
I'm willing to,

332
00:26:59.341 --> 00:27:03.060
and I asked Linda yesterday,
Linda,
you prepare a piece and,

333
00:27:03.061 --> 00:27:06.630
and but don't tell me what it is cause I want to go through the same thought

334
00:27:06.631 --> 00:27:08.400
processes that other people have.

335
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.880
So Linda has prepared a piece and I don't know whether she's going to use the

336
00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:14.850
piano or whether she's going to use the audio player.

337
00:27:14.851 --> 00:27:18.170
You want me to play it for you?
You're okay.
Okay.

338
00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:25.093
<v 1>Okay,</v>

339
00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:07.010
<v 3>nice.
What are you hearing?</v>

340
00:28:07.011 --> 00:28:08.390
Who has any thoughts?

341
00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:14.770
Regular meter.
All right.
Uh,
that's,

342
00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:19.850
that's a very good,
important point for this particular period.
What else?

343
00:28:19.851 --> 00:28:21.050
What kind of instruments?

344
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:24.660
<v 1>Oh
yeah.</v>

345
00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:30.410
<v 3>Strings in the foreground.</v>

346
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.490
So this means we have probably an orchestra.
Uh,

347
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:38.190
what,
well,
okay,
before we get there.
Okay.

348
00:28:38.191 --> 00:28:41.120
It's spring is in the foreground of this particular ensemble.

349
00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.730
Could anybody tell what the solo instrument was?
All right.

350
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:55.660
Uh,
so we've had regular meters.
String is in the foreground,
a solo instrument.

351
00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.150
MMM.

352
00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:01.950
What might you say about the relationship between the Solo Instrument and the

353
00:29:01.951 --> 00:29:06.940
bigger ensemble?
Cool.
I guess that's maybe a pretty obvious,
but

354
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.220
that's true.
They seem to be at about a similar level.
Uh,

355
00:29:19.221 --> 00:29:24.221
it doesn't seem like the ensemble is very big and we have them playing one after

356
00:29:25.191 --> 00:29:26.060
the other,

357
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:30.410
which is a characteristic of something that we learned about.

358
00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.320
Um,
rhythmically this goes with the meter.

359
00:29:35.321 --> 00:29:39.700
Was it regular or irregular?
Pretty regular.

360
00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:45.160
Um,
you could tap your foot to it.
Uh,

361
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.890
you could hear a melody.
I'll just play a couple more

362
00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.553
<v 1>second.</v>

363
00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:11.600
Okay.

364
00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:16.600
<v 3>So the solo instrument is playing something kind of simple or something kind of</v>

365
00:30:18.711 --> 00:30:20.570
virtuosic and impressive.

366
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:24.530
She'd be impressive that you hear lots of little trills.

367
00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:27.790
It's leaping all over the place.
It's showing off.
Uh,

368
00:30:27.791 --> 00:30:31.920
and this is a feature of something we learned about.
So who would like to,
uh,

369
00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:34.870
guess what period wherein

370
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.950
<v 1>Michael Close.</v>

371
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:44.080
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
I guess I can see why you might,
uh,
why,</v>

372
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.310
why don't you say romantic

373
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.160
<v 1>fairly quickly,
but they were saying,</v>

374
00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.720
<v 3>which makes you realize that you can't always tell by the size of the orchestra.</v>

375
00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:54.320
Uh,

376
00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:59.210
sometimes it's better to listen for some of the more abstract features such as

377
00:30:59.211 --> 00:31:04.100
what the orchestra is doing,
the harmonies.
How about the harmonic language?

378
00:31:04.101 --> 00:31:08.990
Was it pretty,
um,
surprising or a little more expected?

379
00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:09.351
I mean,

380
00:31:09.351 --> 00:31:12.440
this is maybe something that's going to help you zero in a little bit more.

381
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:17.300
Yeah.
Pretty expected.
Not Very,
uh,

382
00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:21.750
not very surprising harmonies for anybody else.
Have another

383
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.710
<v 1>or do you want to correct yourself though,
yet</v>

384
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:35.210
<v 3>a little bow?
Tie it out of sequence.
[inaudible] phrase.</v>

385
00:31:35.211 --> 00:31:36.830
What does that suggest to you?

386
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.820
I cadence very good.

387
00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:46.380
Which I is very strong.

388
00:31:46.381 --> 00:31:49.710
And what period classical.
Yeah.

389
00:31:49.711 --> 00:31:51.630
I mean these things do happen and other periods,

390
00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:56.820
but this is sort of a quintessential classical,
very particular genre.

391
00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:59.250
Does anybody know what genre we're in?

392
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.133
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

393
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:05.660
<v 3>Concerto exactly.
So this was the Mozart bassoon concerto.</v>

394
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.400
Who knew that Mozart wrote a bassoon concertos is one of the bassoon is the

395
00:32:09.401 --> 00:32:11.570
biggest pieces in their repertoire.

396
00:32:11.571 --> 00:32:14.020
And we thought the bassoon was sort of amusing instruments.

397
00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.960
That's why there are lots of leaps and it sounds a bit like a clown anyway,

398
00:32:17.961 --> 00:32:22.010
so that,
uh,
that's a concerto example for you,

399
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.430
which is not a piano.
Oh yeah.

400
00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:33.630
That is a great question.
I wonder if I ought to defer to professor.
Right.

401
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.520
<v 0>Well,
um,
let's,
let's work through this together.</v>

402
00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:40.520
One way we've been all over this and that is the size of the orchestra.

403
00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:43.940
And we talk when we had the lecture on 19th century orchestral music,

404
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.810
how all of these instruments come in.
So the,

405
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:50.870
the orchestra has many more and many more varied instruments in it ranging from

406
00:32:50.871 --> 00:32:55.340
top Piccolo down to middle English horn,
down to bottom,
contra based,

407
00:32:55.341 --> 00:32:57.980
bassoon tube,
it and things like that.
So it was the orchestra,

408
00:32:57.981 --> 00:33:02.981
particularly low brasses and that kind of sound that typifies the sound

409
00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:07.520
generally for orchestral music in the 19th century.
Then the,
uh,

410
00:33:07.521 --> 00:33:12.050
whereas Daniel was talking about bow tie,
they're tied together.
Uh,

411
00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:16.100
you don't do what what he was in the meeting there perhaps was that we have this

412
00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:18.470
kind of of paired phrasing or neat,

413
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.350
neat little units of phrasing that can be tied together.

414
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:26.060
That's a component of classical music.
As you go into the romantic period,

415
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:31.220
the themes,
the melodies become much more expansive.
And,

416
00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.740
uh,
someone I think said early on,
he has pretty,

417
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:37.810
maybe the first point was it's pretty regular meter in this particular piece of,

418
00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:42.320
of,
of classical music by Mozart too.
Mozart,
bassoon can share it.
Okay.

419
00:33:42.321 --> 00:33:46.190
One 93 jet.
Right?
Um,
so the,
uh,

420
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:51.280
the regularity of the themes and the balance and symmetry is part and partial of

421
00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:55.880
the classical period.
You move into the romantic,
you have expansive themes,

422
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:58.940
but by way of Contra distinction there,

423
00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:02.750
then the rhythm becomes not necessarily more flaccid but more loose.

424
00:34:02.751 --> 00:34:07.400
And we talked about this,
a phenomena of Rubato for example.
So flexible rhythms,

425
00:34:07.401 --> 00:34:12.230
flexible tempos,
less clear meters in the romantic period.

426
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:15.290
Um,
and not to overdo it,

427
00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.900
but it may be this idea of just beautiful melody and it,

428
00:34:18.901 --> 00:34:21.650
it is of course in this 19th century that we hold,

429
00:34:21.651 --> 00:34:26.490
get the whole idea of the Bel Canto sound.
If anybody read,
uh,

430
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:29.120
uh,
rothsteins uh,
no.

431
00:34:29.121 --> 00:34:33.830
Andrew Thomas Seeney's article that I pointed you to about Bel Canto.
He said,

432
00:34:33.831 --> 00:34:38.831
actually the beginning of that starts back with the composers of piano music of

433
00:34:41.961 --> 00:34:46.400
that same period.
And then the opera composers begin to go into it.

434
00:34:46.401 --> 00:34:47.234
So who wrote this?

435
00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.513
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

436
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:27.810
<v 0>Lovely it.
And a beautiful,
well,
the whole idea of beautiful melody.
Yeah.</v>

437
00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.510
Multirotor.
Lot of beautiful melodies too.
So did Bob.

438
00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.120
But somehow beautiful melody,
just warm,
rich.

439
00:35:33.121 --> 00:35:36.900
Melody is very important in romantic music.

440
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.160
So this is a good example.

441
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:40.350
<v 1>Rich</v>

442
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:44.440
<v 0>harmonies,
a broader palate.
Uh,
and um,</v>

443
00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:46.250
then the classical period.

444
00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:51.280
I could play one other piece here just to differentiate romantic piano music

445
00:35:52.401 --> 00:35:53.450
from this sound.

446
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:04.210
<v 4>Uh,</v>

447
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:11.903
<v 5>oh.</v>

448
00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.593
<v 4>Uh</v>

449
00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:46.483
<v 5>hmm.</v>

450
00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:51.030
<v 0>So that's a piece by Mozart.
You could say that the melody is just as beautiful.</v>

451
00:36:51.031 --> 00:36:52.890
That's gorgeous melody too.
That's lovely.

452
00:36:52.891 --> 00:36:56.430
You could use that as his film music just as well as you could.
The other page.

453
00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:58.090
So the first piece that I played

454
00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:00.453
<v 1>Yup.</v>

455
00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:14.290
<v 0>Is by any takers on that whole piano music of the 19th century.
Uh,</v>

456
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:18.750
anybody,
if you've peaked through the textbook,
that is good.
Yeah.

457
00:37:18.751 --> 00:37:22.710
Chopin and Frederic Chopin.
So that's a classic,
a classic,

458
00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:27.420
quintessential moment of Chopin,
quintessential moment of,
of Chopin,

459
00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:31.200
which become a classic indeed.
It became a kind of,
uh,

460
00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.620
Judy garland and used to seeing this.
I,
I'm forever chasing rainbows.

461
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:38.100
It got turned into a,
a pop song,
uh,
in,

462
00:37:38.101 --> 00:37:40.220
in the 20th century because it's such a,

463
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:45.240
a drop dead beautiful melody.
But the difference here is the,
in the pianos,

464
00:37:45.241 --> 00:37:48.480
the terms of expansion.
Here's the Chopin's sound,

465
00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:50.880
<v 1>here's</v>

466
00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.340
<v 0>and the cord sometime ago,</v>

467
00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:57.333
<v 1>interesting</v>

468
00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:02.890
<v 0>Christine harmonic shifts,
but the Mozart by comparison is very plain harmonic</v>

469
00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:03.813
<v 4>please.</v>

470
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:11.310
<v 0>And very limited in terms of the range and limited somewhat in terms of the</v>

471
00:38:11.311 --> 00:38:15.840
texture,
but kind of base is this,
you're talking about how we identify style.

472
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.010
All you'd really have to do is listen to about one second of this.

473
00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:25.220
Oh,
I know what that is.
That has to be what?
Uh,
um,

474
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:26.453
Emily,

475
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:31.260
that's an Albertie base and LBD basis used only in what period of music history.

476
00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:37.120
Classical.
Okay,
so that's it.
You hear that it's got to be in a 40 year period,

477
00:38:37.121 --> 00:38:41.560
roughly 17,
72,
18,
10 or so.
And then they,

478
00:38:41.561 --> 00:38:45.550
then they stopped using it.
How do we know that this is specifically Mozart?

479
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:49.480
This is above and beyond the Pale that if you put down Beethoven for this,

480
00:38:49.481 --> 00:38:51.700
it'd be great if you put down heightened for this,
it'd be great.

481
00:38:51.701 --> 00:38:54.550
Schubert for this would be great.
Mozart for this.
It would be great.

482
00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:56.770
How do we know it's Mozart?
There's one little moment here

483
00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:06.110
<v 7>that when he takes that line and nobody else made it fun,</v>

484
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:14.020
he loves to do that.
What did he do there?
He inserted what?

485
00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.810
What kind of scale is that?
Yeah.

486
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.940
<v 0>Emily says chromatic.</v>

487
00:39:20.941 --> 00:39:25.660
So he inserted just a little bit of of chromaticism there and that's a finger

488
00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:27.710
fingerprint of Mozart.

489
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:31.110
So we're parsing this out a little bit more fine than we need to do,

490
00:39:31.111 --> 00:39:35.550
but that's the kind of the next step on this.
Okay.
Uh,

491
00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:39.720
where are we?
Let's do one more piece.
Let's do one more piece.
Let's put,

492
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:42.240
uh,
yeah,

493
00:39:42.241 --> 00:39:46.530
let's put this one in and go to track 18.

494
00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:47.580
I believe.

495
00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:52.470
Anybody want to ask a question while we're queuing this up?
Oscar,

496
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:18.020
Beethoven wouldn't really use so much of an Ostinato as he would just sit there.

497
00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:22.600
I see your point on one chord and kind of hammer you over the head with that.
Um,

498
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:26.600
but I say that's a prayer.
That's an Ios.
It's a good point.

499
00:40:26.601 --> 00:40:30.040
It's more sophisticated in a way that we need get into in here.
Uh,

500
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:35.290
but I wouldn't say Beethoven uses Ostinato so much as iteration and admittedly

501
00:40:35.451 --> 00:40:38.210
it's a fine line between Ostinato in iteration,
but,

502
00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:42.300
but kind of sitting on something and just kind of repeating that,

503
00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:46.370
maybe that chord over and over and over again in a way that Mozart and Schubert

504
00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:51.580
being fundamentally constructors of melody wouldn't necessarily do

505
00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:58.163
<v 8>everything.</v>

506
00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.870
<v 0>Okay.
Yeah,
that's true.
That's true.
You could,</v>

507
00:41:02.871 --> 00:41:07.520
you could look upon the famous day Ttt,
him,
Papa,
Papa as an Ostinato.

508
00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.740
People don't normally do that,
but that's,
that's just fine and dandy.

509
00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.990
It may be something particular to Beethoven rather than the,

510
00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:22.460
you're a general,
but a yes,
you're,
you're,
you're right about that.

511
00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:25.730
So good for you,
Oscar.
One Craig.
Nothing at this point.

512
00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.730
Uh,
any other question?
All right,
let's go on.

513
00:41:29.731 --> 00:41:33.020
We'll hear one last piece and I'll let you go.
Although it's a fairly long one.

514
00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:42.350
18 sorry.
Yeah.
Long Way to go

515
00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.153
is that plane.

516
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:55.543
<v 1>Oh</v>

517
00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:56.923
<v 0>Huh.</v>

518
00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:00.323
<v 1>Oh phooey.</v>

519
00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.260
<v 0>Oh,
there's nothing.
We had the CD.</v>

520
00:42:08.261 --> 00:42:10.240
I just played it in my office a few minutes ago.

521
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:13.740
<v 1>Say it out loud.
This one is the city.</v>

522
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:18.730
<v 0>Yeah.
Okay.
Uh,
let me,
let me check the,
the track number here.
Yup.</v>

523
00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:23.330
Yup.
Sorry for the delay.

524
00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:30.720
Any other questions?
Is We vet?
Maybe I'll just dance up here.
Angela,
go ahead.

525
00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:42.980
Well,
you could use him as a swing player.
In other words,

526
00:42:42.981 --> 00:42:46.040
if you hear a piece that you think is Beethoven,
you put that down as classical.

527
00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:49.950
That's fine.
You put that down as romantic.
That's fine too.

528
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:54.230
So we're,
we're sort of said,
uh,
all right,

529
00:42:54.231 --> 00:42:56.000
let's just go ahead and listen to this and then we can go.

530
00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.293
<v 1>Okay.</v>

531
00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:26.020
<v 0>Stop it.
Your time is short.
Go Up to about one 35 on that a CD.</v>

532
00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:27.860
Something else is going to happen.

533
00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

534
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:58.210
<v 0>Stiff.
Stop here.</v>

535
00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:03.480
Now there should be one thing there that's a dead giveaway in terms of period.

536
00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:07.750
And what would that be,
Zack?
The harpsichord.
Okay.

537
00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:11.320
Because we've said before that really the Harpsichord doesn't get much in the

538
00:44:11.321 --> 00:44:14.470
way of legs,
in the history of music until the Baroque period,

539
00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:18.670
and then it disappears as it's replaced by the piano.
Uh,

540
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:21.280
for the most part,
um,
in the classical period.

541
00:44:21.281 --> 00:44:24.440
So Baroque period is all all uh,
oh,

542
00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.930
it can be readily identified here.
Shouldn't be by,

543
00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.390
by the presence of the Harpsichord,
a w.

544
00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:33.210
But what else did we hear in these very short excerpts?

545
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:38.430
Well,
let's go back to the beginning then and listen to the rhythm

546
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:50.240
<v 1>[inaudible] coming into court or something.</v>

547
00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:06.760
[inaudible]

548
00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.710
<v 0>regular rhythm here and in this rhythm and this,</v>

549
00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.920
this particular sale goes on and goes unchanged for about a minute and 35

550
00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:19.850
seconds or so.
Uh,
and that's another aspect of this,

551
00:45:19.851 --> 00:45:24.590
not only regular rhythm but a regular ethos in the music of the Baroque period.

552
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:29.030
Now let's listen to this last component here and uh,

553
00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.750
then we'll stop with this.
Let's go back to one 35.
One more time

554
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:34.003
<v 1>please.</v>

555
00:45:55.660 --> 00:46:00.400
<v 0>So what are we hearing here and why is this further evidence of music coming</v>

556
00:46:00.401 --> 00:46:05.290
from the Baroque period?
Mary Pat.
It's a few.
Okay.
And we studied the few of them.

557
00:46:05.291 --> 00:46:08.680
We said the few came into being in the Baroque period,

558
00:46:08.681 --> 00:46:11.440
principally under the aegis of Js Bach.

559
00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:16.680
So there we've got our four bullet points or four pieces of supporting evidence

560
00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:21.240
for the conclusion that we came to rather early on.
Is that pointed out,
uh,

561
00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:25.780
by the presence of the Harpsichord.
There any final questions before we stop?

562
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:29.470
If not,
I have a request.
You may have heard that.

563
00:46:29.471 --> 00:46:31.920
Unfortunately our good friend Richard Lawley,
uh,

564
00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:36.030
has had a serious medical issue that he is dealing with.
Um,
and he was,

565
00:46:36.031 --> 00:46:39.310
he was always such a wonderful guy and this was going to be the highlight of his

566
00:46:39.311 --> 00:46:43.330
career.
He was going to take over the mastership of Jonathan Edwards College.
Um,

567
00:46:43.331 --> 00:46:45.430
and unfortunately this happened.

568
00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:50.140
So I'd be very grateful to you and we've got a couple of get well cards out

569
00:46:50.141 --> 00:46:54.400
there and Richard is always very much interested in our Yale students.
Uh,

570
00:46:54.401 --> 00:46:56.260
and it'd be great if on the way out,

571
00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.830
you would be good enough to sign your name there,
uh,

572
00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:03.070
on those cards and we'll be sure that they get over to Richard.
Okay.

573
00:47:03.071 --> 00:47:07.030
Thanks very much.
And I'll see you
next Wednesday,

574
00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.170
six days from now.
