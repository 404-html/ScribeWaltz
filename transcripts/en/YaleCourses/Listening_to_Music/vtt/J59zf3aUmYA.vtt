1
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.810
I do want to talk about chords.
Um,

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.870
last time we worked through this idea of the scale and how you can build triads

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.490
on each of the members of the,
of the scale.

4
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.540
And we talked about a triad being a configuration of three pitches where you

5
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:21.090
take the first,
the third,
and the fifth.

6
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.910
The first of the triad,

7
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:26.970
this is a term that we'll be going over today is called the what?

8
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.740
The root of the triad.
So if we have see Eg,

9
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.640
the c is the root of the triad.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.150
The lowest note of this aggregate of three is the root of the trial.

11
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.900
So we can build triads on each of the members of the scale.

12
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:46.410
And we said that some of these cords tend to be used a lot more than others.

13
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.860
That the tonic is very important.
The dominant is important.

14
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.170
The subdominant right next to him below the dominant is important.

15
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.240
We're going to be talking about the sixth core today.
We could give that a name,

16
00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:00.630
we could call it the sub mediant,
but that's probably getting too technical.

17
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.290
We'll just call it a six chords.

18
00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:05.970
So we got a one chord billed on the first degree of the scale of five chord

19
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:08.480
build on the fifth degree of the scale of fourth cord building,

20
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.080
a four chord building,

21
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:13.920
the fourth degree and a six cord built on the sixth degree.

22
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.100
Now I had an interesting discussion in section this past week.
Uh,

23
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.860
and a couple of really good questions were asked.
I started by saying,

24
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:24.540
could you come up with any kind of,

25
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.690
well you tell me in 50 words or less what I said in lecture yesterday about

26
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:32.430
harmony.
How does harmony work?

27
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.270
Can you come up with a visual image of how harmony works?

28
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.830
So we tried out a couple of things.

29
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.810
One of the things that we discussed was this type of imagery here where you'd

30
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:47.670
have vertically these pillars if you will,
or we could even call.
The more,

31
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:51.090
I've sort of looked at this sort of called them tree trunks almost.

32
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.270
And these tree trunks were the chords and that the base of each of these chords,

33
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.410
at least conceptually,
theoretically,
is this thing called the root.

34
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.560
So I like this tree metaphor here.

35
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.300
So we've got the root here of the and then the trunk and then up above of
course,

36
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.750
this florid canopy would musically be the what?

37
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.950
The Melanin.
Okay.
So we might think about,

38
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.030
think about that now in the course of this student ask a very good question that

39
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:22.860
I should have pointed out a long time ago.

40
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.350
And that is when an orchestra plays or in an ensemble plays and they're uh,

41
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.580
they're looking at their meat music and they're reading their music.
Um,

42
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.180
do they play a chord that,

43
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.260
does the violin play a chord and or the trumpets,

44
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.640
each trumpet playing a chord and,
and the viola,
is it playing a chord?

45
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.740
What do you think?
No,
it's just playing one note,

46
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.840
one note of a cord,
one note of a court.
And once again,
we,

47
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:55.980
our ears hear this aggregate of sound.
We say,
oh,
it's got that,
that,
that,
that,

48
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.520
and we extrapolate out of that information that it is this particular core.

49
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.350
But if you were told to look at what the Yso has on it stands,

50
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.210
nobody's playing the chord there.

51
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:11.230
Just playing individual notes that all together form a core.

52
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.640
And we pointed out however,

53
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.790
that one individual has a of the music that has all of these parts on it and

54
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:21.910
that of course is the conductor who has the full conducting score,

55
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:24.460
the full score in front of him or her.

56
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.040
So that was one interesting question that came up.

57
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:30.990
So keep this in mind if you're wondering about this idea of quarter three you

58
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:33.850
could say this is the route and maybe this is the third and that's the fifth.

59
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:38.851
These other instruments are filling in these things at various spots to produce

60
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.810
this aggregate of the cord a supposing this,

61
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.010
we mentioned this also,

62
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:48.640
this idea supposedly we have other things kind of running around there.

63
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.780
Without those other things running around,

64
00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:55.740
we would have a good model of homophonic texture,

65
00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:58.410
sort of block chords changing in that fashion.

66
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.630
If you put in other little strands of melody,

67
00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:03.690
it changes it more toward polyphonic texture.

68
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.400
Let's review another point and I'll get to a second question that was asked,

69
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.540
why do we have to change chords?
We talked about this last time,

70
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.680
why did we change chords?

71
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.683
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

72
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.500
<v 0>because the melody changes and not all harmonies are concordance.</v>

73
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.070
With every note,
someone asked me,
well,
why are some,

74
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.140
why are some notes?

75
00:04:31.141 --> 00:04:35.220
Why are some notes consonant y or other notes,
dissonance,

76
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.130
and the answer has to do with ratios and string sizes,

77
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.020
lengths of pipe and things like that,
but generally speaking,

78
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.450
pitches that are right next to each other,

79
00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.550
very close to each other are dissonant.

80
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.270
If you get a highly irrational ratio like nine to eight,

81
00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:56.140
which is the whole tone or 17 or 18 nine 17 which depending upon your intern

82
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.290
tuning is the half step.

83
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.620
Those irrational ratios are very dissonant or that kind of sound.

84
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.760
But if you allow a little space in there,

85
00:05:08.761 --> 00:05:13.761
let's say you go to a three to two ratio or a six to five,

86
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.580
even a six to five ratio,
it gets more consonant.

87
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.300
Let's see how this would play out here.
For example,
we have the pitch,

88
00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:25.800
see and either no two above or below,

89
00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:29.880
it is dissonant.
These are very close together.
Now let's play this on the piano.

90
00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:30.810
So here's the c.

91
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.810
<v 2>If I play the d above it,
doesn't it be below it?
It's distant.</v>

92
00:05:35.811 --> 00:05:38.500
But let's say I go down to the aid below it.

93
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.830
<v 0>No separation between the two pitches.
Now</v>

94
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:43.390
<v 2>what about that</v>

95
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.420
<v 0>consonant or dissonant?
Sounds a lot better.
What about this,</v>

96
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.730
but now going down to the g against the seat,

97
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.520
<v 2>sounds fine.
Sounds</v>

98
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.590
<v 0>kind of bland or revenue neutral there about this</v>

99
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.680
sounds sort of nights.
What about this?
No,
not so much.

100
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.780
But if you think about it,
so it's not that if you,

101
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.320
it's not that we're allowing even more space here.

102
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:13.400
What we've done is taken this pitch and played it all the way down an octave

103
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:14.030
below it.

104
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.440
So we're actually getting back to this configuration of the pitch right next to

105
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:22.210
it and we could then of course we could throw that one more time.

106
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.103
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

107
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.150
<v 0>And we would get the octave,
which is a,
a duplication of two to one.
So that's,</v>

108
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.160
that's a very wide sort of a ratio there.
So that's something to think about.

109
00:06:33.161 --> 00:06:34.990
The closer to these pitches are together,

110
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.790
the more likely they are to be disappointed and the desire to have some space

111
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.330
added there.
Questions about that?

112
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:44.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

113
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.160
<v 0>Okay.
Uh,
let's go on now to talk about chord progression.</v>

114
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.280
Anybody wanting to do,
what's your understanding of what a chord progression is?

115
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.880
If I said core progression,
I think we have that term up on the board today.

116
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.560
What is a chord progression?

117
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.580
Let's see.
You Ghana.
Yeah,
fire away.

118
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.853
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

119
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.080
<v 0>Nice and loud.
A little bit louder.
I couldn't hear.</v>

120
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.383
<v 1>Okay.</v>

121
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.050
<v 0>Okay,
good.
Excellent.</v>

122
00:07:11.051 --> 00:07:14.620
A sequence of chords that sound good together kind of make sense together.

123
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.370
We could say that sort of March along in a fashion

124
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.250
that kind of makes sense together.
All right.

125
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.810
Then there seemed to be going somewhere and there's this sort of force of polar

126
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.220
gravity in music having to do with some chords,

127
00:07:33.221 --> 00:07:37.540
wanting to go to other chords.
Uh,
so we've got a chord progression.

128
00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:39.340
We've talked about the root of the triad.

129
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.310
The triad is the bottom most pitch of that triad.

130
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.140
Supposing we didn't go see,
gee,

131
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:55.170
but we decided to start with the chain and put the see up on top c e g c,

132
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.780
well that'd be what's called a cord and version.

133
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.120
We're not going to get into that because that takes us into heavy duty music

134
00:08:01.121 --> 00:08:04.660
theory,
but it's if we don't have root position,

135
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.840
then we've got some other note of the triad in the base and we've got some kind

136
00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:09.660
of cord inversion.

137
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.050
So that's what that particular term means up there.

138
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.730
Uh,
what are we going to do to hear these cores?
How do we hear,

139
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.070
how do we hear Chord progressions?
How do we hear harmony?

140
00:08:21.071 --> 00:08:22.630
What are we listening for?
Again,

141
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.550
obviously we've talked about it again and again and again.

142
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.520
We're going to be listening for the base,
okay?

143
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.690
And all of our musical experience tells us,
listen to melody,
melody is beautiful.

144
00:08:33.691 --> 00:08:35.940
That's what we want to hear.
But now to get a sense of harmony,

145
00:08:35.941 --> 00:08:37.110
we're going to listen to the bass.

146
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.510
And we said last time we want to do two things.

147
00:08:39.511 --> 00:08:44.490
We want to figure out if the harmony is changing and if it is changing,

148
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.410
whether it's changing at a regular or irregular rate.
By regular rate,

149
00:08:49.411 --> 00:08:54.411
we mean that the amount of time that each chord holes is exactly the same.

150
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.170
Every cord holds for the same length of time.

151
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.560
If one cord holds twice as long or only half as long,

152
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:08.670
then we have an irregular harmonic change,
irregular rate of harmonic change.

153
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.900
So let's begin with our first example here this morning.
It's from Ricard Wagner.

154
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.810
It's the beginning of his ring cycle.

155
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.350
And we're going to listen to this.
Well,
how do we hear the base?

156
00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:22.470
How do we tell if the,
if the harmony is changing,

157
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.500
what I do is try to sing the bass.

158
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.130
I don't know whether it's easier for gentleman or not because our voices are

159
00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:29.970
sort of in the base,

160
00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:33.450
but maybe this is payback time since ladies are always singing the melody.

161
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.860
So we'll,
we'll focus on the base and we'll try to sing the base.

162
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.920
And if we find that in singing the base,

163
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.270
our voice is not changing.
Probably the harmony hasn't changed.

164
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:50.130
If we have to sing the different pitch,
then probably the harmony has changed.

165
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.000
So let's try that as a initial modus operandi here and we'll see how it works.

166
00:09:54.001 --> 00:09:55.740
So here's an example from Wagner,

167
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.800
<v 4>see if you can find the pitch and when I hear the sound</v>

168
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.010
louder please.

169
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:29.760
[inaudible]

170
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:38.880
<v 0>did it change?
Yup.
He's keeps that same e flat chord for about six minutes.</v>

171
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.350
Be uh,
at the beginning of the overture to Rheingold and basis of that,
you know,

172
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:46.800
there's going to be very long opera if he's going to sit there and one cord to

173
00:10:46.801 --> 00:10:50.010
that amount of time is going to go on for a long period of time.
Okay.

174
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.760
Let's listen to an example from the realm of pop music this time.
Uh,

175
00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:56.070
what about this one?
Is it changing?

176
00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:01.160
<v 4>I think this is Dave Matthews Fan.
What about this one?
See if you can sing,</v>

177
00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:01.994
sing the pitch.

178
00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:15.930
[inaudible]

179
00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:30.740
<v 0>what about that one?
Did it change?
No.
So that when that,
when uh,
didn't uh,</v>

180
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:32.260
change either.

181
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.890
We're going to have some that did that change and we're going to work through

182
00:11:35.891 --> 00:11:37.600
this progressively in just a moment.

183
00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:42.510
I want to make one other point before we launch into that and that is the,

184
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:46.900
this is the following that composers use the rate of harmonic change,

185
00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:51.040
whether it's changing or not changing to sort of make us feel different ways

186
00:11:51.041 --> 00:11:54.310
about the music that we are listening,
uh,

187
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:59.140
gives a sense of what this music is all really all about.

188
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:02.800
And since as we will say so much classical music doesn't have a text with it,

189
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.450
we've got to have some markers in there to,
to know,
uh,
what,

190
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.620
what the composer is trying to communicate to us.

191
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.660
Here's the famous example from Mozart's g minor symphony

192
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.680
and so on.
So if,
if I strip away,
there's noodling here,

193
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:35.260
which is just a kind of Arpeggio patterning of the court and just had the cord

194
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.730
stay there.
Dot Dee Dee Dee.

195
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.560
All right,
so those are the courts underneath notice at the beginning

196
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:57.390
to two to three,

197
00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:02.450
to four to one to two to three to four,

198
00:13:03.661 --> 00:13:08.060
two at the beginning.
These courts are holding for four measures.

199
00:13:08.061 --> 00:13:11.610
Your total of eight beats a then as it goes on.

200
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:18.203
<v 4>Uh</v>

201
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.073
Huh.

202
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.830
<v 0>What happens here?</v>

203
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.660
Changing on every beat that
they were getting.

204
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:40.760
Two changes per beat.
So what's happened to the rate of harmonic change here?

205
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:44.840
Is it regular or irregular?
Highly irregular.

206
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.980
And what is happening to it?
It's getting faster and faster and faster.

207
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.700
So here in the g minor symphony,
we feel this.
Oh,

208
00:13:52.701 --> 00:13:55.880
it's so it's sort of full full of tension,
angst,

209
00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:01.010
anxiety,
perhaps passion.
It's driving somewhere.

210
00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:05.810
And one of the things that's driving it is this accelerating rate of harmonic

211
00:14:05.811 --> 00:14:08.240
change.
The amount of time at each court is holding,

212
00:14:08.241 --> 00:14:11.300
is getting shorter and shorter and shorter.
As we drive into that drive,

213
00:14:11.301 --> 00:14:13.720
into that cadence that the cadences

214
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.700
is simply the end of a musical phrase,
particularly in this case,

215
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.170
the end of a chord progression.
So we've,
well,
we are a point of arrival.

216
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.760
Caden's brings us to a point of arrival.
So that's a piece of Mozart.

217
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.540
Let's turn to a piece of Beethoven now.
Uh,
his symphony number six,

218
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.590
the pastoral symphony.
Let's listen to just a bit of it.

219
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.823
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

220
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.630
<v 0>Can you pick out the base?</v>

221
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.720
Can you sing the bass pit?

222
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:55.440
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

223
00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.510
<v 0>now we can.
Okay.
No,
that's fine.</v>

224
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.910
That's why we were stopped right there at my shop right there.
Well,

225
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:07.550
it's difficult.
It's not easy.
It can you pick out there.
But no,

226
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.920
I mean I was having trouble picking out the base there.
So sometimes you,

227
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.860
you can do it and sometimes you can't do it.

228
00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:16.190
We're going to focus now on some passages where we can do it.

229
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.090
We're going to see how Beethoven is setting up some chord progressions here.

230
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:24.110
So here we've got,
uh,
let's see.
Um,

231
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.950
we've got some cord set out and we're going to,
let's move it along,

232
00:15:27.951 --> 00:15:30.710
but one 38 or wherever we are there,

233
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:34.700
we've got some chords set out here and we're in the key of c at this point and

234
00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:37.460
we're going to hear Beethoven go to a tonic chord,

235
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:42.260
then the subdominant chord than a tonic chord,
then a dominant chord and so on.

236
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:46.280
We're just going to watch and listen to maybe even sing along with the basis he

237
00:15:46.281 --> 00:15:47.480
changes cords.

238
00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.550
<v 4>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

239
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:22.780
yeah,

240
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.130
<v 0>for a minute.
And let's work well here that again,</v>

241
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.060
but as you can see,

242
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.690
<v 6>bomb
hold on that bom,</v>

243
00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.380
Bom,
bom,
Bom,
bom.

244
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.040
<v 0>And then the,
the changes came a little bit faster and faster.</v>

245
00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:45.041
So let's listen to that again and we will then they get over to here where he's

246
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:49.430
sitting on the tonic chord and we want to see how long he's going to hold this

247
00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:51.500
tonic chord.
Okay?

248
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.210
<v 4>Okay.</v>

249
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.080
Regular.
How,
because we're held a long time,

250
00:17:07.081 --> 00:17:10.050
they're now moving faster.

251
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.740
<v 0>Okay.
So he's up to something here with this heart rate of harmonic change.</v>

252
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.550
We almost fell asleep on that tonic chord.
Uh,

253
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.640
he's doing the opposite of what Mozart,

254
00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.330
he's trying to relax this here by slowing down the rate of harmonic change here

255
00:17:51.331 --> 00:17:54.150
that had that health for about 30 seconds.
That tonic core,

256
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:59.130
almost all classical music and involves irregular rates of harmonic change,

257
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.220
um,
appointed I think will become apparent later on.

258
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.690
But that is perhaps why this is the pastoral symphony,

259
00:18:06.691 --> 00:18:09.270
this idea of being relaxed,

260
00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:14.271
being outdoors among the midst nature and being in a very relaxed sort of state

261
00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:20.310
of mind.
The rate of harmonic change has slowed down considerably here.

262
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:26.430
Uh,
okay.
Now for the rest of the session today,

263
00:18:26.431 --> 00:18:31.431
what I'd like to do is take examples from the realm of pop music and used them

264
00:18:32.581 --> 00:18:37.440
as paradigms for what happens in the world of classical music.

265
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.790
Why would I do that?
Why,
when dealing with harmony and baselines,

266
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:47.210
do I want to start by focusing on popular music and then apply those principles

267
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:51.420
to classical music?
What does pop music do for us?

268
00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:55.140
It's very helpful,
Marcus.
Okay.

269
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:59.200
It's not like it is very regular.
Marcus.
I'm always telling my kids don't like,

270
00:18:59.201 --> 00:19:03.990
like no,
it is indeed very regular.
So,
uh,
it is indeed very regular.
So that's,

271
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:04.860
that's one thing.

272
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.970
And by regular we mean these patterns keep repeating again and again.

273
00:19:08.971 --> 00:19:13.800
So Marcus is absolutely right.
That's the big ticket item.
It's,
it's regular.

274
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.030
It oftentimes repeats and it can be symmetrical in that sense.

275
00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:19.890
Another observation,
Roger.

276
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.010
Okay.
Yeah,
that's another point.

277
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:35.040
It's more obvious because it probably fewer lines there so that you can focus on

278
00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:39.710
the primary line,
the basic line,
the baseline.
Yeah.
So there's,
uh,

279
00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.680
it's probably simpler in that sense.
Any other observations?

280
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.600
Well,
here's one other that you might not have thought of a,

281
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.640
and that is that most of the chords in rock music in particular tend to be root

282
00:19:55.181 --> 00:19:58.510
position chords a as,
and for that reason,

283
00:19:58.511 --> 00:20:01.460
they're easier to hear when you start getting an inversion gone.

284
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.870
What node is that?
What Chord is that?
That obfuscates the issue.

285
00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:08.620
So because so much popular music,
particularly rock music,

286
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:13.300
has those chords in root position,
we can track them more readily.

287
00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.130
And then finally we can add that the idea that may be with a lot of,
uh,

288
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.220
electronic basis and things like that that they play,

289
00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:25.360
they tend to play the bass just louder.
Okay.
So all of these factors,

290
00:20:25.361 --> 00:20:29.620
particularly the idea of regularity and repetition.

291
00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:33.130
So let's take a couple of examples here.
Now,

292
00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:36.430
let me go over and look at my list.
Um,

293
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.000
okay.
I think we have something.

294
00:20:40.001 --> 00:20:43.600
I've chosen something called badly drawn.
Boy,

295
00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.920
I had this in my collection.
Anybody ever heard of this is okay,
one,
two,

296
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.090
this is not okay.
Three.
So this is,
is that,
is it direct,

297
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.660
badly drawn boys or boy board?
What?
Singular.
Okay.

298
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:59.050
Um,
we're going to hear just a few seconds of this.

299
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:03.520
See if you can determine the,
how many cords we have here,

300
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.730
whether we have a core change.
If so,

301
00:21:06.731 --> 00:21:10.300
how many cords or are involved in this core change and are they changing and

302
00:21:10.301 --> 00:21:12.490
irregular or your regular rate.

303
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.673
<v 1>Okay.</v>

304
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.640
<v 0>But they were before the corporate counsel's office starts getting on my case.</v>

305
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.020
Uh,
what about that?

306
00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.930
Regular or irregular regular ball.

307
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.630
And then we go onto the next one.
And how many cords were involved?

308
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.590
Their difference of opinion shut.
How many,

309
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:54.460
<v 1>okay,</v>

310
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.430
<v 0>well let,
let's hear it again.
I think we,
let's do,
I'm sorry Linda.</v>

311
00:21:57.431 --> 00:21:58.930
Let's do it again and see if we can figure,

312
00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.540
figure this out where it wasn't planning to do this,
but we have time.

313
00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:02.374
Let's do it.

314
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.253
<v 1>Okay.</v>

315
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.550
So to Edward.

316
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.940
<v 0>Um,
so we have just two chords here.
Just change it back and forth between two.
Uh,</v>

317
00:22:31.941 --> 00:22:36.680
here's another example.
Um,
Justin Timberlake.

318
00:22:36.681 --> 00:22:40.340
Sorry,
but it's a good example.
Let's listen to this.

319
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:43.000
How many cords or involve regular or irregular?

320
00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:07.243
<v 8>Huh?</v>

321
00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:14.260
<v 0>Regular or irregular?</v>

322
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.633
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

323
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:20.770
<v 0>Let me think.
In regular.
Raise your right hand.
Raise your left hand.</v>

324
00:23:20.771 --> 00:23:21.820
You think it's your regular,
yeah,

325
00:23:21.821 --> 00:23:26.530
it's regular and with each cord was holding for two beats there in Dupo meter.

326
00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.740
How many cords where they're all together?
Yeah,

327
00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:33.340
I think there were four chords there.
So we had changed.
Yes,
it was changed.

328
00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.990
It was regular and it happened to involve,
uh,
four chords.
Okay.

329
00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.240
Pop Music.
We've been using some pop music here.

330
00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:43.690
We've talked about why we use the pop music.

331
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.580
Let's talk about what the difference between pop and classical music.

332
00:23:46.581 --> 00:23:50.420
If we've touched on this a little bit before,
but let's,
uh,

333
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.020
let's play with this again.
Uh,
you know,

334
00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.110
let's say you go home for Thanksgiving break and your grandmother and says,

335
00:23:57.111 --> 00:23:59.930
what have you been doing?
It all had been taking this course and music.

336
00:23:59.931 --> 00:24:02.620
We've been sending classical music and some popular music.
She says,

337
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:03.230
what's the difference?

338
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:06.560
Tell me what's the difference between popular music and classical music?

339
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:10.850
How would you explain to your grandmother what the differences,
maybe six,
seven,

340
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.400
eight different bullet points here.

341
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:15.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

342
00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:16.290
<v 0>Who could get us started?</v>

343
00:24:16.291 --> 00:24:20.970
We've talked about some of these already having to do with the nature of the

344
00:24:20.971 --> 00:24:25.971
harmony that pop music tends to have a simpler harmonies and that those

345
00:24:26.251 --> 00:24:28.680
harmonies tend to be more repetitious,

346
00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:33.860
that they tend to have harmonies that have cords in root position.

347
00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:36.180
And here's one other thing.

348
00:24:36.181 --> 00:24:39.870
You might not think of a and then I'm going to stop and I'm gonna let you add

349
00:24:39.871 --> 00:24:44.700
things here.
They tend to be just triads,
whereas in classical music

350
00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:50.160
<v 9>you could have a try,
but we could also add a seventh node,
one,
three,
five,</v>

351
00:24:50.161 --> 00:24:51.060
seven,

352
00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.520
<v 0>that kind of thing.
It gets more distant then the more notes that you add there.</v>

353
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:05.840
So classical music does involve more complex chords.

354
00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.870
Okay,
what else?
What else here?

355
00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

356
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.300
<v 0>Um,
Oscar</v>

357
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:19.220
pop,
pop music tends to have a vocal part.
Why?

358
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.313
<v 1>Okay.</v>

359
00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.500
<v 0>Well,
because it wants to be popular.</v>

360
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.250
Maybe a circular argument there.
Well,
okay,
but,
but if,
if,

361
00:25:32.251 --> 00:25:35.650
if you're going to have a singer,
what's that singer going to be singing?

362
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

363
00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.990
<v 0>Uh,
uh,
a melody.
Well,
album,
but classical music has melody,
you know,</v>

364
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.650
we have a violinists play a melody.
If you have a singer,

365
00:25:44.651 --> 00:25:46.110
a singer is going to be singing a

366
00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:48.843
<v 1>a text,</v>

367
00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.030
<v 0>right?
And we've talked about this before,
that classical music,</v>

368
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.470
probably 85% of it does not involve a text.
And that's,

369
00:25:56.471 --> 00:26:01.450
that's a whole different ballgame because then you have to communicate meaning

370
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.790
in a completely different sort of way.

371
00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:08.740
Maybe you communicate meaning by slowing down your harmonic motion to make us

372
00:26:08.741 --> 00:26:13.330
feel relaxed.
So that,
that each of these with,
with pop music,
you'd have,

373
00:26:13.331 --> 00:26:17.200
you know what the thing means principally because of the text.
But with,

374
00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.610
with the classical music,

375
00:26:18.611 --> 00:26:23.611
you've got these sort of subliminal symbols in their subliminal signifiers that

376
00:26:24.071 --> 00:26:26.740
we've got to pick up on.
And we'll be talking more and more about that.

377
00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.500
So we do have debts.
A very important point that Oscar ridges there.

378
00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:34.620
We've got text in pop music that tells us what this music means.

379
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.633
Anything else?

380
00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:40.990
<v 1>Uh,
Caroline.</v>

381
00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:49.580
<v 0>Okay.</v>

382
00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:53.660
If you go to a hear of symphony of mid Beethoven on each movement will probably

383
00:26:53.661 --> 00:26:57.980
last 15 minutes.
If you put on a CD,
you know,
we could have a what?

384
00:26:57.981 --> 00:27:01.880
What's the timing on the just Dustin Timberlake thing there or any one of the

385
00:27:01.881 --> 00:27:06.750
trash pickup?
The Duke of Earl one there.
Did they give this timings a,

386
00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:10.130
okay,
I can't read it,
but two minutes and 50 seconds,
two minutes.

387
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.420
This is only two minutes,
three minutes and 20 seconds.
That kind of thing.

388
00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:19.160
They're short.
Uh,
whereas Beethoven has mentioned as much longer.

389
00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.690
What does that,
what does that opportunity of length provide us?

390
00:27:23.691 --> 00:27:28.691
It provides us the opportunity to be more diversified in terms of the mood of

391
00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:33.820
the music.
So in classical music you can have rather wide,
uh,

392
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.320
mood swings.
Remember we had in that one piece

393
00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.560
and then,
oh,

394
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.460
it was a modulation tying them together,
but there was,

395
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.690
were completely different sentiments.

396
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:53.400
Usually with a piece of popular music,
you get a single ethos,

397
00:27:53.401 --> 00:27:54.430
a single feeling,

398
00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:59.450
the single mood associated with the piece and the piece will tend to be shorter.

399
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:02.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

400
00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:04.480
<v 0>Anything more that we could push on that?
Yeah.</v>

401
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:09.583
<v 1>Okay.</v>

402
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.880
<v 0>Okay.
That's it.
Yeah.
Most classical music is written down and we've talked to,</v>

403
00:28:12.881 --> 00:28:15.120
we spent a lot of time talking about that and most popular music,

404
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:19.110
well virtually all of it.
Although after the fact people try to write it down,

405
00:28:19.111 --> 00:28:24.090
you can,
you can go by a score of,
of meat of the Beatles for example.

406
00:28:24.091 --> 00:28:28.050
Although they didn't design this initially with with music,

407
00:28:28.051 --> 00:28:32.190
but after the fact people sort of listened to it and and and Co and make,

408
00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:36.030
make written full put in written form what had originally been just an orally

409
00:28:36.031 --> 00:28:39.510
can see artistic statement.
Anything else,
Raj?

410
00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:44.983
<v 1>Okay.</v>

411
00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:50.370
<v 0>Yeah.
Oh,
so we've got the difference between acoustical instruments,</v>

412
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.940
which are sort of natural wood and strings and that sort of thing and

413
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:58.890
electronically amplified sound in which it might be sent to a mixer or perhaps a

414
00:28:58.891 --> 00:29:03.540
synthesizer that could play with those partials that we talked about and maybe

415
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.250
turn a clarinet,

416
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.130
somebody playing it a keyboard and you want that keyboard to sound like a

417
00:29:08.131 --> 00:29:11.280
trumpet where you just turn a mixing board and you can get those pitches to

418
00:29:11.281 --> 00:29:13.770
sound like a trumpet.
Or,
for example,

419
00:29:13.771 --> 00:29:17.070
let's say your share and you're getting into your early sixties,

420
00:29:17.071 --> 00:29:21.570
and you really can't hit that high note and the more you can get electronically

421
00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:25.830
that particular sound to be enhanced.
And let's say you can't hold that.

422
00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:27.390
Let's say Pavarotti at the end of his life,

423
00:29:27.391 --> 00:29:32.391
couldn't hold notes as long as he could when he was recording in 1978.

424
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.930
Well you can just,
uh,

425
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.870
an engineer will just sit there and isolate that second of sound and,

426
00:29:37.871 --> 00:29:41.010
and give the times three come in and boom,
we'll look at poverty.

427
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.910
Hauled out that note.
Well it's,

428
00:29:42.911 --> 00:29:46.710
it's the miracle of the engineer and not the singer.
So,
uh,
there,
uh,

429
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.920
there are a lot of acoustical things,

430
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.990
sort of tricks of synthetic things going on in pop music.
Yeah.

431
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:59.360
<v 1>Chord progression,
but also the structure of the piece.
Music.</v>

432
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:05.010
There's often a couple of verses and the chorus and a bridge and you can predict

433
00:30:05.011 --> 00:30:07.950
each different movement of the piece much more regularly.

434
00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:14.180
<v 0>Couldn't say it better myself.
Say That nice and loud so everyone can hear it.</v>

435
00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:19.400
<v 1>The structure of a popular pieces,
often more predictable and pattern.</v>

436
00:30:19.401 --> 00:30:21.820
And vs in bridges and courses.

437
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.760
Whereas with the classical music,

438
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.470
you really can't predict what part of the movement you're at as well as you can.

439
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:33.280
<v 0>Exactly.
And that ties in with the harmony also,</v>

440
00:30:33.281 --> 00:30:36.790
which is also a lot more predictable.
And so generally speaking,

441
00:30:36.791 --> 00:30:39.820
what we ended up with classical music,
it's much more diversified.

442
00:30:39.821 --> 00:30:42.100
It's much more varied.
It's much more complex.

443
00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:44.740
We've got contrapuntal lines operating in it.

444
00:30:44.741 --> 00:30:48.070
It has the capacity for expansion.

445
00:30:48.071 --> 00:30:50.270
It can take us through the full plan,

446
00:30:50.271 --> 00:30:54.940
a plea of human emotions within one particular composition.

447
00:30:55.090 --> 00:31:00.090
And it perhaps allows the opportunity for more personal interpretation exact,

448
00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:02.080
exactly what does this music mean?

449
00:31:02.081 --> 00:31:05.530
More personal interpretation because we're not tied to attach,

450
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:09.040
we're not linked in to a particular text that tells us what it's about.

451
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:12.970
So those are just a few,
few ideas as we,
as we pursue this.
Well,

452
00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:14.980
what I'd like to do now is,
uh,
uh,

453
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:20.230
move here to a couple of additional pieces and we're going to use an example of

454
00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:24.700
pop music.
Now with a three chord chord progression.
We've heard,

455
00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.800
I guess it was badly drawn board boys.

456
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:31.510
They're with a two chord chord progression.
Now we're going to hear a beach boys,

457
00:31:31.511 --> 00:31:34.210
I guess with a three chord chord progression,

458
00:31:34.211 --> 00:31:37.660
and it's going to be subdominant dominant tonic.

459
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:39.670
Is it regular or irregular?

460
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:45.200
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

461
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:10.070
<v 0>there.
Can you sing that base?
You sing it for me.
Here's the ton of from bump.</v>

462
00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.270
<v 4>MMM,</v>

463
00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:17.290
<v 0>good,
good.
Louder.
That's it.</v>

464
00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.930
Okay.
So that's all you gotta do.
And you can hear the

465
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:24.740
link for twice as long as the other.

466
00:32:24.741 --> 00:32:29.450
So you've got irregular rate of harmonic change.
So that's one,
four,
five,
one.

467
00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:34.360
Let's go to a little bit more of Beethoven.

468
00:32:34.361 --> 00:32:38.390
And we're going to go now to the last movement of his pastoral symphony.

469
00:32:38.391 --> 00:32:42.120
And I keep hitting on the pastoral symphony cousin,
two weeks or maybe three,

470
00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.210
maybe three weeks.
We're going to go here,

471
00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.480
I guess the Saybrook Orchestra play the pastoral symphony.

472
00:32:47.481 --> 00:32:51.350
So I'm spending a little extra time on the pastoral symphony here and the last

473
00:32:51.351 --> 00:32:55.610
movement opens with this sort of sale.
We have these pitches.

474
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:04.550
Uh,
and I'll will listen and you can tell me what instrument is playing it.
Uh,

475
00:33:04.551 --> 00:33:06.070
so we have those sorts of sounds.

476
00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:07.163
<v 5>Woo.</v>

477
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:09.010
<v 0>And then another instrument will come in with</v>

478
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:15.940
and play that.
It's all,
these are all notes of AC.

479
00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.430
Try it and see

480
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:25.930
all notes of the sea trial.

481
00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.030
All notes have a seat right now we happen to be in the key of f here.

482
00:33:30.031 --> 00:33:32.700
So that means he starting out with the dominant,
which,

483
00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:37.410
which gets us to the point that all pieces have to end in the tonic one way or

484
00:33:37.411 --> 00:33:39.870
another,
but not all pieces to begin with the tonic.

485
00:33:39.871 --> 00:33:42.240
So this one happens to begin with a sort of dominant chord.

486
00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.580
So this is a little bit of dominant preparation.

487
00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.420
So tell me what instruments are playing here

488
00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.170
and then the strings coming.
So let's pause it right there.

489
00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.610
So what was the first instrument?

490
00:34:12.611 --> 00:34:15.670
Anybody picked that up and at one point on the quiz or a test?

491
00:34:15.671 --> 00:34:18.430
Next week we are uh,
on Thursday we'll give you three,

492
00:34:18.431 --> 00:34:23.380
at least three playings Robert Clarinet.
Yes,
it was a clarinet up there.

493
00:34:23.381 --> 00:34:25.960
Nice and hot.
And then another instrument came in with,

494
00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:33.090
what instrument was that?
French horn.
Yeah.

495
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.140
But notice if we take this,

496
00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:36.223
<v 3>we're good.</v>

497
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.990
<v 0>Back to that same idea of the Octa,
the fifth,
the fourth and the third.
So,</v>

498
00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.740
so it's again sort of primordial this,

499
00:34:48.741 --> 00:34:51.620
this particular acoustical basis of so much of music.

500
00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.190
So that's our dominant preparation.
And then the melody starts,

501
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:57.350
so let's listen to this.
Let me play it here a little bit.
Yeah.

502
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:12.270
So it has a kind of antecedent consequence for your structure with the,

503
00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:16.920
once we get up there,
that's sort of the end of the antecedent phrase,

504
00:35:16.921 --> 00:35:20.520
and we'll have a core change.
What we're working with here at the same chords,

505
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.190
we've sort of gone from the beach boys to Beethoven here.

506
00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:27.240
We've got the same chords operating.
It's going to be a one core,

507
00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.480
then a four chord,
and we'll drop down for the forecourt.

508
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:33.120
Then we'll come to a five core to a one core,
two,

509
00:35:33.121 --> 00:35:36.960
four core to a five core to a one court,
just as we were doing with the beach.

510
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.570
So let's just continue,
I think Linda,
please.
Yeah,
with the Beethoven,
sorry.

511
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.890
Oops.
Did we lose our friend Beethoven?
Oh,

512
00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.930
we'll will resuscitate Beethoven here.

513
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.900
How many of you have ever heard this before?
While Linda's is getting this set?

514
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:56.850
Let's see if we could sing it together and because we're going to do this in a

515
00:35:56.851 --> 00:35:57.684
different way to say

516
00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:02.450
<v 10>la,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la,</v>

517
00:36:02.451 --> 00:36:05.760
la,
la,
la,
la,
la,

518
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:10.790
la La la La la La la La,

519
00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.460
la La.

520
00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.730
<v 0>Okay.
So let's see this.
That's the melody.
And we're going to sing.</v>

521
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.753
<v 10>Hello.</v>

522
00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:22.130
<v 6>Oh aw.</v>

523
00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:27.520
<v 0>Bomb beneath.
We're gonna sink Beethoven's base beneath Beethoven's melody.</v>

524
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.140
Okay.
This is,
this is the intro.
That's fine.
We'll listen to it.

525
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:36.420
Here comes the horn.

526
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.570
<v 4>Oh,</v>

527
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:59.180
mom.

528
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:08.873
MMM

529
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:35.930
[inaudible].

530
00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:40.350
<v 0>So that's an example of a classical composer,
admittedly in a pretty straight,</v>

531
00:37:40.351 --> 00:37:45.330
straightforward situation using the same three chord core progressions we find

532
00:37:45.331 --> 00:37:48.420
in the beach boys.
Let's enlarge this further.

533
00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.440
Let's move to a four chord chord progression.
We're going to switch the board.

534
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.450
Jacob,
if you could give me a hand,

535
00:37:54.451 --> 00:37:58.200
just tick taking that around and we're going to go to the kind of music that I

536
00:37:58.201 --> 00:38:00.780
grew up with as a kid.
It's always fun.

537
00:38:00.781 --> 00:38:03.270
This is gene Chandler and the Duke of Earl.

538
00:38:03.271 --> 00:38:06.780
So we're going to listen to a little bit of it and we're going to chart the base

539
00:38:06.781 --> 00:38:09.540
here.
Trying to remember,
I think actually is in the same key as Beethoven,

540
00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.010
and then we'll see exactly what it is that he's doing here.

541
00:38:21.011 --> 00:38:24.190
So we're gonna let's try to lock in on the base.
Here we go.

542
00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:29.510
<v 10>Ooh,
wow.</v>

543
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:52.160
<v 4>Nothing can stop a due bill.
Good.
Yeah.</v>

544
00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.610
<v 0>And let's move it up to about 30 39 or so.
Uh,</v>

545
00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:00.970
so we've got four chords operating here and they're changing regularly.

546
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:04.900
What are those four chords?
Well,
we talked a little bit about this before.

547
00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:06.070
Now we have,

548
00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:10.300
which called a six cord and we're not moving directly to the four chord.

549
00:39:10.301 --> 00:39:13.900
We're moving to another court here,
a six cord,

550
00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:21.500
which happens to be a minor chord.
Here's the four card.

551
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:27.090
There's two,
the one.
So you are seeing this nice and loud for me.
Please move.

552
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.060
Bomb.
There's a Tenae.
Why did he go?

553
00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.580
<v 10>Aw,</v>

554
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:36.920
<v 1>good.
One more time.</v>

555
00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:38.560
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

556
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.393
<v 0>Louder.</v>

557
00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.430
<v 10>Hello.</v>

558
00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:49.970
<v 0>Okay.
Now Watch what happens as we continue with this one six,
four,
five,</v>

559
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.740
one progression.
Uh,
do we have a regular or irregular rate of change here?

560
00:39:54.741 --> 00:39:56.480
Let's go onto the next section.

561
00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:57.410
<v 1>Okay?</v>

562
00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:58.243
<v 4>Yes.</v>

563
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:17.220
Yay.

564
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.513
Shit.

565
00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:33.880
Yes sir.

566
00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.860
<v 0>We'll stop it there.
So what happened in that Middle Section?</v>

567
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:41.783
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

568
00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:47.053
<v 0>Good.
Yeah,</v>

569
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:49.370
<v 10>y'all.</v>

570
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:56.170
<v 0>And then we went on and on and on and on.
The longer,
longer,
longer than am I,</v>

571
00:40:56.171 --> 00:40:59.090
Blah Blah.
But it was the same pattern.
He just,

572
00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:02.980
he just elongated each measure by its same amount.

573
00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.960
So we had a harmony changing,
uh,
on each measure.
And then in that middle section,

574
00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.140
each cord was changing at the rate of two measures.

575
00:41:11.141 --> 00:41:15.880
So the whole piece then would be a piece involving irregular rate of change.

576
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:19.080
Your regular rate of change.
The entire piece.
Okay.
So,
uh,

577
00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:23.650
that's the Duke of Earl progression,
the basic one six,
four,
five one.

578
00:41:23.651 --> 00:41:27.040
Now I play a passage of Mozart,
uh,
um,

579
00:41:27.041 --> 00:41:29.180
a symphony by Mozart here,
uh,

580
00:41:29.181 --> 00:41:34.160
that he wrote at the ripe old age of nine years,
nine years.

581
00:41:34.161 --> 00:41:37.970
This is Mozart at age nine.
He had actually written a couple of symphonies.

582
00:41:37.971 --> 00:41:41.720
By this time.
This is as a symphony number five and B flat.
Uh,

583
00:41:41.721 --> 00:41:44.720
so let's listen to this.
We're just going to listen and see if,

584
00:41:44.721 --> 00:41:47.480
see if anything strikes you as interesting.

585
00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:18.700
Okay.
We can pause it there.

586
00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.880
I think we're just shipping to keep right on going just to get the point across

587
00:42:21.881 --> 00:42:23.260
with just let it run.

588
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:46.610
Okay.
That's enough of that.
So that's Mozart using the Duke of Earl harmony.

589
00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.420
Um,
not really.
This was a point I brought up in my section the other day.

590
00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:54.380
Is there a lots of legal cases where people try to sue somebody else for

591
00:42:54.381 --> 00:42:58.250
stealing a song that he's tried to sue them for stealing a baseline or something

592
00:42:58.251 --> 00:43:01.880
like that?
You can get away.
You can sue people for stealing melody.
You can never,

593
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:05.810
there's a strong legal precedent for not being able to make a claim about a

594
00:43:05.811 --> 00:43:09.320
stolen base because these bases are limited in number.

595
00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:13.340
They involve rather simple harmonic progressions and they'd been used over the

596
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:13.550
centuries.

597
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:16.460
It's not as if gene Chandler said around here studying Mozart symphonies.

598
00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:19.460
I don't know.
Maybe he did.
He said,
oh,
I like that.
Harmonic progression.

599
00:43:19.461 --> 00:43:20.294
I'm going use that here.
No,

600
00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.080
everybody's been using that sort of since time in memorial at least since the

601
00:43:24.081 --> 00:43:25.190
16th century.

602
00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:30.800
Now let's go on here to listen to some music of Rossini,

603
00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:35.050
a composer Giacomo Rossini coming after Mozart.
Uh,

604
00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.960
and he likes Chord progressions to,
so we're going to listen to a passage of,

605
00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:43.610
of Rossini and see what he does by way of his cord selection.

606
00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:48.020
So the point of this is once you get these kind of progressions locked in your

607
00:43:48.021 --> 00:43:48.680
ears,

608
00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:53.680
you go to a concert and you can begin to chart what the heart of what the piece

609
00:43:54.171 --> 00:43:56.150
is doing in terms of its harmony.
Yeah,

610
00:43:56.151 --> 00:43:59.090
you're not going to be able to hear all of it and the deed,

611
00:43:59.091 --> 00:44:01.970
you may not be able to hear most of it.
I don't hear most of it,

612
00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:05.990
but there are moments and there are moments that give me pleasure when I can
say,

613
00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:09.380
oh yeah,
that's what he's doing there.
I might not know what key he's in.

614
00:44:09.381 --> 00:44:12.780
I don't really care what keys in,
cause I don't have absolute pitch.
Uh,

615
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:15.650
but I can find,
well maybe it's a one six,
four,

616
00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:20.570
five one chord progression or one five one progression or one four,
five one.

617
00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:25.610
Um,
we,
you'll get different kinds of patterns.
A pocket bell base pattern is,

618
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:26.570
and another one.

619
00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:31.650
So let's listen to a pattern that Rossini is using here in this opera overture.

620
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:37.710
<v 4>First thing we got to do is sort of lock on to the tunnel.</v>

621
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:48.200
Just taking the wild.

622
00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:49.650
<v 0>Let's stop it right there.
It's just fun.</v>

623
00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.480
It's taking me a while to lock on to that time.
I don't know,

624
00:44:52.481 --> 00:44:56.140
the base isn't as loud as it in some of the pop needs will give dumb,

625
00:44:56.170 --> 00:45:01.080
but I think it,
but I think that's what the tonic is so,

626
00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:05.130
so don't be,
don't despair if you don't initially land on the tonic here.

627
00:45:05.131 --> 00:45:09.660
It takes a while.
So,
but I think we've got to identify,
all right,
let's go on,

628
00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:19.730
<v 4>right?</v>

629
00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:20.853
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

630
00:45:20.890 --> 00:45:23.460
<v 6>Pom Pom Pom.</v>

631
00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:25.790
<v 0>Paul,
what would you guess those two chords are?</v>

632
00:45:25.791 --> 00:45:27.790
If he said this is the tonic bomb.

633
00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:28.850
<v 4>Okay.</v>

634
00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:31.280
<v 0>Other,
it's probably going to be the dominant.</v>

635
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:35.030
You ever hear music rocking back and forth repeatedly between two courses is

636
00:45:35.031 --> 00:45:38.620
probably tonic dominant tonic.
I remember we had that even with the Strauss,

637
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:45.010
but he played that tonic dominant tonic dominant Tanika so if you're two cores

638
00:45:45.011 --> 00:45:47.140
rocking is probably tonic and dominance.
Okay.

639
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:49.450
Let's see how he expands this a little bit.

640
00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:56.810
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

641
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:07.370
<v 0>what was that?
Well that's the Duke of Earl passage,
right?</v>

642
00:46:07.371 --> 00:46:09.340
So you're sitting there and Woolsey Hall,

643
00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:11.550
New Haven Symphony or whatever in New York Philharmonic.
Oh yeah.

644
00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:15.520
It's a Duke of Earl passage.
So,
uh,
yes,
it was the one six mm

645
00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.300
progression.
All right,
let's see what happens next.

646
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.820
<v 4>So what happened</v>

647
00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:32.000
<v 0>connect was he then started to run that faster bomb he,
Bob,</v>

648
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:36.880
Bob twice as fast as it had been before.
Changing rate of Armani pattern.
Okay

649
00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:45.180
<v 4>there.</v>

650
00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:49.980
<v 0>What was that?
Bom Bom.
Bom.
Bom pump pump.
Pump.
Pump.
Pump,
pump.
Pump up.</v>

651
00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:54.350
What chords?
They're probably
Daniel,
what do you think?

652
00:46:54.351 --> 00:46:58.810
What courts there
just dominate Italian palm,
palm,
Palm,

653
00:46:58.811 --> 00:47:03.010
palm bump,
bump,
bump,
bump,
going faster and faster.
And then what happens?

654
00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:10.320
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

655
00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:18.650
<v 0>the end of that was all just a ton.
And he just sat there on the tunny forever.</v>

656
00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:22.760
It's a good example of sort of realtime in psychological time in music.

657
00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:24.650
You knew it was time to start clapping.

658
00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:28.870
As soon as that core hit that stop going back and forth,
tonic dominant,

659
00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:30.580
just sitting there.
That piece is over.

660
00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.820
The rest is just a big mud pie in your face.
Okay?

661
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.000
It's just tonic or maybe throwing an anchor overboard to bring this ship to an

662
00:47:39.401 --> 00:47:44.230
end.
Whatever sort of analogy or visual image you want to bring to it.
But it's,

663
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:48.610
the piece has ended.
Even though we are continuing to hear sound harmonically,

664
00:47:48.611 --> 00:47:53.140
psychologically,
we know we're finished when he hits that particular topic.
Okay.

665
00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:57.880
I think our time is up.
I'll see you Wednesday evening and look for an email,
uh,

666
00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:01.300
early this afternoon about individual help tomorrow afternoon.
