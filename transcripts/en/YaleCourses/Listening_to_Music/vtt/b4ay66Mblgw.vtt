WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:03.241
Okay.

2
00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:08.241
So this morning what we're going to be dealing with is the question of the

3
00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:10.230
development of the piano.

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.350
Really from the time of Mozart through Beethoven,

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.860
through Chopin,

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.980
and through list up to the modern grand piano that you see in front of us.

7
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:24.030
And we'll end with a guest performer.

8
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.780
A Dench lost Wartburg will be coming in about 11 o'clock and we'll be talking to

9
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:29.430
Dan at that point.
Uh,

10
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:34.140
we start with Mozart because he was the first composer to switch from the

11
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:37.200
harpsichord over to the piano.

12
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.250
The harpsichord was the primary instrument of course,
of the Baroque period,

13
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:45.300
as we said before,
1600 to 1750.
Now,

14
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:50.301
our first slide that we see on the screen this morning is a Dutch harpsichord,

15
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:53.340
comes in the low countries of the 17th century.

16
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.050
It's actually in our own collection of historical musical instruments at 17

17
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:02.580
Hillhouse avenue.
And many of the slides,
um,
that will,

18
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:05.280
we will be seeing today come from that particular collection.

19
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.600
So if you ever had to be sick and going over to Dui h right next to doh on this

20
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:11.730
side of the railroad tracks or the canal,

21
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:16.440
there is this splendid collection of keyboard instruments.

22
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.940
Uh,
you got a chance I believe,
um,

23
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.080
in section last time to deal with the heart to Gordon and perhaps even play the

24
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:29.970
Harpsichord and remember that produces this kind of tinkling jangling effect,

25
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:30.804
right?

26
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.900
So if you ever hear a tingling jangling keyboard instrument on a test,

27
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:39.510
what are you going to say about musical style?
What period does it come from?

28
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.430
Daniel Baroque.
Okay,
so that's a good key.

29
00:01:44.431 --> 00:01:48.060
It's one of the fingerprints for a baroque music,

30
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.670
but young Mozart here about 1770 to 1780.

31
00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:54.500
He be key came to prefer,
uh,
the,

32
00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:59.501
the piano because what was the one limitation or a central limitation of the

33
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:03.840
Harpsichord?
What,
what was the problem and the essence with the Harpsichord.

34
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.640
A Nice and loud,
Kristin,
isn't it?
I can hardly see back there.
Kristen.

35
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:13.620
Nice and loud.
No dynamics.
Okay.
Basically you get one dynamic level.
Yeah.

36
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:16.650
You can throw some levers and maybe bring some more string strings in,

37
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:20.490
but it's cumbersome.
You can't shade or a scale,
you can't,

38
00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:23.700
we reach for a climax.
It's not only dynamics,
it's shading.

39
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.770
That's also very important there.

40
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.030
So people began to switch over to this thing called the piano forte.

41
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:32.400
Originally it was all one word,
piano,
Forte,

42
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.510
the loud soft or the soft loud piano forte,

43
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.990
so that there could be gradations of,
of sound.

44
00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:44.910
And this was an instrument invented in Florence around 1700.

45
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.990
Actually,
we know the name of the person that did it.
Bartolomeo Krista foray.

46
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.720
I didn't put that up on the board.
Uh,
but uh,

47
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:55.740
that's what happened in Florence around 1700 and it took it off 50 years or so

48
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.950
before this to kind of catch on this invention to catch on and gradually replace

49
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.170
the Harpsichord.
But notice that when we went and when we have our first pianos,

50
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.230
that they look virtually identical to the Harpsichord.

51
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.170
Here is a Harpsichord from our collection.
Here is a piano for,

52
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.900
of the storage.
That Mozart would have played about 1770.

53
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.770
So it's not that much bigger,
right?
Go back and forth quickly.
Uh,
if you would,

54
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:25.570
Jacob.
There's the Harpsichord and there's the piano.

55
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.861
And as said,

56
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:31.861
Mozart was the first co significant composer to switch from the Harpsichord to

57
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:37.060
the piano.
Mozart,
of course,
came from the city of Salzburg,
Austria.

58
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.691
Uh,

59
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:42.691
and he was an employee is sort of disgruntled employee of the Archbishop of

60
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.100
Salzburg.
He referred to the archbishop is the arch Boobie.
Uh,

61
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.280
and Mozart is thought to be a composer who worked at the piano.

62
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.550
And indeed,
uh,
so was Joseph Haydn Mozart,

63
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.280
a contemporary and dear,
dear friend,

64
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:04.270
it's Mozart at first called Haydn Papa Haydn.
Uh,

65
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:08.830
so let's go on to two slides here.
We've got a couple to skip and here is Haydn.

66
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.730
He's composing,
thinking things through at a keyboard.

67
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.820
And here is Mozart,
uh,

68
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.980
working at a keyboard,

69
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.130
but Mozart actually didn't compose at a keyboard.
What,
why,

70
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:27.340
why these then seated at a keyboard to show that he's a musician,

71
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:32.341
you need an icon to associated through associated with when Mozart composed,

72
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:36.880
you know where he did most of his composing.
Some of it had a billiard table,

73
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.100
but most of it in bed.

74
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.000
His sister tells us that in his wife tells us that he would get up in the

75
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.130
morning,

76
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.030
maybe just stay in bed and he had this kind of desk with ink trays and sand and

77
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:46.241
stuff.

78
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:50.770
Go block the paper and he would work in bed from about seven till 10 in the

79
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:55.210
morning.
He didn't need a pin.
He heard it all,
all in his hit.
In any event,

80
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.950
1781,
Mozart has had it with the arch booby of Salzburg.
He breaks free of him.

81
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:04.951
And establishing establishes himself as a freelance musician in the city of

82
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.020
Vienna.
This was kind of a risky gambit to be a freelance musician.

83
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.250
Um,
we have to freelance musicians in our midst today,

84
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.570
Santana and Jacob.
Um,

85
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.120
how is it Centena being a freelance musician?
Busy.

86
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:27.100
What do you have to do?
Run around to different gigs,

87
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:28.000
right?
Trying to,

88
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.440
to patch together a living as best you can until you work your way up to a more

89
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.130
secure position.
Same thing I'm sure with,
with Jacob.
Well,

90
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.290
what did Mozart do when he got to Vienna?
Then?

91
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:42.670
How is he going to patch together a living?
He did it through two,
uh,
two ways.

92
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:47.590
One,
he was going to,
um,
uh,
give piano,

93
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.260
piano lessons to the aristocracy,
going to give piano lessons to the aristocracy.

94
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.980
And two,
he was going to,
uh,

95
00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.650
play the piano in public concerts,
teacher performer.

96
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.150
And as a result of this,

97
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.180
he perfected or contributed greatly to two important jewelers in the history of

98
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:10.790
music.
Those genres being the piano Sonata.

99
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.700
We've talked about this Denada usually three movements.
Uh,

100
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:18.260
those he wrote mostly for his pupils.
And then the Piano Concerto,

101
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.370
Mozart wrote 23 original piano concertos,
the piano concerto,

102
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:26.990
which he wrote principally for himself as a kind of show piece for public

103
00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:30.680
concerts.
And you will be watching in section beginning this evening,

104
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.860
a wonderful video of the performance of the Great d minor piano concerto of

105
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.153
Mozart.

106
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:43.030
Mozart's piano concertos are much more difficult than,

107
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.820
uh,
he is,
uh,
Sonatas.
Uh,

108
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.300
he intended these piano concertos for he himself,
you know,

109
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.840
for him himself,
I guess.
So for him to play,
um,

110
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:55.551
and he did.

111
00:06:55.551 --> 00:07:00.551
So interestingly enough at this public hall that was located in the casino in

112
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.390
Vienna.
Here's a picture of that casino,
which today is actually the,

113
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.270
it's this building to the right there,
the tallest one.

114
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.930
It's a big building and it had a big public space in it and that's where he

115
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:14.810
performed a,
it still exists.
That building still exists.

116
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.890
It's the ambassador hotel in downtown and the Noi mark plots there in,
um,

117
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.350
in Vienna.
Uh,
why did Mozart play in a casino?

118
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.150
I was driving down the highway the other day and a saw sign up there,

119
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.640
usher at Mohegan Sun.

120
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.270
My wife thought this might be a po play of,
you know,

121
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.680
but who is Osher raps?

122
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.110
Ours is a musician,
right?
No.

123
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:49.040
Who's usher?
Come on guys.
Uh,
okay.
Uh,

124
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.180
Fredrick.
Nice and loud please.
And R and B singer.

125
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.900
But he's playing the casinos because that's where the money is.
Okay.

126
00:07:56.901 --> 00:07:58.610
That's where the money is.
That's where the crowd is.

127
00:07:58.611 --> 00:07:59.450
That's where the money is in.

128
00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:02.810
Mozart was doing this back in the 18th century as well.

129
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.820
The other venue that he played,
I think I've got a slide of this,
Jacob.

130
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:11.480
Let's take a look at this.
Is the local court theatre,

131
00:08:11.481 --> 00:08:13.330
the board Tejada it wasn't that big.

132
00:08:13.331 --> 00:08:16.010
It was about the size of our own spring hall here.

133
00:08:16.011 --> 00:08:20.290
Morse recital hall inside of Sprague Hall,
seated about,
uh,

134
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:24.620
80,
excuse me,
800 people.
And for this,

135
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:27.800
Mozart would have to,
uh,
hire the orchestra.

136
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:31.430
He would have to compose the music,
he would have to print the tickets,

137
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:34.800
he would have to sell the tickets out of his own apartment and uh,

138
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:39.560
he would have to transport his own piano over to this whole,
um,
to,
uh,

139
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.650
uh,
provide the instrument for him to play.

140
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:47.180
Let's take a look at this piano of Mozart.
So here is a piano of Mozart.

141
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:52.010
It's a very small instrument.
As you can see.
It's compass is only five octaves,

142
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.780
f two F.
Um,
so it,
it,
uh,

143
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.830
and it has only one string per key.

144
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.410
If you go up to the modern grand and actually look at it,
you'll,

145
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.910
you hit middle c actually three strings up there,
they get struck by that hammer.

146
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.980
But in Mozart's piano,
they don't want to be one.

147
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:12.960
It was much smaller in a number of different ways.
Now,
um,

148
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.410
<v 1>yeah,</v>

149
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.820
<v 0>let's take a listen to,</v>

150
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:21.260
let's listen to a performance on Mozart's piano.

151
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.340
And I emphasize here,
this is not a replica of a piano that,

152
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.690
that Mozart of Mozart's Day,
this is Mozart's own piano.

153
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.250
After he died,
it went to his widow who gave it to,
uh,
the eldest son.

154
00:09:34.251 --> 00:09:39.251
And ultimately it came in back in to Salzburg is today in the volumes house

155
00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:43.950
there in Salzburg.
So this is the real piano.
Uh,

156
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.990
and we're going to hear a performance of the famous Sonata in C Major.

157
00:09:47.991 --> 00:09:50.630
So let's listen to a little bit of Mozart's own piano.

158
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.583
<v 2>Okay,</v>

159
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:38.680
<v 0>stop it there.</v>

160
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.020
Notice that Mozart's piano,

161
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.110
he on the PC was on the dominant there at the end of the first thing,

162
00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:47.620
you know it was,

163
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.870
that's the pitch at which Mozart's piano is tuned and probably pretty close to

164
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:56.700
what it was tuned in his own day.

165
00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:01.650
So he was writing it in the key of g,
which is here,

166
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:03.271
but it's they,

167
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:07.860
it is sounding for our ears there is that higher or lower?

168
00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:11.760
Mozart's the tuning of Mozart's instrument.
Here's what he wrote it for.

169
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.380
Here's what it is.
Sounding higher or lower.
What do you think?

170
00:11:16.381 --> 00:11:19.250
How many say higher?
Raise your right hand.
How many say lower?

171
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.880
Raise your left hand.
Interesting.
Uh,
it's actually lower.

172
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.750
Yeah,
it's down a half a step.
And that was typical.

173
00:11:27.751 --> 00:11:29.460
I think we talked about that before.

174
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.580
The tuning kind of floated around up until really the 20th century when they got

175
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.380
it sorta got fixed at age should be for 40 vibrations per second.

176
00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:40.530
So that's Mozart's own piano.
What did you think about the sound of it?

177
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.750
Any adjectives there?

178
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.960
Somebody tell me something about the sound of Mozart's piano.
Play it,

179
00:11:46.961 --> 00:11:50.310
play the beginning again or are you still there?
And that one.
Okay.

180
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.290
Give me two adjectives about this sound.

181
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.570
Someone give me a shout out.
An adjective.

182
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:15.150
Sarah Shallow.
Okay.
It doesn't have a lot of resonance.
It does not have,

183
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:19.250
it's not a big rich sound.
Um,
so the,

184
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.960
the sound that dissipates very quickly because there's not a lot of resonators

185
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:28.570
around that instrument.
So we'll take shallow.
Give me another adjective.
Uh,

186
00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.970
Roger Pungent.
Okay.
Kind of sharp.

187
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.050
There's pungens you said Punchy.
Oh,
I like that.
Even better.

188
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.090
A punchy.
Yes.
Uh,

189
00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:42.920
and I put the word up there Staccato as opposed to Legato.

190
00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.080
Mozart's piano does not lend itself to legato lines.

191
00:12:48.081 --> 00:12:51.770
These lines that are tied together.
Think of your ligature,
right?

192
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:56.640
It's all etymologically related to,
um,
uh,

193
00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:01.280
the word leg ra,
I suppose.
Uh,
so in Legato,
smooth,

194
00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:04.970
connected,
uh,
but that's not the sound that we get.
Mozart's piano.

195
00:13:04.971 --> 00:13:08.360
We get this to Carto as Roger says,
punchy sound.

196
00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.330
That's at [inaudible].
So,
uh,

197
00:13:11.331 --> 00:13:14.510
and it's because the hammers are actually made of leather,

198
00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.110
kind of hard leather rather than felt in the 19th century,

199
00:13:18.111 --> 00:13:22.100
they put felt on these hammers and it kind of smooths it out a bit.

200
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.690
It makes it less punchy.

201
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.930
So those are a couple of characteristics of Mozart's piano.

202
00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:31.100
It tends to encourage fast staccato playing.

203
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.280
All right,
1791 Mozart dies.

204
00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:41.380
Beethoven had been originally sent to Vienna to study with Mozart,

205
00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.630
but then there were family problems.
His mother died back in Bun.

206
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.920
She had to go back and kind of look after the family.
Beethoven.

207
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:54.100
Mozart was a pianist,
but unfortunately for Beethoven,
his teacher was his father.

208
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:59.110
So what unscrupulous individual who tried to pass off the rather short Beethoven

209
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.340
as being two years younger than he actually was.
Why would he want to do that?

210
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.940
Well,
oftentimes you get kids,
you know,

211
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
the cutoff in produce saw 12 and under soccer or Usta tennis and you're supposed

212
00:14:13.251 --> 00:14:15.890
to,
you can't be 16 before that particular date.

213
00:14:15.891 --> 00:14:19.100
And people would try to sneak over the other side of it.
Uh,
well,

214
00:14:19.101 --> 00:14:22.520
because in terms of the music of Beethoven here,

215
00:14:22.521 --> 00:14:24.890
the father wanted the sun to be the next vendor.

216
00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.190
Can't write the next child prodigy,
the next Mozart.
Why?

217
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.890
Because money was to be made in that fashion.

218
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.350
The Mozart family had certainly made enough of it that way,

219
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.630
but eventually Beethoven broke free of this tyrannical environment and bone and

220
00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.110
established himself permanently in Vienna.
Think about abundance.

221
00:14:42.111 --> 00:14:44.540
At the very west end of the German speaking lands,

222
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.080
Vienna is off toward the east end of the German speaking lands.

223
00:14:48.081 --> 00:14:50.630
So we went all the way to the other side of it.
But the Vienna,
of course,

224
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.590
was the capitol of the world at that particular particular point.

225
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.240
So here is what Beethoven Young Beethoven looked like when he arrived in Vienna,

226
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.770
permanently about 1797.
I forget it.
We'll,
we'll,
we'll,

227
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.770
I forgot that slide,
but it doesn't matter.
Let's look at Beethoven here.

228
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:12.560
Here's young Beethoven,
and here is middle aged Beethoven.

229
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.930
When he is writing things such as,
uh,
the,
uh,
um,

230
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.440
uh,
eighth symphony that we,
uh,
heard at the Je concert.

231
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.110
So we have Beethoven,
young,
Beethoven,
middle aged,

232
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.890
and Beethoven dead.
Okay.

233
00:15:27.891 --> 00:15:29.560
That's Beethoven's death mask.

234
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:34.400
The only reason I mentioned this is that it was drawn by Joseph Don [inaudible],

235
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:38.600
who also was the artist who painted the cover of your textbook.

236
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.770
We'll come back to come back to that just a little bit later.

237
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.610
So when Beethoven,
let's that,

238
00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:49.550
that's too ghoulish let's go back to Beethoven looking a little better there.

239
00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:50.960
I liked that better,
don't you?

240
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:56.120
So with that vision of Beethoven on the Sh on the screen,
uh,

241
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.580
let's make the point that when he arrived in Vienna,

242
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:03.680
he sort of astonished the aristocracy by the power of his play,

243
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:08.330
the aggressive nature of it,
the physicality of it,
the virtuosity of it.

244
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.140
It was much more technical than anything that,
uh,

245
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.920
that moats are had ever created on the piano.

246
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:18.350
And in part because gradually in this period,

247
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:22.670
the piano itself was getting bigger and more powerful.
So here is,

248
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:27.671
let's move on now over dead Beethoven's body here and over to this piano,

249
00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:31.220
which again comes from our own collection of musical instruments.

250
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.580
It's a current IGA piano of about,
um,

251
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:38.690
I think we know exactly 1799,
uh,
and it was made in Vienna,

252
00:16:38.691 --> 00:16:43.340
two doors down the,
down the street from where that casino was.

253
00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:47.990
That's where the current Iga shop was in,
in,
um,
in Vienna.

254
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.340
So this is the kind of instrument that Beethoven would've played when he first

255
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:56.840
arrived in,
uh,
Vienna.
Uh,
it's a little bit bigger.

256
00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:00.330
It's got a few more keys added to it.
Uh,

257
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:04.670
then in 1870 18,
17,

258
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:09.410
Beethoven,
uh,
well let me,
let's move to the next slide.

259
00:17:09.411 --> 00:17:11.450
I want to show this to you just for a moment.

260
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:16.870
This does this look like something from the early 19th century picture of

261
00:17:17.481 --> 00:17:22.280
Beethoven,
actually not,
it created in the 1920s,
not 1820s,

262
00:17:22.281 --> 00:17:23.420
but 1920s.

263
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:28.280
It's a fanciful representation of Beethoven and his musical study there with

264
00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:32.090
papers all around,
you see the ear trumpets on either side is growing death.

265
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.450
You see his bowl of coffee or porridge or whatever on the keyboard.

266
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.360
I'm interested here,
particularly in the piano,

267
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:41.660
w because w what do we have back there coming out of the piano?

268
00:17:41.661 --> 00:17:45.280
A lot of broken streams.
Okay.
Uh,

269
00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.770
and that's kind of important because when he played,
um,

270
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.720
he would frequently break strings here.

271
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.750
Let's move on to the next slide.

272
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:59.700
It's also something of a fanciful representation of Beethoven's room with the

273
00:17:59.701 --> 00:18:02.520
idea of the moonlight in the moonlight sonata behind it.

274
00:18:02.521 --> 00:18:06.420
But it's a in contains as a piano.

275
00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:11.490
I'm an illustration of a Broadwood piano.
In 1817,

276
00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:16.140
the maker Broadwood gave Beethoven a free instrument,

277
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.290
Gay Beethoven,
a free instrument.
Um,

278
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.390
why would somebody do that?
Aren't these pianos expensive?
Let's go on to,

279
00:18:23.391 --> 00:18:27.990
I think I have a shot of another,
uh,
another one.
This is not fanciful.

280
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.800
This is Beethoven's actual instrument.
Uh,

281
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:36.180
it is preserved today.
It was purchased after Beethoven's death by Franz Liszt,

282
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:40.260
the famous pianist,
and taken to ultimately to Budapest.

283
00:18:40.261 --> 00:18:42.480
And you can go into,
I did this two summers ago.

284
00:18:42.481 --> 00:18:45.960
You can go into the national museum there in,
in Budapest,

285
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:50.120
and it's actually an pest and see this particular instrument still.

286
00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.750
So it's still survived.
And as you can see,
it's getting bigger and more powerful.

287
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:56.490
But why would this maker,

288
00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.930
English maker Broadwood give Beethoven a free instrument?
These are expensive.

289
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.480
<v 4>What?
Nice and loud.</v>

290
00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:13.310
<v 0>Probably what?
Publicity.
Yeah.</v>

291
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.020
A celebrity endorsement.
Right?
Why does tiger woods drive a Buick?

292
00:19:18.021 --> 00:19:21.660
Do you think he really wants to drive a Buick.
Okay.
Uh,

293
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.340
but nonetheless from TV commercials,
he's seen driving a Buick,

294
00:19:25.341 --> 00:19:29.390
a celebrity endorsement.
And we'll be talking a little more about that.

295
00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:34.070
So this is Beethoven's Beethoven's Broadwood here.
80 18,

296
00:19:34.071 --> 00:19:37.640
17 still existing today.
Let's listen to a little bit of it.

297
00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.180
We can make recordings,
peep specialists are allowed to make recordings on.
Yeah.

298
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.670
So here is Beethoven instrument.

299
00:19:43.671 --> 00:19:46.400
Just a little bit of out of a piece of this period by Beethoven.

300
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.930
Okay.
Maybe we'll pause it there.
So do you like that sandwich?

301
00:20:38.931 --> 00:20:43.520
You like to have had that piano in your house?
Maybe.
Maybe not.

302
00:20:43.521 --> 00:20:47.620
A lot of you are shaking your heads.
It sounds slightly out of tune to me.
Um,

303
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:50.230
and I think maybe the reason is that author was Beethoven's piano.

304
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:51.910
There are two strings per note.

305
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:55.900
It's really hard to get two strings exactly in tune.
One the string.

306
00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:00.040
It's what it is.
Three strings,
you'll get the kind of a homogenization of sound,

307
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.940
two strings.
It's a bit more difficult.
I think it's the same thing with singers,

308
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.600
oddly too,
wouldn't you seen seen with two people?
Uh,

309
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.290
it's a little more difficult to tune up one or three.
It's not not an issue.

310
00:21:11.291 --> 00:21:14.800
So it does have this slightly out of tune a sound to it.
But nonetheless,

311
00:21:14.801 --> 00:21:18.030
that is Beethoven's Broadwood piano.
Uh,

312
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.940
what did Beethoven right for the piano?
Well,
32 piano sonatas,

313
00:21:21.941 --> 00:21:25.990
32 piano sonatas and five piano concertos.

314
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:29.590
Most famous of which,
uh,
and I put this on your member.

315
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:33.430
I gave you the essential Beethoven sheet a couple of weeks ago,

316
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.150
the most important of these piano concertos as they're so called emperor

317
00:21:37.151 --> 00:21:40.180
concerto.
So we have the emperor quartet by Haydn,

318
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.880
the emperor concerto by Beethoven.

319
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.140
So Beethoven wrote the five piano concertos,
32 piano sonatas,

320
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.900
and these piano sonatas,
we're not so much like Mozart's,
uh,

321
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.480
teaching pieces.
These were,
um,

322
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:58.150
virtuosic pieces for Beethoven himself to play.
Uh,

323
00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:01.180
how well did he play them while you would think that he would play them?

324
00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:03.630
Absolutely.
Superbly,
but that,
uh,
uh,

325
00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:07.240
contemporaries commented that his plane was kind of messy.

326
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.920
Here's what one of them said.
Quote,
his plane is not clean.

327
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:15.370
He has much fire,
but he pounds a bit too much.

328
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.250
He overcomes diabolical difficulties,

329
00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:22.270
but he does not do so neatly.
Maybe,
possibly,

330
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.400
why might Beethoven have trouble as a performer here in the early 18 hundreds?

331
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:34.150
That was Beethoven's issue.
Uh,
Caroline,

332
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:39.640
he was going deaf.
Sophie pounded a bit too much.
Perhaps it's understandable,

333
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.700
but here's the kind of sound perhaps.
Oh,
Lordy.
Um,

334
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.410
here's the kind of sound that,
that,
uh,
uh,

335
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.130
the comment or might have had in mind,
Beethoven pounding,

336
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.890
exaggerating a little bit.
Do you get across that that I did two points.
I guess.

337
00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:35.010
One,
what the piano could do for you,

338
00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:39.750
these extreme dynamics and to perhaps Beethoven because of his growing deafness

339
00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:43.550
was pounding a,
a bit too much,
uh,

340
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:48.620
after Beethoven piano has only continued to get larger and more powerful.

341
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.880
Let's take a look at some of these,
uh,
later.
Uh,

342
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.880
instruments we're moving on now to a graph.

343
00:23:55.881 --> 00:24:00.560
Piano graph was another maker who gave Beethoven an instrument.
Uh,
this,

344
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.690
uh,
comes,
uh,

345
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:06.850
my own shot from the collection of historical musical instruments in Vienna,

346
00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.620
a itself.
As time goes on here,

347
00:24:09.621 --> 00:24:14.621
what we find is that in order as this instrument gets bigger and we want a

348
00:24:15.951 --> 00:24:18.910
bigger sound board soundboard,

349
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:24.560
that thing underneath,
that's the main resonator.
Okay.
Uh,

350
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:29.000
we need a bigger soundboard and as this thing gets bigger and we want to put

351
00:24:29.001 --> 00:24:32.330
more tension on the strings to really pounds or they don't break them or they

352
00:24:32.331 --> 00:24:35.840
don't come loose,
we need some kind of iron support.

353
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.260
So first they started putting pieces of iron and then all the motley,

354
00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:44.360
an entire frame of bed of iron cast iron underneath that thing for that

355
00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:49.010
soundboard to resting.
Then we need the,
at the other end,

356
00:24:49.011 --> 00:24:51.050
we need a pin block.
Uh,

357
00:24:51.051 --> 00:24:55.190
and that pin block has to be very secure because that's where the pins that

358
00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:59.450
anchor the strings are going to be.
Most of the problems,
if you're,

359
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:03.590
if you think you've got a deal on the piano sometime check European block

360
00:25:03.591 --> 00:25:06.800
because you probably don't,
uh,
it probably has cracks in it.

361
00:25:06.801 --> 00:25:07.800
And then you go to tighten that.

362
00:25:07.801 --> 00:25:10.280
Things could get your instrument tune the next day,

363
00:25:10.281 --> 00:25:13.760
it's back out of tune because that pin block is not holding a,

364
00:25:13.761 --> 00:25:18.350
so you have to have a very secure pin block.
You have to have a big resonator,

365
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:22.010
and in order for that to be helped along that needed the cast iron frame

366
00:25:22.011 --> 00:25:25.430
underneath,
all of these things allow for a bigger,

367
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:30.060
more powerful instrument,
uh,
to be put into play.

368
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:34.620
So this is a graph,
as I say,
from the collection in Vienna.
Uh,
the,

369
00:25:34.621 --> 00:25:37.010
the range of the instrument is getting bigger.

370
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.170
The sound of the instrument is getting bigger.

371
00:25:39.171 --> 00:25:41.900
Let's go on to the next slide here.

372
00:25:41.901 --> 00:25:45.020
Here's young Franz Schubert about your age,

373
00:25:45.021 --> 00:25:48.320
young Franz Schubert writing the kinds of pieces that we used in the review

374
00:25:48.321 --> 00:25:51.800
section,
for example.
And here's the piano that he was playing,

375
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:56.790
also a graft instrument in the Schubert Museum there,
uh,

376
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:58.370
in,
in Vienna.

377
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.990
The graft instrument was also given not only to Schubert and to Beethoven,

378
00:26:02.991 --> 00:26:07.250
but also to Franz Liszt.
Uh,
let's take a look at this.

379
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:12.050
Uh,
um,
another graph.
Let's move on to this.

380
00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:16.130
This,
of course is what,
where have you seen this before?

381
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:21.560
Cover the textbook.
What is this?
This is a marketing tool.

382
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:28.010
Did these people that included George,
saw,
uh,

383
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:32.960
Alexander Dumas,
pair Victor Hugo Rossini,

384
00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.940
uh,
Paganini.
Did they ever come together and pose for this?
No,

385
00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:41.440
they were in completely different cities.
This is a,
this is a marketing thing.

386
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.860
I was looking at a Brooks brothers thing.
It seemed to,

387
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.700
that seemed to be shot in Princeton.
But if you look carefully,

388
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:51.270
it had all of these brown leaves on the thing and the people had been patched in

389
00:26:51.271 --> 00:26:55.260
there and,
uh,
the trees around the thing,
they're all in bloom.
I mean,
this is,

390
00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:58.620
this is a hodgepodge.
Well,
this is a hodgepodge too.
Um,

391
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:03.480
but it's kind of an interesting one because it tells us a little bit about what

392
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:07.170
the 19th century thought of Beethoven.
Let's go to this last slide here.

393
00:27:07.171 --> 00:27:10.230
So here's Franz Liszt,
the famous Franz lists playing the piano.

394
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.900
He has the historian Marida Google his,
uh,

395
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:19.200
at his knees there and a typical 19th century sublatory position for women.

396
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.940
And up at the top,
who do we have the bust of Beethoven in Olympian Height,

397
00:27:23.941 --> 00:27:28.941
sort of looking down over the proceeding blessing list and most importantly

398
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.610
blessing the graft piano.
Well,

399
00:27:32.611 --> 00:27:37.560
Liz did a play a graft,
a piano.
Um,
let's listen to,

400
00:27:37.561 --> 00:27:41.430
and we're going to have a slide here,
France list.
Let's go onto the next slide.

401
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:42.300
Oh No.

402
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:46.710
Well there's one other one other composer I should mention that's a wonderful

403
00:27:46.711 --> 00:27:50.880
composer.
I don't have time to do,
do anything really with him and in this course,

404
00:27:50.881 --> 00:27:55.710
but he's one of my favorite Frederic Chopin,
Chopin playing a PR play,

405
00:27:55.711 --> 00:28:00.360
l a piano.
And we have over at our collection of play off right?
Not his piano,

406
00:28:00.361 --> 00:28:04.890
but right from the period that he was,
he was playing a,

407
00:28:04.891 --> 00:28:09.780
and let's go on now.
It should be the portrait of,
Ah,

408
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.230
I got them out of order.
Dot.
All right,
let's go into the portrait of list here.

409
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:17.090
Portrait of list here is Franz list.
Uh,

410
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.230
and let's go back one now.

411
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.900
And here is an air rod piano.
That list played.
Uh,

412
00:28:24.901 --> 00:28:28.330
he actually,
it's actually in the collection of Buckingham Palace.
Um,

413
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:33.420
but when list went there and played for the Queen for Queen Victoria,
uh,

414
00:28:33.421 --> 00:28:36.330
he played on this particular era instrument.

415
00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:40.740
So it looks very much like a,
uh,
like a modern instrument.

416
00:28:40.741 --> 00:28:43.590
Let's hear just a little bit of lists.
Music.

417
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:48.270
You have it as a CD for track one.

418
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.480
It's a transcendental etude sort of hugely difficult technical study by Franz

419
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:55.390
Liszt.
Let's listen to just a bit of lists.
Plane.

420
00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:10.773
<v 3>Oh,</v>

421
00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.600
so this is called a study.

422
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.490
<v 0>Um,
there's some irony here.</v>

423
00:29:55.730 --> 00:30:00.590
It's called a study in order to you when you play this piece and you get better.

424
00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:05.150
Okay.
Now how good would you have to be to begin with to play this piece?

425
00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:09.920
Holy Schmoley.
I mean,
this is a really difficult,
technically,
Dan,

426
00:30:09.921 --> 00:30:12.910
have you ever played a list transcendental etude oh,
we had,

427
00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.320
or we should have gotten into playlists,
transcendental etudes,

428
00:30:15.321 --> 00:30:17.930
kind of the top of the line.
My guess is enlist day there,

429
00:30:17.931 --> 00:30:20.270
probably six or six or seven people,

430
00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:24.530
all of Europe that could actually play these studies that were designed to get

431
00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:27.440
you to be a more proficient pianists.

432
00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:32.150
You were kind of out of the game before the game even began an odd way.
Um,

433
00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:37.150
so,
um,
this is lists [inaudible] piano.
Um,

434
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:41.360
I want to show just a couple more slides and then we'll introduce our guests.
Uh,

435
00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.650
and we've seen the portrait of list.
Uh,
I was struck when,
uh,

436
00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:50.000
at the list museum in Budapest that when you walk in there and you see that list

437
00:30:50.001 --> 00:30:52.880
played in his home,
and there it is,

438
00:30:52.881 --> 00:30:56.870
it's a big instrument with two pedals down there.
Um,

439
00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:01.610
it's a Chickering instrument and you know where that instrument was made in

440
00:31:01.611 --> 00:31:06.410
Boston.
So Boston was a major in New York also here in 1862.

441
00:31:06.411 --> 00:31:11.240
1870 is major manufacturing company and they shipped one all the way to

442
00:31:11.241 --> 00:31:15.510
Budapest,
a four,
four list,
uh,
to play.
Um,

443
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:19.610
and,
uh,
find,
find piano indeed a couple more.

444
00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:23.590
And then we're going to stop.
Uh,
and of course when Liz died,

445
00:31:23.591 --> 00:31:27.440
there were particular,
not so much interested in doing a death mask of his face,

446
00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:30.800
but one of his hand because he was thought to have a very unusual sort of

447
00:31:30.801 --> 00:31:34.520
webbing between his fingers that allowed him to stretch in ways that other

448
00:31:34.521 --> 00:31:38.570
pianists couldn't.
A few more.
And then as I say,
we'll stop.

449
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.020
This is an interesting piano.
Um,
list.

450
00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:46.370
Father in law was Ricard Wagner.
You can read about all about this.

451
00:31:46.371 --> 00:31:50.660
And the textbook list fog of there in law was Rickard Wagner and Wagner,
uh,

452
00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.640
composed at the piano.
Mozart generally didn't,
but Wagner did a,

453
00:31:55.641 --> 00:32:00.641
and this is the instrument that was involved at the end portion of the composing

454
00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:05.750
of his Opera Tristan.
And we heard Tris,
parts of Tristan,
right?

455
00:32:05.751 --> 00:32:08.390
We heard that.
We heard the Lebus towed out of Tristan.

456
00:32:08.391 --> 00:32:13.250
So it may have been on this very instrument that,
that Wagner,
uh,

457
00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:18.050
composed part of that music.
Whereas this instrument today,

458
00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.300
right down the street,

459
00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.690
it's in that same collection of historical musical instruments.

460
00:32:23.691 --> 00:32:27.500
This is what we call the Wagner piano over there and Hillhouse avenue.

461
00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.130
So pop in some data,
17 Hillhouse avenue book,
the second floor,

462
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.140
and you can see all these historic instruments.

463
00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:37.490
It's the greatest collection of keyboard instruments in the entire western

464
00:32:37.491 --> 00:32:42.270
hemisphere right here.
And it's virtually unknown.
So that's Wagner is pan.

465
00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:46.040
What's of interest is to see how those lines are going straight out to the back.

466
00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:51.560
Um,
there,
there's simply braces,
helping,
helping the soundboard there,

467
00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:55.920
uh,
and the strings are running at right angles,
uh,
to,
uh,
the,

468
00:32:55.921 --> 00:32:58.100
the line of the keyboard.
Um,

469
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:03.400
but things didn't stay that way interestingly enough because as time went on,

470
00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:07.730
there was a German manufacturer.
This is actually a Bechstein.
There was a,

471
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.750
another German manufacturer,
however,
with the name of Stein vague,

472
00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:16.430
who immigrated to the United States and set up in New York City.

473
00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:21.640
And of course that shine vague became what Steinway Steinway piano manufacturers

474
00:33:22.941 --> 00:33:27.860
of New York City.
Uh,
and they instituted a couple of things,

475
00:33:27.861 --> 00:33:32.861
but most importantly they instituted this idea of cross stringing where instead

476
00:33:33.831 --> 00:33:38.270
of having the bass strings run out in a straight line,
they took them and run,

477
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.490
run them up over.
And next time you're at a grand piano,

478
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.780
maybe come up afterwards today,

479
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:44.960
look at the base strings they run up over the other strings.

480
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:49.280
What this gives is a much more homogenous kind of sound.

481
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:53.660
It's a much more homophonic instrument.
Ironically,
the Wagner piano,

482
00:33:53.661 --> 00:33:55.490
when you play it is very clear.

483
00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:59.300
You don't get this kind of wash of sounds because the,
because the strings are,

484
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:04.460
as you can see,
a little bit more separated.
And here,
this may be our last slide,

485
00:34:04.461 --> 00:34:06.110
is what we end up with at the piano,

486
00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:10.010
a sort of gilded Steinway from the gilded age.

487
00:34:10.011 --> 00:34:13.970
This is actually up in the Clark Museum,
Williamstown,
Massachusetts,
but it is,

488
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:18.080
it is a Steinway piano.
And you can see on it three pedals,

489
00:34:18.081 --> 00:34:20.420
and this is my last point.
Uh,

490
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.930
initially all the panels up into the Steinway there,

491
00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.850
you saw just two pedals underneath.

492
00:34:25.851 --> 00:34:27.950
And these are the two we're going to talk about today.

493
00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:31.100
The right most pedal is called the sustaining pedal.

494
00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.480
Play that and um,
uh,

495
00:34:35.481 --> 00:34:37.790
the sound goes away because they're our dampers.

496
00:34:37.791 --> 00:34:39.780
They're pieces of felt up on top of the string.

497
00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:41.960
If I can lift all those pieces of felt,

498
00:34:41.961 --> 00:34:44.810
those dampers just by pushing that pedal down.
And then I get

499
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:48.530
the dampers are now up.

500
00:34:48.531 --> 00:34:53.360
So we call this the sustaining pedal or the damper pedal sustaining pedal more

501
00:34:53.361 --> 00:34:57.890
often.
And the other one is the one all the way to the left.
And if you can,

502
00:34:57.891 --> 00:35:01.160
what's happening here?
Aja,
look at the keyboard here,
if you will.

503
00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:02.540
What's happening?

504
00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:05.900
Can you see what's happening to the keyboard as I push that left pedal?
Chris?

505
00:35:05.901 --> 00:35:08.660
Daniel.
Yeah,
it's wiggling.
It's going this way.

506
00:35:08.661 --> 00:35:12.470
What's happening is the groups of units of three strings are all sliding so that

507
00:35:12.471 --> 00:35:16.310
when you hit them that way,
you're now,
instead of hitting three strings,

508
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:18.080
you're hitting only two strings.

509
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:23.200
It makes the sound softer by shifting the whole keyboard and hammer mechanism.

510
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:26.870
So only two strings are engaged instead of three.

511
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:31.960
And that makes the sound a lot more quiet.
All right.
Uh,

512
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:36.280
that does it for the,
um,
uh,
the,
uh,

513
00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.920
specifics of today.
Let's introduce our guests.
So Dan,

514
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:42.360
come on up please.
Uh,

515
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:46.110
Daniel Schlosberg junior year college.

516
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:50.120
What college is a Pearson.
Daniel.
Yeah,
he's in Pearson.
Uh,

517
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:54.330
how many of you know Daniel then?
Brandford oh,
sorry.
I'm sorry.
That's right.

518
00:35:54.331 --> 00:35:57.180
I guess that was was in Branford.
Um,

519
00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:00.720
I heard a recital of him and Branford.
Um,

520
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:07.170
so Dan is a junior now.
He's a music major.
Right?

521
00:36:07.171 --> 00:36:11.430
You're a music major and double majors or anything like that or,
nope.
Okay.

522
00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:16.290
Sometimes,
you know,
Ken shows out there doing microbiology and music,

523
00:36:16.291 --> 00:36:21.180
but um,
but Dan is also a composer.
Right.
Dan does a lot of composing,

524
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:23.570
so he's really into music and the CEO.
Jude,

525
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:28.350
do you do any conducting a little,
a little bit of conducting?
Um,

526
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.740
and maybe at the end of the semester be fun when we get to modern music to have

527
00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:33.960
a do a piece by Dan bringing a piece by Dan.

528
00:36:33.961 --> 00:36:38.010
We could have him come back as guest to guest composer.
Uh,

529
00:36:38.011 --> 00:36:39.900
so how long have you been playing piano?

530
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:43.243
<v 6>Uh,</v>

531
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:48.660
<v 0>all right.
Okay.
First grade,
six,
seven,
something like that.
Um,
uh,</v>

532
00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:52.080
are your parents musical?
Not at all.

533
00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.960
<v 6>Oh,
no.</v>

534
00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:59.550
<v 0>That's kind of musical.
Right?
But they're,
so they're not professional musicians.</v>

535
00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:04.380
Um,
and,
uh,
any relatives a in music at all?

536
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:09.430
Not really.
Uh,
so,
um,
and,
and,

537
00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:14.230
and I hate to embarrass people.
This is something that fascinates me.
You are ear.

538
00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.960
Um,
I,
it's,
I always think it's,

539
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:18.820
you've got to have a really good year to be able to do what you do.

540
00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:20.690
How good is your ear?

541
00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.650
Presumably you don't have absent pill?

542
00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:27.573
<v 6>No.</v>

543
00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:37.120
<v 0>Okay.
So if we played something for you and told you what the first note is,</v>

544
00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.120
you would get the notes they're asked

545
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:44.860
<v 6>the piano.
Definitely.</v>

546
00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.470
<v 0>Oh really?
How interesting.
So you do have absolute pitch for,</v>

547
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:52.580
and I think this is true that some brains are wired for absolute pitch with

548
00:37:52.581 --> 00:37:53.720
particular instruments.

549
00:37:53.721 --> 00:37:56.390
I get pretty close on the trumpet because it was in the fourth grade.

550
00:37:56.391 --> 00:37:59.930
I had to play in a band kind of thing,
play the trumpet.
Um,

551
00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:04.400
so if at a young age you get locked into some instruments and those particular

552
00:38:04.401 --> 00:38:07.100
pitches can stick,
stick with you.
That's interesting.

553
00:38:07.101 --> 00:38:10.160
So almost absolute absolute pitch here.

554
00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.760
So that's one thing I wanted to ask you about because if you have a sense of

555
00:38:13.761 --> 00:38:18.080
pitch and if you hear,
you know,
if you know that and playing a piece,

556
00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:22.520
if I go out there,
I mean,
what happens when somebody plays a piece of music?

557
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:26.000
Lots of things are going on.
Why do I,

558
00:38:26.001 --> 00:38:31.001
Craig have memory lapses when Dan probably doesn't have memory lapses because he

559
00:38:32.361 --> 00:38:34.190
probably has a better ear.
He can remember there's more.

560
00:38:34.191 --> 00:38:36.100
He can stream it there and he knows,

561
00:38:36.101 --> 00:38:39.730
he hears that inside of his head and he knows,
oh,

562
00:38:39.731 --> 00:38:42.760
that's probably an a.
And if I want that sense,

563
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:45.100
I know to go to that particular spot,

564
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.070
I'm not sure what the sound is in my head.

565
00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:53.080
And they assured don't know quickly,
instantaneously where that thing is.

566
00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:55.300
And this stuff is going by blazingly fast.

567
00:38:55.301 --> 00:38:57.760
So your money's got to be wired for it to begin with.

568
00:38:57.761 --> 00:39:00.550
I think it's a huge benefit to have a really good ear,

569
00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:05.380
even if you are a pianist.
Uh,
another question,

570
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:09.640
do you ever get nervous when you play dead all the time?
Really?

571
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:14.140
Uh,
think about that.
Nerves and performers.

572
00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:19.300
Jacob,
do you ever get nervous when you play?
Uh,

573
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:20.830
you take drugs,
Jacob

574
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:28.030
recreationally,
pharmacologically,
um,

575
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:30.970
actually musicians,
anybody ever heard of this?

576
00:39:30.971 --> 00:39:33.520
Musicians do take drugs for this,

577
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:37.630
the Beta blockers to kind of relax them to lower their heart rate.

578
00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:41.620
French horn players.
I have friends,
professional French,
Horn player,
uh,

579
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:46.210
justice to kind of get you to settle a little bit because if you play these

580
00:39:46.211 --> 00:39:49.750
instruments and it's just a question of fraction of an incident near like this,

581
00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:50.980
my God,
a string player,

582
00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.980
it's a catastrophe and then things start going downhill.

583
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:57.000
Uh,

584
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
so these are the kinds of of mind games I think that performers have to have to

585
00:40:02.981 --> 00:40:06.640
engage.
So do you take lessons here?
Dan,

586
00:40:06.641 --> 00:40:11.230
is the school of music you studying with anybody there?
Okay.
Um,

587
00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:16.020
he is one of the,
the artists teachers over at the,
uh,
school of,

588
00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:19.780
of music.
Do you get any time to practice?
Is a busy place?

589
00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:25.490
Hardly no time,
no time to practice.
That's,
that's the great dilemma for you.

590
00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:30.370
A really good performers,
you know,
there's just no time to,
uh,
to practice.

591
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:31.301
What do you want to do?

592
00:40:31.301 --> 00:40:33.580
What do you think you want to do with this music business?

593
00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.660
[inaudible] so how are you going to connect the dots?

594
00:40:42.661 --> 00:40:47.400
How you going to get from Dan here?
Point A to Dan here 10 years from now?

595
00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:49.440
How do you plan to do that?

596
00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:52.600
<v 6>Uh,
Grad school,</v>

597
00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:55.930
<v 0>probably Grad school.
Yeah,
you got it.
For better,
for worse,</v>

598
00:40:55.931 --> 00:40:59.980
you got to get the diploma in all the certificates as I can do this.

599
00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:04.120
You don't mean may or may not make it any better,

600
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:08.950
but you sort of have to get it to get the menu may make you worse.
I don't know.

601
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:13.120
Yeah,
I sort of have to get it to get the Gig.
Uh,
okay.

602
00:41:13.121 --> 00:41:14.830
So let's talk about this.

603
00:41:14.831 --> 00:41:19.450
Talk a little bit about this Beethoven Sonata we've got here.
Um,

604
00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.970
it's an interesting,
it's an interesting piece,
uh,

605
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:30.960
because it's so short in a way.
Okay.
Uh Huh.
Okay.

606
00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.870
So 10 minutes.
Uh,
and um,
it,

607
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:38.660
when you went to the,
how many of you went to the JDE makeup concert?

608
00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:42.830
Okay.
Remember that eight symphony and,
and uh,
how,

609
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.830
how quickly that went through Sonata Allegro form.

610
00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:50.270
There was a period with Beethoven,
uh,
about 18,
10 or so.

611
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:54.530
We started writing very small things again after the fifth and sixth symphonies

612
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:58.910
and then they sort of pull back and wrote kind of almost neoclassical things.

613
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:03.530
And then at the end of his life really expanded out into the realm of the
cosmos.

614
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:08.450
So this is a kind of pulling back here.
Um,
what's hard in this piece,

615
00:42:08.451 --> 00:42:09.284
Dan?
What,
what,

616
00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:10.563
<v 6>what</v>

617
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:18.710
really have to best everything into each whips on Basal Insulin,

618
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:22.520
a broader scale,

619
00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:28.610
the phrases and the musical ideas of soap next that you really have to focus and

620
00:42:30.181 --> 00:42:32.160
make appropriate contracts quickly.

621
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:35.040
<v 0>Okay.
Um,</v>

622
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:40.300
technically is this the most difficult piece that you have ever played?
Uh,

623
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:44.800
from a sheer here?
Okay.
Yeah.
Well we get,
we have another one.

624
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.410
We have another one.
In other words,
this is not a Dazzler,

625
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:50.980
this is not a das or we've saved a bit of a Dazzler for,

626
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.620
for the end of this cause I did want to show you how well this young man plays.

627
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:58.970
Um,
so let's just listen to the Beethoven.
Uh,
then do you want to do,

628
00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:04.090
um,
I beg your pardon?
Yeah,
let's not,
let's not do it.
We're going to get,

629
00:43:04.091 --> 00:43:07.310
let the cat out of the bag here.
He's not going to repeat the exposition.

630
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.780
<v 6>That's awesome.</v>

631
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.210
<v 0>Right?
Actually,
if you look at the score,
Beethoven,</v>

632
00:43:12.211 --> 00:43:14.790
one of the development and the recap also repeated,

633
00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:18.930
but I think in order to get the next more technically demanding piece and we're

634
00:43:18.931 --> 00:43:21.420
just going,
then it's kind of have to do it just without repeats.

635
00:43:21.421 --> 00:43:22.740
I don't mean to upstage him here,

636
00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:25.740
but I'm just going to have to sort of teach as we do this.

637
00:43:25.741 --> 00:43:27.300
It can't just be a concert,

638
00:43:27.301 --> 00:43:30.060
so I'm just going to discretely point where we are in the form.

639
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:59.543
<v 3>Okay.</v>

640
00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.730
[inaudible]

641
00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:33.903
<v 2>uh,</v>

642
00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:10.120
<v 0>okay.
Wonderful piece.
Again,</v>

643
00:47:10.121 --> 00:47:13.810
Beethoven sort of pulling in just a bit there and a wonderful performance.
Um,

644
00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:17.770
I think we have time now for the second piece,

645
00:47:17.771 --> 00:47:22.720
which is by the composer Scarlatti.
Uh,
in the Baroque period.
Hendel,

646
00:47:22.721 --> 00:47:23.800
Buck Scarlatti.

647
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:28.000
We're all composing in the same period,

648
00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.950
all composing in same period.

649
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.270
A all born in 1685.
Uh,

650
00:47:34.271 --> 00:47:38.530
this piece is a sonata by Scarlatti.
It's in one movement.

651
00:47:38.531 --> 00:47:43.480
It goes by rather quickly.
Shall we take,
maybe we should skip repeats here too,

652
00:47:43.481 --> 00:47:47.360
if,
if that,
if that's okay.
So it has a binary form.

653
00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:50.050
We have an a section and then a B section,

654
00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:54.490
and then both of those binaries are going to come back again.
I'll,
I'll sort of,

655
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:56.590
no,
I won't do that.
It's just in the way,
but the,

656
00:47:56.591 --> 00:48:00.790
a section has lots of this kind of Spanish quick sound and the B section,

657
00:48:00.791 --> 00:48:04.870
you'll hear a rising sequence coming up out of the base.

658
00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:07.553
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

659
00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:37.663
<v 2>Hm.</v>

660
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:41.823
<v 1>Okay.</v>

661
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:43.503
<v 4>Hello.</v>

662
00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:52.620
<v 0>Thank you very much.
Wonderful.
Thank you.
Okay.
That's it for today.</v>

663
00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.990
See you soon.
Section.
Starting tonight.
