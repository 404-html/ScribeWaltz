1
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.600
Okay Ladies and gentlemen,
good morning.

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.620
I think things are going to work better today.
I'm optimistic about the uh,

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.910
audio equipment and about our slide material and things such as that.

4
00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:14.770
All cell phones off and we will begin,

5
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.270
don't forget section start tonight at seven o'clock and there's another set it

6
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.410
at eight o'clock and then Friday afternoon at one 30 and Monday morning you've

7
00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:25.420
got that all online for you.

8
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.300
You do your work product and you bring it to sections and handed into your ta in

9
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.240
section each time.
So,
uh,
that's the way this works.

10
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.910
I'll be sending you a global email,
uh,

11
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.950
bringing you up to date with some other things later on this afternoon.
Okay.

12
00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:46.600
So today we actually,
before I get to the,
any questions from you?

13
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:47.703
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.250
<v 0>Is there stuff,
stuff to do for section tonight?
Yes.
Uh,</v>

15
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.120
but only the stuff that was assigned,

16
00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:00.180
the listing exercises that were assigned early on,

17
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.230
it's just one nine through 11,
which you've probably had done for days now.

18
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:08.070
So you just bring that material handed in.
Others will be assigned tonight.

19
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:11.430
This is shopping period.
We're started sifting through things.

20
00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:15.990
And then we'll get rolling.
Gentlemen here.
Can I turn on my microphone?

21
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.740
Very good idea.
And matter of fact,
I think I'm,

22
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.030
I'm actually missing a microphone and it was not put on on here.

23
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.970
So what do I do with this?

24
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.963
<v 1>Okay.</v>

25
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.430
<v 0>Uh,
so I gentlemen,</v>

26
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.410
you will have to come and do this as you would like to have it done.
Uh,

27
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.230
okay.

28
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.070
<v 1>Put this on your,
on your tag.</v>

29
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.740
Let's turn to span of time.

30
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.270
<v 0>Okay,
here we go.
Sorry.
Um,</v>

31
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.080
today we're going to come to what I would call the nitty gritty of the course.

32
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.060
We're no longer having introductory material,

33
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:09.830
but we're going to jump into the question of musical notation and we're going to

34
00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:14.800
be dealing with things such at half notes,
quarter notes,
things like that.
Uh,

35
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.270
but before we do this,

36
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.470
I'd like to say a couple of words about musical notation because it sort of

37
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:25.580
affects how we deal with music,
how we treat music.

38
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.420
Seems to me that there's a very large reverberation in here.
Now,

39
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.700
is that the case?
Does it sound like it's reverberating to,
you know,

40
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.250
sounds okay to you?
Alright.
Uh,

41
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.070
musical notation.
Musical notation is a particularly Western phenomenon.

42
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.260
When you stop and think about it,
only we in the west and by West what I mean,

43
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.610
the United States and Canada and western Europe and Russia,

44
00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:51.500
parts of South America only.

45
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.500
We use musical notation and we use it principally for our,

46
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.570
uh,
high art music.
That's not to say that the Chinese don't have,
uh,

47
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.750
an esoteric form of music notation that the Indians do not have an esoteric form

48
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:06.730
of musical notation.
They do,

49
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.850
but it doesn't intersect quite as intensely as musical notation does in western

50
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.360
cultures.
Most cultures around the world,
if you stop and think about it,

51
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:18.250
don't use musical notation.

52
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.280
But we do here with our art music and that has two advantages.

53
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.960
Let's talk about the advantages first one.

54
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:30.961
It allows the composer to specify rather precisely what he or she wants to sort

55
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:37.840
of write things out in the form of musical details.

56
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.700
So as a result,

57
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.760
the creator in this western art form takes on greater importance than the

58
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:50.980
Creator in other cultures where the composers,
so to speak,

59
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.160
is more or less anonymous and perhaps synonymous with the group as a whole.

60
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.623
So again,

61
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.630
the process of notation allows the composer here to a loom larger.

62
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.330
And secondly,
this is another advantage of notation.

63
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.280
It allows us to preserve the work of art.

64
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:13.870
We can kind of freeze dry this thing and store it and then bring it back to life

65
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:18.550
more or less exactly as the composer had attended.
But this,

66
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:20.650
if you stop and think about it,
um,

67
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.740
takes the traditional balance of things and throws it out of proportion in our

68
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:30.130
art.
Music are symphonies concertos,
uh,
genres of this sort.

69
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:34.810
The performer isn't actually much less important.
He's sort of in there.

70
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:39.280
Let's think of this as architect and carpenter,
the great architect,

71
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:44.080
the thinker is the composer and the performer.
The violinists gets this piece of,

72
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.640
gets this blueprint or black print in the case of musical notation and as

73
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.670
expected simply to replicate the black print.
Well,

74
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:56.080
that's very different than what happens in other kinds of music,

75
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.200
other kinds of music.
Let's talk about pop music for a second.

76
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.030
A Jazz Rock,
hip hop blues,
that kind of thing.

77
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.150
You go over to the toads,
you see the band come out in,

78
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:11.140
the first thing they do is plunk this in front of them.
No,
that'd be ridiculous.

79
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.500
How many of you I was with walking with a student over to my office after

80
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.310
lecture the other day to get some material to them.
Uh,

81
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.160
how many of you play in a rock band or have ever played in a rock band?

82
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.030
Okay.
And number of view,
a young lady out there.

83
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.810
Did you use musical notation now?
Uh,
that,

84
00:05:29.811 --> 00:05:33.700
that'd be kind of silly,
right?
It's okay.
So how is it done?
Well,

85
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:38.200
it's all done orally and we'll talk a little bit more about that as we,

86
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.930
as we go along.
Uh,

87
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.450
so the composer and the West is very important.

88
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:45.580
More important than the composer in other cultures,

89
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:49.510
other cultures don't use this type of notation.

90
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.770
Here's a thought for you.

91
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.300
Musical notation was the first graph in western culture.

92
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.090
How could that be?
You say how that be?
Well,
if you go back to the formation of,

93
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.150
of musical notation from the ninth to the 12th centuries,

94
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.070
we see that very early on these two dimensions of music,

95
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:12.020
the two axes of music that we talked about before,
Pich,
vertically and duration,

96
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.030
horizontally are in place.

97
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.650
And we have these sort of spots in this grid.
So musical notation,

98
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:21.260
first grid pattern in western culture.

99
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.350
But it does lock us in in interesting ways that we mean you perhaps have never

100
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.023
have never,
uh,

101
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.090
considered particularly composed compared to how music is made in other

102
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:38.060
cultures.
Let's see how some music is made and,
and other cultures.

103
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:41.750
We're going to play here now as our first excerpt.

104
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.710
I'm an odd Hahn.
And,
uh,
what this is,

105
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.160
is the Islamic Call to worship,
uh,

106
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.150
which is sung across the world thousands of times every day.

107
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.340
And as we listened to this,

108
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.510
I want you to think about the vocal production here and how,

109
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.990
what's interesting or all the vocal nuances.

110
00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:05.150
So let's listen to just a bit of this please.

111
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.553
<v 2>No Fun.</v>

112
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.380
<v 3>Ah,</v>

113
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.630
<v 1>ah,</v>

114
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.800
<v 4>ah,</v>

115
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.830
<v 1>uh,</v>

116
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.380
<v 2>how are ya?</v>

117
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.700
<v 1>Ah,</v>

118
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.223
yeah.

119
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.263
<v 2>Hi y'all.</v>

120
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.030
<v 3>Ah,</v>

121
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.360
<v 4>Oh,</v>

122
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.900
<v 1>ah,</v>

123
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.440
<v 0>let's stop there.
Fascinating.
What a wonderful sound.</v>

124
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:05.000
But the beauty of it is all between what we would call the notes.

125
00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:08.180
We would specify a precise frequency here.
Another one up here.

126
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.070
But what that gentleman was singing,

127
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.740
it was all the stuff in between that made it very beautiful and there's no way

128
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.450
in God's earth that we could locate that through the western system of musical

129
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.000
notation.
Let's take another example.

130
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:23.870
We're going to go to the realm of Western jazz here.
I'm going to pick on chuck.

131
00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:27.980
Man,
Joni.
Anybody ever heard of Chuck Mangione?
Oh yeah.
Okay.

132
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:32.370
Brian or tech guy has,
he's,
he's an older fellow.
He's sort of my age.
Uh,

133
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.523
and um,

134
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:39.190
the reason I mentioned chuck man is that years ago I went to school with him.

135
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:42.350
He was a couple of classes ahead of me at the Eastman School of music.

136
00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:45.110
I was a fledgling pianist.
He was a very good trumpeter.

137
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:49.130
And deedee was winning grammys when he was in his twenties and he's been

138
00:08:49.131 --> 00:08:54.100
recording sort of esoteric and sometimes more pop jazz.
They're after now.

139
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.600
Uh,
you can go to a man,
Joanie,
chuck concert.

140
00:08:57.601 --> 00:09:00.480
He will sometimes play the Shubert theater there and you'll have two hours of

141
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:03.270
spectacular,
uh,
jazz.
Uh,

142
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:06.000
but what you won't see again is any sort of music in front of them.

143
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.170
So how do these musicians generate two hours of music with,
with no,

144
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.830
with no music in front of them?
Does this mean he doesn't read music?

145
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.520
Of course not.

146
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.030
You can't get through these conservatories like Eastman or Juilliard or Curtis

147
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.500
without being introduced to an intense regimen of musical notation.

148
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.670
But it sort of,
otherwise we'd get in the way of the music.

149
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:30.720
So let's listen to a track here,
a Sax Solo,

150
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.840
and I'm going to try to keep,

151
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:37.620
make some sense out of this because it gets more and more complex by following

152
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.800
the electric base underneath the let you listen to an old tape.

153
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:44.730
I used to go to bars and Rochester and listen to this guy and tape his stuff.

154
00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:45.330
So here's,

155
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.330
here's Chuck Mangione with his saxophonist and a saxophone sort of cadenza

156
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:53.100
almost.
It's a wild riff for saxophone.

157
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:14.743
<v 1>Okay?</v>

158
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.210
Okay.

159
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:03.170
<v 0>Gives you an idea.</v>

160
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:08.420
How in the world would you ever notate that you to produce this prescriptive

161
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.260
document that anybody else could follow was all improvisitory.

162
00:11:12.261 --> 00:11:15.290
They tried to notate it again and would take all the spirit out,

163
00:11:15.291 --> 00:11:18.650
all the heart out of the music.
Well,
how do they do that though?

164
00:11:18.651 --> 00:11:23.000
How did these performers plays such a long spans of music without any notation?

165
00:11:23.001 --> 00:11:26.240
Is it all memorized?
Well,
it's not memorize as we think.

166
00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:29.150
And you may have had music lessons along the way and your teacher and your

167
00:11:29.151 --> 00:11:32.300
mother said,
go memorize your piece.
It's not memorized like that.

168
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.400
There are certain basic patterns that they have.
They might have a,

169
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.520
let's say for that sort of music,
they've say,
all right,

170
00:11:37.521 --> 00:11:40.820
we're now going to have a 32 bars solo,
where be in the key of e flat.

171
00:11:40.821 --> 00:11:44.500
We're gonna work through a one six,
four,
five one core progression.
Uh,

172
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.670
as we'll see when we come back to it,
we'll sit on the,

173
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.720
the dominant Chord for eight beats and all I chuck will look over and everybody

174
00:11:52.161 --> 00:11:56.170
else will come back in the end of Chris's Solo.
It would be that kind of thing.

175
00:11:56.171 --> 00:12:00.550
Kind of head charge,
general plans and within that general plan,

176
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.130
a lot of freedom of expression.

177
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.060
So having said that,
having said that about musical notations,

178
00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:11.320
something about a cautionary tale about musical notation,

179
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:16.090
we should think about how it affects the way we compose music in the West and

180
00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:18.520
how we perform music in the west.

181
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:23.790
When you go to a concert of classical music and the music is playing and you

182
00:12:24.911 --> 00:12:27.220
start to talk,
what happens?

183
00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.240
Somebody will go,
right,

184
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.840
we go to these concerts and we have to be so quiet.

185
00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:41.270
Why do we have to be quiet?
That doesn't sound like much fun.

186
00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.400
Why do we have to be quiet?

187
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.940
It's because we had these performers up there that are reading this blueprint

188
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.240
and everyone is listening basically to see how accurately they can reproduce

189
00:12:52.881 --> 00:12:56.990
revivify this artistic artifact.

190
00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:01.760
So that's sort of what's going on.
But it really does affect how we behave.

191
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:05.750
Even in a concert.
No.
If you go to other cultures of,

192
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.120
and they are engaged in their own classical,

193
00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:11.990
not just popular but classical music,
Indonesian Gamelan music for example,

194
00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:16.340
the audience will be there swaying back and forth,
uh,
clapping,

195
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.360
applauding with the performance for particularly good solo.

196
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.950
The same thing with Indian sitar music,
that classical tradition,
oddly,

197
00:13:24.951 --> 00:13:28.040
it's much more like going to a jazz concert.
You know,

198
00:13:28.041 --> 00:13:29.150
where the audience is sitting.

199
00:13:29.151 --> 00:13:33.950
Maybe round tables or something like that and encouraging and interacting with

200
00:13:33.951 --> 00:13:38.060
the,
with the performers.
But again,
in those cultures,
no notation notation,

201
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.050
everybody just sits there sort of Moma fine waiting for this great work of art

202
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.890
to come back to life.
It's an interesting thing.
Uh,

203
00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.980
and isn't a sort of typical of us in the West to take something music,

204
00:13:51.321 --> 00:13:55.910
which is expression and feeling and motion and movement and a response to sound

205
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.840
and turn it in to a complex patterns,

206
00:13:59.841 --> 00:14:04.841
complex patterns that can be sort of visualized and rearranged and analyzed.

207
00:14:06.021 --> 00:14:08.630
And nowadays even digitalized,

208
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:13.870
what we've done is take this spontaneous response to the creation of sound and

209
00:14:15.381 --> 00:14:20.381
bodily movement with sound and sort of a re replaced it.

210
00:14:20.571 --> 00:14:25.010
We've replaced the ear and they'd be the heart,

211
00:14:25.011 --> 00:14:29.990
the ear,
and the body with the eye and the mind.
It's a much more visual.

212
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:34.730
It's a much more analytical type of approach to music and it has its pros and

213
00:14:34.731 --> 00:14:36.740
cons.
We get great Mahler's symphonies,

214
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.720
yet we have everybody sitting there rock still at these concerts.

215
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.510
Okay.
Having said that,

216
00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:49.220
and I guess pointing out the the advantages and disadvantages of notation,

217
00:14:49.221 --> 00:14:53.960
let's plunge in then to a discussion.
It put on the board up here.
The following,

218
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:55.700
we're going to review this.

219
00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.260
It's simply material found on page 15 of your textbook,

220
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.940
but let's review it.
We say this is a beginning course,
so we assume,
uh,

221
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.510
no previous knowledge.

222
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.020
If you've read through that material and you should have read through it by now,

223
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.310
you know that we have a value in music that's called the whole note.

224
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.510
What the whole note is,

225
00:15:14.511 --> 00:15:18.800
what all these symbols are are simply representations of duration.

226
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:23.801
So we have a symbolic language here that's going to represent the horizontal

227
00:15:23.811 --> 00:15:26.270
axis,
the axis of of duration.

228
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:31.660
And this whole node obviously can be subdivided into two half notes and each of

229
00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:33.700
the half notes into two quarter,
no teacher,

230
00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.740
the quarter notes into two eighth notes and so on.

231
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:41.770
So these are symbols telling us how long a particular frequency is to endure.

232
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.280
Similarly,
justice,

233
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:51.200
we have symbols for the presence of sound and its length.

234
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:55.910
We have symbols that represent the absence of sound.
We call those,
of course.

235
00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:00.470
What?
Rest.
Okay,
so arresting over here,
we're not making any music.

236
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:06.020
So we have the notes in their values and the,
and the rest.

237
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:10.040
Notice that they're all pretty much um,
uh,

238
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:14.660
Dupo in their divisions.
Now here's a question for you all.
Dupal divisions.

239
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.690
How do we make,
how do we get triple arrangements in music?
How do we do that?

240
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:25.340
Well,
we take our basic note and what do we do to it?
I've been,

241
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:26.990
I'm sure some of you noted that.

242
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:31.490
How can we get a half note that actually equals now three quarter notes?

243
00:16:31.491 --> 00:16:34.550
What did we do gentlemen here?
At a dot.

244
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:39.610
What does that do to this value specifically in terms of ratios,

245
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.900
it adds,
okay,

246
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:46.250
that's 50% or a half to that and that means instead of two quarter notes that we

247
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:50.870
now have three and we can do the same thing to any one of these other values

248
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:55.040
here and that's how we get our triple relationships.
Okay,

249
00:16:55.041 --> 00:16:59.690
so those are the basic note values normally with a Dupal division,

250
00:16:59.691 --> 00:17:04.640
but we can super impose triple by using a doc and the absence of sound.

251
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:10.510
Now let's talk for a moment about the idea of pulse in music and the beat in the

252
00:17:11.711 --> 00:17:14.690
music and rhythms in music.

253
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:19.220
We all know that there is this thing in music called beat and to the extent that

254
00:17:19.221 --> 00:17:21.490
popular music is more interesting and that you,

255
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.110
everybody likes it and go dance to it just because it's really foregrounding

256
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:29.570
beat and rhythm in an important way that classical music does not.

257
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.620
So I've put a,
this idea of the beat up on the board here.

258
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.940
It's really just a pulse.
It's very much likely human pulse.
This is the,

259
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:43.100
the pulse of music and music theorists ever since the late 15th century from

260
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:44.720
Kenya's Ghafoori us.

261
00:17:44.721 --> 00:17:47.780
We could go all the way back to him if said that the pulse and music is

262
00:17:47.781 --> 00:17:51.990
basically at the same tempo as the human pulse,
which comes out to be about,
oh,

263
00:17:51.991 --> 00:17:56.430
we'll say 72 beats if you will,
pulses per,
uh,

264
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.293
per minute.

265
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.400
So we have this pulse and it's just kind of out there streaming be uh,

266
00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.370
uh,
uh,
uh,

267
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.920
but we don't like undifferentiated disorganized material in the west.

268
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:15.530
Our Psyche says we've got to bring rational organization to this.

269
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:16.830
Ever think about this.

270
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:21.300
Why do we have this periodicity when you take history courses,

271
00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:25.500
why do we have the renaissance,
the baroque period,
the classical period,
uh,

272
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.830
the romantic period and so on.
We have it in music.
You have in,
in history,

273
00:18:28.831 --> 00:18:31.800
we have it in the fine arts.
Why do we have it?

274
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:37.130
It's simply a convention established after the fact that allows us to organize

275
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.870
material in ways that we can grapple with it.
The ways that we can understand it.

276
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.660
So in music,

277
00:18:45.661 --> 00:18:49.770
what has happened is that we have organized this steady stream of beats in ways

278
00:18:49.771 --> 00:18:51.000
that we can understand it.

279
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:56.280
We organize and we s we subdivide these into units of two for example,

280
00:18:56.281 --> 00:19:01.281
groups of two like this or we have an undifferentiated stream like this.

281
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:07.350
I am convinced even though I'm sure that the Toyota Motor Company didn't

282
00:19:07.351 --> 00:19:08.460
organize it this way,

283
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:13.610
I am convinced that on my automobile when I do not plug in my safety belt,

284
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.060
uh,
that there is a bell ringing.

285
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:22.130
<v 5>Ding,
Ding,
Ding,
Ding,
Ding,
Ding,
ding,
ding,</v>

286
00:19:22.131 --> 00:19:23.480
Ding Dane Dane.

287
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.540
<v 0>I don't think they were thinking of that in terms of triple meter here.</v>

288
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.440
I think they were just a succession of deans,
but I'm hearing it.

289
00:19:30.441 --> 00:19:33.230
My mind wants to hear this organization.

290
00:19:33.231 --> 00:19:36.770
So there's another organization here of units of three.

291
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:38.473
As you may know,

292
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:43.510
there's yet another organization where we could group this in units of four but

293
00:19:44.001 --> 00:19:49.001
for all intents and purposes there are a few nuances to it for is simply a

294
00:19:49.461 --> 00:19:51.230
multiplication of two.

295
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:56.530
So in our course we are only going to have two types,

296
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.760
two types of meters.

297
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.800
These organizations taking the beat and organizing it into groups is called

298
00:20:03.801 --> 00:20:06.440
super imposing meter on the music.

299
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.060
Then we want to indicate that meter to the performer.

300
00:20:11.061 --> 00:20:16.061
It's a way to tell the performer how this music is to be executed.

301
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.280
So what do we do?
Well in music,

302
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.670
the most basic symbol for the beat is the quarter note.

303
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.210
The quarter note usually carries the beat.
Okay,

304
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:31.270
so here we have a series of groups of two quarter knows we have the convention

305
00:20:33.111 --> 00:20:38.111
of music of writing this symbol indicating the beat carrying unit of four.

306
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:43.040
So I'm writing a four underneath each of these.
Then I look up here and I say,

307
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.970
well,
up in this Dupo pattern,
I have two of these quarter notes.

308
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:50.890
So I'm going to write a two out there that tells the performer that the quarter

309
00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:53.950
note is carrying the B.
Think of the,
and you see according to note,

310
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:58.270
that's a beat and that there'll be two in each of your units.

311
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:03.430
These units we call bars or measures,
and just to finish this off,

312
00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:04.180
down here,

313
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:09.180
we would have three quarter notes of course in this particular arrangement.

314
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:11.950
Okay.

315
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:17.250
Now ultimately what happens with this is that we begin to take this stream and

316
00:21:20.591 --> 00:21:25.530
organize it into different pattern.
I could go dada the dog dot.

317
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.390
Um,
something like this.

318
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.400
And we would call that a rhythm,

319
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.780
super imposing longs and shorts,
different patterns,

320
00:21:37.781 --> 00:21:42.781
patterns that oftentimes repeat the dividing up of this stream into different

321
00:21:43.841 --> 00:21:48.160
patterns.
Often repeating of longs and shorts is super imposing,

322
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.660
super imposing rhythm over top of this basic beat,

323
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.020
which is organized in terms of these meters.

324
00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.400
So there questions about that.
That seems straightforward enough.

325
00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.800
Now,
as you may know,

326
00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.620
you've probably seen some of you may have played clarinet in high school band or

327
00:22:05.621 --> 00:22:09.820
something like that.
A neither here nor there if you did or did not.
But uh,

328
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.120
you may know that there are other meters out there.

329
00:22:13.121 --> 00:22:16.900
These things called six eight.
I was thinking this morning bomb,

330
00:22:16.901 --> 00:22:20.620
bt DDP,
the bomb BP,

331
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:25.570
BP team,
the up,
up,
up,
up at the fuck did the four,
five,
six,

332
00:22:25.571 --> 00:22:27.420
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six month.

333
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.720
Well that's a beat is basically a duplo meter with a triple subdivision,

334
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.320
but we're not getting into triple subdivisions here in our course.

335
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.520
The beat is always going to be a divided to the extent that is divided.

336
00:22:39.521 --> 00:22:41.290
Always going to be divided into two.

337
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:46.320
We have only so called simple meters rather than compound meters and want to

338
00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:51.190
learn about compound meters,
go take music to 10 and become a music major.

339
00:22:51.191 --> 00:22:53.980
That's a kind of thing that they get into,
but we're not doing that here.

340
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.610
We're interested only really in the two things.
One,

341
00:22:57.611 --> 00:23:01.540
can you differentiate between Dupal and triple meter and two,

342
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:06.630
can you recognize some very basic with Mick patterns and we'll be doing some of

343
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:11.800
that today.
Questions again?
Okay.
Let's,

344
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:16.600
uh,
then proceed.
Uh,
used to have some glasses,
but that's,

345
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.380
that's okay.
Uh,
I'll just,
Oh,
here they are.
Okay.

346
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.590
Let me play some music at the piano.
This is bulldog.

347
00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:28.290
Isn't this the Yale fight song?
Who wrote this?
Anybody know?

348
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:31.660
You know,
you've probably heard it a zillion times at football games.

349
00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:36.100
It's a great,
what a wonderful,
yeah.
Well.
Yeah,
it was so lucky to have this as a,

350
00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.220
uh,
so yes,
I think I hear somebody out there,

351
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.040
Cole Porter who was Cole Porter as I van for my music here.

352
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.670
Ah,
Oui.
Have loss.
Who was Cole Porter?

353
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.490
He was a Yale graduate class of,
of 1914.

354
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:59.720
Uh,
and unfortunately I seem to have misplaced,

355
00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.000
I like and generate a little bit of it here.

356
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.593
<v 3>Oh,</v>

357
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.100
<v 0>okay.
Is it sort of trying to remember the first page of missing music diff.</v>

358
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.720
So is this an Dupo meter or triple meter?

359
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.320
What do you think and how do we find out?
Tap your foot.

360
00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:50.870
Did we find any music?

361
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:52.573
<v 3>Oh,</v>

362
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.900
<v 0>I think enlightenment.
Enlightenment from Linda.</v>

363
00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:04.643
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

364
00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:10.080
<v 0>What's the key here?
What do you listen to?
How many think it's in Dupo meter?</v>

365
00:25:10.081 --> 00:25:13.840
Raise your hand.
How many think it's in triple meter?
Okay.

366
00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.570
Almost everybody thinks it's in Dupal meter.
And that's correct.

367
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.090
And we worked through this just a little bit once before.

368
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.150
What is it that tells us that it's in Dupal meter?

369
00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.400
It's the base

370
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.440
because it's more organizing itself.
Very strongly.
DUPO patterns.

371
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:34.310
There's one other interesting thing in here.
This would be,
well,
let,
let,
let's,

372
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.340
let's think through that one in one additional way.

373
00:25:37.341 --> 00:25:41.630
And that is notice that in dupont media we have a strong beat,
right?
Strong,

374
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:46.430
strong,
we are strong,
we draw,
we draw weak in that sense.

375
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:51.110
Or if we have triple,
it would be strong,
weak,
weak,
strong,
weak,
weak.

376
00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:56.340
It would be too weak beach or to unstressed beats between each strong bid.

377
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:57.560
We could do this

378
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.540
and we'd have the waltz of the bulldog.
It'd be pretty cool to see actually.

379
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:19.640
So there I'm simply taking the Cole porter piece and throwing in an extra beat

380
00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:24.110
in each measure,
an unstressed beat in each measure.
And it works out pretty well.

381
00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:25.490
Notice this would be,

382
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:29.810
Harvard would have had a field day with this melody if he's Cole Porter had not

383
00:26:29.811 --> 00:26:32.170
done one thing.
He's,
he,

384
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:36.710
he makes this really rather snappy by the use of this kind of stuff.

385
00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:44.120
We're coming on bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom and uh,
Dun Dun.

386
00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:50.670
What's that?
A good example of syncopation.
Yeah,
it turns on the board up there.

387
00:26:50.671 --> 00:26:53.820
But you're good example of syncopation,
sort of jumping in ahead of time,

388
00:26:53.821 --> 00:26:54.730
cutting off the big,

389
00:26:54.731 --> 00:26:59.040
getting in there ahead of time and throwing off the metrical balance for a very

390
00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:03.120
short period of time.
Uh,
well,
okay,
so that's a,

391
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:07.020
that's a duplo meter piece.
And what we're trying to do here is just here,

392
00:27:07.021 --> 00:27:12.021
if we've got one strong and one weak B or one strong and too weak beats,

393
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:18.030
uh,
how do we,
how should we do this?
How are you going to do this?
Well,

394
00:27:18.031 --> 00:27:22.290
I think one thing that's very helpful is for you to start to move,

395
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.150
to move around to sway,
tap your foot.
No,
we can't do this during an exam test.

396
00:27:27.151 --> 00:27:29.840
In here it'd be a little bit annoying,
but we really have to,

397
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:33.600
we really do have to do this now.
Musicians being a bit more uptight,

398
00:27:33.601 --> 00:27:36.210
oftentimes classical musicians,
uh,

399
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:41.270
then other more spirited folks have developed this tradition of using conducting

400
00:27:42.451 --> 00:27:47.340
patterns.
Right?
So for Duplo meter,
we just go down,
up,
down,

401
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:52.170
up is maybe a little shake over to the right,
down,
up,
down,
up,
that kind of thing.

402
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:57.050
And for triple we do down,
over,
up,
down,
over,

403
00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.640
up,
down,
over,
up.
Okay.

404
00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:03.990
So I'm going to start playing in here and you are going to start conducting.

405
00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.440
You're going to listen just for a second and then you're going to move and

406
00:28:07.441 --> 00:28:09.600
you're going to move using the conducting pattern.

407
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:26.250
Okay?
Good.
Now I see some of you out there,
uh,

408
00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.610
from like this,
not really participating.

409
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:35.220
And if I can get up here and think about this,
I'm old.
I sort of think of myself,

410
00:28:35.221 --> 00:28:39.390
a white Anglo Saxon,
Protestant.
I have every reason in the world to be repressed,

411
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.233
right?

412
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:45.840
So if I could be up here making a fool of myself on a daily basis,

413
00:28:45.841 --> 00:28:48.960
you guys are much younger than I and known for outrageous behavior.

414
00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:52.400
She can certainly get in here and move in the flow and go with the bead here.

415
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.060
So here we go.
Everybody together,

416
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:56.803
<v 3>much better.</v>

417
00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:11.260
<v 0>Okay,
I'm watching.
Good.
Virtually everyone has got the down beat here.</v>

418
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.880
You're not going Yati.
Yati,
Yati.

419
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:18.660
Yati Yati so there is a sense of downbeat.

420
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.060
There is a sense of downbeat and we'll come back to that in just a moment.

421
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.670
Let's do a triple meter one.
Here we go.

422
00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:50.270
Excellent.
Very good.
Now I'm going know modulator.

423
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.240
<v 3>Go to a different key.</v>

424
00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.520
Can you conduct this?

425
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:15.570
<v 0>Okay.
There's a little confusion here,
so let's try to do together.
You Ready?</v>

426
00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.700
Your t.
T.
T.
T.
Oh,

427
00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:23.740
<v 6>okay.</v>

428
00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.150
<v 0>Okay.
Let this gentleman out here.</v>

429
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:28.600
It's actually doing it different from what I am doing and what most of you are

430
00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:32.920
doing,
but you know what?
He's doing it correctly.
We're doing it incorrectly.

431
00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:34.610
Your Tki,

432
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:40.020
<v 6>dog,
dog,
dog,
dog,
dog,</v>

433
00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.173
dog.

434
00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:46.030
<v 0>Wrong here.
We're off.</v>

435
00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:49.810
We're off because our down beats are strong.

436
00:30:49.811 --> 00:30:54.760
Pulses always have to come on the first part of the ball.
This note,
this note,

437
00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.800
the first part of the bars card,
the downbeat,

438
00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:01.360
it's the most important thing and are conducting pattern always has to have the

439
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:06.370
downbeat of the hand in sync with the strongest impulse in the music.

440
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:08.230
Then the strong,

441
00:31:08.231 --> 00:31:11.470
the downbeat in the music comes with the downward motion of the hand.

442
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:16.600
So we were getting the team,
oh,
there's the downbeat Dharma,

443
00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:21.550
but we were putting that on two one,
two,
three,
one,
two.

444
00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:25.960
But we don't want that.
We want one bomb at that point.

445
00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.630
So what do we have here?
What's happening?
Well,

446
00:31:28.631 --> 00:31:33.631
there's a little bit of music before the downbeat that's called a pickup.

447
00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.850
Okay.
So we have a little pickup di Di team.

448
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:39.310
I was thinking of a diver in the Olympics,
you know,
they go out there,

449
00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:40.121
don't put it off,

450
00:31:40.121 --> 00:31:44.590
they do these little steps just before the spring off of the board,
Dum bum,

451
00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:46.083
bum bum.

452
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.950
But town that bumping up kind of gets you really land in good and hard on that

453
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:55.070
downbeat.
So the downbeat is very important to us.
Uh,

454
00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:59.800
and we could conclude this by saying that,
uh,

455
00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:04.450
although all music has a Dell beat,
although all music has a downbeat,

456
00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:09.010
not all music starch with the Down Beach,
sometimes when listening to music,

457
00:32:09.011 --> 00:32:11.400
you have to wait,
listen,
listen for awhile.

458
00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:16.630
And your body almost will start to tell you,
tell you,
start to signal to you,

459
00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:21.370
uh,
where the downbeat is.
Is it really your body that will signal this to you?

460
00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.500
I doubt it.
It's your brain up here processing all this information.

461
00:32:26.501 --> 00:32:29.920
We talked about the auditory Cortex,
the first section section,

462
00:32:29.921 --> 00:32:34.210
and maybe there are other parts of the brains that are factoring in here as
well.

463
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:39.300
But how is it that composers send this information to let's say our auditory

464
00:32:40.251 --> 00:32:42.500
cortex here?
How did they do that?
Well,

465
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:47.501
there are four principal ways that composers signal to us the whereabouts of the

466
00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:50.420
downbeat.
Okay?
So let's review.

467
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:53.750
Let's focus on that just for a moment,

468
00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:55.023
<v 1>okay?</v>

469
00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:00.160
<v 0>Okay.
Way Number One,</v>

470
00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:03.370
way number one,
uh,

471
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:07.270
that has to do with duration.

472
00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:11.380
Duration notes are simply longer held longer.

473
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.180
That's how we have a sense of where the downbeat is.

474
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:16.023
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

475
00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:51.030
<v 0>Beautiful.
I guess it's a spiritual beautiful.
Uh,</v>

476
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:52.670
but think about that shortly.

477
00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:05.680
<v 3>All of those loans,</v>

478
00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.410
<v 0>no,
to come in on the downbeat.
So that's how,</v>

479
00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.430
that's how we start to hear that as a downbeat.

480
00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:13.600
And that's how we know to make our hand.
And go down at that point.

481
00:34:13.601 --> 00:34:17.650
So that's one way.
Another way is through accent.

482
00:34:17.651 --> 00:34:22.090
And to exemplify this,
let's turn to some classical music,
the music of Mozart.

483
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.950
So here we have Mozart's 40th symphony,
his famous g minor symphony.

484
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:30.250
Um,
and let it go ahead and start to play it just to go ahead

485
00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.300
maybe a second or two before it pops up at it.
It's going to come up.

486
00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.760
Several of you work actually conducting this.
That's great.
That's great.
Okay.

487
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:04.880
This happens to be in Dupo meter and that's fine.
I,
that's,

488
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:07.010
that wasn't the the question here,
but great.

489
00:35:07.011 --> 00:35:10.490
You're hearing that and I'm delighted.
Uh,
what Mozart has done here,

490
00:35:10.491 --> 00:35:12.980
if we could get the score up here of Mozart's music,

491
00:35:12.981 --> 00:35:15.020
we would see that he is just put a little,
uh,

492
00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:19.330
sort of Arrow over top of a wedge over top of each of the downbeat

493
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:29.870
so that the string player will really accent though.

494
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:33.350
But the string player would be accenting them anyway.
Why any,

495
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.620
any violinists in here or anybody ever played a string instrument?

496
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:41.770
What do you always told to do if you're playing a downbeat with an upbeat go,

497
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:46.290
are you in good shape?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Your teacher would not be happy with that.

498
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:49.380
You're Boeing has patterns probably backward at that point.

499
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:52.290
The string players are taught where there's Chellus going this way,

500
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:57.270
a downbeat or violas and,
and,
and violinists coming down this way,

501
00:35:57.271 --> 00:36:00.070
that the downward motion of the hand or the Polocrosse,

502
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:04.830
the strong polocrosse should come with the downbeat that's emphasizes the

503
00:36:04.831 --> 00:36:07.230
downbeat.
That's how we know the downbeat.
So,

504
00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:09.390
so far we've had duration and accent.

505
00:36:09.391 --> 00:36:13.530
Mozart is actually writing accent into this.
The third way that we,

506
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.630
that composers signal to us that we pick up almost intuitively the whereabouts

507
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:23.660
of downbeats is through patterns of accompaniment.

508
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:26.250
We'll call it range range.
Okay?

509
00:36:26.251 --> 00:36:30.970
So here's a waltz by Ricard Strauss.
Not to be confused,
uh,

510
00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.730
you know,
excuse me by Johann Strauss,

511
00:36:32.731 --> 00:36:35.100
not to be confused with Ricard Strauss that we heard last.

512
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.150
And so on.
What important.
Here's the left hand.

513
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.870
That's why we hear a triple pattern there.

514
00:36:57.871 --> 00:37:01.840
We're hearing two week beach and the strong [inaudible] is always in the lower

515
00:37:01.841 --> 00:37:06.430
position here.
So we're getting low,
middle,
middle,
middle,
middle,

516
00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:09.180
or it could be something as we had the other day and the chart,
Schakowsky,

517
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.023
piano concerto

518
00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:12.993
<v 3>no.</v>

519
00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:19.470
<v 0>But each time the downbeat seems to be coming in association with that lowest</v>

520
00:37:19.471 --> 00:37:21.710
note.
So range or position,

521
00:37:21.711 --> 00:37:26.100
if you're in the accompanying can oftentimes signal this information to us.

522
00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:30.060
Um,
and finally,
and most important,

523
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.870
these others I think have been pretty straight forward.

524
00:37:33.871 --> 00:37:37.200
These others had been pretty straight forward.
But what,
uh,

525
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:42.260
has not been straightforward is something that you might listen to many,

526
00:37:42.841 --> 00:37:46.560
many times and not be aware of.
And that is chord changes.

527
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:49.650
If you know that we have cords in music,

528
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:50.873
<v 3>oh,</v>

529
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:55.430
these building

530
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:59.330
<v 0>blocks that support and melody and they have to change for that melody to be</v>

531
00:37:59.331 --> 00:38:00.650
constant all the time.

532
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:04.820
But where they change oftentimes is on the downbeat.

533
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:08.170
Most frequently core changes come on the downbeat.

534
00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.910
So composers signaled to us in a fourth way.

535
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:14.030
The down beat by means of core to change.

536
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.590
Now we're going to play just a little bit of Pop music,
not too loud limbic.

537
00:38:17.591 --> 00:38:19.220
Cause this thing is really hyped up.

538
00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:23.870
I'm a bit of Pop music here and by playing this you might think that I think

539
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:27.590
that I'm hip or with it,
we're going to play some rock and roll.

540
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:32.950
Do I look hip or with it hopelessly out of touch with popular culture and nobody

541
00:38:34.491 --> 00:38:36.910
knows this better than I and approve this.

542
00:38:36.911 --> 00:38:40.510
I've chosen a piece because there's a little story with it.
Uh,
I,

543
00:38:40.511 --> 00:38:44.320
I like this piece because it does something and I've used it in previous years

544
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:48.680
and I put it on and I would announce a,
I'm now going to play out of the dark.

545
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:53.390
It's an album called document,
bike rim and put it on and,

546
00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:56.970
and ram this fine with me.
That's what it says.
Rim.
Uh,

547
00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:01.030
we put dog about two years after I was doing this,
a student came up and said,

548
00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.890
oh professor,
right?
It's really not realm.
Oh sorry.
Okay.
So that's,

549
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:10.090
that's how distant I am from all of this.
But let's listen to a little this.

550
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:15.040
It's in a straight forward for rock really comes forth,
not so much in twos,

551
00:39:15.041 --> 00:39:15.880
but in four it's a,

552
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:20.020
so we'll call this a four four and you can kind of beat a four pattern two,

553
00:39:20.021 --> 00:39:22.000
what are you going to be?
The two patterns,
it doesn't really matter.

554
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.120
But notice that your,
whenever the courts are changing,

555
00:39:25.121 --> 00:39:26.890
they're changing on downbeat.

556
00:39:26.891 --> 00:39:29.140
So let's hear a little bit of this and then we'll stop.

557
00:39:29.141 --> 00:39:32.440
So they don't sue us for copyright infringement when we'll go somewhere else and

558
00:39:32.441 --> 00:39:33.274
take another chunk.

559
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:38.463
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

560
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:49.580
<v 7>it's strange going on.</v>

561
00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.130
Hey.

562
00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.393
<v 3>Okay.</v>

563
00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.820
<v 0>So that's all they're doing.
They're,</v>

564
00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:09.300
they're just taking every time they're changing.
You know what?

565
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:12.130
Every time I say change and eventually you'd be hearing you'd to be saying

566
00:40:12.131 --> 00:40:16.090
change to every time that changing your hand is going down,

567
00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:21.040
your hand is going down.
So core changes,
maybe the most powerful,

568
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:22.053
powerful,
oh,

569
00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:27.220
all of these aspects of where the down beat is.

570
00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:30.340
Um,
okay.

571
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:34.000
I had intended to give you just a little bit of a rhythmic quiz,

572
00:40:34.001 --> 00:40:35.710
but let's just do one of these things.

573
00:40:35.711 --> 00:40:36.940
Here's something else we have to do in here.

574
00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:40.880
We have to hear a rhythm and recognize it.
So we have a,

575
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:44.330
a series of rhythms on the board up there.
Uh,

576
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:48.280
you can choose the rhythm for excerpt one.

577
00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:51.190
You can choose rhythm a,
which is,

578
00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.240
<v 8>uh,
Duh,
Duh,
Duh Duh Duh.</v>

579
00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:57.240
<v 0>Or You could choose rhythm be</v>

580
00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:01.410
<v 8>dot.
Duh,
Duh,
Duh,
Duh,
Duh,
Duh.</v>

581
00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:03.990
<v 0>So I'm about to play a piece.
It's by Chopin.</v>

582
00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:08.490
Which rhythm is in play here?

583
00:41:08.491 --> 00:41:11.670
Which rhythm of my play?
Is it a or is it B?

584
00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:31.800
<v 3>So</v>

585
00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:36.470
<v 0>what do you think?
How many think a,
how you think B?
Okay,
so,
uh,
that's,</v>

586
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:40.280
that's uh,
um,
not too challenging.
We'll be doing some of that.

587
00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:44.420
Then she'll bend is sitting here and he modulating changes.
Key.

588
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.500
What about this is it,
this is a number two.
Is it a or B?

589
00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.280
Lovely about it by Chopin.

590
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:25.220
How long did it take all Chopin to think that up,
do you suppose?
Two seconds.

591
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:27.710
Three seconds of white hot inspiration.

592
00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:33.070
I'm 64 years old and I haven't had one second of genius in my entire life.

593
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:38.870
This is really depressing.
It's discouraging.
I soldier on,

594
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:42.770
but it hasn't come to you are younger and I'm sure that your moment of genius is

595
00:42:42.771 --> 00:42:46.250
out there.
It's really the,
the,
the difference between,
uh,

596
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:51.130
perseverance in my case and genius,
pure,
unadulterated genius.

597
00:42:51.131 --> 00:42:56.030
In the case of up,
what a beautiful melody.
In any event,
the answer is what?
Uh,
a,

598
00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.610
uh,
for two.
Is it a or B?

599
00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:00.263
<v 1>Okay.</v>

600
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:09.100
What do you think,
eh?
Yeah,
so that's his rhythm.
Eight.
Yeah.

601
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.230
<v 0>All right.
We're going to end with one final exercise.
It's a fun piece.</v>

602
00:43:13.231 --> 00:43:16.470
I think it's fun to do.
It's a piece by Maurice Ravel.

603
00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:20.790
Hold Balero.
It's a unique piece reveal.

604
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:25.350
Maurice Ravel was a French composer writing in the early 20th century.

605
00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:30.390
It's a unique piece because what he does is take some very basic patterns and

606
00:43:30.391 --> 00:43:35.391
simply repeats them over and over and over again for about 14 and a half

607
00:43:35.881 --> 00:43:40.650
minutes,
depending upon the tempo that the conductor is taking the museum.

608
00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:43.500
So let's listen to a little bit of this music.

609
00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:48.570
And I want you maybe as a group to tap with your foot,
your hand,

610
00:43:48.571 --> 00:43:52.080
whatever.
Just the beat as you here,
you don't have to pay any attention to this.

611
00:43:52.081 --> 00:43:55.320
We'll come to this,
um,
in,
in just a moment,

612
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.550
but just tap it will all maybe eventually altogether the beat.
Here we go.

613
00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:40.301
I am.

614
00:44:40.301 --> 00:44:43.950
Most of you are not tapping so everybody start tapping where you think it is.

615
00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:51.920
Okay,
good.
All right,
let's just pause it right there.

616
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:55.520
Let's just pause it right there.
Gentlemen,
out here in the orange shirt,

617
00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.020
I'm going to have you be a conductor.

618
00:44:57.021 --> 00:45:01.310
You are doing really well and you were conducting correctly early morning.
Um,

619
00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:04.460
so good.
Here's what we got.
We got most people don't,

620
00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:08.590
<v 9>bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
bom.</v>

621
00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:13.120
Some people are going that,
that,
that,
that,
that,
that,
that,
that,
that.

622
00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:15.020
Um,

623
00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.720
<v 0>and in this course we would know how your,</v>

624
00:45:17.721 --> 00:45:20.870
whether you're hearing dupler triple based on some other information.

625
00:45:20.871 --> 00:45:23.740
So don't worry about if you're doing good,
going down that.
Got that.

626
00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.150
That's a little bit fast for B.
What you're doing.

627
00:45:26.151 --> 00:45:29.390
There's actually subdividing the beat into two,
but don't worry about that.

628
00:45:29.391 --> 00:45:32.660
That's fine.
You're,
you're doing eighth notes.
The rest of us are doing.

629
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:37.880
Other people are doing quarter notes.
Okay,
so the beat is Dun Dun,
Dun,
Dun.

630
00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:42.770
Done.
Done.
Now what music have we been hearing here?
Uh,
Santana.

631
00:45:42.771 --> 00:45:46.520
Where are you?
Okay,
come on up here.
Take a look at this.
Linda,

632
00:45:46.521 --> 00:45:48.320
come on over here and take a look at this.

633
00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:51.980
We should have rehearsed this in advance.
We did not do this.

634
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:55.340
These are two ladies that are very experienced singers.

635
00:45:55.341 --> 00:45:57.800
I want you to just stand right up here,
please.
This,

636
00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:01.020
but they have not been forewarned about this.
Take a look at this.
Okay?

637
00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:01.973
<v 8>Yeah,</v>

638
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:03.340
<v 0>we're going to do it together.
Here we go.</v>

639
00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:06.940
You're going to sing that top melody one.
Ready Go.

640
00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:07.451
<v 8>Ooh.</v>

641
00:46:07.451 --> 00:46:12.451
La La la La la La la La la La la La la La la La la La la La la La la La la.

642
00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:20.840
<v 0>Okay,
and we're just going to keep you out.
It'll be fine.
It'll be fine.</v>

643
00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.470
And we're just going to keep going in that.
Once you get to the end,

644
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:27.590
then we're going to repeat.
Okay,
here we go.

645
00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:30.150
To Sing La,

646
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:35.050

647
00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:39.260

la La,
la La.

648
00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.000
<v 0>Okay,
so you're going to keep going over it over and over like that.</v>

649
00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:47.410
I'm going to be this thing here.
It's just going,
this is the percussion.

650
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.610
Okay.
There is no pitch too is just rhythm.

651
00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:59.850
Up here we have melody and rhythm here we have just rhythm underneath.

652
00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:01.630
We have

653
00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:05.200
<v 10>bom,
Bom,
Bom,
bom.</v>

654
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:09.510
<v 0>Well we have basically harmony harmony,
but it has a simple rhythm to it.</v>

655
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:11.730
It's a rhythm with a couple of different patterns.

656
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.710
You students are going to sing this.
Okay,
so here we go.
Everybody together.
Ready?

657
00:47:16.711 --> 00:47:17.440
Sing,

658
00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:21.970
<v 10>bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,</v>

659
00:47:21.971 --> 00:47:26.470
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,

660
00:47:26.471 --> 00:47:27.304
bom.

661
00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:30.850
<v 0>Okay.
All right,
so here going to go,
the gentleman in the orange shirt,</v>

662
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:34.180
I hate to do this to you,
but you've got 30 seconds.
Stand up.

663
00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:38.590
You were doing a great job.
Stand up and uh,

664
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:40.600
if you could,
that's fine.
You can face me.

665
00:47:40.601 --> 00:47:43.270
We'll coordinate it better this way and just conduct this in three.

666
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.890
All start conducting with you and then you take over.
Here we go,

667
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.910
one ready,
go.

668
00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.800
Okay,
great.
This is actually terrific.

669
00:48:05.801 --> 00:48:08.110
We're going to take it to Hoboken in Sheboygan.

670
00:48:08.111 --> 00:48:11.440
We're going to play across across the world with this group.
Okay.

671
00:48:11.441 --> 00:48:15.640
Thank you very much ladies.
The point here,
final point,
and then I'll let you go.

672
00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:19.810
This is a melody with rhythm.
This is pure rhythm.

673
00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:24.700
This is a harmony with a very simple rhythm here.
Who is playing the beat?

674
00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:28.960
I asked you to conduct the beat or to tap the beat.
Most people,

675
00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:32.500
everybody was tapping the beat just fine and Dandy,
but no notice up here,

676
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.970
nobody is playing the beat.
There's nobody up here.
It's playing the beat.

677
00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:41.960
The Brain perceives all of this complex information and it processes it and it

678
00:48:41.961 --> 00:48:46.180
extrapolates from it.
It extrapolates from it the beat.
But again,

679
00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.970
nobody in music except the bass drum player in the marching band.

680
00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:54.040
Nobody in music ever does anything except,
except just play the beat.
Okay,

681
00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:56.360
so I'll see you starting this evening in sections.
