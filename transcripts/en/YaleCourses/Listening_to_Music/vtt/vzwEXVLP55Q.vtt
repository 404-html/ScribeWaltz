1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.500
So good morning.
Today we're going to be talking about opera,

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.920
particularly opera of the 19th century.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.600
This is actually the third opera that we have engaged in our course.

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.610
And it occurs to me that I should ask you the names of the other two.

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.630
Can you remember any of the other operas that we looked at,

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.580
albeit briefly in this class?

7
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:27.240
That is Don Giovanni by Mozart.

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.720
That was the one we had a run at acting out particular scenes of.

9
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.710
We enjoyed it.
Uh,
and what was the other one earlier?
One that we,
um,
uh,

10
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.820
heard at least an Aria out of is it layer layer athlete,

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.900
Dido and the niece of Henry personal taking us back into the 17th century.

12
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:48.360
So we had a 17th century opera in 18th century opera.

13
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.250
Now we come to 19th century opera,
19th century opera.

14
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.670
As you may know,
if you've piqued their in chapters 26,

15
00:00:56.671 --> 00:01:00.180
27 28 of your textbook,
uh,

16
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.480
concerns two figures in particular,

17
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.250
one or rijkaard Bogner and the other Giuseppe Verdi.

18
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.830
And we've had some music of Wagner before.

19
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.810
What was the big Aria that we dealt with out of his opera?

20
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:18.810
Tristin remember that?
What was that?

21
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.870
Had An interesting name that he is again the liebers tope believers tote of

22
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:25.750
Ricard Wagner.
Um,

23
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.700
but we've had some Wagner here in our course.

24
00:01:29.701 --> 00:01:34.620
We've had no verity and I think it's,
uh,
it is probably why is there,

25
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.010
uh,
to focus on Verdi because Verdi in a way,

26
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:42.940
as much more representative of 19th century opera,
uh,

27
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.670
generally then is Wagner.

28
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.860
Wagner is a very special kind of thing that gets put on only in,

29
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.200
usually only involved in her festivals,
whereas Verdi in an odd way very,

30
00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:58.201
and Mozart and Buccini are still sort of the staples of most opera companies

31
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.440
around the world.
Uh,

32
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.510
last night I went online just to see what was happening with Italian opera Verdi

33
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:08.390
and particularly La Traviata.
Uh,

34
00:02:08.391 --> 00:02:11.850
and immediately of course the first thing you get in any kind of Google search

35
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.610
is somebody trying to sell you tickets to something.

36
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.780
But I was just interested how many opera houses around the world.

37
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:23.070
You could buy tickets for La Traviata tonight,
tomorrow night,

38
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:23.904
or the next night.

39
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.720
And it turns out that there are five opera houses in the United States playing

40
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.220
La Traviata Thursday evening,
one of them at the metropolitan opera.

41
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.180
So,
uh,
this gives you a sense that hey,
this is really popular.

42
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:39.030
This is what a opera companies are really working with.

43
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:42.900
So we're going to focus on Giuseppe Verdi here in particularly La Traviata.

44
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.030
A Verdi is an interesting case.

45
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.740
We've dealt with lots of musical prodigy such as Machar.
Uh,
in an odd way.

46
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:53.250
Very at the beginning of his career was an abject musical failure.

47
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.490
He tried to get into,

48
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:58.170
we applied for admission to the conservatory of Milan and was rejected.

49
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.490
He tried to get a job as the director of music at his,
uh,

50
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.670
small farming community of boosts Eto in northern Italy near Parma and was

51
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:13.630
turned down for that job.
So we got a job as the town band of master ultimately,

52
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.090
but he was,
uh,
he persevered.
He continued to write operas,
uh,

53
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.180
and then eventually he got one the performed at La Scala.

54
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.280
Now La Scala is the main opera house in Milan.

55
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.090
So that was successful.
And on the basis of that success,

56
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.240
then impresarios producers around the world contacted Verdi and try to convince

57
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.620
him to write operas for their theaters.
And he did,

58
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:45.940
and eventually his career spread even North America and South America.

59
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.900
So let's take a moment and look at the opera that Verdi compose.

60
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.880
You have a list over there putting the Buco on because that's the one that

61
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:59.770
launched his career really in Milan 1842.
Uh,

62
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:03.760
then we have a series there in the middle.
Rigoletto Il Trovatore,

63
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:08.480
ray La Traviata.
These are sometimes called is more domestic,
uh,

64
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.050
type of,
um,
uh,

65
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:15.830
opera subjects rather than historical ones.
Uh,

66
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.780
then we move on the to later works.
You can see Don Carlos there,

67
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:21.130
another historical one.

68
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:26.131
I Eda for the opening of the Suez Canal Otello and false staff based off of the,

69
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.590
I guess the merry wives of Windsor.

70
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.160
So you can see a couple of points here.
Uh,

71
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.230
one that very lived a long time and it was active as a creative artist for a

72
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:39.280
very long period of time.

73
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.880
Any other artists have a longer productive career than Verdi?

74
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.960
There's one painter working in the 20th century.
Think about it a minute.

75
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.790
Picasa yeah,
from about 1905 until it really,

76
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:55.440
the time of his death in the early 1970s,
I guess.
Uh,

77
00:04:55.441 --> 00:04:59.650
so he was productive in case of Verdi for five or six decades there.

78
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.800
And notice also the importance of Shakespeare here.
Lots of Shakespeare,

79
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:07.801
he's sitting Shakespeare was the dominant literary figure of the 19th century.

80
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.070
So let's turn our attention now to La Traviata.

81
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.040
It's based on a play of Alexander Dumas.
Alexon grow Dumas,

82
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.940
uh,
feasts actually pair Ackman's to be on the cover of our textbook.

83
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.541
Uh,

84
00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:27.340
the son wrote a play called the Lady of the Chameleon Chameleon is a white

85
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:32.260
flower.
Um,
and the play was simply staging,

86
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.920
uh,

87
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.920
a true life story involving this playwright Alexandre Dumas,

88
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:43.051
the younger and his love affair with a young lady named Lee do play cease.

89
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.070
Uh,
you have a picture of mafia who place these in page one,

90
00:05:49.071 --> 00:05:52.780
page three Oh two of your textbook.
Uh,

91
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.810
she was a girl from the country who by a liberal allocation of charm and an even

92
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:01.040
more generous distribution of her virtue.

93
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.220
Managed to sleep her way to the top of Parisian society at that time.

94
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.280
Let's try to think this morning.
I don't know very much about popular culture.
Um,

95
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.920
but who would be like that today?
I don't know.
I Paris Hilton,

96
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.590
people like I,
I,
I don't know,
but,
uh,
it,
it,
it,
she would,

97
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.630
it was kind of the tabloid figure of the 19th century.

98
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:28.490
So much so that I was struck.
I came upon this reasonably Charles Dickens,

99
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.090
you don't think of Dickens and Paris Hilton in the same sentence normally,

100
00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:35.450
but Charles Dickens in far away England at this time.

101
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.300
Notice that Marie do play Csun Paris when she died and she died into this

102
00:06:40.301 --> 00:06:45.301
shockingly young age of 23 when she died a dick and said the following,

103
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:51.010
you would have thought her passing was a question of a life and death or the

104
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:54.840
death of a hero such as Joan of arc.

105
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.200
So obviously again,

106
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.640
sort of cap capturing everyone's attention in any of it.

107
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:06.670
We're going to watch a lot Traviata on a video and that video will be on a

108
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.180
reserve for you.
And you've got some hints about that.

109
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:14.510
On that flip side of your sheet,
everybody got the sheet for today,

110
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:18.860
it says opera news and be watching a video.
Uh,

111
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:23.861
and you'll see there that these scene is set in Paris about 1845.

112
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:29.381
So this is core romantic time core romantic place,

113
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:34.220
Paris,
1845,
la Traviata.
What does that mean?
Well,

114
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:38.000
if you break it down in terms of its syllables,
you get the following law.

115
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.180
Feminine article,
I Guess Tra,
uh,

116
00:07:41.181 --> 00:07:46.181
on the other side of the via is a road ta is a feminine thing.

117
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.900
Uh,
so we have the woman that's,

118
00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:52.940
it's sort of fallen off the beaten path or the expected road here.

119
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:57.860
She's the woman who has gone astray.
She is a kept woman.

120
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.480
A court doesn't,
uh,
if you will,
uh,

121
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.270
sort of high class hooker here and at the moment she is,
um,

122
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.470
under the protection of one bottle.
Do Fool.

123
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:14.120
He's the bad guy in,
in our opera,
the bad guy on our video,

124
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.710
the opera opens at a party,
incomes.
Our hero,

125
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.370
his name is Alfredo.
So the love couple here,
the,

126
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.680
the love interest Alfredo Violeta Violetta is the woman going astray.

127
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.380
So Alfredo comes in and he proposes a toe.

128
00:08:32.381 --> 00:08:36.570
So we're going to listen to a little bit of our first music.
Uh,

129
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.700
this morning I will probably be breaking up this music and commenting more than

130
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:45.190
I normally would for reasons of copyrights.
Uh,

131
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.730
I needn't say more go into that,
uh,
more than that,

132
00:08:48.731 --> 00:08:51.230
but in break it up a little bit more than I normally would.

133
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.920
So let's listen to a little bit and think about here.
Think of the meter.

134
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.810
Think of the mode as we listened to this opening chorus.

135
00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.953
<v 1>Okay,</v>

136
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.830
<v 0>let's pause it here for a second.
You have the text,</v>

137
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:30.270
it's the opening scene Aria here.
Alfredo.
Um,
at the top there,

138
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:35.070
waltz and drinking song.
[inaudible] let us drink,
let us drink and so on.

139
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:39.960
Let's have a good time.
Uh,
what about the mode in the meter?
Basic question.

140
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:45.830
Well,
if it's a waltz,
has gotta be trip?
Okay.
Do we have a fast trip up?
Boom.
Pop,

141
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.520
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop,
pop.
Uh,
in the mode.

142
00:09:50.521 --> 00:09:53.340
Major,
minor,
minor,
minor.

143
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.630
Let's listen to some more.

144
00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.240
What about that cord?
Major.
Minor.
So it's all in major.

145
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.280
All in major.
So we have a happy,

146
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:22.020
joyful sort of crowd scene led by Alfredo here.
Uh,

147
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:27.120
then he steps forward to announce his two professors love to via Lotta,

148
00:10:27.761 --> 00:10:32.680
he's been admiring her from afar.
And we have the first major Aria.

149
00:10:32.681 --> 00:10:37.020
Here you have your sheet and you can see the Arrow pointing to it.
Ooh,

150
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.730
Andy Fetty j uh,

151
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.320
and let's listen to a bit of this now and the same question to you.

152
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:49.600
Uh,
the mode and,
uh,
the meter of this.

153
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.390
We're gonna listen to a little bit and then we'll talk about tempo here.

154
00:10:52.391 --> 00:10:55.510
So let's pay particular attention to tempo and meter.

155
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.870
<v 1>So let's go into,
let's go on to the next,</v>

156
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:05.680
<v 0>just a,
the next CD.
I'm sorry.
It should be CD,
uh,
three.</v>

157
00:11:05.681 --> 00:11:08.050
They're probably track too.

158
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:09.760
<v 1>Very beginning.</v>

159
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.580
<v 0>That's my fault.
Here we go.</v>

160
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.373
<v 1>Okay.</v>

161
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:26.090
<v 0>Where's the beat?
Got It.</v>

162
00:11:26.091 --> 00:11:28.760
Stand up and conduct with,
no,
don't stand up.
A nice big beat.

163
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:32.683
<v 1>Very good.</v>

164
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.963
<v 2>Okay.</v>

165
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:40.070
<v 0>All right.
So we've got an a nice slow triple meter here.</v>

166
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:44.750
Uh,
and what about the,
it's mostly major bit sort of tinge,

167
00:11:44.751 --> 00:11:48.980
a little bit with minor.
Let's watch what happens to the,
to the tempo.

168
00:11:48.981 --> 00:11:53.230
Now we're going to do them two,
three,
one,
two,
three,

169
00:11:53.231 --> 00:11:54.070
a little bit more.

170
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.540
<v 1>Oh,</v>

171
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.840
Yay.

172
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:06.080
Oh,

173
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.360
<v 0>so what happened?
Well,
obviously the tempo slowed way,
way down there,</v>

174
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.070
and we have this term for this.

175
00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:25.080
It's a part and parcel of the romantic romantic era called tempo.

176
00:12:25.081 --> 00:12:26.820
Rubato flexibility,

177
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:31.980
a more unstable tempos here.
Again,

178
00:12:31.981 --> 00:12:34.710
part of the instability in a way,

179
00:12:34.711 --> 00:12:39.711
and the mercurial switches back and forth of mood of the romantic period.

180
00:12:39.811 --> 00:12:44.610
Tempo.
Robota literally means robbed.
Rubato means robbed something.
Robbed.
Well,

181
00:12:44.611 --> 00:12:48.210
here the tempo is rob.
We're taking away,
we're showing the way down here,

182
00:12:48.211 --> 00:12:51.180
and then it will speed back up to catch catch back up.

183
00:12:51.181 --> 00:12:53.910
So it's kind of like a slinky.
The slinky had as a kid.

184
00:12:53.911 --> 00:12:58.100
He put it on the stepping go really fast and slow too over the top and showed.

185
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.840
So that's what sort of what tempo Rubato yes.

186
00:13:00.841 --> 00:13:02.700
So let's listen to a little bit more.

187
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.100
<v 1>Oh,</v>

188
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.460
<v 0>here's a shift of minor on the word mystery.</v>

189
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.990
<v 2>Oh,</v>

190
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:28.640
<v 1>oh,</v>

191
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:42.420
<v 0>more rubato.
They're slowed way down.
Okay,</v>

192
00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:43.770
let's pause it here just for a second.

193
00:13:43.771 --> 00:13:46.290
Now via led to is going to come in and I would ask you,

194
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:51.270
how does Violetta's music and differ from the music of Alfredo?

195
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.960
I'll be able to think of a couple of ways here.
Let's listen to Violetta.

196
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.120
Okay.
So we'll pause it there.

197
00:14:08.121 --> 00:14:11.330
So how has that music differ from what we've just heard?
Anybody?

198
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.840
Jerry?
It's faster.
All right.
Pick the basic.
It's faster.
Uh,

199
00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.430
what did you sense about it?
Darker or lighter?

200
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:24.530
Probably lighter.

201
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.010
It's and it's higher in range and it's a little bit flighty and it's more

202
00:14:28.011 --> 00:14:31.880
disjunct.
And this is what composers,
composers do.

203
00:14:31.881 --> 00:14:33.620
They tried to depict characters.

204
00:14:33.621 --> 00:14:36.530
So right off the bat we have this kind of live for the moment,

205
00:14:36.531 --> 00:14:38.270
character of Violetta coming here.

206
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:42.740
She doesn't want to have anything to do with this mystery of love that Alfredo

207
00:14:42.741 --> 00:14:47.300
was proposing here.
Um,
Eh,
and this is what Verdi was good.

208
00:14:47.301 --> 00:14:49.400
I didn't mean this is what Mozart was a very good at.

209
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.580
One of the things we should have noticed about lovely duet that Richard Lolly

210
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.540
and Linda saying the other day,
Laci Darren,
no,

211
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.370
was it as they were singing,

212
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.520
Mozart was writing music in which they were rests in between each entry of the,

213
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:07.760
of the singers.
And then there's that duet went on and we didn't even notice.

214
00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:11.540
But it's crucial to the effect of the,
uh,
of the duet.

215
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.740
As the duet went on,
the,

216
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.830
the length of those rest got smaller and smaller and eventually they
disappeared.

217
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:19.731
Uh,

218
00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:24.731
and what Mozart isn't telling us here is that just as physical as,

219
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.210
as sonic space is disappearing,

220
00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.740
so to the distance between these two individuals is disappearing.

221
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:37.040
They're getting closer together musically as a,

222
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.350
as they're getting closer together physically,
and then ended up with

223
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:53.100
right together in parallel thirds there so much are kind of brings this music

224
00:15:53.101 --> 00:15:56.340
altogether.
Well,
watch what happens here.
Who's going to win out?

225
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.070
Is Violetta's light music going to win out?

226
00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:03.540
Is Alfredo gonna start singing like Violetta or is Violeta going to start

227
00:16:03.541 --> 00:16:05.730
singing like Alfredo?
Let's listen a bit more.

228
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.590
<v 2>Hello,</v>

229
00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:45.270
<v 0>right there.
So who won?
Who?
God has his or her way.</v>

230
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.520
Uh,
Alfredo,
right?

231
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.440
So she came down in her range,

232
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.560
she shifted to slightly minor tinted sound and that the tempo of the music

233
00:16:58.141 --> 00:17:02.620
slowed down.
So he sort of won that contest of musical wills there.

234
00:17:02.621 --> 00:17:06.690
A musical characterizations should want to listen to a little bit more of this.

235
00:17:06.691 --> 00:17:11.070
And now we want to shift our attention over to the issue of the relationship

236
00:17:11.071 --> 00:17:13.320
between the voice and the orchestra.

237
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.780
And this is very different than what happens in Wagner.

238
00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:20.340
So we're listening here to a typical setup of Verdi and what is the relationship

239
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.640
of the voice and the orchestra?
What is the orchestra doing here?

240
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:53.310
Let's pause here.
Uh,
what's the orchestra doing?

241
00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.420
<v 1>Boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.</v>

242
00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:02.720
<v 0>Little sort of Pitsa cadeau support underneath.
Not much more.</v>

243
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:06.410
Let's listen to a bit more here and see what the orchestra is doing.

244
00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:14.600
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

245
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.433
<v 2>Whoa.</v>

246
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:21.920
<v 1>Hello.</v>

247
00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:27.660
<v 4>Oh,</v>

248
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:34.190
<v 0>what's is here?
What's the orchestra doing?
Absolutely none.</v>

249
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.100
It's disappeared completely.
What is this?
What's going on?
Well,

250
00:18:39.101 --> 00:18:43.420
this is the period of the great period of Bel Canto singing.

251
00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:45.970
Literally Bel Canto,
just made sure,
beautiful song,

252
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.800
beautiful song singing where all of the attention is focused on the voyage.

253
00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.200
That's what the audience is paying to come to here.

254
00:18:53.201 --> 00:18:57.070
They don't care if you almost get amplified guitar underneath there and play

255
00:18:57.071 --> 00:19:01.360
that,
that accompany mint.
So it's all in the voices here.
And again,

256
00:19:01.361 --> 00:19:05.920
this is very different than the Orca or cash really dominated score of Wagner.

257
00:19:05.921 --> 00:19:08.590
So let's listen to the end of this Aria voices alone.

258
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:10.940
<v 1>Oh,</v>

259
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:27.410
okay.
Oh,

260
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:33.290
oh,

261
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:41.060
<v 0>okay.
So that's the first big Aria together and needed to do it.</v>

262
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:46.100
Now we're going to want to move on here in La Travie artists to something
called,

263
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.860
uh,
uh,

264
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:51.860
Shayna and Ushana to the Italian word for Sheena of course is simply seen.

265
00:19:51.951 --> 00:19:56.630
But in opera it's a little bit more,
a little bit more complex than that.

266
00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.770
Um,
what we have is a,
um,

267
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:05.240
an amalgam of three items.
We have a recitative,
excuse me,

268
00:20:05.241 --> 00:20:09.110
an Aria followed by a recitatives followed by another Aria.

269
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.680
And that final Aria is a very fast Aria.
Indeed,

270
00:20:12.681 --> 00:20:16.550
it's something called a capital letter that we'll talk a little bit about later

271
00:20:16.551 --> 00:20:17.180
on.

272
00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:22.180
So now we're moving on our text sheet here to the second Arrow where we have an

273
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.740
aria sung by Violeta.
She saying to herself,

274
00:20:27.741 --> 00:20:29.210
she's off by herself.
Ah,

275
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:34.160
perhaps she is or he is the one that I have been waiting for.

276
00:20:34.161 --> 00:20:37.370
Maybe this is finally the great true love of my life.

277
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.050
Let's listen to a little bit of this.

278
00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.413
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

279
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:12.421
<v 0>All right,
we'll stop.</v>

280
00:21:12.421 --> 00:21:17.310
There obviously is an Aria because there's so much attention on just producing

281
00:21:17.311 --> 00:21:21.660
sound sliding all the way up to that high note there and it happens to be in a

282
00:21:21.661 --> 00:21:26.040
minor key.
Then she begins to reflect further on this and she says,
well no,

283
00:21:26.041 --> 00:21:29.280
this is not what I want to do.
Think about my situation here.

284
00:21:29.281 --> 00:21:31.620
Here I am in Paris alone and abandoned.

285
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:36.390
We're going to go on to the next to Arrow here down a little bit below.

286
00:21:36.391 --> 00:21:41.150
Fully your folio Deleo von [inaudible] questo pull that.
I don't,
uh,

287
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:46.530
poor lady,
solo abandoned,
not the inquest or popular.

288
00:21:46.531 --> 00:21:51.531
So [inaudible] g k sparrow or Pew Kfr Day.

289
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.890
Joe,
what am I going to do?
Well,
I'm going to enjoy myself.

290
00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.200
So what we have here is a to teeth,

291
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:03.480
but it's a different kind of recipe to teeth than we've had up to this point in

292
00:22:03.481 --> 00:22:05.060
our course.
Up to this point,

293
00:22:05.061 --> 00:22:08.370
we've had rested to teeth called simple recitative and this is the recipe,

294
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.920
the teeth of the 17th and 18th century,

295
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:15.780
that in which the particular proponent will be going along and trying to relate

296
00:22:15.781 --> 00:22:18.480
what has happened in that time.
And then we'd come to the end of the Shag,

297
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.170
something like that.

298
00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:25.170
It would be a company very lightly by a keyboard underneath and that that's kind

299
00:22:25.471 --> 00:22:26.790
of all the tech company.

300
00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:32.150
But now we move on to a bigger kind of accompany a or Casserly accompanied

301
00:22:32.191 --> 00:22:36.390
recitatives got this fancy Italian sounding word,

302
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.440
[inaudible] auto.
We could pronounce it that way.

303
00:22:40.441 --> 00:22:44.250
Or just say accompanied rest at the teeth.
It's the same.
It's the same,
same deal.

304
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:49.340
You get the full orchestra accompanying rather than just the keyboard.

305
00:22:49.831 --> 00:22:53.590
So let's listen to a good example of 19th century recipe to teeth,

306
00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.990
but rested to teeth that is fully accompanied.
Yep.

307
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.420
So here we are at the third,
yeah,

308
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:07.603
<v 1>era.</v>

309
00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.150
<v 0>A lot of tremolo</v>

310
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.270
<v 1>strings.</v>

311
00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.450
<v 7>What am I going to do?
Cape federal data.</v>

312
00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:31.323
<v 5>Okay,</v>

313
00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:41.470
<v 7>well this is a very joyful setting of the word joy.
[inaudible].</v>

314
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:07.690
<v 0>The third part of our Sheena begins now we have the beginning of Fast Aria.</v>

315
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.780
It's called a cab Aleta.
It's an operatic device.

316
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.960
It usually appears at the end of the scene in order to allow the protagonists to

317
00:24:17.071 --> 00:24:17.800
make,
uh,

318
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.800
a strong declaration or an emphatic statement and then enthusiastically,

319
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.000
um,
uh,
exit stage left or stage right.

320
00:24:28.001 --> 00:24:31.870
It's a kind of convention to get the protagonist off the,
off the stage.

321
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.670
Let's listen to a couple of seconds of this.

322
00:24:33.671 --> 00:24:37.360
We're going to come back to this particular Kalb.
Aleta Sim pre Libra.

323
00:24:37.361 --> 00:24:41.950
It's a famous one.
Virtually every major soprano has sung it,
um,

324
00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.970
in which at the vows to remain always free.

325
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:10.953
<v 4>Simpler,</v>

326
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.540
<v 1>stop</v>

327
00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.370
<v 0>it there.
We will come back to that.</v>

328
00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.760
But of course the electorate doesn't remain free.
She used to,

329
00:25:23.761 --> 00:25:27.590
comes to the advances of Alfredo.
The two of them live blissfully,

330
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.190
blissfully together for awhile.
Then she coral separate.

331
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.870
Ultimately they are reunited after a period of time.
Uh,

332
00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:40.760
but she is developed consumption,
tuberculosis.
This sort of age of the,

333
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.560
of the 19th century.
Uh,
and the,
uh,
she dies at the end of the opera.

334
00:25:45.561 --> 00:25:49.010
We've talked about this convention of opera before.
Remember,

335
00:25:49.011 --> 00:25:52.400
it ain't over til the fat lady sings.
That's,
that's,
uh,
uh,

336
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.580
probably a silly remark about opera in this case.

337
00:25:55.581 --> 00:26:00.581
It ain't over until the thin lady sings because on our video we have the,

338
00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:06.920
a role of Violetta Sung by Teresa Strada,
the very thin Teresa strata.

339
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:11.050
And uh,
she is a very fine actress.
Indeed.

340
00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:15.380
That's why she was chosen for this.
A video,
a video production.

341
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:21.260
So that in brief is the story of La Traviata and you've got a video of it.

342
00:26:21.261 --> 00:26:24.330
I asked you to what scenes Outta it's um,

343
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:29.950
directed by Franco Zeffirelli and it was a production he put together in the mid

344
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:34.550
1980 [inaudible] and it's still used at the met.
Again,

345
00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:38.990
if you go there Thursday night,
if you can pony up the be the expensive,

346
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.580
the big bucks for the tickets.
Boy,
are they expensive?
Um,

347
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:47.940
uh,
you can see this as Zeffirelli production,
um,

348
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.360
with different singers of course,
than those on the video.

349
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:56.220
But it's still being produced that all the sets and the costumes and all exactly

350
00:26:56.221 --> 00:27:00.150
as you will see it there in your video.
Okay.

351
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.680
So now what I want to do with the rest of the,
uh,
of the session today,

352
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:08.670
having established a little bit about Verdi and a little bit about La Traviata

353
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.680
is talk about singers' voices.
What to listen for,
uh,

354
00:27:13.681 --> 00:27:15.330
with regard to singers.

355
00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:21.050
When we went to the Saybrook Orchestra concert and we went to the Jonathan

356
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:22.650
Edwards makeup concert,

357
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:27.830
we were engaging a critical ear with regard to hearing instrumental sounds or

358
00:27:29.521 --> 00:27:32.710
Kestrel.
Sounds.
Well,
now we want to do the same thing,
uh,

359
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.950
with regard to a vocal sounds.

360
00:27:34.951 --> 00:27:37.830
So what is it that makes a good operatic singer?

361
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:43.170
Anybody in here take ever take some voice lessons?
I bet you have.

362
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:47.430
Don't be bashful now,
Kristen.
Okay.

363
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:51.690
Did you ever try singing any opera?
Okay.
Oh,
good for you.
Uh,
well,

364
00:27:51.691 --> 00:27:55.300
tell us about it.
Uh,
I don't mean to put you on the spot here.
Uh,

365
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:58.590
do you remember that?
What was any particular opera that you remember?

366
00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.073
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

367
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:07.020
<v 0>Johnny sqeaky.
Oh,
how interesting.
That has that beautiful Amil Bambino cargo,
uh,</v>

368
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:11.450
that we used as an example of melody a little bit earlier in,
in our,
um,

369
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:16.700
in our course.
Um,
so,
uh,
by Puccini of course.
Uh,

370
00:28:16.701 --> 00:28:20.960
so let's talk about this for a minute.
What constitutes a good operatic voice,

371
00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:25.360
which may be a little bit different than what constitutes a good church voice or

372
00:28:25.361 --> 00:28:29.330
a good synagogue voice,
um,
or a good mosque voice,

373
00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.850
top of him in or rent,
whatever it might happen to be.
Um,

374
00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.680
we're talking opera here.
What do you need to have a good operatic voice?

375
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:42.280
What would you guess?
Well,
nice tone,

376
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:47.110
a nice tone and the tone is kind of even from top to bottom.

377
00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:51.220
Oftentimes you run into singers that have what's called a break in their voice,

378
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:54.550
uh,
in might have one tone quality in the lower register and then you can hear it

379
00:28:54.551 --> 00:28:57.670
shift into a different tone,
quality in the upper registered.
So you would,

380
00:28:57.671 --> 00:29:01.410
we don't want that.
We want to kind of smooth quality,
uh,
from,
uh,

381
00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:05.980
beginning to end.
A richness of tone,
color,

382
00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:10.810
richness of tone,
color,
uh,
other things.

383
00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.260
Roger,
you had your hand up.
Anything you want to add to that?

384
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:21.860
Okay.
Project the voice.
That's very important.

385
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:23.810
You've got to have a powerful voice.

386
00:29:23.811 --> 00:29:26.300
You have to have a powerful voice because of your singing at the met.

387
00:29:26.301 --> 00:29:28.160
This came up in my section the other day.

388
00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.170
Are you allowed to have microphones there?

389
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.640
<v 5>Okay.</v>

390
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.290
<v 0>No,
not at the metropolitan opera.</v>

391
00:29:33.291 --> 00:29:38.291
You have to have natural voices going to fill that auditorium of (252) 062-0700

392
00:29:38.331 --> 00:29:40.880
people.
If you go to a Broadway show,

393
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:44.020
are the singers amplified by microphones there?

394
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.860
<v 9>Phantom of the opera?
Yes,</v>

395
00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.380
<v 0>they certainly are.
And we've talked about that,
how that sound.</v>

396
00:29:51.381 --> 00:29:54.890
There's picked up and immediately sent to a mixing board in the back and there's

397
00:29:54.891 --> 00:29:57.500
an electronic engineer.
They're manipulating that sound,

398
00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.400
but for opera singers,
they,
you don't get to do that.

399
00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.310
You have to have a powerful voice that's going to fill the hole and they want

400
00:30:04.311 --> 00:30:07.010
you to fill the hall.
They want to fill the hall cause they got to sell,

401
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:10.670
sell tickets.
So they want big holes.
So you have to a powerful voice.

402
00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:14.240
What about the quality of the voice?
Well,
it,
the bigger the hall,

403
00:30:14.241 --> 00:30:17.280
oftentimes you have to generate of a broader,

404
00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.313
<v 9>right?</v>

405
00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.660
<v 0>And we've talked about that with string players,
but what's the,</v>

406
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.060
the liability of a Bronto?

407
00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:27.280
<v 9>Okay,</v>

408
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.580
<v 0>well sometimes it can get so big that it becomes uncomfortable.</v>

409
00:30:30.581 --> 00:30:35.020
What is the pitch please?
So we have to have a well focused voice.

410
00:30:35.021 --> 00:30:39.130
You have to have a powerful voice or well-focused voice,
uh,
and so on.

411
00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:43.690
So let's listen to a couple of famous singers here in the course of the,

412
00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.600
of the 20th century.
Um,

413
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.930
I struck by this cause a lot of my acquaintances like this music.

414
00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:54.520
I was interested this morning that our camera man Juge said that each morning

415
00:30:54.521 --> 00:30:57.340
his mother listens to Pavarotti in both Chaley.

416
00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.760
So here is Andrea both Chaley.
Um,

417
00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:03.010
and let's listen to a little bit of his singing.

418
00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:07.480
How many of you know who this fellow boat Chaley is?
Most of you.
Okay.

419
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.010
He frequently owned television.

420
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.190
So listen a little bit of Andrea Bocelli and we'll focus,

421
00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:13.600
try to come in on his voice.

422
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.090
<v 1>Tommy,
Tommy</v>

423
00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:31.790
[inaudible].

424
00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:08.380
<v 9>But before I get in trouble.
Um,
what do you think of that voice?</v>

425
00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:11.470
What are you think of that sound?
Would you buy that?

426
00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:13.690
Is that opera?

427
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.810
<v 0>Well it's a little bit,
it's kind of an operating voice.
Actually.</v>

428
00:32:18.811 --> 00:32:22.570
He studied with Pavarotti.
He studied with Pavarotti.
Is it as good as papa?
Right.

429
00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.980
His voice.
I,
we don't have all morning to focus on this.
No,

430
00:32:25.981 --> 00:32:28.830
it's not as good as papa brought his voice.
He goes in the upper register.

431
00:32:28.831 --> 00:32:31.200
You can't hold the notes for as long.
It's more pinched.

432
00:32:31.201 --> 00:32:35.250
You feel that he's uncomfortable there in terms of the style of this music,

433
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:40.010
is that,
why is this not,
and this is something,
what makes this not a real opera?

434
00:32:40.011 --> 00:32:42.110
Aria here are different than an opera Aria.

435
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:47.350
Right at the beginning of June,

436
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.830
June,
June,
June.
It's much more rhythmic,
right?

437
00:32:48.831 --> 00:32:52.820
It's got a back beat to it and has a strong base component and a strong rhythmic

438
00:32:52.821 --> 00:32:57.200
component.
It's what I call pop up or op pop.
Either way.

439
00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.920
Popular opera,
popular pop bro,
whatever.
Um,

440
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:02.990
is it kind of blend between the two?

441
00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.590
So it's somewhere between opera and poppy pop music.

442
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:11.120
Let's go on now to talk about the two tenors that have dominated the 20th

443
00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:15.380
century and one of them continues to dominate in the 21st century.

444
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:20.390
Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo.
Okay.

445
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:25.370
Um,
let's start with Domingo.
Really developed as a baritone voice,

446
00:33:25.371 --> 00:33:26.420
then a second tenor,

447
00:33:26.421 --> 00:33:30.260
and then pushed himself up into the higher range to sing first tenor,

448
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.500
but not initially trained as a first Tinder.
Um,

449
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:38.960
a highly intelligent man,
a great actor,
a conductor,

450
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.120
a,
it's fascinating.

451
00:33:41.121 --> 00:33:45.230
Sometimes he will sing the matinee and then in the evening we'll go into the pit

452
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:49.490
to conduct an opera.
So of really impressive musician,

453
00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.030
but maybe not the voice of Pavarotti.

454
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.560
Let's listen to the two of them seeing the same passage.

455
00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:01.220
And we have this at the bottom of your sheet here.
Um,

456
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:06.250
it's a kappa Leta in which the hero Alfredo vows to wash away the sin that has

457
00:34:09.651 --> 00:34:13.790
been visited on his family.
Family's going to wash away this disgrace.

458
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.070
So he,
he's going to say,

459
00:34:16.071 --> 00:34:20.840
I'm going to wash this away and then he's going,
going to exit the stage.

460
00:34:20.841 --> 00:34:24.950
So let's listen to a Domingo seeing this passage.

461
00:34:24.951 --> 00:34:26.930
You have the text again at the bottom of your sheet.

462
00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:34.740
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

463
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:54.590
<v 0>okay,
no comment.
Let's go on out to listen to Luciano Pavarotti.</v>

464
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:59.120
Sing the same passage.
Turn it down.
Just a hair.

465
00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:18.830
<v 1>[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

466
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:44.110
<v 0>so what's the difference?</v>

467
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:45.910
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

468
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:49.170
<v 0>let me two things there that immediately edited.
Oh,
Roger,</v>

469
00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:53.500
you just look a stronger voice.
He has a stronger,
more powerful voice.

470
00:35:53.501 --> 00:35:57.850
I had to ask Linda to turn down the volume.
It's huge and it's rich.

471
00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:03.100
It's rich too.
Um,
anything else there?
You were talking about?

472
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:04.820
Uh,
Emily.
Is it?

473
00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:07.573
<v 1>Huh?</v>

474
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:11.360
<v 0>Yeah.
You heard at the end there?
I was starting to look at my watch just as it,</v>

475
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.740
uh,
Domingo held that note for four seconds.

476
00:36:13.741 --> 00:36:15.540
It's like a diving contest or something.

477
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.150
We're going to hold up a 10 or seven after this jump here,

478
00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.240
but Domingo held this for four seconds.

479
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:26.040
Pavarotti held it for 11 seconds.
I mean,
just hugely high note.

480
00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.600
Uh,
I think it's a high seat.
It's way up here.
I don't know.

481
00:36:30.601 --> 00:36:32.400
It was somebody would absolute pitch and tell us what,

482
00:36:32.401 --> 00:36:36.270
that was a hugely high note.
I'll let you just sat on this thing.
Powerful,

483
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:39.630
beautiful tone.
It really is.
It was amazing.

484
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.830
Now I think through the marvels of modern technology here,

485
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.350
uh,
and we may crash and burn.

486
00:36:46.351 --> 00:36:51.351
We will find out a take a look here at Pava Rati singing what might have been

487
00:36:52.321 --> 00:36:57.321
his signature Aria Nessun dorma out of Turin.

488
00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:02.280
Dot.
And you have tour in dot disgust in the exoticism chapter of your textbook.

489
00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:07.020
And the setup here as Linda queues,
this particular is that he,

490
00:37:07.021 --> 00:37:09.990
um,
uh,
Nessun dorma means no one will sleep.

491
00:37:09.991 --> 00:37:14.991
He's going to go out and find the answer to the riddle that will allow him to be

492
00:37:15.421 --> 00:37:19.800
successful in his conquest of this ice cold,

493
00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:24.840
uh,
princess that he wants to,
um,
uh,
make,
uh,

494
00:37:24.841 --> 00:37:27.340
Morris advances upon.
So what do you think?

495
00:37:27.341 --> 00:37:29.070
Do we have it queued there to the right spot?

496
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.170
So here's Luciano Pavarotti singing.
Whoops,

497
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.840
we got to go to one 55 because we get,
we don't have time to listen to all of it.

498
00:37:36.841 --> 00:37:38.790
So this is the end of Nessun.

499
00:37:38.791 --> 00:37:42.600
Dorma and here's Pavarotti was Zubin Mehta conducting the New York Phil.

500
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:47.963
<v 1>Okay.</v>

501
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:52.490
<v 0>And thanks to Linda for helping me out and getting all these things up in</v>

502
00:37:52.491 --> 00:37:54.290
bookmarks and cute and things.

503
00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:55.973
<v 1>It be slightly</v>

504
00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:57.970
<v 0>okay.
That's all right.
We'll,
we'll,
we'll have a little</v>

505
00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:32.163
<v 1>hello.</v>

506
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:36.510
Oh,

507
00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:43.293
Tom.

508
00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:01.310
<v 0>Okay.
So that's the great Luciano Pavarotti.
And he was great.
I mean,</v>

509
00:39:01.311 --> 00:39:03.290
in terms of male voices I've ever heard in,

510
00:39:03.291 --> 00:39:06.980
I listen to a bit of this going back tracking in the 20s and they never heard

511
00:39:06.981 --> 00:39:11.900
anything like this in the entire 20th century.
But a word of caution,

512
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:15.680
you can go on youtube here and you'll see Pavarotti picture coming up with the

513
00:39:15.681 --> 00:39:19.430
same,
same Aria,
maybe four or five different recordings of it.

514
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:23.420
When was Pavarotti really good?

515
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:25.340
And when did he stop being really good?

516
00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:29.540
Don't buy anything of rocky after 1980,
uh,

517
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:33.680
from 78 79 80.
That's the heyday of Pavarotti.
His recordings,

518
00:39:33.681 --> 00:39:37.850
and they're spectacular.
I mean,
nobody could touch this guy,
but they're after.

519
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.500
They really do begin to decline.

520
00:39:39.501 --> 00:39:42.110
And you could do comparative comparisons of these,

521
00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:46.040
of these various recordings over time to have to watch the decline.

522
00:39:46.041 --> 00:39:46.851
Then it's sort of sad,

523
00:39:46.851 --> 00:39:50.600
but it's the natural process of the aging of the voice and the aging of the
body.

524
00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:55.190
Um,
so now we're going to talk about the ladies.
We have a number of,

525
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:59.240
of different voice terms here,
vocal terms,
Volkl terms,

526
00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.160
applying to particular registers.

527
00:40:01.161 --> 00:40:06.161
The lowest part of the female operatic register is called the control tobe.

528
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:08.270
Uh,
and there's some of floating around,

529
00:40:08.271 --> 00:40:12.890
used to be Maria Maureen forester across the street at our school of music.
Uh,

530
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:16.310
lily [inaudible] used to sing at the metropolitan opera.
She teaches,

531
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.030
I was still teaching at the school of music.
Uh,

532
00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:22.850
I went to school with a woman named Joyce Castle Castrato,
uh,

533
00:40:22.851 --> 00:40:26.630
frequently singing with the met.
So that's the kind of low part,
the Alto,

534
00:40:26.631 --> 00:40:29.960
if you will,
of the,
of the female voice in opera.

535
00:40:29.961 --> 00:40:34.760
Then we have the mezzo soprano,
kind of half soprano Metso,
Mezzo Forte,

536
00:40:34.761 --> 00:40:38.990
half a,
that's between an alto and a soprano.
Frequent.
We,

537
00:40:38.991 --> 00:40:42.650
we've had here at Yale Frederica bunch daughter.
She's a good example of a,

538
00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.860
of a mezzo soprano sneaking up into the soprano range.

539
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:50.390
Then we have a soprano voice called the lyric soprano.

540
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:54.590
Uh,
so we're up in the high part of the female range,
the lyric soprano,

541
00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.070
lovely sound,
a smooth sound.

542
00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:02.420
We also have a soprano called a dramatic soprano.
Uh,

543
00:41:02.421 --> 00:41:06.530
and these are voices like Kiersten flight stead beer get Neilson.

544
00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:10.940
And more recently Jane Eagan,
uh,

545
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:12.230
Debra void.

546
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:17.120
These are the women that seeing Wagner and seeing Strauss where you really need

547
00:41:17.121 --> 00:41:22.121
super superhuman large voices with plenty of powerful well-focused abroad,

548
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.310
a little broad vibrato.
And then finally we have a voice,

549
00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:29.840
a range called the Coloratura,
very top part of the soprano range.

550
00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:30.920
Very high.

551
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:35.210
Ken's to be light hinged if good tends to be well focused.

552
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:39.590
What does a Coloratura sound light?
We don't have a visual here,

553
00:41:39.591 --> 00:41:44.450
but we do have the leading,
I think coloratura today.
Natalie decide,

554
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:46.720
uh,
singing just a bit of the,

555
00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:50.030
of something called the Coloratura Soprano.
Uh,

556
00:41:50.031 --> 00:41:52.940
just to give you a sense of what a coloratura sounds like.

557
00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.630
Oof that up a bit.
Funny.
We just brought up this clip this morning.

558
00:42:18.631 --> 00:42:21.750
We have a little trouble with computers.
Okay,
here she goes.
You should go.

559
00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:49.840
All right.
That's probably,
that's probably not,
you get the idea.
Hi and light.

560
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:51.670
That's what the color a tour is all about.

561
00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:57.060
Now we're going to focus on for sopranos singing the same Aria by way of

562
00:42:57.971 --> 00:43:00.970
comparison here.
Um,
and,
uh,

563
00:43:00.971 --> 00:43:05.971
the Ra in question is the part of that Shana that we were dealing with before.

564
00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:11.620
I'll say for Louie,
fully folio and ultimately separate Libra.

565
00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:15.220
We're first ApprenNet we're gonna start with is Nellie Melba?

566
00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:20.370
She was an Australian soprano and was the leading a prima Donna around the turn

567
00:43:21.971 --> 00:43:26.230
of the 20th century.
So this recording,
thanks Linda.

568
00:43:26.231 --> 00:43:31.150
We got some surface noise here.
Uh,
John,
would you get the maybe?
Oh,

569
00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:32.970
I guess one just got it.
Um,

570
00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:40.270
this particular recording was made here and our own historical sound collection

571
00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:44.980
off of,
uh,
of old vinyl.
Uh,
it goes back to 1905.

572
00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.280
So here's Nelly Melba stinging.
You said a very interesting voice.

573
00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:51.880
Tell me what you think about it.
Put two adjectives with this voice.

574
00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:56.093
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

575
00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:20.683
Okay.

576
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.230
<v 1>Uh,</v>

577
00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.490
<v 0>uh,
what did you think?</v>

578
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

579
00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:36.760
<v 0>Santana and Linda,
you're both professional singers.</v>

580
00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:40.450
What did you think of Nellie Melba here?
Your,
your head is elsewhere,

581
00:44:40.451 --> 00:44:41.410
but any thoughts?

582
00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:45.060
<v 1>I love it,
but it sounds like you're allowed to be much smaller.</v>

583
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:48.100
<v 0>Okay.
Yes,
I love it.
But it sounds like you,</v>

584
00:44:48.101 --> 00:44:49.670
you're allowed to have a much smaller voice.

585
00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:53.030
The Wagnerian voice hadn't carried the whole world at this point.

586
00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:57.830
And we think that this is much more typical of 19th century scene,
well focused,

587
00:44:57.831 --> 00:45:02.020
right on pitch,
uh,
but lighter perhaps something closer to the Coloratura.

588
00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:05.570
Now we're going to move on for reasons of time to another video and we're going

589
00:45:05.571 --> 00:45:10.571
to hear the dominant a Prima Donna of the mid 20th century.

590
00:45:11.061 --> 00:45:15.080
And that was Maria Callas.
Anybody ever heard of Maria Callas?
Okay.

591
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.980
<v 1>All the way.
All the way in the back.</v>

592
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.680
<v 0>She was,
uh,
uh,</v>

593
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:25.410
something of a fashion statement,

594
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:30.530
a farm fatale and soprano that dominated the operatic stage in the 1950s.

595
00:45:31.951 --> 00:45:34.050
Let's listen to a bit of her singing.
Let's see if you like it.

596
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:36.103
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

597
00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:48.203
Okay.

598
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:08.803
<v 10>Hello?</v>

599
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:15.850
<v 0>Let's stop it there.
He liked that sound.
Yes or no.</v>

600
00:46:15.851 --> 00:46:17.620
How many Lichen I may don't like.

601
00:46:17.621 --> 00:46:21.730
It reminds me of one town that California recently passed her a couple of years

602
00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:22.600
ago,
passed an ordinance.

603
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:25.420
You get the vagrants out of this particular shopping center,

604
00:46:25.421 --> 00:46:27.940
they would pipe nothing but Maria callous over the,

605
00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:32.290
over the public address system.
It's a very kind of sharp penetrating voice.

606
00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.110
And the older she got,
the wider that Virbrato God.

607
00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:39.730
So some people don't find that particular that sound particularly attractive.

608
00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:42.290
Let's go on to,
uh,

609
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:45.790
not chronological order because I'm going to finish with somebody else.

610
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.560
But the raining and diva of today,
Renee Fleming from Rochester,
New York,

611
00:46:50.561 --> 00:46:51.970
her mother is a public school teacher,

612
00:46:51.971 --> 00:46:53.920
was a public school voice teacher in Rochester.

613
00:46:53.921 --> 00:46:57.190
So she's just a hometown girl from Rochester here.
Uh,

614
00:46:57.191 --> 00:47:00.880
but now she is the glamor girl,
the poster girl for all of the,

615
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:04.840
all sopranos in opera.
And I think we have a video of,

616
00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:09.490
of the famous Renee Fleming always sells out to the mid,

617
00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:13.630
uh,
singing the same kind of material.
And as we listen,

618
00:47:13.631 --> 00:47:18.070
what interests me here is her capacity to control the voice.

619
00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:18.940
Wow.

620
00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:23.200
She started fat can sit that tone out there and just spin it this way or spin it

621
00:47:23.201 --> 00:47:27.400
that way,
slow it down,
make it roll faster.
It really,

622
00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:32.010
it may not be the biggest,
it not be the,
the most,
uh,
uh,

623
00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.750
always the richest.
But boy it is.
Sure.

624
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:37.840
The most controlled of the sopranos that I have seen.

625
00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:49.403
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

626
00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:36.123
<v 7>Okay.</v>

627
00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:40.500
<v 0>And then finally we're going to hear from Oh,
question Daniel.</v>

628
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:41.783
<v 1>She's laying down.</v>

629
00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:46.030
<v 0>Uh,
I don't know how they do it.
I'd never,</v>

630
00:48:46.031 --> 00:48:49.750
I have enough trouble standing up and singing,
but I guess you know,

631
00:48:49.751 --> 00:48:51.370
you wonder about that,
how they can do that,

632
00:48:51.371 --> 00:48:55.150
how they can keep that pressure and all reclined like that.

633
00:48:55.151 --> 00:48:58.270
But they always do it.
It's not,
it was not unusual to see that.

634
00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:02.770
And we're going to end here with a couple of things.
Joan Sutherland,

635
00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.910
probably the greatest soprano of the 20th century.

636
00:49:06.911 --> 00:49:11.110
She really also reached your peak about 1980 and she frame frequently saying

637
00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:15.070
with Pavarotti and on the cds for your,
our course here,

638
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:19.660
I have chosen Pavarotti in Sutherland singing La Traviata because I get to

639
00:49:19.661 --> 00:49:24.050
choose these particular cds,
that recordings to go on our cds.
Uh,

640
00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:26.860
so here you're going to see a bit of Joan Sutherland.

641
00:49:26.861 --> 00:49:29.530
She wasn't particularly distinguishes an actress,
but boy,

642
00:49:29.531 --> 00:49:33.370
what a voice and what you're going to hear here,
and I'll play this very quickly,

643
00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:35.850
we've got a,
um,
a a line.
It's going,

644
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:36.833
<v 11>Eh,</v>

645
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.810
<v 12>okay.</v>

646
00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:48.750
<v 0>She's going to add a soprano line here that goes,</v>

647
00:49:48.751 --> 00:49:53.280
jumps up an octave higher than Verdi actually wrote it.
And if you listen to,
uh,

648
00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:57.240
um,
uh,
Fleming in this Aria Fleming,
we'll end here.

649
00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:00.643
<v 1>Sutherland.</v>

650
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:01.823
<v 12>Okay,</v>

651
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:06.180
<v 0>well,
octave higher.
So let's listen to this woman with a beautiful color tour,</v>

652
00:50:06.181 --> 00:50:09.580
a tour of a very well focused,
powerful in all ranges,

653
00:50:09.581 --> 00:50:11.200
sort of the complete voice,

654
00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:17.400
<v 1>still loading take to get to the point where you want.
Oh,
okay.
Okay.</v>

655
00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:22.260
<v 0>Um,
and then,
uh,
on the way out while we're loading this,
um,</v>

656
00:50:22.261 --> 00:50:26.700
we had the hop an era of Bza on our quiz,

657
00:50:26.701 --> 00:50:30.140
and we're to have an alternative performance of [inaudible] hub,
an arrow.

658
00:50:30.141 --> 00:50:35.000
So give us one minute here.
We'll finish up.
We're almost there,

659
00:50:35.001 --> 00:50:35.834
I think.

660
00:50:56.590 --> 00:51:01.450
Uh,
okay,
let's,
let's,
let's do it off of that.
Can we do it quickly off the CD?

661
00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:05.590
No.
That too much trouble.
And in any event,
listened to your CD,

662
00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:08.530
let's listen to your cds.
Let's go to our last clip.

663
00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.240
You remember the hub and Arrow with the,

664
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:13.543
<v 13>okay.</v>

665
00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:23.100
<v 0>And so on,
descending chromatic scale Ostinato underneath.</v>

666
00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.050
I found a better version of this.

667
00:51:25.051 --> 00:51:27.840
I don't know whether this is the dumbest thing you've ever seen.

668
00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:32.030
Probably is more.
It's really funny.
I can't tell me.

669
00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:34.773
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

670
00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:39.923
<v 14>Yeah.</v>

671
00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:44.570
<v 0>No,
I don't know what kind of soprano voice this is,
but it sure is different.</v>

672
00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:46.890
<v 14>Me.</v>

673
00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:47.723
<v 8>Right.</v>

674
00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:00.590
<v 0>Okay.
So let's,</v>

675
00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:07.000
let's see.
I don't,
I'm still after.

676
00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:14.740
Okay.
Just,
just play,
just play whatever we got.
Yeah.

677
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:18.370
<v 3>Here's Sutherland.</v>
