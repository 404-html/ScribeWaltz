1
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.480
Did.
They were going to start talking about music of the Baroque period.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.510
1600 to 1750 exemplified by js.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.360
Bach today will be the first of two presentations about the music of Bach.

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.090
One today dealing with box vocal music.

5
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.590
The other coming in sections.
Yes,
we have sections on Thursday,

6
00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:27.591
Friday and Monday having to do with the instrumental music of Js Bach.

7
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.300
So we're going to start now with Baroque music and Bach and a word first about

8
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.490
box.
Uh,

9
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.530
biography bock came from a very long line of musicians in deed 10 generations of

10
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:41.940
box.

11
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.940
We're musicians goes back to old Veit Bach in the 16th century and continues

12
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:52.641
generation after generation into the 19th century in the area in which Bach was

13
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:57.150
born,
this small town of Eisenach,

14
00:00:57.151 --> 00:01:00.630
you can see the town's name up there and the date in which you was born,

15
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:03.840
1685 in this area of Thuringia,

16
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:08.730
the region which Eisenach sits the word Bach was eponymous.

17
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.750
In other words,
a Bach simply met a musician,
a musician,

18
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:15.420
just like we have the word Kleenex,
for example,

19
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:20.130
or we have the word xerox that begin to take on the connotations of an entire

20
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:24.570
class.
So it'd be a Bach in that area was to be a musician.

21
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.380
Johann Sebastian Bach was simply the most talented of this long lived clan of

22
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.450
musicians from the age of nine Js Bach was orphan.

23
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.280
Both his parents had died by that time.

24
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:41.490
So it was raised for the most part by his older brother,

25
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:43.980
Johann Christoph Bock,

26
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.860
who was a student of our Johann puck.
A bell.

27
00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:52.861
So there is this connection between the box and a PA cowbell and for the most

28
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:58.530
part,
js Bach was a self taught.
How did he teach himself music?

29
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.970
Well,
he copied music.
He copied music for two reasons.
One,

30
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.830
to learn the musical style and to,

31
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.570
to get music because you simply couldn't go to a photocopying machine.

32
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.980
Uh,
and copy this,
the music of Corolla or the music of [inaudible].
Uh,

33
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.610
you had to copy it down yourself by hand.

34
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.440
You couldn't go to a music store and buy edited additions because for the most

35
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:27.810
part,
that didn't exist so much more of,

36
00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:31.380
it was simply music copied by one musician after the next.

37
00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:36.060
So Bach learned his craft by copying literally Corelli and we have run into

38
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:40.500
Corelli.
Of course,
anybody remember a piece by Corelli that we perform?

39
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.770
Frederick La Folia excellent.
Uh,

40
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:45.660
and he copied Vivaldi.

41
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:49.920
What's some of all these most famous composition Frederick again,

42
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.040
the four seasons.
So,
uh,
so he copied that and he also copied a,

43
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.660
some other can charity Grossi of,
of Vivaldi,
uh,

44
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.570
oftentimes surreptitiously,
uh,

45
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:06.571
by moonlight when he was supposed to be in bed box devotion to his profession

46
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:09.160
was legendary when he was a young man.

47
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.400
He sort of went AWOL from his first job and walk from the town of Orange Dot,

48
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.570
which you see up there,

49
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.230
a walk from orange.in the center part of Germany,

50
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:24.490
all the way up to the Hanseatic city of Oulu back on the North Sea up there,

51
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.730
a distance of about 250 miles in order to be able to sit at the feet of a very

52
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:35.950
famous organist and composer there and Lubeck.
And then he walked back.

53
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.830
It would be like one of us wanting to learn something from a congressman or

54
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:43.831
something and walking to from new haven to Washington DC in back in his day,

55
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:49.030
Bach was legendary.
Not so much as a composer,
oddly enough,

56
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:53.410
but as what?
What was Bach known for in his day?
We touched on this before,
Angela.

57
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.340
He was an organist.
Okay.
So he was an organist.

58
00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:01.990
He was the v Great Virtuoso organist of central northern Germany,

59
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.880
uh,
in this period.

60
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.650
Now we have met a Oregon piece of Bach before.

61
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.990
What was that?
Uh,

62
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.160
name Michael.
Mitch.
Okay.
Yes.
What was that please?

63
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.570
G minor feud.
Can you sing any of it?
Good.

64
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:25.270
Anybody seeing any of it?
Hey,
we got some takers down here.

65
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:28.390
Kristen [inaudible] together.
A Duet gentlemen please.

66
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.130
Excellent.
Oh Wow.
Bravo.
Okay.

67
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.490
<v 2>Hmm.
Mm.</v>

68
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.000
<v 0>That's sort of the key that they sang it.</v>

69
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:56.290
And we'll come back to that idea in just a minute because I found myself

70
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:58.210
tripping over that fugue subject.

71
00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:00.760
And another one that I want to talk about this morning is,

72
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:03.580
I was trying to think through these.
There's another famous piece,

73
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.860
Oregon piece of Bach that we might have heard recently.

74
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.240
Do we have the Takata queued up there?
It should be track one.

75
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:14.860
Let's listen to a Toccata by Bach written in orange dot early in his career.

76
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.890
Whoa.
Where did that come from?
That's,
Oh,
I know it's in the mission

77
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.950
they were in,
they were in the bay.
We lost the CD this morning.

78
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.030
So it's sitting in the machine.
How interesting.
Sometimes a,

79
00:05:30.031 --> 00:05:35.031
our CD player eats our machine for days on days on end and then only belatedly

80
00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:39.420
spits it back out.
So do we have that?
Uh,
okay.

81
00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:40.920
We don't have that cute.
I'm sorry,

82
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.350
but you've probably heard it at the concert the other day.

83
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.960
De,
De,
De,
De,
De,
de,
de,
t,
t,
t,
t,
t,
t,
t,
t,
t.
T.

84
00:05:47.961 --> 00:05:52.650
T team.
It's a big Oregon piece in d minor kind of spooky music that begins every

85
00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:57.440
Halloween show.
Well,
that's more organ music by J Bach.

86
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.640
We may be able to,
to resurrect that.
After a while,
we'll,
we'll find out,
uh,

87
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:02.270
and again,

88
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.270
a piece that he composed as a young man here in the town of Orange Dot.

89
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.350
Roughly 1705 or so.
So there he is a first job,

90
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.710
uh,
and we won't say fresh out of college because Bach did not go to college,

91
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:17.780
but he went to a very,
uh,
hike,
uh,

92
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.070
standing prep school in the northern part of Germany,
just graduated,

93
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:26.330
has his first job at orange dot.
Let's take a look at a raw wool.

94
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.830
Here is the picture of our great men.
But let's go on to our first,
uh,

95
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:34.040
real slide there.
And I think everybody see that.
Okay.

96
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.610
That's the organ in the church had orange dot where Bach worked.
Uh,

97
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.750
the Oregon is still there.
Uh,
the,

98
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.720
the essential parts of the pipes and all are still there.

99
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:46.400
That's the very organ that Bach play,

100
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.060
but they've sort of modernized it over the centuries and they took out the

101
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:53.510
original console.
So Rachel,
if we could have the next slide please.

102
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.120
And there is the console.
This is the kind of the central processing unit,

103
00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:02.810
if you will,
for a box Oregon.
So you can see,

104
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.460
does that look like a big Oregon or a small organ to you by our standards?

105
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.310
Kind of on the smallest side.
They were bigger ones actually,
uh,
up,
up to,

106
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.870
up to the north.
Uh,

107
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:19.760
but you can see here some of you did that extra credit credit project on the

108
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:20.480
Oregon,

109
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.100
two keyboards and a pedal board down here to be played of obviously with the

110
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:29.690
feet.
And what do you suppose these things are working all around it?

111
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.330
What,
what would we call those?
We're going to pull one of those,
uh,
stop.

112
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.170
Okay.
And it brings into play and extra rank of pipes,

113
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:42.170
pipes of a particular sound.
And we have this expression,
oh,

114
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:44.450
I'm going to pull out all the stops.
Well,
of course,

115
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:49.040
that has to do with Oregon technology.
So this is box,

116
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.460
uh,
the console ineffective box,
original Oregon.

117
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:57.560
A Bach eventually left orange dot and moved on to the larger city of Weimar,

118
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:58.910
uh,
where he stayed.

119
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:03.911
As you can see there from 1708 to 17 seven,

120
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:09.530
uh,
1717 and he functioned as an organist and a court,

121
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.410
a musician there in 17,
17,

122
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:17.411
he decided to leave that position in Weimar and move on to another town curtain.

123
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.890
And the Duke of Weimar Pr,

124
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.890
Duke Ville helm summarily had Bach thrown in jail.

125
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:30.230
Bach was thrown in jail for a month,
sat in jail,

126
00:08:30.231 --> 00:08:35.150
languish in jail.
We think he started the well tempered clavier a while in jail.

127
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.530
Why did the Duke have box thrown in jail?
Any ideas?
Well,

128
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.520
he hadn't obtained a release from the Duke.

129
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:48.320
And this tells us something about the status of musicians in the 18th century.

130
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:51.020
There were little better than indentured servants,

131
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:55.410
no such thing as free agency here,
not like baseball players or whatever.
Today.

132
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.780
Uh,
if you wanted to take another position,

133
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.650
you had to get your present employer to say,
okay,

134
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:03.030
it's all right if you go,

135
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.360
imagine that today you want to quit your job and move on to a better job.
Well,

136
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:10.920
you can't leave until the present boss says you can go.
But that was the case.

137
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.180
And Bach had violated that modus operandi and there he languished in jail for a

138
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.020
month.
Finally,
the Duke of Weimar,
uh,

139
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.390
relented and off Bach and his family went to the town of Curtin.

140
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:26.550
Let's take a look at the next slide please.
The town of Curtin,
um,
again,

141
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:27.750
sort of central Germany.

142
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:32.751
This is an engraving of the mid 17th century and we can see here the court

143
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:38.700
building of complex plexes where Bach worked there in the center.

144
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.510
Now we're going to go to the front of that next slide.
Uh,

145
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:46.830
as it stands today is rather heavily damaged after communist occupation after

146
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:50.580
World War Two,
uh,
rather,
not in the best state of repair.

147
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:54.900
You go inside the court yard there a next slide please.

148
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.500
Going in and you can see it's something of a mess because they are fixing up

149
00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:02.400
that room and indeed half fixed up that room up above.
Let's have the,

150
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.950
the next slide please.

151
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.700
A and here is that room up above the,

152
00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:13.701
so now crystal room of the palace at Curtin and this was where Bach performed.

153
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.310
And when you go to sections this week,

154
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:21.420
you will watch a wonderful video of a performance of the Bach Brandenburg

155
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:24.840
Concerto number five,
perform right in this hall.

156
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:29.550
You'll see those same windows there.
This is Bach's music,
uh,
performed,

157
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:35.450
performed in the environment for which Bach had created in 1723.

158
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:41.400
Bach moved again,
he was an aggressive,
uh,
um,
ambitious,

159
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.750
uh,
person js Bach.
He moved this time to the city of Leipzig,

160
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.913
Leipzig,

161
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:51.970
a little bit to the south of Curtin and he spent the rest of his career in

162
00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:52.590
Leipzig.

163
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:57.590
He moved to Leipzig in 1723 for two reasons and we'll come back to those two

164
00:10:59.371 --> 00:11:01.110
reasons.
But while I have this slide up here,

165
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.970
let's just put this in context a little bit.
You can see where Berlin is there.

166
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.660
You can see where Lubeck is,
where he walked all the way at the top.

167
00:11:09.661 --> 00:11:13.440
This is central Germany here,
and these towns aren't too far apart.

168
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.370
Here's curtain.
Here's Leipzig.
So 1723,

169
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:21.840
he goes to Leipzig and he goes there for two reasons.
One next slide.

170
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:26.280
One,
because his family will be given by the standards of the time,

171
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:30.930
rather large corridors here.
Actually by our standards,

172
00:11:30.931 --> 00:11:33.690
they were very small.
900 square feet.

173
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:38.220
Buck ultimately had 20 children and they were living in 900 square feet.

174
00:11:38.221 --> 00:11:39.120
Ask Yourself,

175
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.330
do you know how many square feet are in your parents' apartment or home?

176
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.060
A lot more than 900.
But that would,

177
00:11:45.061 --> 00:11:49.770
this was thought to be big digs back in the 18th century in these cities that

178
00:11:49.771 --> 00:11:52.620
were in case by military fortresses.
In any event,

179
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.410
we see box working here and living area right here in this building.

180
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.760
And I want you to count the number of stories because it will become important

181
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:05.560
later on.
One,
two,
three.
And then the roof begins.

182
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.920
Uh,
and I also want you to,
uh,
it's hard to see in the slide,

183
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:11.470
but there's a group of choir boys walking out here.

184
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.960
How do I know their choir boys?
Cause they're arranged by height.

185
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.310
Ever look at choir boys.

186
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.730
That's how they arrange them when they walk in procession,
the young kids first,

187
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:22.650
the older ones,
uh,
towards the back.
We'll come back to that point,
uh,
in,

188
00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.280
in just a,
just a minute.
Um,

189
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:28.870
another reason Bach moved to Leipzig was it was a university town so he could

190
00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:32.260
get a free university education for his numerous sons.

191
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.150
What about his numerous daughters?

192
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.630
Did they get a free education at the university?
No,

193
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.870
because women did not go to the university in this period.

194
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.570
The first woman to receive a degree,

195
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.680
a college degree in a Western University,
uh,

196
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:52.360
was a woman enrolled in philosophy at the University of Padua and 1676,

197
00:12:52.361 --> 00:12:57.310
1676.
So it would be unprecedented really.
I mean,
there was one precedent,

198
00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.670
a inbox day for women to go to university.

199
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:04.780
It was assumed that just the men would go to university.
In any event,

200
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.840
let's talk about box standing here in the town of Leipsic.

201
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.640
Bach had to petition for this job.

202
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:16.630
He wanted this job because it had these advantages as mentioned.
Uh,

203
00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:21.250
and he was not the first choice of the town council of Leipsic.

204
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.430
Uh,
there was another composer who was their first choice.
Georg Fidi him,

205
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:30.040
he declined the position.
They offered it to somebody else named [inaudible].

206
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.150
He couldn't get a release from his employer so he couldn't take it.

207
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:38.430
And so as the town minutes,
uh,
of the,
uh,
town council,

208
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.800
the of the town council say,
since,
uh,

209
00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.750
good musicians can't be had,

210
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.170
we'll have mediocre ones will have to suffice.

211
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.930
And they turn at that point to Bach,
uh,

212
00:13:49.931 --> 00:13:52.420
which I guess calls us to ask,

213
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.910
how many misjudgments are we making in our lives?
May Be,
uh,

214
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.590
Aja doesn't realize that sitting right next to him,
Chris,

215
00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:00.910
there is really a genius and,

216
00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.120
and we should pay more attention to how many geniuses they're sort of sneaking

217
00:14:04.121 --> 00:14:07.660
around in our midst on recognized today.

218
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:13.240
Anyway,
Bach was anything other than the groaned [inaudible] east.
Uh,

219
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.140
when he arrived in Leipzig,
uh,
here,
uh,

220
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.350
I've made some xeroxes out of my book called the Bach reader.

221
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.020
When Barack got there,
he had to take an oath of office.

222
00:14:23.021 --> 00:14:25.360
He had to swear to do the following.
One,

223
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.720
I shall set the boys a shiny example of honest and retiring manner of life,

224
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:36.540
serve the school industriously and instruct the boys conscientiously to bring

225
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:42.121
the music on all the principal churches of the town into good estate to the best

226
00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:47.440
of my ability.
Three show the honorable and most wise counsel.

227
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:52.400
All proper respect and obedience and so on.
It goes,
here are a few more things.

228
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:57.290
Faithfully instruct the boys not only in vocal music but also an instrumental

229
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:01.040
music.
Andy had to teach them Latin as well.
Uh,

230
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.990
arrange the music that it shall not last too long,
ah,

231
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.880
shall be of such a nature as not to make an operatic impression but rather

232
00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:15.620
insight the listeners to devotion.

233
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.520
So they didn't want Bach's music to go on too long,
which is very important.

234
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.130
And they didn't want it to be very operatic.

235
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.390
They wanted sort of conservative music there.
Uh,

236
00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:28.940
here's a number 12 not to go out of town without the permission of the honorable

237
00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:30.950
burgermeister a number 13,

238
00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:35.090
always walk as far as possible with the boys at,
at funerals.

239
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.940
So Bach here in Leipzig is sort of a glorified scoutmaster he's,

240
00:15:38.941 --> 00:15:43.070
he's not this kind of 19th century image of the genius or the of the globe

241
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.480
artist as mentioned.
Uh,
okay.

242
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:48.980
The point being,
once again,

243
00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:52.970
the Bach in his day was recognized and valued not so much as a composer,

244
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:57.260
but as a performer.
Well,
what was the matter with Bach's music?

245
00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.460
Why did they want already at the outset here sort of clipping his wings,

246
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.550
telling him what style not to write in?
Well,

247
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.870
Bob had this proclivity for writing music that's very sort of rigid,

248
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:10.130
very chromatic,

249
00:16:10.131 --> 00:16:13.880
very contrapuntal and very long.

250
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:18.500
And it is long and contract portal as we will be seeing in particularly in,

251
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:23.420
in sections,
uh,
this,
uh,
coming,
uh,
week.

252
00:16:23.421 --> 00:16:25.610
If we compare for example,

253
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.790
to can charity Grossi the first movement of,
of Ah,

254
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.220
of evolve these spring concerto,
it lasts three minutes and 10 seconds.

255
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.760
Bach writes a first movement of a concerto.
Grosso.

256
00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:42.710
You're going to watch a video of it.
It runs for nine minutes and 10 seconds.

257
00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.180
So it's three times as long,
three times as,

258
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.380
as dense in a way.
Um,
okay.
Let's,
uh,

259
00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:56.180
let's go on to talk about the kinds of things that Bach composed here and for

260
00:16:56.181 --> 00:17:00.590
that we'll take,
take a look at,
uh,
at the board.

261
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.160
Um,
box works.

262
00:17:04.161 --> 00:17:06.290
Some of these we've talked about already,

263
00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:10.010
preludes and fugues for Harpsichord or keyboard,

264
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:14.810
the well tempered clavier.
We've talked about the g minor Oregon few.
We've,

265
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.710
we can talk about the art of the fugue.
Uh,
let's around.
Well,

266
00:17:18.711 --> 00:17:23.210
let's have the next slide.
Uh,
I think I've got a slide of that here.
Uh,

267
00:17:23.211 --> 00:17:27.710
no wrong piece.
Okay.
Sorry.
Uh,
this is the Bach Brandenburg.

268
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.530
I brought in the wrong slide.
I'm sorry.
Uh,

269
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.560
but the art of Fugue is an interesting composition that a Bach wrote v very much

270
00:17:36.591 --> 00:17:41.420
toward the end of his life.
Sonatas for flutes and violin.

271
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.750
Viola,
a dance suites for orchestra.

272
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.230
You may know the air on the g string.
Beautiful,

273
00:17:48.231 --> 00:17:53.231
beautiful s Solo Violin writing there with Basso continuo underneath solo

274
00:17:54.511 --> 00:17:58.280
concertos for violin and Harpsichord.
Uh,
the um,

275
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:03.030
can charity Grossi that we'll be talking about the Brandenburg concertos.

276
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.730
We'll be working with number five.

277
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.560
Then he wrote a lot of religious vocal music.
The B minor mass.

278
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:15.540
I was playing parts of the sunk two of the B minor mass.
Uh,
when we,

279
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:20.340
when we came in,
uh,
Linda,
this is going to really mess things up.
Do we know what,

280
00:18:20.341 --> 00:18:25.341
try where we have that a sunk twos where the Bach B minor mass massive is track

281
00:18:26.221 --> 00:18:29.740
10.
If you can get to the CD,
let's just listen to a little bit of,

282
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.440
this is on the fly this morning,
but let's,

283
00:18:31.441 --> 00:18:35.490
let's just listen to a bit of the sunk twos of the B minor mass to give you a

284
00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:39.690
sense of the,
the,
the monumental quality that Bach can create.

285
00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:01.140
<v 3>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

286
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:11.990
[inaudible] [inaudible]

287
00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.800
[inaudible]

288
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:48.683
okay.

289
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.740
<v 0>Pretty impressive stuff,
but it goes on for a long time and it's filled with,</v>

290
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:58.400
with imitation and fugal subjects that recombine in different kinds of

291
00:19:58.401 --> 00:20:03.080
permutations can be inverted and go backwards and forwards and upside down.

292
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.410
Uh,
and this is what Bach would do if somebody would write a,
uh,

293
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.260
a set of variations that had 10 variations in it.

294
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.630
He would write a set of variations with 20 variations.

295
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.620
If somebody would write one cannon,
he would write a 10 canons as he does,

296
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:20.120
for example,
in the Goldberg variations.
Whatever he did,

297
00:20:20.121 --> 00:20:23.930
he sorta prosecuted maniacally.
And what he ended up with,
with stuff that's,

298
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.790
that's very dense,
very compact,
is really the best sort of craftsmanship.

299
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:33.570
But it's not necessarily the most sort of popular music in,

300
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:37.610
in that regard.
But as you hear heard,
it can be,
uh,
very,
uh,

301
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:42.870
grand and quite a spectacular as we heard from the song tos of the B minor mass

302
00:20:44.181 --> 00:20:47.560
there.
When Bob arrived in Leipzig,

303
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:52.420
it was a town of 35,000 in,
was one of the biggest in Germany.

304
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:57.760
Does that sound like a big town to you?
35 south thousand?
No,
I mean,

305
00:20:57.761 --> 00:21:01.030
hand in probably has 35,000 people living in,

306
00:21:01.031 --> 00:21:04.490
but this was a big city in inbox day.
Um,

307
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.550
and he was called there to run a music,
uh,

308
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:12.640
for really for all of the Lutheran churches in that town.

309
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.490
Now that we're talking here,
uh,
uh,
Leipzig,

310
00:21:15.491 --> 00:21:20.020
which is not far from Wittenberg where,
uh,
Martin Luther,
uh,
uh,

311
00:21:20.021 --> 00:21:22.750
was active.
So we're talking about kind of the,
the,

312
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:27.520
the home ground of Lutheranism here and Leipzig enjoyed complete freedom of

313
00:21:27.521 --> 00:21:32.020
religion.
Uh,
you can attend any church accorded,
this was all Christianity.

314
00:21:32.021 --> 00:21:35.770
You can attend any church that you wished,

315
00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:39.580
any church that you wish there were a dozen or so of them in the city.

316
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.820
The only kicker was that they were all Lutheran churches.

317
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.730
It goes this Lutheran church or that Lutheran Church,
whatever when you want,

318
00:21:45.731 --> 00:21:48.340
but they were all Lutheran churches.

319
00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:49.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

320
00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:54.890
<v 0>So box job was to organize the music for these churches,</v>

321
00:21:55.021 --> 00:21:59.010
particularly the principal church,
which was this Saint Thomas Church.

322
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:03.930
And what he wrote for this Saint Thomas Church was this thing called the

323
00:22:03.931 --> 00:22:06.330
Cantata.
What's a Cantata?
Well,

324
00:22:06.331 --> 00:22:11.331
literally it's a sung thing as opposed to a sonata.

325
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:15.960
So nata sounded thing.
So this is a sung thing.

326
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:20.640
What can we say about the Cantatas that Bach Road?
How would we summarize them?

327
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:24.520
Well,
they are multi movements.
Uh,

328
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.420
recitatives Aria Chorus,
multimedia movements.

329
00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:31.230
They go on for about 25 to 30 minutes.

330
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:36.030
They are religious,
uh,
in,
um,
subject matter.

331
00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.930
And of course they are written in the German language.

332
00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:43.740
And Bach wrote about 300 of these cantatas.

333
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.070
He wrote them in cycles of 50.
When he arrived there in 17.

334
00:22:47.071 --> 00:22:50.630
23 starts writing one cantata for each Sunday.
The end of the,

335
00:22:50.631 --> 00:22:53.730
at the end of the a year,
he's got about 50 of these things.

336
00:22:53.731 --> 00:22:58.260
Next year he starts all over again.
So we ended up with about 300 cantatas.

337
00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:02.580
Then he got exhausted from the process and stopped about 17,
29,

338
00:23:02.581 --> 00:23:06.300
1730 or so.
Now on the board up here,

339
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.960
you see the layout of a typical,

340
00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.420
a Cantata,

341
00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.200
uh,

342
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:19.820
it is vocat hour lunch dish Dima arise,

343
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.470
a voice is calling.
And here's,
here's,
I hope you can see this.

344
00:23:24.471 --> 00:23:26.480
Okay.
Here's how it shakes down.

345
00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:31.340
We have seven the movements in this [inaudible] seven movements.

346
00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:35.630
Um,
and they are arranged chorus.

347
00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:40.140
Then recitatives what's a recitatives somebody tell us what the rest of the t
is.

348
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:46.400
We haven't talked about it,
but maybe you know from other context.
Uh,
Jacob.

349
00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.070
Yeah.
Okay.
It's not much music,
more,

350
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:56.080
more sort of spoken dialogue accompanied a little bit by a Baso continue,

351
00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:02.480
uh,
Baso continuum.
Anybody tell me from the reading when a baso continuum is,

352
00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.650
I think if you look on your text and about page one 14,

353
00:24:08.651 --> 00:24:12.590
you'll find a discussion of it.
But at Bosco continual is,
um,

354
00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:17.640
an ensemble that plays a baseline and because a number of instruments are

355
00:24:17.711 --> 00:24:21.610
involved in,
it'd be the left hand of the Harpsichord,
maybe a cello,

356
00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:26.290
maybe also a bassoon,
two,
three instruments playing the baseline.

357
00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:30.250
It makes for a very heavy,
very powerful baseline.

358
00:24:30.251 --> 00:24:33.760
And this is something that is typical of baroque music.

359
00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:38.500
So a recitatives will be a company and indeed all the Arias will be accompanied

360
00:24:38.501 --> 00:24:40.330
by Baso.
Continue with the choral stuff,

361
00:24:40.331 --> 00:24:44.290
will be contempt ended by Bosco continuum.
Continuum is just always going.

362
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:48.570
So it's a strong base that's always going.
It's different from the boss.

363
00:24:48.571 --> 00:24:52.300
So ostinato because what happens in a boss?
No ostinato

364
00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.193
<v 1>young,</v>

365
00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.100
<v 0>it keeps repeating over and over and over again.</v>

366
00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:04.340
So a Baso Ostinato would be of a particular kind of Baso continuum.

367
00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:08.970
I'm kind of a species of Baso continuum,

368
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.780
but Bosco continuum of based,
it's always going on and is very strong.

369
00:25:12.781 --> 00:25:16.350
So we'd have sort of spoken dialogue with a strong base,

370
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:19.500
then an Aria,
and I'm going to say something about this,

371
00:25:19.501 --> 00:25:21.060
these Arias in this period,

372
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.750
they are dot Capo Arias in the baroque period.

373
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.970
What does a de Capo Aria mean?

374
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:32.390
Anybody peeked ahead and that are in discussions around pages one 51 60 or so in

375
00:25:32.911 --> 00:25:37.200
the text or know that from,
uh,
other contexts.

376
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:40.980
What would it dot Capo Aria be?
Well,
literally.
Dot.
Capo.

377
00:25:40.981 --> 00:25:45.020
And it sounds like a film score.
The Capo or something.
It means the head guy,

378
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:47.910
the head guy,
or in this case,
the beginning of the music.

379
00:25:47.911 --> 00:25:50.670
The head of the music means you take it from the beginning of the music.

380
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.390
So you do one,
a section and a section,

381
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:57.390
and then you have a contrasting section,

382
00:25:57.391 --> 00:26:00.720
and then you'll get this sign that says d C.
Dot.
Capo.

383
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.410
And then you go back and do the a section all over again.

384
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.910
So what form do we end up with when we have a duck capo orient,
then obviously

385
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:11.420
turn and reform.
Okay,

386
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.040
so the Arias in here are usually structured in the baroque period,

387
00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:18.260
in a dot.
Capo form.

388
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:23.630
And then we have the choruses chorus one chorus for chorus seven.

389
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.960
And in each of these choruses we are making use of this thing called a chorale

390
00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.310
tune.
A corral tune.
What's a corral?

391
00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:38.000
What's a corral to what corral tune is just what,
uh,

392
00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:42.830
other Christian denominations would call a him or what we here at Yale,

393
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:47.400
whether we're a Muslim,
whether we're Jewish or,
uh,
whether we're Christian,

394
00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:49.320
we're going to have to sing the,

395
00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.350
and so when it goes,
I think it's called Duke Street.
Oh God.
Beneath God.

396
00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.820
Above the rising stars die,
exiled father's cross the sea.
It's,

397
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:12.160
it was actually written here in new haven.
So it's kind of the Yale,
him,

398
00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:16.050
if you will,
or maybe the Yale a chorale.
Um,

399
00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.700
so these chorales were sort of old melodies,
old religious melodies.

400
00:27:19.701 --> 00:27:23.470
Some of them worked sort of remakes of Gregorian chants.

401
00:27:23.471 --> 00:27:26.800
The Lutherans just took old Catholic chance and turned them into corral tunes.

402
00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:30.340
Others were newly composed going all the way back to the 16th century.

403
00:27:30.341 --> 00:27:34.330
Martin Luther himself composed a corral tunes.

404
00:27:34.331 --> 00:27:37.090
Anybody name a corral tune or a hymn tune of Martin Luther,

405
00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.673
<v 1>I bet you</v>

406
00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:45.640
<v 4>tata,
Tata,
Tata,
Bom,
Bom,</v>

407
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.950
Bom,
Bom,
bom,
Bom,
bom.
Um,

408
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.490
<v 0>and by knowing the name of that,
yes.
Uh,
Kristen didn't it?</v>

409
00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:53.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

410
00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.270
<v 0>Okay.
Nice and loud please.
Christian.</v>

411
00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:56.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

412
00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.010
<v 0>Okay.
A mighty fortress is our God.
It's a reformation.</v>

413
00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:05.080
The reformation corral and musicians have used that frequently over the,

414
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:09.340
over the,
uh,
over the centuries.
Um,

415
00:28:09.341 --> 00:28:11.650
so we're going not going to be working with a mighty fortress.

416
00:28:11.651 --> 00:28:14.500
We're going to be working with a different corral tune,

417
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:16.900
voc and Alpha root and Judy Stimah,

418
00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:23.010
which was a couple of years old by the time Bob got his hands on it and you have

419
00:28:23.141 --> 00:28:27.550
it here.
So on your sheet,
everybody got the sheet for today?

420
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.980
<v 1>Maybe I'll turn the lights back on.
Just see a little better.</v>

421
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:40.090
Yeah,
it's a little better.
How that's even,

422
00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.310
<v 0>so here is a corral to,
and it's in lots of phrases.
Right?</v>

423
00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:49.520
<v 1>Um,
what about this,</v>

424
00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.600
<v 0>do you think that's a tonal melodies?</v>

425
00:29:05.601 --> 00:29:10.010
Does that sound pretty secure for you or does that sound sort of weird?

426
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:15.240
Roger,
what do you think
down secure.
It is tonal.

427
00:29:15.241 --> 00:29:19.590
And why would you imagine it sounds secure if you look at the down beat of each

428
00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:24.300
measure,
uh,
almost every measure.
What notes do we have there?

429
00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:25.840
There are notes that form

430
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:32.100
a triad,
a major triad,

431
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.890
so we mustn't forget all that stuff we studied early on.

432
00:29:34.891 --> 00:29:39.891
So here's Bach or borrowing a corral to that is you is for grounding a major

433
00:29:41.831 --> 00:29:44.180
triad in a big way and uh,

434
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.840
who has to sing this walls and really the full congregation,

435
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:51.370
everybody has to sing these corral tunes to show that you are a,

436
00:29:51.371 --> 00:29:54.720
in this case,
a good Lutheran I suppose.
Um,

437
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:58.300
so everybody was be expected to sing them.
And because of that,

438
00:29:58.301 --> 00:30:03.040
they tended to be rather step wise.
So we should all sing this right?

439
00:30:03.041 --> 00:30:07.600
Today we're all going to be good Lutherans,
no matter what our real religion is,

440
00:30:07.601 --> 00:30:10.510
assuming we have a real religion.
So let's,
um,

441
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:14.350
let's start here and we're just going to sing law.
Here we go.

442
00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:21.390
<v 4>La,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la,</v>

443
00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:24.170
la,
la,

444
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:28.540
<v 3>la,
la,
la,
la,
la.</v>

445
00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.470
<v 0>Okay,
great.
Now this is,</v>

446
00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:37.130
this is not working so well and why is it not working so well?

447
00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.240
It's too high.
So what would [inaudible] have done in those days?

448
00:30:41.241 --> 00:30:44.510
The only person here that can sing this is Leah.
Uh,
Linda and Santana.

449
00:30:44.511 --> 00:30:47.450
Cause they're sopranos and I could hear them.
Uh,

450
00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.910
but that was about all I could hear.
It's too high.

451
00:30:49.911 --> 00:30:54.120
So what would they have done in box day?
Stop singing.

452
00:30:54.121 --> 00:30:57.590
It had a lightening bolts would come down.
The church is a bad,

453
00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:01.620
I'm not quite sure why they couldn't stop singing it.
They had to transpose it.

454
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:03.330
Just take it down.
We'll make it lower.

455
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:07.443
<v 4>Let's go.</v>

456
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.040
<v 0>Different key.
Here we go.
Ready?
Sing</v>

457
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:16.290
<v 4>la La la.</v>

458
00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:19.893
Rest

459
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.073
louder.

460
00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.140
<v 0>Okay,
we'll stop there.
We'll stop there.</v>

461
00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:41.710
So bucks got this corral and then he's going to do something with it.
Uh,

462
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:44.430
and what he does is write a first movement.

463
00:31:44.431 --> 00:31:49.010
So that takes us back over here to movement.
One of,
of our,
of our,
uh,

464
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:53.980
chorale.
Um,
we're going to talk now about the text.
Uh,

465
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:58.050
uh,
with regard to this particular,
um,
chorale.

466
00:31:58.051 --> 00:32:01.650
What's the texts calling about?
Well,
here's what,
here's the translation of it.

467
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:02.300
Awake.

468
00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:07.300
A voice is calling from the watchman from high in the tower awake Jerusalem.

469
00:32:07.411 --> 00:32:11.310
Midnight is the hour.
They call us with a clarion voice.

470
00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:15.480
Where are the wise virgins?
Get up,
the bridegroom cometh,

471
00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:20.160
stand up and take your lamps,
Aloe Luhya provide yourself for the wedding.

472
00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.520
Go.
You must go out,
go forth to meet him.
Um,

473
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:29.820
now inbox day,
this corral would have been sung.

474
00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:33.660
It's the major musical portion of the Cantata,

475
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:38.670
which is the major musical portion of the whole service,
which was sung,

476
00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:41.030
right?
The reading of the Gospel.

477
00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.540
So they'd come in and there'd be some introductory corrals and prayers and that

478
00:32:44.541 --> 00:32:49.490
kind of thing.
Then they would have a reading of the Gospel of the Gospel,
the,

479
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.560
the thesis of the day.

480
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:56.330
Now this particular Cantata is written for advent.
So what's advent?

481
00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:01.000
Who can tell me what advent is?
Don't necessarily have,
you know,

482
00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:04.510
Muslim,
Jewish,
Christian,
whatever.
You may probably know what Admin is that is,

483
00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:06.380
<v 1>okay.</v>

484
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:10.400
<v 0>It's the days before Christmas.
So we have the English word adventitious,</v>

485
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:12.680
something coming,
something about to arrive.

486
00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.290
It's the birth of Christ in this particular case.
So it's a,

487
00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:19.400
I think roughly the four weeks before Christmas,
thinking maybe late November,

488
00:33:19.401 --> 00:33:23.450
early December,
up to Christmas.
So,
so that's when this cantata would have been,

489
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:27.650
uh,
would have been appropriate.
Who'd been sung say the on the Sunday,

490
00:33:27.651 --> 00:33:31.700
the 1st of December,
something,
something like that.
And as I say,

491
00:33:31.701 --> 00:33:35.330
it's preceded by the gospel of the day.
So to get our heads in this,

492
00:33:35.331 --> 00:33:38.120
we have to understand what box message is here.

493
00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:40.910
We have to know what the Gospel is.
So I've asked Chris,

494
00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:45.100
I gave Chris The textbook here.
I put the,
the textbook and ask Christa,

495
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:49.910
read the Gospel for today.
So sound is stand up and or,
yeah,

496
00:33:49.911 --> 00:33:50.744
you can stand up

497
00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:53.223
<v 6>Michelle.</v>

498
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:57.040
<v 0>Oh good.
I like that.
Nice and loud of the voice.
The Voice of God</v>

499
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:03.080
<v 6>took the labs and when forth to meet and</v>

500
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:09.020
hey,
that's cool.
But the goal

501
00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:12.790
and it was a crime,

502
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:18.610
behold the bridegroom come out to me and all of those versions of roads and

503
00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:25.300
traffic,
their lists and the coolest set to the wise give us oil.

504
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:26.543
Arlene's.

505
00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:32.550
But the wise answer it say not sad least there'd be not enough for us.

506
00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.210
And the go,

507
00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:39.220
you'd rather to them that set and by yourself and you get to buy the Brian Room.

508
00:34:40.541 --> 00:34:42.490
Okay.
And they got ready,

509
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:46.290
went in with him to the managers and the door was shut up.

510
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:52.000
Watch for,
you know,
neither the day nor the hour we're in the sun.

511
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:57.350
<v 0>Okay,
excellent.
And then that's the King James version of that.
So the,
the,</v>

512
00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:01.640
the syntax is sometimes difficult in the verbiage is a little bit unexpected

513
00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:05.820
there.
But what does all this mean?
What is this Roger?

514
00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:12.730
Uh,
the second coming of Christ.
Okay.
Uh,
and what are we supposed to do?

515
00:35:12.731 --> 00:35:16.090
We good citizens of Leipzig.
What are we supposed to do?

516
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:17.420
<v 1>Great.</v>

517
00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:21.500
<v 0>The ready get our spiritual house in order because Christ is coming.</v>

518
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:26.650
So Bach has this idea of this powerful figure coming into the midst of Leipzig,

519
00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.350
uh,
and he creates the following kind of music.

520
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:34.830
We start out here with Dum de Dum,
de Dum,
de Dum,
de Dum,
de Dum,

521
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:39.150
and then it begins to move a little bit in pitch.
It's a good example of,

522
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.060
of uh,
something that we'll talk about it in a moment,

523
00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:46.290
but if we want to have the sense of the inexorable march of something,

524
00:35:46.291 --> 00:35:49.500
what better way than a repeating baseline.

525
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.760
Then we have a melody begin.
Yeah.
T,

526
00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:57.390
t t t t t t t,
t.
T.
And then we didn't have time.

527
00:35:57.391 --> 00:35:58.940
We have a c mode motive that we want to put up.

528
00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:03.480
<v 7>Yeah.
Yeah.
T,
t t t t t t t t t t t t t t,
t,
t,
t,
t.
T.
T.
T.
T.
Dumb.</v>

529
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:06.960
<v 0>But I'm being,
so when you read your textbook there,</v>

530
00:36:06.961 --> 00:36:11.730
I interpreted this as follows a you will,
you will hear someone saying,

531
00:36:11.731 --> 00:36:15.360
I he me saying that,
uh,
this is,
uh,

532
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:19.110
the inexorable march of the Lord coming to the citizens of Leipzig.

533
00:36:19.111 --> 00:36:23.700
They get very excited and then begin to run in his direction.
Um,
and uh,

534
00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:25.050
this is the,
uh,
you know,

535
00:36:25.051 --> 00:36:28.560
Bach didn't write all this down and kind of interpreting it this way,
but I,

536
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:33.561
I can't help but think back on the early session that we had talking about the

537
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:38.740
musical Chicago and that,
uh,
that number in Chicago and uh,

538
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:40.290
get the,
the gun,
the gun to do that

539
00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.470
<v 7>De de,
De,
De,
De,
De,
De,
De,
De,
De,
De,
De,
De,
de,
De,
de.
De.</v>

540
00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:47.740
<v 0>It gets faster and faster and the texture gets denser and denser.
Well,</v>

541
00:36:47.741 --> 00:36:50.760
that's exactly what block is doing here.
Whether it's Broadway or box,
the,

542
00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:53.680
the modus operandi is going to be the same.

543
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.750
So let's listen to just a little bit here.

544
00:36:55.751 --> 00:36:59.970
This is the opening movement of box Cantata vocat our fruit punch dish demo.

545
00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.113
<v 3>Okay.</v>

546
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.970
That's

547
00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.690
<v 0>just the opening phrase.
And the crowds coming in with little,</v>

548
00:38:00.691 --> 00:38:03.650
a few goal expositions underneath that who were,

549
00:38:03.651 --> 00:38:06.930
who were coming were sort of this busy counterpoint underneath.

550
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:11.850
I used to use this as a listening exercise,
but it didn't work.
It was too,

551
00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.070
I couldn't get,
the students couldn't respond,
I don't know.

552
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:17.700
It just was too complex.
And then the way it told me something,

553
00:38:17.701 --> 00:38:21.540
Bach's music is very,
very complex.
So I went on to a,
uh,

554
00:38:21.541 --> 00:38:24.930
I think a more straight forward movement and that's what we're going to do now.

555
00:38:24.931 --> 00:38:29.750
The fourth movement that incorporates the corrals,
we have the,
the corrals,

556
00:38:29.751 --> 00:38:34.290
sort of like the voice of God up here on top.
Let's go onto the fourth movement.

557
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:38.350
Uh,
that may well recognized as one of box,
most famous compositions.

558
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.230
And I have three questions for you here.
Uh,
what's the base doing?
Yeah.

559
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.270
How many of voices are there?

560
00:38:46.271 --> 00:38:51.271
How many lines strands do here in the texture and where is the corral tune?

561
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:57.110
Who's singing the corral too?
So this is movement for,
of Cantata vocat out.

562
00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:58.653
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

563
00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.170
Oh,
that's,

564
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.400
<v 0>and then the Red Tornillo starts again.</v>

565
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:22.210
This refrain theme starts all over again.
All right,
let's pause it there.

566
00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:24.640
So what kind of base do we have here?

567
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:27.580
<v 3>Okay.</v>

568
00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:31.780
<v 0>Called Walking Bass,
right?
We've talked about that before.
Uh,
and once again,</v>

569
00:40:31.781 --> 00:40:36.230
it gives a very sort of secure a foundation.
So we have a boss,
oh,
continue.

570
00:40:36.231 --> 00:40:39.140
We'll play a walking bass.
Boom.
Okay.

571
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:46.070
<v 4>MMM.
MMM.
MMM.
MMM.
MMM.</v>

572
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:50.470
MMM.
MMM.
MMM.

573
00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:57.420
<v 0>Thing like that.
Just going on and on,
sort of with the same note,</v>

574
00:40:57.421 --> 00:41:01.440
values tends to be stepwise.
Have the same note values.
Uh,

575
00:41:01.441 --> 00:41:04.680
what else did we need to know there?
What happened to the corral?
Well,

576
00:41:04.681 --> 00:41:06.480
first of all,
well,
what about the texture?

577
00:41:06.481 --> 00:41:09.390
How many strands did you hear in that texture?

578
00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:12.183
<v 3>Okay,</v>

579
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:13.181
<v 0>Ryan and Nicole,</v>

580
00:41:13.181 --> 00:41:16.200
you want to huddle out there and figure out what the answer to this one is?
What,

581
00:41:16.201 --> 00:41:19.150
what do you think,
Nicole?
How many,
uh,
how many strands?

582
00:41:19.151 --> 00:41:20.620
How many lines did you hear there?

583
00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:28.910
Okay,
well,
we've got the base in there and we had that lovely,
lovely melody.

584
00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:32.510
The Tottenham Pod,
even part in which you have on,

585
00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:37.400
on sheet there.
Uh,
so that's two.
And what was the third one?

586
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:42.970
Well,
the corral Dune,
your palm palm body,
him.

587
00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.650
But what was different about the corral tune this time?

588
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.810
It was easier to hear why?

589
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:53.540
Because all of the male voices were singing it together in unison.

590
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:57.620
It wasn't distributed in all of this counterpoint in all of the voices,

591
00:41:57.621 --> 00:42:00.980
all the line,
uh,
all the voices were singing it together.

592
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.540
And if you have this sheet here,

593
00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:07.541
I think the miracle of this particular sheet is that this guy thought I had this

594
00:42:08.031 --> 00:42:12.830
one melody Yadim palm and he said,
Gee Whiz,
you know,
as I went,

595
00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:17.450
Yachty bodied it on bottom,
beat up,
beat up.

596
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:20.600
I could have that go against this melody.
He,

597
00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:24.380
he thought he had won the Nice Melody and he thought up an even more beautiful

598
00:42:24.381 --> 00:42:28.850
melody that could interweave with his given melody.

599
00:42:28.851 --> 00:42:30.450
So that's the gift here too,

600
00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:35.460
to be able to hear one thing and a size up its implications to know what it

601
00:42:36.801 --> 00:42:40.580
could become.
I guess that's what a great creative artist is all about.

602
00:42:40.581 --> 00:42:45.010
To know what something can become.
All right,
so we have,
uh,

603
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:48.710
that particular movement and I think that's the basis of your listening
exercise.

604
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:53.810
22,
uh,
for next time.
Um,
now,
uh,

605
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:58.040
we're getting toward the end of our hour and I wanted to ask you,
um,

606
00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.410
what we're going to do,
two,
two more things.
One,

607
00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:04.240
we're going to come back at the end to the end of the CONTORTA.
Uh,

608
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:06.800
but I want to ask you a question,
uh,
about,
uh,

609
00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:09.710
just try to put yourself in boxing shoes here for the moment.

610
00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:14.510
You got this job as a composer and you've got to generate all this music,
right?

611
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:18.830
You got to generate 25 to 30 minutes of new music every week.

612
00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:24.260
Well,
that would be like,
all right,
so presumably you get Sunday afternoon off,

613
00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:25.880
watch football,
whatever you want to do.

614
00:43:25.881 --> 00:43:27.890
Then Monday morning you start all over again,

615
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:33.160
and by next Sunday morning you got to have 25 to 30 minutes of music ready to

616
00:43:34.251 --> 00:43:38.750
perform.
Why is that really hard?
What's the hard part of this?

617
00:43:38.751 --> 00:43:43.490
What's the time consuming part of all of this?
Uh,
I see,

618
00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.250
uh,
Roger and Elizabeth or Elizabeth go with him.

619
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:51.230
Writing it out.
Yeah,
probably not composing it.

620
00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:55.820
I think these composers just have this stuff spewing out of their ears nonstop.

621
00:43:55.821 --> 00:43:59.630
I don't think it was thinking it up and maybe not rehearsing it though.

622
00:43:59.631 --> 00:44:03.980
That would take some time.
But before the days of copyists machines,
uh,

623
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:09.010
it would be very laborious to copy the full score and all of these parts may be

624
00:44:09.291 --> 00:44:14.210
14 different lines simultaneously and multiple copies of the violin parts and

625
00:44:14.211 --> 00:44:19.160
the cello parts in this.
So it'd be very time consuming.
How did he do this?
Well,

626
00:44:19.161 --> 00:44:22.340
let's see if we can go back to the next slide here.

627
00:44:22.341 --> 00:44:26.090
And we're going to talk about this just for a bit.
How did Bach um,

628
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:30.950
execute this and the next row row?
I think there was a,
uh,
yeah,

629
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.950
so we're going to go back into our church here and we're going to see box
church,

630
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:39.960
uh,
where uh,
he is,
um,
uh,
the,
the floor plan here.

631
00:44:39.961 --> 00:44:41.910
And then we're going to next slide,
please

632
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:47.910
take a look at the inside of it where the sermon was preached and take a note of

633
00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:51.690
the high altar up there.
Next slide.
We're going to go through these quickly now.

634
00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.170
Uh,
there we have the west end up there where the Oregon is.

635
00:44:55.171 --> 00:44:58.950
That's where the CANTATA would be performed.
Next slide.

636
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:03.600
The Oregon up there.
Here's a question for you.
Is this an Oregon from box day?

637
00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:07.900
Next slide
that look like box Oregon,

638
00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.290
too many mechanical chemical,
mechanical contrivances there.

639
00:45:11.291 --> 00:45:15.860
So that's an Oregon from the beginning of the 20th century and Box Oregon would

640
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:19.390
looked far more like this and we're going to talk about this in section a little

641
00:45:19.391 --> 00:45:21.370
bit later on.
Moving on.

642
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:23.150
<v 1>Okay,</v>

643
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:28.150
<v 0>let's go back to this because this is the building that we saw before the place</v>

644
00:45:28.551 --> 00:45:32.570
where Bach lived.
If we look at it now and start counting up,

645
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.010
we see that nail.

646
00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:38.300
There are five stories before we reach the roof line.

647
00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.790
In 1731 buck petition,

648
00:45:40.791 --> 00:45:44.750
the town council because of his large family to take the roof off of this

649
00:45:44.751 --> 00:45:48.890
building and provide him with more space,
more space.

650
00:45:48.891 --> 00:45:50.420
Because he had all of these children,

651
00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:54.260
he had relatives and he had students living in these corridors.

652
00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.770
And what did they do to earn their keep?
Well,

653
00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.160
they copied music for him.
So this is sort of,
if you will,

654
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:03.620
the corporate headquarters of Bach Inc.

655
00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:07.820
This is where all this great music is being generated from his wife and am I

656
00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:12.560
Galena?
Bach was his principle a copyist.
All right,
so that's uh,

657
00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:14.960
that's what,
uh,
where they live.
Now,

658
00:46:14.961 --> 00:46:17.960
Bach of course has mentioned died in 1750.

659
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:22.760
A historians are profoundly grateful to him for that because it gives us a nice

660
00:46:22.761 --> 00:46:24.890
clean cutoff by which to end.

661
00:46:24.891 --> 00:46:29.891
The Baroque era and of Bach and of baroque died in 1750 of a stroke at age 65.

662
00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.150
At the time,
he wasn't thought to be particularly important.

663
00:46:35.151 --> 00:46:39.020
So they relegated box remains to an outlying parish church.

664
00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:43.220
As Mozart Played Bach,
Beethoven Played Bach,
Felix Mendelssohn played Bach.

665
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:47.870
People began to realize that Lo and behold,
they'd had a genius in their midst.

666
00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:52.340
So they x whom Bob to see if he was a genius.
Let's take a look at this.

667
00:46:52.341 --> 00:46:57.341
This is what they did in 1895 they dug him up and they photographed him because

668
00:46:58.791 --> 00:47:02.660
this was the period in which there was a theory of genius.
Interestingly enough,

669
00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:07.310
that the genius had a smaller brain then the normal human being,

670
00:47:07.311 --> 00:47:10.520
not a larger brain,
but a smaller brain.
Uh,
in any event,

671
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:12.920
Bach's brain turned out to be just completely normal,

672
00:47:12.921 --> 00:47:16.910
and this was presumably a lot of nonsense.
But when they dug him up,

673
00:47:16.911 --> 00:47:21.470
then they repositioned him and they repositioned him at the high altar.

674
00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:26.620
And this marker here is now where the remains of Bach are situated and they tore

675
00:47:28.641 --> 00:47:33.641
out the south side Bank of glass in the church and constructed based on the

676
00:47:35.531 --> 00:47:40.390
photograph that you saw at the beginning of our hour,
that photograph,
um,

677
00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:41.861
uh,

678
00:47:41.861 --> 00:47:46.861
they constructed stained glass windows with titles of some of box works there so

679
00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:51.931
that the musical tourists such as myself or I hope you someday we'll go to

680
00:47:52.091 --> 00:47:53.580
Leipzig.
Uh,
to,
uh,

681
00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:57.640
enjoy the wonderful music of this city and the wonderful music of Bach.
Now,

682
00:47:57.641 --> 00:48:01.600
the last thing we're going to do on our way out the way the cantata within is

683
00:48:01.601 --> 00:48:06.280
that the entire congregation would stand up and everybody together would sing

684
00:48:06.281 --> 00:48:10.310
the corral tune.
We're not going to do that because you already did that.
Uh,

685
00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:14.290
but we'll just play this music as you go out to give you a sense of how the

686
00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:15.520
service would end.

687
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:21.870
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

688
00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.020
<v 0>yeah.</v>

689
00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:33.350
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

690
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.680
yeah.
