1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.000
Let us begin then with the subject of today,
which is the few,

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.710
every educated person should know what a few gifts.
Why?

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.030
Because it's an intellectual model and intellectual paradigm.

4
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.440
That surface is in a number of disciplines.

5
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.170
For example,
uh,
in poetry,
oddly a,

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.370
if you've ever peaked at Thomas,
uh,
uh,

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.850
ts Elliot's the four core tents,

8
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.650
the structure of a few is referenced there frequently we could go to literature,

9
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.820
uh,
a novel written about the same time,
Aldous Huxley's point,
counterpoint,

10
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.970
it's framed in the shape of a fugue.

11
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.450
We could go to geology geologists.

12
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:50.451
Occasionally we'll say this particular crystal has a few like structure to it

13
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.120
turning to painting.
There are painters of the 20th century,

14
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:56.910
I can name at least three fronts.

15
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.040
Koepka all the violence and Josef Albers who used to be the dean of our own

16
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:04.440
school of art and architecture,

17
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.150
they all painted fugues and we will be looking at Albers fugue,

18
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:11.730
which actually happens to be in your textbook,
uh,

19
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:14.190
when we come to section a this week.

20
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.990
So be sure to bring your textbooks to section this week cause cause we'll,

21
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.860
we will be using them.
I'm interested in the few also because of this book.

22
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.690
Douglas Hofstadter's girdle,
Escher,
Bach.
Oh my,
it's heavy.

23
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.180
My mind,
I didn't bring in my copy.

24
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:33.420
This is the bass copy that Linda was kind enough to pull over.

25
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:35.460
Mine is a paperback.
It's not this heavy,

26
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.570
but in a way this is indicative because it's heavy reading.

27
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.550
Anybody ever peaked at this book in hand?
The other good is it Adam?
Yeah,

28
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.210
Adam.
Uh,
what course did you read this in?

29
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.670
Um,
recommended by friends.
I can follow about the first 25 or 30 pages or so.

30
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:57.150
Then when it gets to the math,
it really gets over my head.

31
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.180
But what it is is an attempt to use the fugue is a way of bringing a common mode

32
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:07.170
of understanding to the visual arts,
to mathematics and to music.

33
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.840
The musician that is,
uh,
foregrounded here of course is js Bach,

34
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:16.680
the master of the few.
So we want to know about how fuse operate.

35
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:19.410
So let's take a take a look at the specifics here.

36
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.820
The term fugue actually comes from an old Latin word [inaudible],

37
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.410
which means flight or to fly.
So in a few of what you get is one,

38
00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:30.810
a voice going ahead,

39
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:33.810
leading ahead and another voice following it.

40
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.460
Now I just used the term voice there.
Fuchs can be written for,

41
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.563
uh,

42
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.750
actual voices sounding voices or they can be written for instruments such as

43
00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:48.900
the,
the violin or the cello individual lines.

44
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.010
It can even be written for instruments that can play several lines are several

45
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:56.010
parts at once.
The piano can do that.
The Oregon can do that,

46
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:59.740
even the guitar and occasionally the violin will be asked to do that.

47
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.110
Fuse had been written for as few as two voices.

48
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:05.561
You asked,

49
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:10.450
you could have a two voice few up to as many as 32 voices.

50
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.850
Uh,
and uh,
they can be,
uh,
as mentioned,

51
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.220
um,
uh,

52
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.310
written for and they are best perhaps performed on these keyboard instruments

53
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:27.430
that have the capacity to play many lines,
many parts,

54
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:32.260
many voices that once the greatest collection of fuse as you may have,
uh,

55
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.760
may have bumped into,

56
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.870
heard about or at least heard the term is this collection of preludes and fugues

57
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:42.220
by Js Bach called the well tempered clavier.
First of all,
what's a prelude?

58
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.440
It's just a warm up piece.

59
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.500
Started getting relaxed.

60
00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:53.040
You get to see your fingers get a feel of the keyboard or the of the loot or

61
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.550
whatever it might happen.
Maybe be a prelude to pre play a warmup.

62
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.990
And then we go on to the meat of the issue,
uh,

63
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.090
which is the fugue now,

64
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.560
why is this called the well tempered clavier?
Anybody know?

65
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.130
Anybody have,
that's an odd term.
Clivia just means keyboard.

66
00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:15.540
The well tuned to keyboard thoughts there.
What,

67
00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:18.560
what was going on in box day is that they didn't have a keyboard

68
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.473
<v 1>dead.</v>

69
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.280
<v 0>They didn't have a tuning system in which all of the pitches were exactly a half</v>

70
00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:26.114
step apart,

71
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.070
somewhere slightly closer together and then others farther apart.

72
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.930
And the key of c actually had a slightly different sound than the key of d.

73
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.880
And it's only in the 18th and 19th century that we gradually shifted from an

74
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.960
unequal keyboard to an equally tuned to keyboard.

75
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.990
So Bach is kind of part of this transition to the equal tuned keyboard.

76
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.500
He was getting close to the equal temperament of the modern keyboard.

77
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.690
And that's why he called it the well tuned a keyboard.
And it,
uh,

78
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.640
by tuning it this way,
it allows you to modulate to all keys.

79
00:05:04.641 --> 00:05:08.420
And that's what he did in this collection.
He wrote two books,

80
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.680
one in 17,

81
00:05:09.681 --> 00:05:14.681
about 1722 and he was in Curtin and another about 1742 when he was in Leipzig.

82
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.860
And in each of these books we have a total of 24 preludes and fugues one the

83
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:27.291
prelude and fugue in c major one prelude and fugue and C minor one prelude and

84
00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:33.461
fugue in c sharp major and one prelude and fugue in c sharp minor and so on.

85
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.050
It goes all the way up the keyboard in that fashion to books or those.
And that,

86
00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:42.680
this is kind of standard fodder for those that want to become professional

87
00:05:42.681 --> 00:05:46.520
musicians.
Okay.
So that's what,
that's what,
uh,

88
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.410
that is,
uh,
about the well tempered,
well tempered clavier.

89
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.680
Uh,
we've been referencing Bach here and nobody of course,
uh,

90
00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.200
wrote better fuse than j s Bach.
Uh,
some continued,

91
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.290
some continued to write fuse.
Mozart wrote some cubes,
Haydn wrote some Fuchs,

92
00:06:04.291 --> 00:06:08.060
Beethoven wrote some cubes and so on.
And even into the 20th century,

93
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:12.240
we have a few composers,
Paul Hindemith used to teach at Yale.
Uh,

94
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.550
Dmitri Shostakovich.
Uh,
they wrote,
but generally speaking,

95
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:19.340
the few has its heyday in the Baroque period,

96
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.970
roughly 1600 to 1750,

97
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.470
the hay day of Bach and Handel.
How To fugues work?

98
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.903
Well,

99
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.110
they start out as mentioned with one voice leading forward and then another

100
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:36.770
voice imitates that voice.
Exactly.
Now,

101
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:38.870
if that following voice,
here's a question.

102
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.430
If that following voice imitated the leader exactly from beginning to end,

103
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.540
what would we have?

104
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.343
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

105
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.680
<v 0>Around.
Okay,
good.
That's what we would have around,
or we could call,
use the,</v>

106
00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:58.120
have the fancier music word,
a Canon Canon round the same thing.

107
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.120
One voice imitating the other.
Exactly from beginning to end.

108
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.410
But in a few of what happens is after the main idea,

109
00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:09.430
which we'll be calling the subject,
the main idea is stated,

110
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.350
then the parts go,
they're independent ways,
uh,
generating counterpoint.

111
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.600
But they're not exact.

112
00:07:16.601 --> 00:07:21.340
They're not a precise duplications of the rhythms and the pitches of the

113
00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:24.520
leaders.
So what we could do would be to visualize this in a,

114
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.540
in a sort of a crude way up here,
do you have a leader?

115
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.290
And then a follower and the follower duplicates the main idea,

116
00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:34.960
which we're going to call the subject for a period of time,

117
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.520
but then it kind of breaks off.

118
00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:41.020
So voices will come in and duplicate a certain amount of material and then break

119
00:07:41.021 --> 00:07:43.840
off and go their own way.

120
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.650
So that's a good way of thinking of the beginning of a few,

121
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.210
which we will call the exposition.
I'll come back to that point in a moment.

122
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.000
Notice here,
I've put a little silly little tree up here.

123
00:07:55.001 --> 00:07:57.370
We could say that we have the,
uh,

124
00:07:57.371 --> 00:08:00.610
the genus polyphony here and we've gotten monophonic texture,

125
00:08:00.611 --> 00:08:02.500
homophonic texture and polyphonic texture.

126
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.660
So within polyphonic texture we have non imitative texture and then a stream of

127
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:12.690
imitative polyphony and then two forms of imitative polyphony rather strict.

128
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.760
Exactly.
Strict imitative polyphony,

129
00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:19.810
the cannon and less strict imitative polyphony is a few.

130
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:20.830
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

131
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.110
<v 0>Okay.
Questions about that so far?</v>

132
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:25.290
<v 2>Okay.</v>

133
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:28.800
<v 0>All right.
Let's go back to the beginning of a few.
We have this opening melody,</v>

134
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.430
the distinctive part of it,
which we're going to call the subject.

135
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.300
That's just what we call the melody and a few the subject and the way this works

136
00:08:36.301 --> 00:08:38.370
is in a,
in a few,

137
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:42.930
each of the voices in turn will come in with that subject.
One we'll start out,

138
00:08:42.931 --> 00:08:43.860
then another will come in.

139
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:48.390
Then another will come in after all of the voices are in.

140
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.170
We're at the end of what we call the exposition of the few.

141
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.250
Now we've had the term exposition before.
Where was that?

142
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:03.170
Uh,
over there.
Elizabeth.
I hear you.
Yeah.
Sonata form.

143
00:09:03.171 --> 00:09:07.780
It's not a allegro form.
So we and what do we,
what do we mean by exposition?

144
00:09:07.781 --> 00:09:10.090
There was a chance where you present all the,
all the,

145
00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.450
the themes and we talked about first theme,
the second theme,
closing theme.

146
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.000
We're here in a few.
We have just one theme,

147
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.970
but everybody's going to get a chance to present it.

148
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:20.850
And after everyone has a chance to present it,

149
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.990
every voice has a chance to present it.
Then we're finished with the exposition.

150
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.630
All the voices have exposed the theme in their range.

151
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.040
After that we go on to what's called the episode of a few.

152
00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.540
What happens in an episode?

153
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.720
Well usually it modulates key and the vehicle through which composers frequently

154
00:09:39.911 --> 00:09:43.540
modulator is melodic sequence either up or down.

155
00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:46.030
You can kind of move around.
By using sequence,

156
00:09:46.031 --> 00:09:50.400
you can get to different places by using sequence.
So it tends to be uh,

157
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.790
a contrapuntal because it's using little motives from the theme.

158
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.020
It modulates,
moves around a lot,
goes to different keys,
sounds a bit unsettled.

159
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:04.420
If you were to think back on Sonata Allegro form and try to find an analog for

160
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:09.160
Sonata Allegro form in the few episode,
what would it be?

161
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:13.930
What is the episode of a few like in Sonata Allegro Form Roger?

162
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.930
Exactly the development section.

163
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.130
So these episodes in a few are sort of mini development sections.

164
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.200
So visualize if you will,

165
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:27.160
we start out here with the exposition in which all voices present the subject.

166
00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:29.740
Then you have this kind of free period in which the,

167
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:34.240
the motive out of the subject has played with develop moved around different

168
00:10:34.241 --> 00:10:35.980
pitches.
Then the subject,

169
00:10:35.981 --> 00:10:40.981
we'll come back in a new key because we've modulated in the episode and subject

170
00:10:41.021 --> 00:10:45.160
in just one voice,
new key.
Then another episode in which there's modulation,

171
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:50.200
more counterpoint,
more movement and other statement of the subject in a new key,

172
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.030
uh,
another episode.

173
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:56.200
Now their statement of the subject and on it goes until we run out of energy,

174
00:10:56.201 --> 00:10:58.870
usually about after four or five minutes or so.
Uh,

175
00:10:58.871 --> 00:11:03.580
at which point the composer will bring the subject back maybe in the base or in

176
00:11:03.581 --> 00:11:07.880
the soprano in a very prominent range in the tonic key.
And we haven't,

177
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.400
since this is a very solid moment,
yes,
this few is ending.

178
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:16.060
It may be the throw upon one or throw one or two courts on at the end,
but that,

179
00:11:16.061 --> 00:11:18.580
that's it.
Uh,

180
00:11:18.581 --> 00:11:23.581
so it's a complex form but maybe not quite as complex as a allegro form.

181
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.430
Uh,
what's a definition and if you're taking notes there,

182
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:30.280
what's the definition of a few?
Well,

183
00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.930
I wrote a definition of a few and I will read the definition out of the
textbook.

184
00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.410
Students don't like this,
I found if you read out of a textbook,

185
00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:43.080
but I ought to be able to do this since I wrote the textbook.
Okay.
So,
um,

186
00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:47.440
I'm going to read,
read a good definition of a few cubes,
a definition of the few,

187
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.650
uh,
composition for two,

188
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.030
three or four parts played or by voices or instruments,

189
00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:00.300
which begins with a presentation of a subject in imitation in each park.

190
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.740
The episode,
excuse me,

191
00:12:02.741 --> 00:12:07.090
the exposition continues with modulating passages of free counterpoint,

192
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:12.280
the episodes and further appearances of the subject and ends with a strong

193
00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:15.970
affirmation of the tonic key.
Well,
you can't write all that down,

194
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:19.390
but if you want to just put in your notes for definition of few,

195
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.190
see page one 44 of the text.
Fortunately,

196
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:25.720
as I say,
uh,

197
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:30.750
it's easier to hear and look at fuse a than it is to define them.

198
00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.390
All right?
Now,
today we're going to do something different.

199
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.230
It's the only day in our course where we're actually going to look at music.

200
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.870
Okay.
We've handed out music for you,

201
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.130
an entire piece and entire fugue by J s Bach here.

202
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.260
And ideally I guess we'd be in the,

203
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:51.430
in a seminar format and we'd all be standing around the piano here.

204
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:56.940
So my first question for you is for how many voices is this few written?

205
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.440
Look at just the first page and look vertically and see what's the maximum

206
00:13:06.011 --> 00:13:11.011
number of pitches you have sounding simultaneously at any one moment.

207
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:23.360
Um,
Caroline,
is it
three?
Okay.
Yeah,

208
00:13:23.361 --> 00:13:25.790
we have three.
If you,
if you look through there,

209
00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.180
there sometimes at the very beginning there's just one voice and then there are

210
00:13:29.181 --> 00:13:32.630
two voices and then the three voices,
three lines.

211
00:13:32.631 --> 00:13:36.110
But it never gets to be more than three lines.

212
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:41.410
So we have our x position here and it consists of three statements of the

213
00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:46.400
subject.
We're going to call these three voices or,
or lines,

214
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.600
the Alto,
the soprano,

215
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.650
and the base,
which comes in,

216
00:13:54.651 --> 00:13:58.220
in bar a seven there.
So here's the little bit of the beginning of the,

217
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.690
okay,
so that's our exposition because each of the voices,
Alto,

218
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:35.250
a soprano and base has come in and presented as this subject.

219
00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:38.070
Then we have bars nine and 10 here.

220
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.120
What's that?
If I just go,

221
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.990
Jerry,
what's that?
It's a melodic sequence.

222
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.270
And which direction is it going up or down?

223
00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.410
Well that's hard.
Maybe harder than you think.

224
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.770
<v 2>Okay.</v>

225
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.940
<v 0>Really going down.
Not because the line is going down,
but we're starting</v>

226
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.350
each time on the successively lower pitch and this sequence takes us.

227
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.190
So we've started in this kind of tonality,

228
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:39.540
which is minor,

229
00:15:39.541 --> 00:15:44.541
but now by the time we've gotten to bar 10 and 11 particularly,

230
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.750
he's modulated.

231
00:15:48.751 --> 00:15:53.310
So that's what our little episode was in bars nine and 10 there.

232
00:15:53.311 --> 00:15:58.311
It allowed us to move from a minor key to a major key and now the subject comes

233
00:15:58.561 --> 00:16:01.740
back in and as you can see what voices it in there?

234
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.840
What voices the subject in in bar 11 pretty straightforward.

235
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:10.440
<v 2>Somebody yell it out</v>

236
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.760
<v 0>the print.
Okay,
so here,
heads up in the subreddit.</v>

237
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.220
So there we are.
Nice statement of the seam in a major in the soprano.

238
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.670
What happened in that little episode?

239
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:43.480
We were here and now we're here module.

240
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:48.620
He did again to minor and is there in bar 15 where's the subject?

241
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.513
<v 5>Which</v>

242
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:07.820
<v 0>Chris Alto Park.
Good,
thanks.
So there it is in the alto part.</v>

243
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.590
That's an interesting moment there because we've got a three voice few and how

244
00:17:12.591 --> 00:17:14.990
many hands does the performer?
Half obviously too.

245
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:20.270
So at some moments these hands are going to have to share a subject and that's

246
00:17:20.271 --> 00:17:23.150
what happens in that voice.
When you play this.
Take a look there.

247
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:27.830
The very last measure of that page,
it must be 15 starts out,

248
00:17:27.831 --> 00:17:29.330
my left hand is playing here

249
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.160
and then the left hand has to get out and pick up the counterpoint in the base

250
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.160
and the right hand takes over that subject.

251
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.710
But it's the job of the pianist.

252
00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:56.700
There are the keyboard she was ever plaintiff to really lean on the inside of

253
00:17:56.701 --> 00:18:00.480
your hand there because when you normally play play these instruments,

254
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:04.070
there's a tendency,
and I'm sure Santana Santana's far better keyboard said,

255
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.650
I will confirm this.
There's a tendency to roll the either side.

256
00:18:07.651 --> 00:18:11.730
It's easy to play bass and soprano.
It's hard to do is to get those inner voices.

257
00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:13.390
So there's the keyboard player after,

258
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.860
so you can really hear that.
If you didn't hear it,

259
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.590
then that wasn't a good performance.
All right,

260
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.200
now that takes us across the page.

261
00:18:34.201 --> 00:18:38.400
There were now back in a minor key.
Uh,

262
00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:42.960
this is bar 16 and 17 in bar 17,
18,

263
00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:46.200
19 beginning of 20.
We have an interesting moment.

264
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:51.060
It's called invertible counterpoint.
What do we mean by that?
Well,

265
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.320
he has a motive.

266
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:53.603
<v 1>Okay,</v>

267
00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:01.270
<v 0>we're going to call that motive a,
and he has another motive motive be.</v>

268
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:10.910
So there's B and the alto a in the base and together they sound sort of like

269
00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:12.024
this.

270
00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:22.010
Okay,
cool.
Now,
next three bars.
What happens?
Well,

271
00:19:22.011 --> 00:19:22.870
he takes be

272
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.410
and so he takes B and puts that below a,

273
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.810
he's switching the positions.
You're a is,
no.

274
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:35.240
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

275
00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.530
<v 0>Both of these motors are coming up in rising sequence.</v>

276
00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:45.910
So let's go back to the beginning of 17 there and we'll listen to the switch.

277
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.510
<v 4>All right?</v>

278
00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:05.720
<v 0>So that uh,
goes by very quickly.
Right.
How long do you think it took the Bach to,</v>

279
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.160
to figure that out?

280
00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:08.910
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

281
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.330
<v 0>I don't know.
He's a very good contrapuntal.
This may be boom like that.</v>

282
00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.610
I'd have to sit there.
Santana,

283
00:20:14.611 --> 00:20:17.290
how long would it take you to figure out some invertible counterpoint?

284
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.150
Did you get think of one melody,

285
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.570
think up another Melly they would be a harmony against it,

286
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.260
but yet you could flip the two and it would still sound pretty darn good.

287
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:27.810
They take a long time though.
It kind of work that out.

288
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.520
So that's what's kind of neat about few,

289
00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:33.750
there's all these intricacies imbedded in them that almost sale by the,

290
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.040
the general listener unless we happen to have the music right in front of us and

291
00:20:38.041 --> 00:20:39.810
couldn't dwell on them.
All right,

292
00:20:39.811 --> 00:20:44.811
so that takes us over now to bar 20 where we are here,

293
00:20:44.821 --> 00:20:49.821
back I guess tonic of c minor and the theme is up in the soprano.

294
00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.980
And then one final statement and the soprano.

295
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:46.370
A couple of interesting points there.
When we concluded this piece,

296
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:48.620
we had this sale.

297
00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.650
What's a little bit surprising about that?
We're ending a piece,

298
00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:05.240
it's called a feud number two in c minor.
We are ending here with

299
00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.510
sounds like a minor chord at the end.
Now the major court.
All right,

300
00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:13.440
so he's changing.

301
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:18.590
This is a standard gambit gambit from the late 16th through the 18th century

302
00:22:19.381 --> 00:22:22.440
last chord.
They didn't like to end pieces in mind or maybe it's too depressing.

303
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.000
Well,
I do that.
So yeah,

304
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.300
the major third up there,
but that's called a picker d third,

305
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.710
maybe from the old French word [inaudible] which means sort of sharp or pointed.

306
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.970
So we have a pointed ending there.
We have a major day.
Here's another Po,
uh,

307
00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:47.830
issue,
uh,
when we're all,

308
00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.740
since we're on the topic of points and that's called a pedal point.

309
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:56.080
What was j s Bach known as in his day?
Was he known as a great composer?

310
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.160
Who was he known is,
how do you earn a,
basically how they earn his living?

311
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:07.230
He played the,
if more,
yeah,
he played the organ.

312
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.470
He was the Great Oregon Virtuoso of his day.

313
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.740
And I think at the end of this particular few here,

314
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.530
it's interesting he just has that line sit there.

315
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:24.350
Okay.

316
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:28.970
On the Oregon that would just be fine and Dandy because you'd put your foot down

317
00:23:28.971 --> 00:23:30.800
there on that low c,
you know we go

318
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.560
<v 5>and</v>

319
00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.300
<v 0>that tonic note would continue to hold.</v>

320
00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.800
But if you were writing this for the clavichord or the Harpsichord or the piano,

321
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:43.490
what happens to that sound?
Once you hit it,
it dies away.

322
00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.970
I think in the end of this piece,
buck had the sound of the organ.
He didn't read,

323
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.510
he wasn't thinking,
Jesus,
this is really for,
for Harpsichord or something.

324
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.520
I better write this like this.

325
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.640
So we get a nice strong tonic.
Sounded the end.

326
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.480
He may have had the sound of the Oregon there in his ear,

327
00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.040
but perhaps the important point here is this idea of a pedal point,

328
00:24:11.041 --> 00:24:15.490
cause we've actually even talked about that before in the Yohanis Brahms'

329
00:24:15.491 --> 00:24:19.360
variations on the theme of Haydn that was performed Saturday night.

330
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.810
Pedal point is what anybody can define pedal point for us.

331
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.073
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

332
00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.960
<v 0>Well what goes on,
it's pretty simple.</v>

333
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.833
<v 6>Oh Roger.</v>

334
00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:35.880
<v 0>Yeah.
A base,</v>

335
00:24:35.881 --> 00:24:38.850
holds a note and basically you're just kind of running over top of one,

336
00:24:38.851 --> 00:24:43.710
possibly two.
Harmony's up above it,
but it all sounds continents a consonant.
So,

337
00:24:43.711 --> 00:24:48.210
uh,
just be issuer of the idea of one that note usually in the basis holding,

338
00:24:48.211 --> 00:24:49.750
holding,
holding for a long period.

339
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.820
<v 6>Um,
Linda,
turn them</v>

340
00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:54.340
<v 0>volume down the hero.
How many?</v>

341
00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.693
<v 6>Wow.</v>

342
00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:01.260
<v 0>Okay.
Uh,
any questions about that fugue by Js Bach?</v>

343
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.240
Anybody want to ask anything about that?

344
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:12.930
Marcus,
that works for you?
Ghana.
Okay.

345
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:17.480
<v 6>That he has no question.
Um,
Frederick.</v>

346
00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:28.500
<v 0>Oh,
okay,
good.
Yeah.
Thanks for bringing that out there at the end.</v>

347
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.280
We could even have your right for me be even five notes played at once.

348
00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:35.310
So this idea that you,
once you have three parts,

349
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.680
you can only have three parts or once you have a five voice,

350
00:25:37.681 --> 00:25:41.730
few you can have no more than five voices breaks down at the very end.

351
00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.790
Why would you imagine the composure would want to do that,
Fredrik?

352
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.980
Well,
well no,

353
00:25:50.981 --> 00:25:53.650
it's not that hard because you don't want you to get used to the idea of a c

354
00:25:53.651 --> 00:25:56.920
major triad.
You have musician would look at that end and say up,

355
00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.260
I've just got to see major trying to manage a bang down on it.

356
00:25:59.261 --> 00:26:02.660
So that's not hard technically or intellectually,
but why would it come?

357
00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.300
They raised a very interesting point here.

358
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.030
Why would a composer want to add more notes at the end?

359
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.650
I think it's a pretty straight forward idea.

360
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:11.510
<v 6>Deep Michael Micheal.</v>

361
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:16.820
<v 0>Yeah,
just make it louder.
Make it's more snores,
big bang endings sort of thing.</v>

362
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:20.330
Yeah.
To tell the listener once again that this is something special that we're

363
00:26:20.331 --> 00:26:24.560
probably at the end.
All right,
so let's listen to just a bit of this.

364
00:26:24.561 --> 00:26:26.330
We've had one version of this.

365
00:26:26.331 --> 00:26:30.200
Let's listen to a contemporary jazz ensemble playing.

366
00:26:30.201 --> 00:26:34.940
It starts out with a kind of guitar synthesizer with a piano here,

367
00:26:34.941 --> 00:26:38.370
and then we'll see what other instruments are.
Here's,

368
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:41.570
here's the jazz rendition of the same few by Bach.

369
00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:58.953
<v 4>Ooh,</v>

370
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:17.190
<v 0>what instrument is playing this baseline?</v>

371
00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:30.711
Okay,

372
00:27:30.711 --> 00:27:35.711
here we are in bar 1315 subject in the inner voice.

373
00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.240
Here's our invertible counterpoint

374
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.233
<v 3>switch,</v>

375
00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.570
<v 0>subject soprano,</v>

376
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:13.680
just modulating from one key to the next tier.

377
00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.540
And here they actually do repeat that tonic note.

378
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:40.943
<v 3>Oh</v>

379
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.510
<v 0>cool.
And then what they do is go off and improvise.</v>

380
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:50.900
But it's interesting the similarity between jazz style and jazz style and

381
00:28:51.651 --> 00:28:54.140
Baroque music.
Why is that the case?
Well,

382
00:28:54.141 --> 00:28:58.490
Baroque music has a lot of driving rhythm is kind of regular regular rhythm in

383
00:28:58.491 --> 00:29:01.910
it.
And jazz has a kind of regular pulsating rhythm in it too.

384
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:07.090
I asked you what instrument was playing the baseline there and uh,

385
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.800
Daniel,
you started going like this,

386
00:29:09.801 --> 00:29:14.720
so what were you doing the double bass of this year?
But is it a,
is it bode?

387
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.120
No,
it's a pluck to Pitsa Ocado double bass.

388
00:29:17.121 --> 00:29:21.800
But that's a standard instrument in a jazz quartet,
Jazz,
jazz ensemble.

389
00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.840
But it's a,
it's a very strong base.

390
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.690
And Baroque music also has a very strong base,

391
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:31.730
so lots of similarities between contemporary jazz and a baroque music.

392
00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:36.080
And sometimes these jazz ensembles like to get to this baroque music and,

393
00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:40.490
and resurrect them in a modern idiom.
Uh,
all right.

394
00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:45.250
So normally a few cause a freestanding piece where you could have an entire

395
00:29:45.251 --> 00:29:50.140
movement written as a Fugue,
uh,
heightened court,
last mover,

396
00:29:50.141 --> 00:29:54.370
Haydn quartets.
We'll sometimes do that.
A Beethoven Piano Sonata might do that,

397
00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:57.040
but usually they're freestanding pieces.

398
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:02.250
Occasionally you run into a few that's embedded inside another movement.

399
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:07.710
You might have a movement in Sonata Allegro form and you'll get to a particular

400
00:30:08.021 --> 00:30:11.560
section,
let's say the development section.
And the composer says,
well,

401
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:15.190
I want to write a few here as my development.
When that happens,

402
00:30:15.191 --> 00:30:17.700
we call it a few Gato,
a few gato.

403
00:30:17.701 --> 00:30:21.700
So if you got doe is a few placed in the side,

404
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:22.900
another form.

405
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.550
So we're going to listen to an example of this from the romantic period in which

406
00:30:27.551 --> 00:30:30.050
we have the young composer George Bz.

407
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:34.900
He was exactly you were age when he wrote this.
He was 19 years old.
Uh,

408
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.540
George Bza wrote this symphony,

409
00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.750
there's a lovely romantic strings sound sort of break your heart string sound.

410
00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:43.030
And then we have a segway.

411
00:30:43.031 --> 00:30:46.900
We have kind of a romantic transition here as he changed his mood.

412
00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.480
And then a few we'll break out.

413
00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:53.560
And it will start in the bottom voice.
I'll tell you that much.

414
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:57.160
And my question to you or my challenge to you is this,
what's the order?

415
00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.630
Let's say,
and I'll tell you this,

416
00:30:58.631 --> 00:31:00.820
we got a four voice fugue that's going to start here.

417
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:05.040
Can you track the order in which the voice is enter?
You know,

418
00:31:05.041 --> 00:31:08.410
you've got the four,
you got the bass,
tenor soprano or bass,

419
00:31:08.411 --> 00:31:10.750
tenor alto and soprano or soprano,
Alto,
tenor bass.

420
00:31:10.751 --> 00:31:14.050
They can come in any one of four different,
um,

421
00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:17.170
we'll probably even more than four mute permutations,

422
00:31:17.171 --> 00:31:21.040
but the order might be a alto base,
soprano tenor.

423
00:31:21.041 --> 00:31:25.510
It might be based Alto,
tenor soprano or soprano,
alto,
tenor and bass.

424
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.381
And we don't know.

425
00:31:26.381 --> 00:31:29.800
And that's your challenge here to see if you can track the subject.
Here we go.

426
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:33.063
Yeah.

427
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:02.663
<v 4>Okay.</v>

428
00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:29.040
Okay.
Let's talk

429
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.160
all four voices here.
Is there,

430
00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.900
<v 0>could anybody on just one hearing?
Tell me what the order was.</v>

431
00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:50.090
Uh,
okay.
Let me chew,
uh,
somebody,

432
00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:54.450
the differs here.
Robert,
I haven't called on you this morning.
Okay.

433
00:32:54.451 --> 00:32:57.360
Start with Beta.
Maybe even.

434
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:09.570
Okay.
Then where did it go?
Yeah,
it actually went to the house

435
00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:18.080
and there then when Tinder.

436
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:26.563
Yeah.

437
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:31.833
<v 7>Okay.</v>

438
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.520
<v 0>And though we're going to get a,
uh,</v>

439
00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:40.600
an episode in which he's going to play with just a motive and then the subject,

440
00:33:40.601 --> 00:33:43.830
we'll come back.
So here are two questions for you.
In what,

441
00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:48.790
which voice is the subject coming back and what's happened to the subject when

442
00:33:48.791 --> 00:33:50.620
it comes back?
It's changed in one way.

443
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:56.190
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

444
00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:07.450
<v 0>stop it there any takers on that?
If we're doing a quiz on this,</v>

445
00:34:07.451 --> 00:34:10.940
we'd give you three or four plagues of that,
which,
which,
uh,

446
00:34:10.941 --> 00:34:12.340
voice did it come back in.

447
00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:23.080
That is,
uh,
not bad.
We would take that,
um,

448
00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:27.130
because it's kind of high 10.
I'm playing a kind of Tinder range here.
Uh,

449
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.820
I think it was more cellos and we'd probably with bassoons would public call

450
00:34:30.821 --> 00:34:34.270
that base base for it,
but,
but fair enough,

451
00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:36.340
tenor and what happened to him,

452
00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:45.820
<v 8>Roger?</v>

453
00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:52.620
<v 0>So He'd modulated to a different key and then gave you the subject in a minor</v>

454
00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:57.190
key.
And that's kind of the way these,
uh,
uh,
fuge operate.

455
00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:00.070
Give you an exposition episode,
which you change key,

456
00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.550
bring back the subject in a different key.
All right,

457
00:35:03.551 --> 00:35:06.190
so we've now had a few from the 19th century,

458
00:35:06.191 --> 00:35:10.360
although we would call it a few Gado because it's embedded in this lovely,

459
00:35:10.361 --> 00:35:13.750
lovely Sonata Allegro Movement.
Um,

460
00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.940
let's turn to a few from the 20th century.

461
00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:19.420
And for this we go to Leonard Bernstein and you can see the playlist up on the

462
00:35:19.421 --> 00:35:20.630
board.
Uh,

463
00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:25.650
new haven used to be a favorite tryout city for Broadway musicals.

464
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:30.130
Deed.
There was a musical entitled never went anywhere.
It was entitled,

465
00:35:30.131 --> 00:35:31.810
we bombed in new haven,

466
00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:37.560
meaning that the tryout of the particular musical was not a success.

467
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.010
And where would they,
where would they try out in new haven?

468
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:44.510
<v 6>What was the great theater for this?
Hmm.</v>

469
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.450
<v 0>That Yale Rep theater and the other takers.</v>

470
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:49.383
<v 3>Okay.</v>

471
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:52.590
<v 0>The Shubert theater.
Yeah.
Actually in that period,</v>

472
00:35:52.591 --> 00:35:55.830
the Yale Rep was actually a functioning,
a house of worship.

473
00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:00.150
It was a church at deputy.
What's now the rep?
Uh,
so was it the Schumer theater,

474
00:36:00.151 --> 00:36:02.550
which has been here for a long,
long time.

475
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:07.680
So Leonard Bernstein came in here with a show in 1952 called wonderful town and

476
00:36:07.681 --> 00:36:10.140
he tried it out there and generally speaking,

477
00:36:10.141 --> 00:36:13.470
and it was a success and he took a download toilet train tracks there to

478
00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:15.840
Broadway,
but he took some music out of it.

479
00:36:15.841 --> 00:36:19.740
So music that he thought actually it was a little bit too complicated for the

480
00:36:19.741 --> 00:36:22.490
choreography that he wanted to to work into.
It.

481
00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.200
Leader took that material and worked it into a freestanding piece called prelude

482
00:36:27.201 --> 00:36:32.150
and fugue and jazz riff.
So we're going to look at now just the,

483
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:36.140
a few good portion of it because it's a very interesting kind of,
phew,

484
00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:37.940
it's a very complex view.

485
00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:41.630
So we're going to start out here and I'm going to break this.
Well listen,

486
00:36:41.631 --> 00:36:46.260
we'll stop and listen and stop,
uh,
so that we can,
um,
uh,

487
00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:50.540
focus on particular passages.
So as we start to listen,
uh,

488
00:36:50.541 --> 00:36:54.170
see how many voices there are in Leonard Bernstein's few,

489
00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.520
have a general sense of what the range is,
Soprano,
Alto base,
uh,

490
00:36:58.521 --> 00:37:01.040
what else do we need?
Oh yeah.
What instruments are playing here?

491
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.250
So that's,
uh,
uh,
the exposition.

492
00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:36.100
And little bit of a development there.
So what instruments?

493
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:39.500
<v 6>Hmm?
Ducks.</v>

494
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:44.280
<v 0>Yeah.
Saxophones.
Yeah.
Okay.
Nealon said,
says saxophones.
These,
right?
Yeah.</v>

495
00:37:44.281 --> 00:37:48.660
So saxophones.
Yeah.
Um,
so we've got roughly how many did you hear?

496
00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:49.593
<v 3>Okay.</v>

497
00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.910
<v 6>Two,
three,
four,
maybe four,
maybe four days.</v>

498
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:58.010
<v 0>Fringe Saxophone,
sorta.
Alto Sax,
maybe Baritone Sax in there.
Um,</v>

499
00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.850
and there was one.
And so we're,

500
00:37:59.851 --> 00:38:04.600
we were playing this out in this rather a syncopated,
uh,
a few stubby top p p p.

501
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:09.400
P.
P.
P.
P.
P.
Papa.
Papa.
Let's listen to it again.

502
00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.050
No,
we don't have time to do that.
But here's one thing that,
that happened,

503
00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:18.200
that kind of sound.
Then after one episode,

504
00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.540
one of the sacs is brought back that Sabine,

505
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:24.100
<v 6>what's it doing there?</v>

506
00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:33.680
<v 0>What is that?
What's the relationship there?
Yeah,
it's just,</v>

507
00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:36.460
it's just inverting.
It was taking the intervals and flipping them.

508
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.380
And that's what composers love to do with fuse.

509
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.540
And we'll be talking about interchangeable parts,

510
00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:45.370
reciprocal relationships with the mathematical quality of fugues.

511
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.900
And so that's what's happening here.

512
00:38:46.901 --> 00:38:51.901
We have a moment of melodic inversion and sometimes in Fuchs and box did this in

513
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:55.750
a musical offering.
He can take his few subjects and run it backwards,

514
00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.090
run it backwards from beginning to end.

515
00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:02.140
So they like to have these kinds of mathematical permutations of these
intervals.

516
00:39:02.141 --> 00:39:04.540
It's a very cerebral stuff,
this few business.

517
00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.860
So there we had just a moment of Leonard Bernstein writing,
um,
uh,

518
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:12.250
a little bit of inversion.

519
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:16.300
Now what we're about to hear next is something of a surprise because we get a

520
00:39:16.301 --> 00:39:19.980
second fugue subject and it's a different fugue.

521
00:39:19.981 --> 00:39:24.410
Subjects did not support syncopated is rather lyrical dog,

522
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.320
something like that.

523
00:39:32.321 --> 00:39:37.321
So it's nice and nice and lyrical and let's listen to how he know full unfolds a

524
00:39:39.341 --> 00:39:43.210
second fugue subject.
So what we have here is called a double few.

525
00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.030
He's got one exposition with one fugue subject.

526
00:39:46.031 --> 00:39:50.650
Now he's going to give us some completely different exposition with yet a second

527
00:39:50.651 --> 00:39:51.490
fugue subject.

528
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:22.120
And then number one comes back.
Okay,

529
00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:25.720
we're going to pause it here because he's now about to do something rather

530
00:40:25.721 --> 00:40:29.770
interesting.
The Bach used to do as well and Bernstein was a consummate musician,

531
00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:33.380
uh,
and studied Bach had bought coming out of his ear,

532
00:40:33.381 --> 00:40:36.190
so he knew about this particular trick.
It's called stretto.

533
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.450
You can design a fugue subject.
Uh,
not only did it could go upside down,

534
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:43.540
but in which the intervals instead of coming in long,

535
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:47.860
this succession could be piled right on top of one another.

536
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:50.830
So the way he sets this thing up to begin with is this,

537
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:53.950
this and maybe this and then this.

538
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.880
But in the next section it's going to go this,
this,

539
00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.740
this and this.

540
00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:04.270
The intervals back up on each other because they had been arranged to be

541
00:41:04.271 --> 00:41:07.960
consonant at key points and that's called stretto.
Uh,

542
00:41:07.961 --> 00:41:11.170
Italian word stretto kind of tight tight entries here.

543
00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.910
So here is a fancy little bit of counterpoint by Leonard Bernstein that once

544
00:41:15.911 --> 00:41:17.320
again goes by very quickly.

545
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:23.143
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

546
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:37.210
<v 0>Now he's going to bring back the two subjects together.</v>

547
00:41:37.211 --> 00:41:37.900
We have one in [inaudible],

548
00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:38.733
<v 4>two together</v>

549
00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:44.283
episode,

550
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:51.470
episode
one,

551
00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.233
two.

552
00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.190
<v 0>So it's a pretty nifty little few of there by Leonard Bernstein with lots of</v>

553
00:42:03.191 --> 00:42:06.670
intricate counterpoint,
uh,
involved in it.
All right,

554
00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:09.280
let's end now with a few of Js Bach.

555
00:42:09.281 --> 00:42:14.281
And for that we're going to turn to an Oregon fugue that he wrote about 17,

556
00:42:17.231 --> 00:42:18.880
10,
17,

557
00:42:18.881 --> 00:42:22.750
10 when he was a young man in Weimar here.

558
00:42:22.751 --> 00:42:24.340
Is that fugue subject?

559
00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:25.773
<v 9>Hmm.</v>

560
00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:34.650
<v 10>Mom bought hot,
hot,
hot,
hot,
hot,
hot,</v>

561
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:39.220
um,
Palm Palm,
Palm Palm,
Todd,
Todd,
Todd,
Todd,
Todd,

562
00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:46.160
<v 0>and on and on and on.
It goes.
What's of interest about this subject?
Well,</v>

563
00:42:46.161 --> 00:42:49.880
two things.
First of all,
uh,
as a sing this,

564
00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.850
<v 10>oh,
Bob,
Bob,</v>

565
00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:54.903
<v 0>what is that?</v>

566
00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.810
Uh,
it's a
Arpeggio.

567
00:43:06.811 --> 00:43:09.030
Yes it is,
but it's an Arpeggio of what

568
00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:16.230
you should try it.

569
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:21.090
Just to minor triad might attract one five,
three,

570
00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.870
one.
If I skipped this note here,
blah,
poppy,
palm,

571
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:29.250
as they come to every strong beat in this team,
every strong beat,

572
00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:33.990
I have a member of the triad that seemed either g,
B flat or d.

573
00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.750
So these trials,
as we said before,
are really the structure,

574
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:42.030
the backbone on which a composer like Bach will place the flesh of a few

575
00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.970
subjects.
So it's very triadic and it sounds pretty secure for that.

576
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.720
Now here's another thing that this fugue subject does and many other few

577
00:43:51.721 --> 00:43:56.640
subjects.
It starts with quarter notes,
Yom quarter,
quarter,
quarter.

578
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:57.540
Then next measure

579
00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:02.480
<v 11>eight,
eight,
eight,
eight,
eight,
eight.
And then we get in here,
eight,
eight d,

581
00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:10.700
<v 0>[inaudible] speed.
Of course,
the beat isn't going any faster.</v>

582
00:44:10.701 --> 00:44:14.390
The tempo is staying the same.
He's simply writing shorter note values,

583
00:44:14.391 --> 00:44:18.200
which has a psychological impact.
As we've said several times of getup,

584
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:22.060
giving the sense of movement gathering speed here.
Uh,

585
00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:24.080
it's like a train pulling out of the station.

586
00:44:24.081 --> 00:44:28.160
We want to get on this train and this thing is really starting to roll after

587
00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.320
five measures or so.

588
00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:35.740
So it's a pretty nifty a fugue subject here and we're going to listen to this

589
00:44:36.541 --> 00:44:39.450
now.
Uh,
and what I'd like to do is the following,

590
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:42.930
we're going to listen to the entire piece in addition to the entire piece.

591
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:46.740
Think about as the,
as the,
uh,

592
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:50.070
voices come in,
think about

593
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.190
where they're coming in.

594
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:58.110
Can you tell me what the trajectory of the voices is in the exposition?

595
00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:01.320
And I'm going to turn out the lights here because sometimes it's good just to

596
00:45:01.321 --> 00:45:03.870
kind of go off into your own world.
Close your eyes.

597
00:45:03.871 --> 00:45:06.720
But I would like you to do the following thing,
kind of lean back,

598
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:11.430
get comfortable,
close your eyes.
But every time you hear,
uh,
the fugue subject,

599
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:12.463
<v 5>hmm.</v>

600
00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:30.490
<v 0>And so on,
every time you hear that fugue subject,</v>

601
00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:34.960
raise your hand so that I know you're recognizing that is the subject because

602
00:45:34.961 --> 00:45:35.710
listening to a Fuchs,

603
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:39.820
it's basically one thing differentiating between a passage in which you've got a

604
00:45:39.821 --> 00:45:43.660
statement of the subject and an episode where the Ain't no statement of the

605
00:45:43.661 --> 00:45:44.770
subject.
Okay.

606
00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:49.570
So this is a three minute and 22nd few and we're going to listen to the whole

607
00:45:49.571 --> 00:45:52.960
thing,
but do raise your hand when you think that fugue subject is in there.

608
00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:49.740
<v 3>Soprano,
Alto,
tenor,
and now baby.</v>

609
00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:07.840
Yeah,
there it is.

610
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.870
One of those inner voices and it's a little bit disguise,
but it's in there.

611
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:07.500
Nice long sequence.

612
00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:19.563
Yeah.

613
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:22.640
<v 0>All the way up on top.</v>

614
00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:36.050
<v 3>Their
episode descending sequence,</v>

615
00:48:36.051 --> 00:48:36.884
this time,

616
00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:45.850
rising sequences here.

617
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:51.250
Polling sequence,

618
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.800
the base.

619
00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:13.630
Okay.

620
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:16.600
<v 0>Okay.
So that's a wonderful few by Js Bach,
and we can,</v>

621
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.370
we're going to talk more about this in section,

622
00:49:18.371 --> 00:49:21.280
this idea how you can run your few parts this way,

623
00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.200
or you could order them this way.

624
00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:26.530
You can think of these constructs mathematically,

625
00:49:26.531 --> 00:49:27.820
or you can think of the musically,

626
00:49:27.821 --> 00:49:30.940
but you're all working with the same kind of material as you go out.

627
00:49:30.941 --> 00:49:32.920
One final few by Glenn Gould,

628
00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:38.160
who is going to teach you how to write a few as he sings a fume to you.

629
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:40.243
<v 3>Okay?</v>

630
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.680
<v 12>Right.</v>
