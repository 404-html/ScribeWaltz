WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.120
So today we're going to engage modernism where we talking principally about the

2
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:07.560
music of Igor Stravinsky.

3
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:12.561
I should also mention Arnold Schoenberg just as Verdi and Wagner were the

4
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:18.150
principal composers of opera in the 19th century.

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.970
So sharenburg and Stravinsky where the principal proponents not only of

6
00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:27.870
instrumental music,
but some vocal music in the first half of the 20th century.

7
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:32.310
So we want to keep them,
uh,
carefully positioned on our radar screen here.

8
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.380
Igor Stravinsky,
of course,
was a Russian composer born in Saint Petersburg.

9
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:41.300
You had the dates up there on the board,
I'm sure.
Uh,

10
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.310
he studied with Nicholi Rimsky-korsakov who wrote one famous piece Shaharazad,

11
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:49.230
which I used to hear all the time as a kid.
Uh,

12
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.290
and then the caught the eye of Sergey Diaghilev.

13
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.280
Sergey Diaghilev was an emprasario.
What's an Empresario?

14
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.130
Who can tell me what an Emprasario is?
It's a fancy word for Thaddeus.

15
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.410
A producer.
Okay.
Think of the Broadway show.
The producers.
He simply,

16
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.770
I'm a producer and what the Aga Lev was producing Wa and importing into Paris

17
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:21.570
from Russia was modernist art from Russia,

18
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.370
modernist painting,
modernist ballet,
modernist art,
music,

19
00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:28.020
and modernist opera.

20
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.280
So that's what we want to keep in mind with regard to segregate Diaghilev and

21
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:36.570
four Diaghilev Stravinsky composed early in his career.

22
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:40.710
Three important ballet scores and you have those titles up on the board there.

23
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.590
Firebird with its date,
1909,
uh,

24
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.290
Petrouchka 1911 and then uh,

25
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.160
the rite of spring in 1913.

26
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.940
Now the first of these ballets to really show a heavy modernist content is not

27
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:05.541
so much Firebird but more the second if this troika here Petrouchka it's modern

28
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.770
because of the new approach to rhythm in the romantic music that we had been

29
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:17.640
listening to,
we would hear these long,
somewhat amorphous melodies,

30
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.270
a amorphous in terms of the rhythm.

31
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.260
But now here with the advent of modernism in the 20th century,

32
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.640
we get a much more driving a type of rhythm.

33
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.360
It almost in some ways goes back to the driving rhythms of the baroque except

34
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:34.980
with one major difference.

35
00:02:34.981 --> 00:02:37.980
And that is that these modern rhythms are highly irregular.

36
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.930
What we get oftentimes are irregular meters.

37
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.910
What would you imagine an irregular meter is?
Anyone want to feel that one?

38
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.030
You regular meters?
Well simply said,

39
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.170
it's not a succession of two,
four,
two,
four two,
four two four three four three,

40
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:59.410
four but two,
four,
five,
four four four two,
four,
six,
four,
three,

41
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:04.150
eight and so on.
Each measure can have a different meter.
In addition,

42
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:07.990
we also have this phenomenon called Polly meters in which you could assign to

43
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:11.140
your clarinet to play in three,
four and your bassoon to play in four,

44
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:14.770
four and maybe your violence in [inaudible] 78.
So as a result,

45
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.920
you get something of a disjunctive rhythmic texture here,

46
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.900
disjointed rhythms.
And the second,

47
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.220
second aspect of this,
uh,
uh,

48
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.520
approach to modernism has something to do with the orchestration.

49
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.140
There's a great deal more emphasis now on percussive affects.

50
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.320
New Instruments are added to the orchestra instruments called the Xylophone,

51
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.020
the Glockenspiel,
the Celest Sta.

52
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.080
And if you want to see a picture of some of these,

53
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.290
you could open your textbook at some point.
Just write this in your notes.

54
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:55.090
See figure,
I think I wrote it down here.
Figure 10 you know,
excuse me,

55
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:58.120
five number 10,
chapter five.
Number 10.

56
00:03:58.121 --> 00:03:59.800
You can see some of these percussion instruments.

57
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:04.801
But basically they're just either sticks or pieces of metal bars that you beat

58
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.830
with sticks.

59
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.810
Or in the case of the Celestica you activate with a keyboard.

60
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:15.250
So we've got these two things here,
the driving,
but you irregular rhythms.

61
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.910
And we also have this new approach to orchestration.

62
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.030
So let's listen to a bit now of Igor Stravinsky is ballet of 1911.

63
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.263
Petrouchka

64
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.610
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

65
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.290
<v 0>okay.
So we'll stop there.
Uh,</v>

66
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:01.720
Jacob and I were fooling around with this in the background,

67
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:05.110
trying to figure out what these meters we're seeing if we could pick up these

68
00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:09.910
different changes,
but they are as how,
how'd we do not?

69
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:12.110
Well,
Jacob says we did not do well.
Uh,

70
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.910
because without the score it's difficult to anticipate which meter is going to

71
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:20.290
come next.
And you heard the intense percussive affects there.

72
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.440
But Stravinsky,

73
00:05:21.441 --> 00:05:25.720
his most radical statement of modernism occurs not here in Petrouchka,

74
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.490
but two years later in the right of springs,
uh,

75
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.570
it premiered in Paris,
uh,
in,
uh,

76
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.620
may of 1913 and it's become something of a cultural icon.

77
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:42.420
This whole idea of the rite of spring.
Indeed.
Uh,

78
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.560
I have this book and I've had it for quite a while.

79
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.440
Rites of Spring by Madras Eckstein.

80
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.000
It's often required reading in the history department here,
history programs.

81
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.440
Anybody ever run into this pedestrian read anything by Modrus Eckstein?
Well,

82
00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.590
the is,
you're the great war and the birth of the modern age,

83
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:05.591
but it's not accidental that he is playing off of this title of a ballet of Igor

84
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.120
Stravinsky because the ballet of Stravinsky was a kind of watershed,

85
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.570
a touchstone.
The benchmark from which modernism,
uh,
can be,
uh,
uh,

86
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.930
calculated and against which it can be measured.

87
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.510
So when the audience arrive there at the Tiatros shows the lycee,

88
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.060
the auto shows in Esa,
in Paris,
and that theater still is there.

89
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.210
You can walk down the Avenue,
Montana,
it's over that hair,

90
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:35.570
maize is and Gucci and all of these fancy stores.

91
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.630
It's there in Paris and go in and still hear concerts there.

92
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:42.350
I've heard concerts in the [inaudible],
so you can still do that today.

93
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:44.930
It's still functioning as one of the major concert halls in Paris.

94
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:49.730
So in any event,
May,
1913,
the audience arrives,

95
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.980
they are there to hear a Russian ballet.

96
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.380
What kind of music do they expect to hear?
Well,

97
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:57.110
let's listen to what they were expecting to hear.

98
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.610
<v 2>So whose music is this?
Chuck Kowski,
anybody layer,</v>

99
00:07:08.611 --> 00:07:11.550
you know,
the title level,
Swan Lake,

100
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.380
lots of Tutus and potted does up there and moving around.

101
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.290
So this is what they thought.
Russian ballet.
So they arrive.

102
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.870
<v 0>So they arrive,
let's go in and set up,
uh,
take their seats,</v>

103
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.880
the lights go down,

104
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.470
everybody is properly addressed for this particular occasion.

105
00:07:33.471 --> 00:07:35.870
And here's the kind of music that they hear.

106
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.810
So that's a radically new sound,

107
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:04.580
radically new approach to modern art.
And indeed,
once again,

108
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:09.230
if you're asking generally cultural historians to put their finger on the moment

109
00:08:09.231 --> 00:08:11.240
that constitutes the beginning of modernism,

110
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.760
it would probably be this moment of the performance of the,

111
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.740
of the rite of spring.
How did Stravinsky create these radically new sounds?
Well,

112
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:22.430
he did.
So in a,
in a couple of ways,
uh,
we've,

113
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:26.830
we've been talking before about this idea of um,
uh,

114
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.470
irregular meters.
Let's see how these play out.

115
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.310
The music that you were just listening to,
not the pitches,

116
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.240
but the durations are up here on the board and they're all,
as you can see,

117
00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:41.840
quarter notes,
but they are grouped in different sorts of ways,

118
00:08:41.841 --> 00:08:46.460
group by these accents.
So I've asked Jacob Jacob's up here to grab his viola.

119
00:08:46.461 --> 00:08:51.461
Now he's going to come over and play this sequence for us following the accents

120
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.080
and then he will be joined by our guest artist.

121
00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.173
<v 1>Okay.</v>

122
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.500
<v 0>Okay.
So that's the way it goes.
That's all the,</v>

123
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.950
all the violin or the viola stir violence.
All the strings do.

124
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.900
Let's do that one more time with our guest artists.

125
00:09:17.901 --> 00:09:19.220
We're going to add percussion now.

126
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.673
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

127
00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.120
<v 0>Ah,
what a virtue.</v>

128
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

129
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.080
<v 0>Okay.
Um,</v>

130
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:48.620
so that was what Jacob don't go away completely,
uh,
here.
Uh,

131
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.580
one other point,
watch Jacob's hand.
When he is doing this,

132
00:09:52.581 --> 00:09:55.070
this is not the way string players normally play.

133
00:09:55.071 --> 00:09:57.200
He's doing something extra ordinary here.

134
00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.450
<v 1>Okay?</v>

135
00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.850
<v 0>And it tells us,
we don't hear that when you placed your,</v>

136
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.930
He Yadi Yadi Utah,
you duty.

137
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.710
But that's what he's playing now.

138
00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:18.700
Okay.
So what's he doing?
He's playing all with
down bows.

139
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.110
Everything down boat and that's it.

140
00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.960
That's counter intuitive district or your normal string teaching.

141
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.470
So run back there if you wouldn't set the slide projector force.

142
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:31.000
So we've taken the string instruments instead of using them as these warm

143
00:10:31.001 --> 00:10:35.380
virbrato filled communicators,
we're uh,
in the string family.

144
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.110
We're sort of turning them in now to percussion instruments.

145
00:10:38.111 --> 00:10:39.730
That's a very percussive effect.

146
00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.330
So not only do we have new percussion instruments,

147
00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:47.620
we have progressive affects with the existing,
uh,
instruments.

148
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:52.600
Uh,
and uh,
perhaps most important here is the cord,

149
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.100
the music that Stravinsky is setting forth here.
It's an odd odd court.

150
00:10:57.101 --> 00:10:58.600
It's an odd occurrence.

151
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:03.220
What he's got here is a perfectly innocuous e major triad.

152
00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:09.660
I'll put it down here in October.
And then on top of it,
he's got a seventh chord,

153
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:11.090
a starting on e flat.

154
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.320
And either each of those each by itself is this rather consonant,

155
00:11:19.121 --> 00:11:20.530
but you put the two of them together.

156
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.910
So this is a good example of another way this modern isn't in music is created

157
00:11:29.911 --> 00:11:34.800
and that's through the use of very obviously a poly cord.
Interesting point.

158
00:11:34.801 --> 00:11:38.520
I'm going to go to some slides now because it's exactly at this time in the

159
00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:43.350
history of art that painters started doing this same kind of thing.

160
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.380
So we're going to go to the first slide here.
Who painted this place?

161
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.810
Nice,
nice and loud.
I hear it in the back.
Picasa.
Okay.

162
00:11:52.811 --> 00:11:56.030
Three by Pablo Picasso.
Uh,

163
00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:01.110
and what we have here is sort of one musician kind of out of phase with himself.

164
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.150
Uh,
one musician in an another musician,

165
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:09.070
slightly irregular position against it.
Next type of slide here.

166
00:12:09.071 --> 00:12:13.690
This is,
uh,
George Brock,
a woman that with violin,

167
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.770
a little bit difficult to see the,
um,
the woman there,

168
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:21.490
but in the context of this highly fragmented violin.

169
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:25.210
Now we're going to go on the one greys a violin,

170
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.840
and now we're going to go onto a slide taken from a book published in 1916 by,

171
00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:36.220
uh,
Albert Glee's.
Uh,
can you focus that just a little bit?
Forest Jacob,

172
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:40.750
there's a focus knob up there.
Uh,
go the other way with it.

173
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.490
Oh,
well,
but we can see the,
we can see the point here.

174
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.170
I'm off to the left.

175
00:12:49.171 --> 00:12:52.920
We have just a square and that square then as being rotated against itself,

176
00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.430
it's being rotated itself against itself in another position,

177
00:12:56.431 --> 00:12:59.040
rotate it in itself and then not yet another position.

178
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.690
And that's all these musicians are doing.

179
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.560
They're taking one triad and then taking the triad right next to each other so

180
00:13:04.561 --> 00:13:09.480
the triads are slightly out of phase with each other and ultimately it produces

181
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:14.490
a rather dissonant,
uh,
configuration.
Okay.
That's all we,
that's all we need here.

182
00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.670
Uh,
by way of the,
of the slides.

183
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.171
Well,

184
00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:30.171
the premier of the rite of spring was just as dissonant as some of these

185
00:13:30.991 --> 00:13:35.700
paintings are indeed.
It,
it caused a scandal.
It caused a riot.
It was,

186
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.330
it created the most,
uh,
infamous I guess,

187
00:13:39.331 --> 00:13:43.230
riot in the history of music.
And,
uh,

188
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.890
we have,
uh,
fortunately,
and they are contained here in modules,

189
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.530
Eckstine's book among other places,
some primary source accounts,

190
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:55.350
people that were there at the time telling what it was like to be at this

191
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.170
premier.
So here are a couple of direct quotes,

192
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:03.000
then ensued a battery of screams,
countered by a foil of applause.

193
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.010
We ward over art.

194
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:10.350
I liked that ward over art or what some thought was art,
but others didn't.

195
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.580
About 40 of the protesters were forced out of the theater by the police,

196
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.830
but that did not quell the disturbance,

197
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.220
the lights in the auditorium or turn fully on.

198
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.170
But that did not still the disjointed ravings of a mob of angry men and women.

199
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:29.550
Uh,
in quote,
and here's another,
a direct quote.

200
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.640
I was sitting in a box in which I hadn't rented.
One seat.

201
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.420
Three lady sat in front of me and a young man occupied the place behind me.

202
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:41.550
He stood up during the course of the ballet to see more clearly the intense

203
00:14:41.551 --> 00:14:45.360
excitement under which he was laboring thanks to the potent force of the music

204
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:50.630
portrayed itself presently when he began to beat rhythmically with his fish on

205
00:14:52.461 --> 00:14:57.440
the top of my head
and quote,
well,

206
00:14:57.441 --> 00:14:58.430
what is it again,

207
00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:03.431
specifically in this music of Stravinsky that causes this kind of reaction?

208
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.640
Let me list for you.
Let me enumerate five things here.

209
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.210
One heavy dissonance.
We just heard some of that,

210
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:17.500
that kind of sound almost a cluster type dissident heavy dissonance created by

211
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.690
Paulie chords in which we have triads in.

212
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.920
These tribes are only a half step apart.
The roots are only a half step apart.

213
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.270
So one heavy dissonance,
too much greater reliance on percussion,

214
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:34.280
Timpani,
Glockenspiel,
Celestia,
that sort of thing.
Three,
as we saw with Jacob,

215
00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:38.750
the use of stringed instruments as percussion instrument.

216
00:15:38.751 --> 00:15:42.920
So a new use of these traditional instruments.

217
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.950
And even the piano,
there's banging on the piano to the percussion.
Uh,

218
00:15:46.951 --> 00:15:49.610
it was a piano is technically a percussion instrument,

219
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.140
but so particularly lyrical one.

220
00:15:51.141 --> 00:15:56.141
Well it's not so lyrically used here in the modern idiom number for uh,

221
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.980
an increased use of woodwinds.
The strange fall into the background,

222
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:06.130
the woodwinds with their potentially bright Riddell sound are now four grounded

223
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:11.450
and fifth,
uh,
this idea of rhythm driving rhythms.
Yes,

224
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.600
but your regular rhythms and Paula and Polly meters and your regular meters all

225
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.080
creating this kind of disjunctive a affair.

226
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.550
So let's listen now to a passage out of Stravinsky's,
rite of spring.

227
00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:26.540
You heard one of them.

228
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:31.690
Let's listen to another one in which all five of these elements a sound at once.

229
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.043
<v 1>What</v>

230
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.790
<v 0>we have track five.
Oh,
okay.
At 50.
Yes.
Oh,</v>

231
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.060
all right.
That's what I'm sorry.
Let's go ahead then.

232
00:16:55.950 --> 00:17:00.950
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

233
00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:19.170
<v 0>so what do you think?
Do you like that music?
Brian?</v>

234
00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:22.080
You've been a good student here who showed up virtually every lecture.

235
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:26.530
I see you out there.
What do you think of this?
Just different.

236
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.890
It's different,
more fast paced,

237
00:17:31.891 --> 00:17:35.890
more upbeat,
kind of like a slap in the face.
Uh,

238
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.230
who doesn't like it ended.
Okay.
Caroline.
Caroline on this person out there,

239
00:17:40.231 --> 00:17:41.940
she doesn't like it.
At the end of the day.

240
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.940
Are you going to go home when it's time to relax and put on this music?

241
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:50.280
Probably not.
Uh,
do I like music?
Yeah,

242
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:53.550
I really do like this music.
Um,
I love this music,

243
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:57.810
but I've heard it a lot.
Uh,
and when I first heard it,
I didn't like it.

244
00:17:57.811 --> 00:18:00.390
So the one of these things like sort of oral spinach or whatever,

245
00:18:00.391 --> 00:18:03.390
you've got to really get used to it over over the years.

246
00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:05.370
Mushrooms or whatever it might happen to be.

247
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.000
I first heard this piece in 1967 when I was a ta.

248
00:18:09.001 --> 00:18:11.220
I had to teach it and I didn't really know it.
Uh,

249
00:18:11.221 --> 00:18:16.221
and then I had the honor and pleasure of hearing it performed live in Paris in

250
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:18.490
1970.
Uh,

251
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.660
and it was really an epiphany because I was sitting there,

252
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:25.200
I remember it distinctly.
It was in a boxing arena of all places,

253
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.590
but they had an elevated stage and the dancers came out and they started going,

254
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:33.000
oh,
oh,
that kind of thing.

255
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.680
And the whole arena began to shake it.
Whoa.
I now understand.
I get it.

256
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:42.330
It's not just the music.
Music is just part of this total artistic experience.

257
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.310
It's a kind of sympathetic vibration,
uh,

258
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:50.290
in conjunction with the kinetic experience of the dance that really brings all

259
00:18:50.291 --> 00:18:51.660
of this to life.

260
00:18:51.661 --> 00:18:56.640
So music here is just a kind of catalyst for the ballet and to really begin to

261
00:18:56.641 --> 00:19:00.840
appreciate something such as this Stravinsky's approached to modernism.

262
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.630
We've kind of,
uh,
we do in fact have to see it to,

263
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.660
to experience it fully.

264
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.050
And that's really what we're going to do here next.

265
00:19:10.051 --> 00:19:13.080
We're going to do that in section starting today.

266
00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:18.030
We have a wonderful video for you of the reconstruction of the rite of spring

267
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:21.060
because the initial choreography a,

268
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.840
which is an important part of this was lost.
So I'm a woman,

269
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.690
a choreographer came along,
Millicent Hodson,

270
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.400
and she reconstructed all the choreography for this dance and then they filmed

271
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:34.740
it.
So this is a wonderful opportunity to see this.

272
00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:39.660
We'll be talking about this in a section starting today.
Okay.

273
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.310
We're finished with our brief introduction to modernism and uh,

274
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:48.020
where do we stand now in our course?
Uh,

275
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.500
well obviously we were pretty much at the end of it.
Uh,
what do you have to do?

276
00:19:52.501 --> 00:19:57.030
What remains for you to do
Zach?
What you gotta do?

277
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.980
You gotta do your last paper.
Each ta will assign that last paper.

278
00:20:01.981 --> 00:20:05.730
What else do you have to do?
Prepare for the final exam,

279
00:20:05.731 --> 00:20:07.380
we will be sending you a prep sheet.

280
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.970
The final exam I believe is Wednesday the 17th at 2:00 PM and we'll be in this

281
00:20:11.971 --> 00:20:15.990
room.
Other things?
Yeah,

282
00:20:15.991 --> 00:20:18.810
the last six listening exercises.
And I think that's about it.

283
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.960
And of course in addition there's a review section,
uh,

284
00:20:21.961 --> 00:20:26.040
that I and one or two of the TA's will be doing a week from today,
right back,

285
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.660
right back in here.
So,
uh,
is that the end of today?
No,

286
00:20:30.661 --> 00:20:32.570
that's not the end of today.
We have,
uh,

287
00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:37.350
a good half hour left and I'd like to work just with one the piece,

288
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.640
um,
and,
and one composer a at the end of the course.

289
00:20:41.641 --> 00:20:44.700
I'd like to do a piece that's really,
uh,
that I love.

290
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:49.480
It doesn't really teach you much of anything.
It's an odd sensation.

291
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:53.530
Oftentimes there are really lovely pieces that I would like to incorporate in

292
00:20:53.531 --> 00:20:55.570
the textbook and in this program generally,

293
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.710
but I can't do it because they don't really teach us anything.

294
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.750
We were listening to one in section just intro music the other day,

295
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.150
uh,
by Samuel Barber.

296
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.810
Anybody know who wrote a famous piece ever?

297
00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:15.170
But did they move that famous piece by Samuel Barber is that is Elizabeth Ral

298
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.740
arou the Adagio for strings by Samuel Barber.

299
00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:22.610
Americans sandwich.
Beautiful.
We should ever,

300
00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:25.030
everybody should download it for 99 cents.
It's just gorgeous.

301
00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.870
But we don't really learn anything from,
well,
this is a piece that we,

302
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.380
that we're about to hear,
that we will learn only what really one thing about,

303
00:21:32.381 --> 00:21:35.740
and that is the idea of an orchestral lead.

304
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.690
So I'm going to go back to one of my favorite composers and that is Gustaf

305
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.360
Moller.
We talked a little bit about Gustav Mahler,
uh,

306
00:21:43.361 --> 00:21:48.361
when we had our lecture on the symphony in the 19th century and we said that

307
00:21:49.691 --> 00:21:54.691
Mahler was of Jewish descent from what is now a portion of the Czech Republic

308
00:21:55.301 --> 00:21:59.770
who came into Vienna to study music.
He started as a pianist,
became a conductor,

309
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.400
and basically he earned his living as a conductor.

310
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.630
He got small time jobs out in the provinces and then ultimately worked his way

311
00:22:07.631 --> 00:22:12.631
back to Vienna where he became the conductor of the Staats opera in Vienna.

312
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.660
And if you ever go to Vienna and you should all go to Vienna,

313
00:22:16.661 --> 00:22:19.780
and it's an incredibly musical city.
Everywhere you go,

314
00:22:19.781 --> 00:22:23.650
you see these silhouettes of Mozart.
It is so cool.
So you have to go,

315
00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.830
you have to go to,
I mean,
you can't walk a block without seeing Mozart,

316
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:30.580
it's to die for.
Um,
so there we are on the range Straw.

317
00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:35.530
So with the great Stuart's opera,
and this is where Gustav Mahler conducted,

318
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.120
it's still there.
Um,
but Mahler was a difficult person to get along with.

319
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.450
I suppose.
Oftentimes great artists are geniuses are,

320
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:48.130
they tend to be self referential and maybe rightly so.
Uh,
but in any event,

321
00:22:48.131 --> 00:22:51.460
he was an orchestral tyrant.
His players didn't like playing for them.

322
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.820
And after 10 years they didn't renew his contract.
In effect,

323
00:22:54.821 --> 00:22:59.500
he was fired in Vienna,
but as good fortune had it,
he,
um,
uh,

324
00:22:59.501 --> 00:23:02.440
was able,
or that time there was an opening in New York City.

325
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.790
So he comes to New York to conduct first the metropolitan opera.

326
00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:10.270
And then a year or so later he took on what was to become the New York

327
00:23:10.271 --> 00:23:14.770
Philharmonic.
So there he is the principal conductor.
Now in New York City.

328
00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:20.800
Interestingly enough,
uh,
on two occasions,
on two occasions,

329
00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.550
Mahler,
um,
came to new haven.

330
00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.110
He came to new haven.

331
00:23:26.111 --> 00:23:31.111
He brought a first was in 1910 he brought the New York Philharmonic to new

332
00:23:32.831 --> 00:23:35.860
haven.
And where,
where did they perform?

333
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.580
Where would you imagine they perform?
Woolsey.
Hall.
Okay.

334
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:47.240
Woolsey Hall Woolsey Hall was built for Gustav Mahler.

335
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.780
No,
that's not really true,

336
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:55.910
but it gets across the point that Woolsey Hall was built to be a concert hall

337
00:23:55.911 --> 00:23:58.250
for what Gustaf Moller represented,

338
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:02.090
which was the apotheosis the ultimate flourishing,

339
00:24:02.091 --> 00:24:05.450
although they didn't know what was the ultimate at the time of this great

340
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.360
instrument,
which was the 19th century orchestra.

341
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:12.340
So Mahler brings the New York Philharmonic to Woolsey Hall.

342
00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.550
Next time you're in Woolsey Hall,

343
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:17.090
think of Gustaf Moller standing on those boards there.

344
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.420
And as good luck would have it again,

345
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:25.160
it was reviewed in of all places.
As you can see by the handout for today.

346
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:29.330
Dot.
Um,
the Yale daily.
Okay.
How about that?

347
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:33.920
The daily reviews Gustaf Moller astonishing.
Okay.

348
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:38.180
Astonishing.
And I didn't darn it,
I didn't bring my glasses today,

349
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:42.770
but you can sort of look at the,
look at the review there.
Uh,

350
00:24:42.771 --> 00:24:46.970
and it talks about the repertoire.
What,
uh,
what did he,
what did he perform?

351
00:24:46.971 --> 00:24:49.070
First of all,
they slightly misspelled his name.

352
00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:53.120
There's no e on Gustaf and the way he spelled it,
but that doesn't really matter.

353
00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:54.243
Um,

354
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.970
what did they perform at this concert conducted by Mahler in Woolsey Hall?

355
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.030
What's it say there,
Elizabeth?
Okay.
Sound phony.

356
00:25:05.031 --> 00:25:08.600
Fantastic.
The basis of what you're listening.

357
00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:11.630
Exercise 34.
Okay,

358
00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.780
so that was one of the big pieces are ones that you have just engaged.

359
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.020
What else please?
Okay.

360
00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:21.980
Bach orchestral suite doesn't say which one,
doesn't matter.
What else?

361
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.340
Yeah,
that's good.
Until oil and Spiegel's Mary Pranks.

362
00:25:28.341 --> 00:25:32.720
That's another one of these tone poems like Zara through stress and like death

363
00:25:32.721 --> 00:25:37.450
and transfiguration by Strauss.
And there was also,
um,
a,

364
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:41.420
a pianist there.
And what did she perform all Olga summer off

365
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:48.450
the Grieg piano concerto,
but no music by Mahler because in his,
uh,

366
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:53.300
day,
uh,
Mahler was thought to really be more of a conductor,

367
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:57.130
a conductor than he was a composer.

368
00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.580
We'll come back to that point in a minute.

369
00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:03.530
The second time that Mahler came to new haven was the next year,

370
00:26:03.531 --> 00:26:04.760
1911.

371
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:09.950
He went to what was then called new haven hospital.
Why?

372
00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.670
Because he had a heart condition.
Uh,

373
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:17.660
and I gather and we have in our Mitch today a specialist who can talk to this

374
00:26:17.661 --> 00:26:21.710
more directly than I,
um,
a streptococcal infection,

375
00:26:21.711 --> 00:26:25.160
a lingering streptococcal infection in the area of the heart,
uh,

376
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:27.320
that had greatly weakened his heart.
Uh,

377
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.260
so the doctors at Yale New Haven Hospital in new haven,
hospital's,

378
00:26:30.261 --> 00:26:32.630
there's really nothing we can do for you.
He goes back to New York,

379
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:37.430
it goes immediately back to Vienna and he dies within six weeks of this heart

380
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.140
condition.
And we have,

381
00:26:39.141 --> 00:26:43.680
and I'm delighted to say Dr. Jean James Hines has been with us all semester.
Jim,

382
00:26:43.681 --> 00:26:47.520
thank you for your attendance.
Uh,
a cardiologist can use been here.

383
00:26:47.521 --> 00:26:49.470
You may thought that this was just accidental,

384
00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:53.610
but in case I was thinking this morning,
uh,
we'd never told you that we had,

385
00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:57.240
if your heart begins to palpitate when you're listening to all this really great

386
00:26:57.241 --> 00:26:59.860
music and you become aphasic or something,
like,

387
00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:03.400
we have an attendant here ready to serve you in the form of doctor height.

388
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:07.710
So you've been in good hands all along.
And thank you Jim,
for,
for being here.

389
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.790
Uh,
so,
uh,

390
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.440
let's take a look at some of the things that Gustafsson Wall are composed here.

391
00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.640
I think we've got a list up on the board.
Okay.
Uh,

392
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.590
symphonies nine symphonies.

393
00:27:22.591 --> 00:27:27.070
Why is everybody composes nine symphonies and then they die.
Uh,

394
00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:32.480
I stop at eight a company he composed also nine symphonies.

395
00:27:33.091 --> 00:27:35.630
He composed nine symphonies.
Um,

396
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.310
and if you like Mauler and I hope you will come to light.
[inaudible].
Uh,

397
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.740
I think there's an entry path into these symphonies.
Start with number four.

398
00:27:43.741 --> 00:27:46.380
It's the most user friendly.
Then number one,

399
00:27:46.381 --> 00:27:51.060
we played s extra x out of number one in that symphony lecture.
So,
you know,

400
00:27:51.061 --> 00:27:55.890
that's,
it's a great piece to then a symphony number five,

401
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.130
which is worth the price of admission.
Really,
uh,

402
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.500
if for no other reason then the middle movement there,

403
00:28:01.501 --> 00:28:06.120
that Adagietto it's just so heartbreakingly beautiful that no one would want to

404
00:28:06.121 --> 00:28:09.870
miss it.
And then ultimately a little bit more challenging,
symphonies,

405
00:28:09.871 --> 00:28:13.050
bigger symphonies,
a number eight,
and number nine.

406
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.230
Mauler also wrote,
as you can see up there,

407
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.940
two collections of songs they're called,

408
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:22.890
or Kestrel leader.

409
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:28.350
We have this term or Kestrel elite simply means orchestral song.

410
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:33.120
Uh,
we've had the lead before in our course,
uh,

411
00:28:33.121 --> 00:28:37.140
where indeed,
what was the name of the lead that we work

412
00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.193
<v 1>with?</v>

413
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:40.720
<v 0>Composer's name.</v>

414
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:44.710
The name of the piece.

415
00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:48.913
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

416
00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:57.420
<v 0>Okay.
Well that's it.
That's it.
What,
what was the name of the piece?
Elf King.</v>

417
00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:02.100
Thank you Fredrik.
And who has the composure?
Franz Schubert.
Okay.

418
00:29:02.101 --> 00:29:04.380
So we've had a,
that's,
that's a lead for piano,

419
00:29:04.381 --> 00:29:07.860
but now we have a lead for voice and orchestra.

420
00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.540
So it tends to be bigger and more flamboyant.
This is unusual.
It's longer,

421
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.710
it's more colorful,

422
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:18.360
yet it features a single voice singing a,
uh,

423
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.580
a single,
a single text.

424
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:25.670
So we're going to focus on now on one of of Gustav Mahler's or Kestrel,

425
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:27.780
uh,
leads.
Um,

426
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.850
and it's talked about in the textbook there,
uh,
right before impressionism,

427
00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:35.400
uh,
no listening exercise on it.
And as I say,

428
00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:37.980
it's in there just because I think it's a drop dead beautiful piece.

429
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:43.240
And I want to try to proselytize bit with regard to Muller's music.

430
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.650
So it has a text.
Here's the text.
The text is by romantic,
a German poet,

431
00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.100
Friedrich Rueckert.
We're now talking about,
uh,

432
00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:55.960
it had been their belt [inaudible] Coleman by Friedrich Bruker as set in this

433
00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:58.390
collection of five songs,

434
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:03.370
about 19 Oh 1902 and 1802.

435
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.480
Um,
and let's take a look at the German here.
Just for a moment.

436
00:30:07.481 --> 00:30:09.820
It had been their belt up hand and go Coleman.

437
00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:13.890
I become detached from the world.
Um,
and uh,

438
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:15.880
I thought it might be nice to hear,
um,

439
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.540
a German speaker or somebody that speaks pretty good German,
uh,
uh,

440
00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:21.850
tackle this tech.
So I've asked a student,

441
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:26.740
David the Roski cope and to stand up if you would,
um,
uh,

442
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.780
David's applying to med school,
right?

443
00:30:28.781 --> 00:30:30.640
You're going around with all kinds of med school interviews,

444
00:30:30.641 --> 00:30:33.880
but he's putting on his German hat for us,
uh,
this morning.

445
00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.130
So read the first a stroll fee please,
David.

446
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:47.790
Okay.

447
00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:52.050
And let's cut to the last one and a little bit more slowly and the lymph because

448
00:30:52.051 --> 00:30:54.930
it slows down.
So let's,
let's read it a little more slowly.

449
00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:00.770
<v 3>He's speeding.
This job
student,</v>

450
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.960
you'd beads each lab align in minor in mining even in mine and lead.

451
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:09.830
<v 0>Okay,
great.
Thanks very much.
So as you can see here,
uh,</v>

452
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:15.090
this is in a sense old person's music in that this is an individual that has

453
00:31:15.161 --> 00:31:17.560
become disenchanted,

454
00:31:17.561 --> 00:31:22.000
is exhausted from the trials and tribulations of this,

455
00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:25.840
of this world is it says that he had been their belt up.
Hondan good Coleman.

456
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:30.070
I've become detached from the world.
And if you don't see much of me anymore,

457
00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:34.430
I don't really care because as it says in the last trophy,

458
00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:39.330
it been distorb under [inaudible].
I'm dead to the trauma,

459
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.910
I guess of the world in who and is still in beat.

460
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:47.500
And I rest now in a still land,
uh,
labor line.

461
00:31:47.501 --> 00:31:52.501
I'm living alone in my heaven in minded Lieben in mine and lead.

462
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:57.610
And there where it's an interesting play of the word lead because it's not so

463
00:31:57.611 --> 00:32:02.020
much a song.
This is a metaphor for all of his music.

464
00:32:02.021 --> 00:32:07.021
So this is an individual that has become detached from the world and simply

465
00:32:08.081 --> 00:32:12.550
wants to live in the world of music.
So let's listen to a bit of it now.

466
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:13.420
Um,

467
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:18.420
and it starts out with an English horn.

468
00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:22.930
Somebody tell us,
review for us what an English horn is.

469
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:26.090
Talked about this before Jerry.

470
00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:33.410
A lower Obo.
That's right.
A lower oh bone.
It sounds a little bit more and full.

471
00:32:33.411 --> 00:32:37.100
Sounds a little bit nostalgic here.
So we'll here lovely harp underneath.

472
00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:38.660
And then the English horn,

473
00:32:38.661 --> 00:32:43.160
we'll start just one phrase and then the phrase will grow.

474
00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:47.600
It's kind of a cell or a motive growing into a longer melody as we discussed at

475
00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:52.490
the beginning of the course.
Whoops.

476
00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:57.420
Uh,
we need,
let's see.
Track too.
It's okay

477
00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:05.040
of the,
of,
of the red CD.
Okay.

478
00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:10.560
No,
no.
Let's see.
It should be,
have been the single CD that was in here.

479
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.590
It should be city far as shirts.
That in there

480
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:18.950
too of what it should be.
CD three.

481
00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:21.563
<v 2>Okay.</v>

482
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:26.750
<v 0>Sorry.
That's,
it's that red one there.
Yeah.</v>

483
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:30.380
Okay.
How many cds do we have?

484
00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:36.580
<v 2>The thing where it won't
change all the way.</v>

485
00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.350
<v 0>Okay.
Um,
let's shut it,</v>

486
00:33:39.351 --> 00:33:44.351
shut it down then and then see if we can get back to that CD and it should be

487
00:33:44.541 --> 00:33:49.540
tracked to have that,
that CD.
Sometimes our CD player eats our cds.

488
00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:51.530
That's gets it up there and it won't release them.

489
00:33:51.531 --> 00:33:54.110
So we'll have to reconfigure this.
Um,

490
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:57.980
it's an interesting a song in that I'm going to van peer just for a moment.

491
00:33:57.981 --> 00:33:59.120
We've,
it starts out with,

492
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.680
with the harp underneath and the English horn and it's a movement in which there

493
00:34:03.681 --> 00:34:08.060
is no brass whatsoever.
So I believe we have it set up now.

494
00:34:08.061 --> 00:34:11.870
It's not to be an exciting movement.
A much more reflective movement

495
00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:51.030
passes off the melody to a clarinet

496
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.470
and then the voice will come in.

497
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.720
We're gonna pause it there.

498
00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:24.800
Then we will go on to a little bit of material from the climax of the song.

499
00:35:25.351 --> 00:35:26.910
Just by way of a preview here,

500
00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:31.570
we're going to go on now two oh four 47 if you,
if you will,
uh,

501
00:35:31.571 --> 00:35:34.890
where he works up to a peak on this text.

502
00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:38.730
He can labor line in mind and hemo in,
in [inaudible],
in mind,
in lead.

503
00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.680
Little bit of dissonance

504
00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:47.920
back to the tonic.
English born comes back in,

505
00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.010
builds out the melody.

506
00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:12.591
Okay,

507
00:37:12.591 --> 00:37:16.190
now we're going to pause it here because there's one other small point I want to

508
00:37:16.191 --> 00:37:19.820
make and that has to do with a,
what's called a suspension.

509
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
The suspension is something that composure set up in music to sort of make us

510
00:37:25.941 --> 00:37:30.440
feel a particular way and they'll start with this by having a note,
be consonant

511
00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:37.660
and then having moving the harmony underneath of it to a dissonance and then

512
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:42.500
resolving it to a constant like that.
Or maybe,

513
00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.330
and the longer they sit on the dissonance,
the more feeling I think is,

514
00:37:52.331 --> 00:37:56.160
is communicated.
And here at the end of the romantic period,
it tends to be,

515
00:37:56.161 --> 00:38:00.480
they tend to sit on these dissonances inside of the suspension for a long period

516
00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:03.270
of time.
So we're about to hear will we still got it right there.

517
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:07.140
We're about to hear the strings go up and play a suspension.

518
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:11.940
And then the English horn,
we'll do the same.
There it is.

519
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:23.260
Now the English horn will suspend

520
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:31.833
<v 2>dissonance.</v>

521
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.950
<v 0>Okay,
so that's the piece.
Now we're going to do something.</v>

522
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:47.220
We've only done one other occasion in our class and that is the list of the

523
00:38:47.221 --> 00:38:49.560
whole piece from beginning to end.
I'd like to do this.

524
00:38:49.561 --> 00:38:52.900
I'm even a little hokey I guess,
but it doesn't matter.

525
00:38:52.901 --> 00:38:54.870
It can turn off all the lights here as best I can.

526
00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:59.040
And I do this because it gives you a sense sometimes of what,

527
00:38:59.041 --> 00:39:03.720
at least how I engage music oftentimes.
What does it do for us?
Well,

528
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:06.570
we've talked before at the beginning.
It allows us to kind of relax,

529
00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:10.320
center our attention.
You're under a lot of stress at the moment.

530
00:39:10.321 --> 00:39:15.210
This is a,
the sort of climax crunch time in the academic world.

531
00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.600
So this is an opportunity to kind of tune everything out.

532
00:39:18.601 --> 00:39:23.010
Maybe go inside of your own beat here,
your own musical territory.

533
00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:28.170
Uh,
and maybe think of things in the past.
Music is a creator of Nostalgia.

534
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:32.550
Think of things that might be music.
Uh,
uh,
giving us a vision.

535
00:39:32.551 --> 00:39:33.990
Perhaps have a better world,

536
00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.900
a whatever you would like to ever spend you want to put on this.

537
00:39:36.901 --> 00:39:37.621
But we're going to be,

538
00:39:37.621 --> 00:39:42.540
each of us is now going to go into our own zone here for about seven minutes as

539
00:39:42.541 --> 00:39:47.541
we listened to this orchestral lead had been developed on Hung Coleman by Gustav

540
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:48.743
Mahler.

541
00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:29.100
<v 2>Eh,</v>

542
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.650
it's fine.

543
00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:11.220
<v 1>Hey,</v>

544
00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:14.683
Ooh,

545
00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:19.940
Ooh,

546
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:10.753
<v 2>Yay.</v>

547
00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:25.563
Okay.

548
00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.450
Hey

549
00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:53.853
hmm.

550
00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:04.950
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

551
00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.410
Oh,

552
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:30.570
oh,

553
00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.560
I am.

554
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:47.050
<v 0>Okay.
So that's our last piece of music at four.
Listening to music here.</v>

555
00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.120
Now I'm going to tell you what this class was really about.

556
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:54.880
It wasn't about listening to music.
It was about saving classical music,

557
00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:59.560
saving classical music.
Why?
Why would we want to save classical music?

558
00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:04.570
We could spend hours discussing that.
We would want to save it,
arguably,

559
00:47:04.571 --> 00:47:07.210
because it is one of

560
00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:10.870
the things that we value in western culture.

561
00:47:10.871 --> 00:47:13.150
What are we valuers and he about this,
this morning we've got,

562
00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.910
we just had a big election,
right?
We value democracy.

563
00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.520
We value religious freedom.

564
00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:22.870
We value quality of the sexes,
of gender.
What else?

565
00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:25.840
A due process under the law.
We Value Shakespeare.

566
00:47:25.841 --> 00:47:30.430
We Value Leonardo Davinci and the symphonies of Mozart,
for example.

567
00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:33.190
Uh,
and these are very important things.
I think they're worth,

568
00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:36.370
worth fighting for and worth trying to,
trying to preserve.

569
00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:39.220
Recently somebody gave the school of music.
How much money?

570
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:44.650
$100 million to keep classical music alive.
That's a lot of money.

571
00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:48.580
I've done my part.
Showed up here everyday.
Haven't missed a minute.

572
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.600
Now it's time for you to do your part.
What's your part?

573
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:54.490
You have to do the following kinds of things.

574
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:59.350
You have to continue to buy cds and download classical music,

575
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:03.820
uh,
off of iTunes or whatever it is.
Don't steal that stuff.
Why?

576
00:48:03.821 --> 00:48:06.100
If you take that stuff for nothing,
what are you doing?

577
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:10.500
You're taking the livelihood away from Jacob and Santana and uh,

578
00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:13.780
Linda here.
There,
there's the livelihood is musicians.

579
00:48:13.781 --> 00:48:16.060
They've put their Labor into it and you're taking it for nothing.

580
00:48:16.061 --> 00:48:19.690
So download these things.
It doesn't cost all that much to get involved.

581
00:48:19.691 --> 00:48:22.060
Get involved in informal singing groups,
keep your piano lessons.

582
00:48:22.061 --> 00:48:25.120
Have you ever had those kinds of things going on,
local choral groups,

583
00:48:25.121 --> 00:48:26.800
whatever you get out of Yale,
what do you do?

584
00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:30.520
Get on the boards of these artistic institutions,
your local symphony,

585
00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:34.150
your local choral society,
Opera Company,
Neighborhood Music School here.

586
00:48:34.151 --> 00:48:37.330
Get on the board of that and help them.
Those sorts of folks.

587
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:41.800
Most important give music lessons to your children.

588
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:46.900
Adopted or,
or natural.
Why teaches them hard work?

589
00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:48.910
Teaches them to think sequentially,

590
00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:52.060
teaches them various forms of quantitative reasoning.

591
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:57.490
Teaches them also,
uh,
to be disciplined and teaches them to,
uh,

592
00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.920
have a,
a pride in the work product that they,

593
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:04.240
that they ultimately ultimately generate.
So these are the kinds of things that,

594
00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:07.240
that you can do.
I thank you for your attention.

we've had great TA's this year.
And,

596
00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:16.060

I will end by quoting,
thanking you for,
for allowing me to quote here.
