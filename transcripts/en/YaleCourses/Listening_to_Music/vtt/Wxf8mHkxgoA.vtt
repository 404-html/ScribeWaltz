1
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.890
All right,
let's get started.
Here we go again.
That's had some fun again today.

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.060
A notice of course we have the sign in sheet when you come in every morning.

3
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:13.200
Great thing to do as we say.
Ah,
this is not the world's most demanding class,

4
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:14.400
but one thing we do ask you to do,

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.590
he has come to the lectures and come to section.
Um,

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.570
you may know if someday you are,
in fact,

7
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.570
you'll get an email message from me about a half hour after class is over.

8
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.380
So sorry to hear that you were sick this morning.
Uh,

9
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.760
hope you're feeling better very soon.
Uh,
so we do,

10
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:35.820
we do look after these things.
Such an email went out last time,

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.210
but I'm preaching to the converted because you're,
you guys are already here.

12
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.020
So good for you.
Let's continue with the discussion of

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.450
the elements of music who are going to be working today with harmony.

14
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.410
So far we've had two sessions specifically on rhythm to special session,

15
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.150
specifically on melody.
And today we come to harmony.

16
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.810
Harmony is one of the two things that really distinguishes the music of Western

17
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:08.580
civilization.
Western classical music,
western pop music.
What are the two things?

18
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:10.500
Well,
as mentioned before,

19
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.770
this dependence upon a heavy usage of Witten musical notation,

20
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.560
not so much into pop music,
but certainly in the classical music,

21
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.160
writing it all down,
being able to manipulate it in that fashion.

22
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:26.070
So that's one thing that distinguishes western classical music.

23
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.220
And the other aspect of we're talking about today is harmony.

24
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.700
Stop and think about it.
Think about the melodies of China and Japan.

25
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.480
Virtually every and and Islamic countries,

26
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.770
virtually every musical civilization around the world has more sophisticated

27
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:45.150
melodies than we do in the west.
Hours are very blunt in a way.

28
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:48.960
They go from one discrete frequency to another discrete frequency to another

29
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:49.920
discrete frequency.

30
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.840
And they're not making use of all of the material in between in any sort of

31
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.430
nuanced way.
Maybe it's because we're so dependent on the keyboard here.

32
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.690
Uh,
so that's,
that's important to keep in mind.

33
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.660
But let's talk about rhythm for a moment.
Is Western,
uh,

34
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.510
rhythm particularly sophisticated?

35
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:11.370
I was listening as I was coming in this morning.

36
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.730
That'd be [inaudible] and are they had a Strauss waltz playing there?

37
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.720
Oompah whom par par,
how sophisticated is that?

38
00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:22.530
Rhythmically think of African music where you have one downbeat and one pattern

39
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:26.520
working against another downbeat and another pattern.
Caribbean music,

40
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.290
African influence,
the same kind of thing.

41
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:33.291
It's world a head in terms of sophistication with regard to rhythm,

42
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.280
but the one thing that distinguished a western music is this idea of harmony,

43
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:42.930
this concept of super imposing,
multiple pitches,
interesting idea.

44
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.460
You know that,
that you have this,

45
00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:48.120
this sound and you've been another one but another one with another one.

46
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.880
Something like that and you can play with these and and manipulate these in

47
00:02:54.881 --> 00:02:59.520
interesting kinds of ways.
So piling up sounds simultaneously.

48
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.940
This idea of harmony,

49
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.350
it's what makes Western music very special and what we end up with here,

50
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:10.351
I just reached for anything in my office here is the overture to a score of a

51
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:15.901
Mozart opera and look here how many parts we have playing simultaneously.

52
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.420
Some of them may be repeating pitch names,

53
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.950
somebody may be playing see here and somebody else's see up there,

54
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.860
that sort of thing.
There may be duplicating pitch names,

55
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.730
but you could have anywhere up to 10 wellness case about 15 different sounds

56
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:36.940
going at once and you don't get that in other musical cultures.

57
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.330
Let's talk for a moment about chords.
What's a cord?
Will a court,

58
00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:46.331
it's just a simultaneous sounding of two or more pitches.

59
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.220
That's a very basic general definition of a cord.

60
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.010
And a cord can be of course consonant

61
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.920
or it can be
dissonant,
dissonant.

62
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.060
So let's stick with just consonant chords should be working with consonant

63
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:04.960
chords today.

64
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.380
And the most fundamental of the consonant chords is this idea of the triad.

65
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.600
This figure that we call the triad,

66
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.130
it's the building block really of all our harmonies,

67
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:20.410
whether it's a pop or classical.

68
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.780
And we're going to use a lot of pop music today and there'll be,

69
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.730
we'll be pointing up a triax there in this pop music.

70
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:31.390
So what's a triad?
Well,
obviously you get the idea of three pitches,

71
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:32.740
three pitches,
how's it work?

72
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.460
Let's go over to the keyboard and the staff here.

73
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.930
Let's say

74
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.880
we've got a scale and we do have a scale CD.

75
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.650
He have ga BCE.

76
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.440
And I wanted to construct a triad above each of these notes of the scale.

77
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.190
Well,
I take the,
this happens to be a c middle c hears.

78
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.370
So I try it is going to have three pitches you and it spans five letter names

79
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:02.800
and we go one,
one letter name,
two letter names,

80
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:04.780
three later named four letter names,
five letter names.

81
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:09.700
We take one three and five year.
I'm taking cs,
skipping d,
taking III,

82
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:14.701
skipping F and taking g and it gives me this three note aggregate.

83
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.200
Take one,
skip,
take one,
skip take one.

84
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.130
<v 1>Yeah,
Todd,
I'm Bot.
Um,
and we can do the same thing.
Todd,
Todd,</v>

85
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.930
Todd,
Todd,
Todd,
ah,

86
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.050
<v 0>and so on,
right up the,
the scale in that fashion.</v>

87
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.670
No,
this,
as we said before,
we've got this scale and we've got some nodes.

88
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:38.280
Rather important in the scale of tonic is very important.
We said the Yod home,

89
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.730
the leading tone is important.
So with cords and triads,

90
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.410
some are very important.

91
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.120
The tonic is very important and this dominant,
what we call the dominant,

92
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.300
it's not really the most important.
It.
It sort of leads into pools into it,

93
00:05:54.301 --> 00:05:57.640
particularly important.
Setting up the tiny,

94
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.660
it's the next important.

95
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.070
Right below that is this sub dominant.

96
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.110
It often pulls into the dominant,

97
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.220
which then pulls into the titanic in that fashion.

98
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.630
So we would get this idea of here's a chord here,

99
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.230
here's the tonic,
here's the dominated,

100
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.420
there's a subdominant and there's the tunnel.

101
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.050
We can flip this just a little bit.
We could say,
all right,

102
00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:28.490
here's our Tomanek up here.

103
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.290
<v 2>Long bomb bomb bomb</v>

104
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.710
<v 0>go that way.
Tonic subdominant dominant tonic</v>

105
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.990
that way.
So we could go come up from the time or go down from the tiny,

106
00:06:46.991 --> 00:06:47.950
generally speaking,

107
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.480
the composers are more likely to go down from the tonic and then come back up to

108
00:06:52.481 --> 00:06:56.260
the tonic.
Then they aren't likely to go to the other way.

109
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.620
So we've got these three basic chords we're going to talk about.

110
00:06:59.621 --> 00:07:03.280
There are others there that we built on the second and seventh degree of the

111
00:07:03.281 --> 00:07:03.581
scale,

112
00:07:03.581 --> 00:07:08.581
but these are the most important and it's surprising how much music these three

113
00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:12.850
basic chords can accommodate all the things

114
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.863
<v 3>dominant.</v>

115
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.390
<v 0>Subdominant Tanya.</v>

116
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.380
So a lot of lot of,
uh,
music is made in that fashion.

117
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.460
One of my favorite pieces,
and I thought it was because it,

118
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.180
it's a good teaching piece.
Uh,

119
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.850
and I thought it was known just to me and other old codgers is a good cowboy

120
00:07:50.851 --> 00:07:54.390
song called streets of Laredo.
But last night I looked it up on youtube,

121
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.210
not on youtube or iTunes and you know,

122
00:07:57.211 --> 00:08:01.110
there are 139 s the recordings at that that you can buy now.

123
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.470
Johnny Cash Arlo Guthrie.
Um,
but I'd be interested,

124
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.220
anybody ever heard that before?
Raise your hand if you've heard that.
One,
two,

125
00:08:12.221 --> 00:08:15.430
three.
Well,
a few people.
So it's a,
it's a,
it's a cowboy song.

126
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.370
<v 2>Walked the streets,</v>

127
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.013
I

128
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:32.100
was dressed in white linens,
dressed in white,

129
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.760
says call.

130
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.980
<v 0>And as I was singing,
all I was doing underneath was playing the basic harmony,</v>

131
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.320
the courts.
And it consists just of two courts

132
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.223
<v 4>dominant</v>

133
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.613
<v 0>fashion.</v>

134
00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.390
<v 4>Oh,</v>

135
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.020
<v 0>why the courts had,
why,
why do we do that?</v>

136
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:05.760
Why don't we have to change these cords?
Any ideas?
Why don't we,
why don't this,

137
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.743
why don't you just say

138
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.463
<v 3>no street?</v>

139
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.760
<v 4>Why do we change court?
Yeah,</v>

140
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:17.960
the melody changes.

141
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:25.190
<v 0>And because the melody changes to keep banging that same Agri and against it,</v>

142
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.840
it's going to create what a distance and we don't want,
we don't like distance.

143
00:09:29.841 --> 00:09:31.940
There's,
if we're going to have this,
we got to control them.

144
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:40.483
<v 5>Uh,</v>

145
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.360
<v 0>you know,
if,
if,
unless I change that cord underneath when I get up,</v>

146
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:51.380
sorry,
this is,
it doesn't sound very silent for silent night there.
So I need to,

147
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.020
to switch to another

148
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.710
and then switching back to the original one.

149
00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:03.730
So we change chords to make the harmony constant or to make the harmony

150
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.790
harmonious,
harmonious.
All right,
so that,
that's uh,

151
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.830
uh,
something that we need to keep in mind.

152
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.760
Here's something else that's were we're going to ask you to focus on and that is

153
00:10:15.761 --> 00:10:17.560
the rate of harmonic change.

154
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.710
The rate of harmonic change will really be asking you to things.

155
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.580
Is the harmony changing?
Okay?
Can you,

156
00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:28.180
is the harmony changing or is it static?
And if it is changing,

157
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:33.360
is it changing at eight regular or you regular rate by regular rate?

158
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:39.160
Every time of chord sounds it will be holding for exactly the same amount of

159
00:10:39.161 --> 00:10:41.170
time.
Let's go back to streets of Laredo.

160
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.080
<v 3>One,
two,
three</v>

161
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:51.150
<v 1>mano.
Hey.
Aw,</v>

162
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.470
aw,
oh,
aw.

163
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:03.790
<v 0>What do you think?
Regular or irregular?
Regular.
Okay.
Um,
but no.</v>

164
00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:07.540
Uh,
well,
okay,
so that's regular.

165
00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.100
Let's go onto another one.

166
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.090
<v 3>Okay.</v>

167
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.330
<v 0>Doing a lot there in the base to make it more interesting,</v>

168
00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.740
but let's strip that down just to the fundamental core that's underneath that.

169
00:11:20.741 --> 00:11:25.240
So we're targeting,
we're sitting here on the tonic chord and we'll go

170
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:30.230
<v 1>la,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la La Blah Blah,
blah.</v>

171
00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:35.040
La La,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la,
la.

172
00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:36.280
<v 0>We could even count it out.</v>

173
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.440
<v 3>One to two to three</v>

174
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.750
<v 0>to move forward.</v>

175
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.670
<v 3>Oh,
one,
two,
one,
two,
one,
two,
two,
two,</v>

176
00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.040
two,
two,
two,

177
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:49.950
<v 0>three.
Heat to before.</v>

178
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.200
So some chords they're holding for I guess four,

179
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.460
four measures for bars and some for two and some for just one.

180
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.880
So that's an irregular rate of harmony change.

181
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.840
So we're not going to be asking you a is are we did well,

182
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:15.160
what court do we have here and expect you to say subdominant or what chord we

183
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:18.700
have you here expect you to say dominant.

184
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.870
We're going to be working with more fundamental things.
Is the harmony changing?

185
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.830
Is it changing it a regular or irregular irregular rate.

186
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.680
Uh,
okay.

187
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.620
Notice I was playing up here.
Oh,

188
00:12:36.621 --> 00:12:37.454
jingle bells.

189
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.470
So what is it in music that sets

190
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.730
<v 4>the harmony?
What part?</v>

191
00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.840
<v 0>Who,
what's the foundation of harmony?
What instrument plays it?</v>

192
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.910
Where in the texture is the,
are we talking high,
low,
middle,
low?

193
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:10.080
It's the base.
The base is,
it's like these pillars.
I think of architecture.

194
00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:11.050
You get,
you know,
your,

195
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.910
you put these pilings in and then you can build other things around it.

196
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:19.500
Well those basic notes,
the tonic note,
the dominant knows the subdominant.

197
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.560
There's sort of the pilings,
then you can ornament around the pilot.

198
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:24.470
That's just a,

199
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:29.060
I could go in that fashion that would be simple from dominant to tonic or I

200
00:13:29.061 --> 00:13:30.230
could make it a little more interesting.

201
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:37.510
And that's kind of what bass players do.
Uh,

202
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.820
whether they're playing electric bass in a rock band,
um,

203
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:47.410
maybe in even more sophisticated weight and acoustic bass in a symphony or a

204
00:13:47.511 --> 00:13:49.820
double bass in a bluegrass band.

205
00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:56.020
And who is the world's most famous double Bass player in a boot blue grass bed?

206
00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.633
<v 4>Anybody know?</v>

207
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:04.200
<v 0>Well,
thank here at,
yeah.
Well we'll see what we've got here.
Let Brian,</v>

208
00:14:04.201 --> 00:14:06.390
if you could bring up this particular video.

209
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:10.680
This is one is this world famous bass player.
I was kind enough to loan me.

210
00:14:10.681 --> 00:14:14.190
It was something put together by a Kentucky public television.

211
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:20.040
So let's bring up this screen.
Okay,
good.
Let's pause it here just for a second.

212
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.940
So here's the setup and we're going to turn off the lights.
We've got,
um,

213
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:30.360
a DVD from Kentucky public television involving,

214
00:14:30.361 --> 00:14:34.280
as you will see,
some people that may look familiar is this person look familiar.

215
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.040
Anybody know this person?
She's a student run here.
She was a Yale undergraduate,

216
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:43.250
and she's telling us how she tried out for the Yale Symphony Orchestra and she

217
00:14:43.411 --> 00:14:46.320
was designated as an alternate and she was Crestfallen,

218
00:14:46.321 --> 00:14:51.321
but she then saw this ad where people wanted her to play in a bluegrass band.

219
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.150
So let's watch what happens

220
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.650
<v 6>trapped in a classical violinist body.</v>

221
00:14:57.651 --> 00:15:02.030
So I guess they were kind of pessimistic about finding a real fiddle player.
So,

222
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:04.280
um,
so she is like,
you're from West Virginia,

223
00:15:04.281 --> 00:15:07.460
you should go down there and audition for that.
And a,

224
00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:12.260
so luckily no other fiddle player showed up.
Um,
bear like film.
And I was like,

225
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.230
Mozart.
Um,
so,
uh,

226
00:15:15.231 --> 00:15:18.410
so they were very kind and let me,
uh,
you know,

227
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:20.180
kind of get my training on the job.

228
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:24.860
And so I started playing with them at that point and it's just been great ever

229
00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:25.694
since.

230
00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:54.890
<v 7>Darlin please.</v>

231
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:56.690
Beneath the ground.

232
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.400
Okay,
let's pause it here just for a second.

233
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.440
So a mystery basic layer is

234
00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:36.160
<v 0>Peter Salovey's,
the new provost.
And I said I'd send him an email.
Say,
Peter,
look,</v>

235
00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:38.110
we're teaching base over here.
Once you come in,
bring your,

236
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:42.460
bring your base here and you can demonstrate this stuff a little bit busy

237
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.700
at the moment.
But I got this DVD,

238
00:16:45.701 --> 00:16:49.640
you can have this DVD and do what ever you want it to with.
So,
uh,

239
00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.080
what's he doing there?
Boom,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.

240
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.490
And he's working around these particular notes.

241
00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.710
In this particular piece we're going to say,
here's a seat.

242
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:04.530
<v 8>Um,
do you bar,
there's this sub done follow bump,</v>

243
00:17:04.531 --> 00:17:09.450
bump bump there go bom,
Bom,
bom,
Bom and oftentime.

244
00:17:09.451 --> 00:17:12.670
He's going bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,

245
00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:17.120
Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,

246
00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.550
Bom,
Bom,
Bom,
bom.

247
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.380
<v 0>But again,
it's just fleshing out that subdominant chord,</v>

248
00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.970
dominant chord and tonic chord.
And it's,
and we can all hear this.
I mean,

249
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:32.420
do we see,
does this guy playing off of music again and get,

250
00:17:32.421 --> 00:17:36.170
of course the point not using music.
How were they doing this?

251
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.370
They're hearing the courts,

252
00:17:37.371 --> 00:17:42.170
they're hearing tonic subdominant and dominant and I think we can hear them to

253
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.980
anybody out there hearing these cords.
Can you sing along with these,

254
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.980
this wonderful music?
It's great.
All right.
How many like this music,

255
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.410
it's happy music again.
Uh,
we should have a whole course on bluegrass music.

256
00:17:54.411 --> 00:17:54.670
A good,

257
00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:58.640
would we be really be good because a lot of interesting ethnic issues involved

258
00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.580
in it.
Uh,

259
00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:03.750
so let's continue here and all sort of bang on the piano or seeing the basic

260
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:06.650
pictures of the base.
And I hope you'll join with me here.
Um,

261
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.000
if you don't like blue grass,
you don't have to sing,

262
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.180
but if you like the book where I sing along with me here.
Okay,
here we go.

263
00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:15.913
Whoops.

264
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.050
<v 7>TV movies</v>

265
00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.220
here.
Craig.

266
00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:07.623
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

267
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.420
<v 7>maybe that's it.
I could listen to this all day.</v>

268
00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:42.220
<v 0>I Dunno.
It was just too goofy or stay with history or ditch this.</v>

269
00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:45.900
Uh,
I think it's a wonderful,
but you seem less excited about [inaudible].

270
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.133
All right,
so let's,

271
00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.200
let's turn the lights back and we'll get back to Mozart and stuff like stuff

272
00:19:50.201 --> 00:19:54.640
like that.
Um,
let's talk about how these bases,

273
00:19:54.641 --> 00:19:58.150
we said that the bass note is sort of the foundation and then you add these

274
00:19:58.151 --> 00:20:01.690
other things up above it and they produce these chords and the courts are tonic

275
00:20:01.691 --> 00:20:05.200
and dominants and so on.
Sometimes if you're have a solo instrument,

276
00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.510
the you can play the basis just a cord

277
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.350
<v 2>or you could play it the same notes but spinning them out.</v>

278
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:18.320
<v 0>And we call that an Arpeggio probably cause with the harps play this a lot to</v>

279
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:19.290
sort of harp edge,

280
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:25.070
taking the notes of a triad and just spinning them out in six sessions.
Um,

281
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:30.250
and Arpeggios work particularly well with one triage with pieces that happened

282
00:20:30.261 --> 00:20:31.094
to be in three,

283
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.710
<v 2>one,
two,
three,
one,
two,
three.
So that's our pitch.</v>

284
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.640
Just a cord.

285
00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.220
<v 0>The notes played successively to create an Arpeggio.</v>

286
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.900
It works less.

287
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.590
These triadic Arpeggios with pieces and two,

288
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:57.873
that's not so good,

289
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:00.303
<v 3>right?</v>

290
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:09.240
<v 0>Metrical train wreck there.
Uh,
so,
uh,
what we would do with that will be fine.</v>

291
00:21:09.241 --> 00:21:10.001
Another pattern.

292
00:21:10.001 --> 00:21:14.530
One of the favorite patterns ever since the 18th century was this thing called

293
00:21:14.531 --> 00:21:15.880
an owl Berti base.

294
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:20.940
It goes one then up to the fifth degree of the triad,

295
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.890
one five,
three,
five,
one five,
three,
five.

296
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:35.190
It sounds very classical,
but that's a good way of harmonizing a um,

297
00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:40.220
uh,
something,
making something that's not very interesting.

298
00:21:40.221 --> 00:21:42.500
Sound more interesting.
Another way of doing it is just taking a note,

299
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.510
Boogie Woogie base.
You could just take optives rolls that way.

300
00:21:51.511 --> 00:21:52.830
Beethoven does this and this auto

301
00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:01.570
so on.

302
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:06.190
So there you can get though the harmony to sound more interesting simply by

303
00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:11.140
rolling that Optiv underneath.
So all of these little tricks,

304
00:22:11.141 --> 00:22:14.020
uh,
sort of energize the music and again,

305
00:22:14.021 --> 00:22:19.021
make it more interesting is that it otherwise perhaps would be sometimes if

306
00:22:20.441 --> 00:22:23.800
sometimes harmonies can stand by themselves.

307
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.430
Sometimes you could take just the harmony and it would be very beautiful.

308
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.400
Js Bach,
I should get my music up here,

309
00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:35.490
which my music js Bach wrote a prelude to the first book of his well-tempered

310
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:40.720
clubbier and it's a famous work.
It goes this way.

311
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.200
And so all it really is

312
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.280
<v 5>six</v>

313
00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.000
<v 0>sessions of chords played as our pitch CIOs.
So there it's sad for about,</v>

314
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:09.460
well I could say rather specifically about 140 years or so.

315
00:23:09.461 --> 00:23:14.140
And the French composer in the 19th century trough no,
came along and said,

316
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:17.710
well gee,
that's nice,
but I could write a melody against that.

317
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.340
So we're going to listen to this,
listen to box harmony underneath.
Uh,

318
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:27.330
at the same time we listened to this lovely melody that Charles [inaudible]

319
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.340
composed for it,
uh,

320
00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.730
and it gives us a chance to think about melody and it gives us a chance to think

321
00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:38.500
about the sound of the cello.
The cello is a particularly beautiful instrument.

322
00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.770
I've always said if I ever come back as a musical instrument,

323
00:23:41.771 --> 00:23:43.300
I want to come back as a cello.

324
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.890
It's just so rich and so beautiful and consortia.

325
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:50.930
So let's listen to a lovely cello line added over top of box,

326
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:52.100
original harmony

327
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:50.270
<v 3>descending sequence here.
That pattern shows up again,
but a lower step,</v>

328
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.150
it sounds as if he's going to do it yet.
A third time

329
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.850
<v 4>it takes that we know</v>

330
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:16.420
<v 3>the rest of this arching</v>

331
00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.370
get to this building higher

332
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.533
<v 4>Meyer.</v>

333
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:13.510
<v 0>Okay,
so we'll stop it.
There.</v>

334
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:28.240
It comes back to the tonic after that lovely climates at the top of that.

335
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:34.110
So we need to point out that we've got these two types of courts here.

336
00:26:37.361 --> 00:26:41.110
The idea of the,
this was all in c major,

337
00:26:41.111 --> 00:26:44.940
but we could turn this into c minor.
Let's go back and review this.

338
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.610
We have up on the board again the scale

339
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.050
and we need to talk about these triads that are made up of either major or minor

340
00:26:55.051 --> 00:26:56.340
thirds here.

341
00:26:56.341 --> 00:26:59.940
We could look at it this way with this particular interval in this particular

342
00:26:59.941 --> 00:27:00.331
involve.

343
00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:04.590
Let's go over to the keyboard here cause I think it's easier to show here.

344
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:08.790
So I'm going to start here with C,
uh,
because you know,

345
00:27:08.791 --> 00:27:10.290
sees kind of revenue neutral.

346
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:15.090
We'll start here with C and we're going to take the skip one,
take one,

347
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:20.790
skip one,
take one.
So we get C,
e g notice coming up here,
we have one,
two,

348
00:27:20.791 --> 00:27:24.390
three,
four half steps here.
This is an interval.

349
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:29.600
This interval from c up to e is the interval of a third because it spans three

350
00:27:30.031 --> 00:27:34.890
letter names.
C Up to g is a fifth.
It spans five letter names.

351
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.600
So we have c d e being a third with one,
two,
three,

352
00:27:39.601 --> 00:27:42.810
four steps in it,
half steps.

353
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:47.490
Now we're going to go from e up to G.
Notice here we get one,
two,

354
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:49.020
three,
just three.

355
00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:54.260
And that's because I said before we've got this arbitrary division of the octave

356
00:27:54.961 --> 00:27:56.700
according to Greek and mathematics,

357
00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:00.300
on to which in the ninth and 10th and 11th century,

358
00:28:00.301 --> 00:28:05.130
the Benedictine monks laid on another system that didn't quite work.

359
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.440
So up here,
this all seems to be the same.

360
00:28:07.441 --> 00:28:12.330
Distance e to f seems to be the same distance as d,
but it's not.

361
00:28:12.331 --> 00:28:16.800
It's only half the distance.
So we get this funny junction in the keyboard here,

362
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.470
but in any event,

363
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:24.500
the important thing to note is that we have a major triad with the big third on

364
00:28:24.931 --> 00:28:28.080
the bottom and the little third on the top.

365
00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:33.290
If we switched this around them and went to see e flat g to give us the minor

366
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.950
triad,
then of course we would have just three half steps here and four here.

367
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:45.450
Um,
were,
were reciprocal angles or something like,
yet you change one ipso facto,

368
00:28:45.451 --> 00:28:48.300
you change the other.
But that's all that's in play.

369
00:28:48.301 --> 00:28:49.740
And we've seen this in play before.

370
00:28:49.741 --> 00:28:54.390
Just the positioning of that third will determine whether this triad is a major

371
00:28:54.391 --> 00:28:58.750
triad or a minor.
It,
let's see how this works out in terms of real sound.
Um,

372
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.870
I'd like to do you guys down here y'all,
I'm just hold that pitch.

373
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:04.990
<v 4>Aw.</v>

374
00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:06.761
<v 10>And Tas,</v>

375
00:29:06.761 --> 00:29:11.761
can you sing the fifth law and Nice and loud everybody and everyone else.

376
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.700
Your,
there's the major third work with me.
Everybody else saying that.
Third.

377
00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.040
<v 4>Ah,</v>

378
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:20.083
<v 10>we're going to go minor.</v>

379
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.270
<v 4>Uh Huh.</v>

380
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.710
<v 10>Major,
Major,</v>

381
00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:30.940
minor,
Major.

382
00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:32.050
And it's just,

383
00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:35.980
<v 0>just tweaking,
just tweaking that middle note of the trial there.</v>

384
00:29:35.981 --> 00:29:38.980
That's all that should really involve in composers have tweaked this.

385
00:29:38.981 --> 00:29:40.690
Here's a piece by France list.

386
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:45.930
It re orchestrated by contemporary composer called lugubrious Gondola in French

387
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:50.380
or in English translating from the French.
Let's listen to a bit of,

388
00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:53.020
it starts out with a woodwind instrument.

389
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.390
What would win instrument is playing here.

390
00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:00.430
And then we'll focus on the change from one triad to the next.

391
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:17.140
Hey,
let's stop there.
There's a positive right there.
So what instrument was that?

392
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:22.100
Did you pick that up?
Yeah,
I was a clarinet.
If we're doing this on a,

393
00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:25.410
on a quiz or test,
we probably played that three times.
Did you hear it?

394
00:30:25.411 --> 00:30:29.410
A lot more than just that.
But it was a clarinet.
Now we go to this sound

395
00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:32.640
and watch what happens,

396
00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:46.750
<v 4>moves to another core</v>

397
00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:56.060
major,
minor,

398
00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:02.530
Major.
Bye.

399
00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:19.003
Yeah,

400
00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.450
<v 0>let's pause it there and reset this just a little bit.
Because underneath,</v>

401
00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.460
underneath,
what's the base doing here?

402
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.760
What's that?
Arpeggio?
Yeah,
just an Arpeggio.

403
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:41.020
So sometimes they take these cores and we just use it as an arpeggiated support.

404
00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:53.230
That's all Puccini does by waiver harmonic support.

405
00:31:53.231 --> 00:31:57.640
They're just takes that tonic chord
basically just works.

406
00:31:57.641 --> 00:32:02.320
That is an Arpeggio or page you underneath.
Um,
all right.

407
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:07.350
So let's see how if we can begin to hear the distinction between a major triad

408
00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.560
in a minor try.
And for this,
we're going to turn to a very famous piece,

409
00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.110
the Moonlight Sonata of Beethoven.
Uh,

410
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:19.900
and I ask you if you got this paper there.
I hope you do.
Um,
uh,
we're,

411
00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:24.910
we're going to play 19 cords for you and we're going to ask you which is major

412
00:32:25.121 --> 00:32:29.380
in which is minor.
So you know the piece.

413
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:06.200
So I'm going to sort of strip these down to their essence here.

414
00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:09.770
Here's court number one,
major or minor.
Try it.

415
00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.320
Here's cord number two.

416
00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:26.670
<v 3>Here's three,
four</v>

417
00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:33.570
five,
six,

418
00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:40.190
seven,
eight,

419
00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:49.490
91011121314

420
00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.470
1516

421
00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:14.540
1718

422
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:19.520
and late teens.

423
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.750
<v 0>So how'd you do it?
Well,
let's,
let's see here.
Let's go back and double check.</v>

424
00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:35.960
<v 3>Well that's a minor chord.
I'll just tell you the answers here.
It's major.</v>

425
00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:40.340
This is minor.
Three is minor

426
00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:46.330
<v 0>for his minor about that one.
That may be tough one.</v>

427
00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.740
Is that a major corridor

428
00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:52.520
<v 3>major?
Some of these are hard though.</v>

429
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:57.350
<v 0>Major,
minor,
Major.</v>

430
00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:00.740
<v 3>Okay.
That was six here.</v>

431
00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:06.100
She was making 17 major eight years.

432
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:11.080
Nine Years Major.
10 is major.

433
00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.880
11 is minor.
12 with major.

434
00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.900
13 is minor.

435
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:25.230
41516171819.

436
00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.300
<v 0>So it would be working.
This I think is fair game.</v>

437
00:35:42.301 --> 00:35:43.830
Just to differentiate between a major,

438
00:35:43.831 --> 00:35:47.450
try it as a minor to try it and we'll be doing that all the test that week from,

439
00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:48.031
from Dale.

440
00:35:48.031 --> 00:35:53.031
But we'll be giving you lots of prepping in that in section a section this week.

441
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.650
Uh,

442
00:35:55.650 --> 00:36:00.540
let's return to the pop realm and its focus a continually here on harmony and

443
00:36:00.541 --> 00:36:03.210
combine the idea of harmony with major and minor tribe.

444
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:07.110
And I play a piece that I've always liked a by you too.

445
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:10.200
I don't really know much about them but it's an interesting piece.

446
00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:15.430
Love is blind in this.
Let's listen to chunks of this.
Um,

447
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:19.230
and uh,
we'll see what they're doing with the harmony here.
Wow.

448
00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:35.360
What's the meter?
Kind of a slow one.

449
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.400
Okay.
So for copyright reasons we're cutting is exactly sure.

450
00:36:44.401 --> 00:36:46.470
We don't want to go over a limit here.
Okay.

451
00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:51.200
So we're going to skip ahead and I will listen to just a little bit more yard

452
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.350
that I think that's kind of the beat,
you know,
kind of a slow beat.

453
00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.910
Let's hear just a little bit more than that.

454
00:36:56.911 --> 00:37:01.740
I'll start to play along and I want you to to count the number of bars,

455
00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:03.660
number of measures in the pattern.

456
00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:07.530
This is a pattern that repeats over and over in music.
When that pattern repeats,

457
00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:11.860
we call it an Ostinato Austin Ra from the Italian word,
Austin,
Ra,

458
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:16.110
stubborn pigheaded.
So we have an Ostinato harmony here.
Um,

459
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:21.320
and how many bars is in this Ostinato are there in this Ostinato pattern?

460
00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:36.610
<v 3>[inaudible] and it's</v>

461
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.370
<v 0>going to continue again,</v>

462
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:10.290
anybody able to count the number of bars in the pattern just on that one little

463
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.110
quick plane there?
Yeah.
Uh,

464
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.750
Betty 16.
Um,
okay.
Uh,

465
00:38:18.751 --> 00:38:23.310
you're on the right track.
Uh,
Roger Eight.

466
00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:26.250
Yeah,
it was,
it was a 16 bar pattern.

467
00:38:26.251 --> 00:38:28.740
It was a 60 week played 16 bars there,

468
00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:33.480
but the harmony of the second eight bars was identical to the harmony of the

469
00:38:33.481 --> 00:38:36.650
first eight bars.
It was just repeating same hormone.
What's the harmony?

470
00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:39.883
<v 4>MMM.</v>

471
00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.040
<v 0>Is this piece by you to in major or minor?</v>

472
00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:56.050
How many think major raise your right here.
Sinister minor type Frazier.
Lefthand,

473
00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:01.840
definitely in lighter.
So it's one of these unusual part pieces in minor.
Uh.

474
00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.140
All right.
So that's cord one.

475
00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.093
<v 2>It's the titanic.</v>

476
00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.350
<v 0>What about this?
Try it major.
Minor,</v>

477
00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:14.200
major about this one
major.
What about this one?

478
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:18.160
Okay,
then back to

479
00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:23.500
<v 3>minor.
Major</v>

480
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.430
<v 0>and mine at the end.
So that's our,
that's our eight bar pattern.</v>

481
00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:33.210
Now maybe even kind of sing along with this.
My question to you,

482
00:39:33.211 --> 00:39:36.840
and this is the last room with this piece is,
is this a,

483
00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:41.960
an example of a regular rate of harmonic change or an irregular rate of harmonic

484
00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.120
change?
So here we go.
Maybe I'll just play it on the piano.

485
00:39:45.121 --> 00:39:48.660
Just the simplest thing here.
Ready?
Go.

486
00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:22.310
So what do you think?
Regular.
Irregular.
How many think regular?

487
00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:24.170
How many think irregular?

488
00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:29.420
It's actually you regular Sadie?
Yes.

489
00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.130
Tell me why.
Anybody tell me why I start to put you on the spot here.

490
00:40:34.131 --> 00:40:35.090
But you got it right

491
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:39.543
<v 7>incident.</v>

492
00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:44.470
<v 0>Well,
no,
they,
they,
they were kind of falling.
Well they were falling on the meter.</v>

493
00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:47.770
Okay.
But there was one moment,
uh,

494
00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:51.130
when something was a little bit different,
Elizabeth

495
00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:53.020
<v 7>lasted long.</v>

496
00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:56.010
<v 0>Okay.
It lasted longer.
What's the it here?</v>

497
00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.460
<v 7>No,
the core last long.</v>

498
00:40:58.380 --> 00:40:59.700
<v 0>Okay.
At the end of the phrase</v>

499
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:03.700
<v 2>seven Oh six,
seven two.</v>

500
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:07.100
<v 0>So that one lasted two bars,</v>

501
00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.740
<v 2>two,
three,
two,
five,
two six,</v>

502
00:41:11.741 --> 00:41:13.690
two seven two eight two.

503
00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:19.260
<v 0>So one of those chords lasted actually called one of those cores toward the end</v>

504
00:41:19.261 --> 00:41:21.990
there lasted twice as long as all the others.
Roger a question

505
00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.413
<v 7>that last part,</v>

506
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.580
<v 0>um,
aid could conceivably be arrest,</v>

507
00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.190
but that would give us a kind of a seven bar phrase.

508
00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:33.170
I don't like seven bar phrases.

509
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:36.020
Never met a seven bar phrase and it was really comfortable with,

510
00:41:36.021 --> 00:41:39.710
and musicians generally don't like that,
so it's better to better to go with,

511
00:41:39.711 --> 00:41:43.580
you know,
I,
I've used this for the first time in section the other day,
uh,

512
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:46.400
and I'll use it again here a second time.
OCKHAM's razor,

513
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:49.550
if there's a simple solution,
go for it.
Um,

514
00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:53.930
so take the idea of symmetry and assume that it's an eight bar phrase and you've

515
00:41:53.931 --> 00:41:58.520
got one court holding for extra cord.
But theoretically that's possible.

516
00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.380
A question here.

517
00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:07.443
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

518
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:10.410
<v 0>Uh,
we would not get into that.
Um,</v>

519
00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:13.480
but it would still be considered regular.

520
00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:16.750
All they're doing is filling between court.
Like Peter Salovey.

521
00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.660
Okay.
All he's doing is,

522
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:25.660
<v 3>and if he could</v>

523
00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:28.810
<v 0>playing other things along the way,
that's still regular,</v>

524
00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:31.800
but that's far more sophisticated and we're,
we're ever going to get to,

525
00:42:31.801 --> 00:42:36.570
we're just going to go plunk,
plunk,
plunk,
plunk.
Okay.
So keep it very,

526
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:39.180
very much in the street in Nero.
All right,

527
00:42:39.181 --> 00:42:43.890
we have one more idea to talk about and that is the concept of key and

528
00:42:43.891 --> 00:42:45.780
modulation.
Now this piece by youtube

529
00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:54.480
is written in a key.
It's got the home key.
Here's an odd kid,
B flat,

530
00:42:54.481 --> 00:42:58.420
minor five flats B,
flat,
minor.
Uh,

531
00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:01.620
but it nonetheless is a key and the pole piece,

532
00:43:01.621 --> 00:43:05.040
at least the vast majority of it is in that one key.

533
00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:08.580
Occasionally composers will change keys.

534
00:43:08.581 --> 00:43:11.550
I was thinking I could play right for you here.
The Beethoven he started.

535
00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.140
So here we are in this minor key.

536
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:38.300
So composers do Kate change keys and when they change keys,

537
00:43:38.301 --> 00:43:41.060
they affect what's called a modulation.

538
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:45.710
Let's listen to an example of,
I think we have Copeland up next.
Okay.

539
00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:50.860
Let's listen to an example of a pretty simple modulation affected by Aaron

540
00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:55.340
Copeland,
American composer working in New York City.
Uh,
in the forties,
50s,

541
00:43:55.341 --> 00:43:59.810
60s and 70s,
wrote a,
a ballet suite called Appalachian Spring.

542
00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:03.590
And in it he has one section where he's working through a series of variations

543
00:44:03.591 --> 00:44:07.010
on a folk tune called a gift to be simple.
And he,

544
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:09.260
he pulls off a modulation.

545
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:14.410
So let's listen to Copeland's Appalachian Spring as he proceeds and all kind of

546
00:44:15.771 --> 00:44:18.560
try to duplicate and go crazy up here at the piano.

547
00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:22.580
At the moment we get to the modulation.
Modulations are hard to hear.

548
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:26.870
Modulations are hard to hear.
The best you can do with it oftentimes and say,

549
00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.260
this is unsettled.
Maybe it's modulating,
and we,
I don't,

550
00:44:30.261 --> 00:44:34.050
I'm not even sure would ask you.
It has the piece modular.
They're really,

551
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.260
really kind of hard to hear,
but let's,
let's try it anyway.

552
00:44:37.261 --> 00:44:39.180
So here's cope a Copeland modulation.

553
00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.820
<v 4>So here he is in this case.</v>

554
00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.770
<v 0>Yeah,
I think this is where the modulation comes.</v>

555
00:45:27.771 --> 00:45:28.630
Then he's going to bring in the [inaudible]

556
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:31.060
<v 2>sitting on this note.
He brings in the trombone</v>

557
00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:35.220
<v 0>and then the trumpet will jump off from</v>

558
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:38.693
<v 11>yeah</v>

559
00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:42.980
<v 2>to a much,
he was here.
Now he's modulated up to here.</v>

560
00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.280
<v 0>So let's see if we can hear this modulation now.</v>

561
00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.713
<v 4>Here we go.</v>

562
00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.450
<v 0>So that's a modulation immune.</v>

563
00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:11.120
Conceptually it's pretty straight forward but it's hard to hear.
Uh,

564
00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:13.670
I think I've got an e one that's easier to here.

565
00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:17.720
It's a piece I like to use because it's just off the charts in terms of what

566
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:20.090
other popular music was doing at that time.

567
00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:24.050
It's piece by the Beach Boys Beach Boys Music is extremely interesting.

568
00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.290
Whether the California airheads,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

569
00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:30.410
This is really musically,

570
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:33.770
it's just light years ahead of what everybody else was doing,

571
00:46:33.771 --> 00:46:36.320
I guess late fifties,
early,
early sixties.

572
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:41.050
So what I've got here on the board is a harmonic scheme and we're going to for

573
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:45.230
once again for copyright reasons,
just take little chunks of this.
Um,

574
00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:50.150
but you can see that it's a,
it's a piece that changes,

575
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.970
uses a lot of triad.
So every time you see a g up here,

576
00:46:52.971 --> 00:46:57.670
that means we have a cord build on g and the try it on e try it on a tryout on
f,

577
00:46:57.671 --> 00:47:02.120
d e And just looking at this,
this isn't shaping out to be one,
four,

578
00:47:02.121 --> 00:47:05.180
five one.
So it's moving around a lot.

579
00:47:05.181 --> 00:47:09.050
Then it gets to a section where it does get very boring.

580
00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.540
It's very static at that particular point,

581
00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:14.090
and then something of interest will happen.

582
00:47:14.091 --> 00:47:17.300
So let's listen to a little bit of this.
And there are,

583
00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:22.440
it's a piece in which they are contrast between sections of movement with a lot

584
00:47:23.171 --> 00:47:25.150
of wild modulations and then,
uh,

585
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:29.920
sections of Stacy's Brown,
Brown

586
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.040
<v 4>kid around.
I get around</v>

587
00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.120
<v 0>here,
it gets very boring and we're not going to even listen to it.</v>

588
00:47:52.121 --> 00:47:52.954
Just going to sit there.

589
00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:00.210
I'm really hip and I'm having a great time,
but then the text comes back to,
um,

590
00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.290
I get around.
So let's,

591
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:06.580
I think that's what I've had to parse this thing out and do a Frankenstein.

592
00:48:06.581 --> 00:48:10.030
But let's,
let's listen to the next thing.
I think we go back to the idea of,

593
00:48:10.031 --> 00:48:10.990
I get around

594
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:16.710
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

595
00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:30.680
<v 0>duff,
more boring stuff at this point,</v>

596
00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:34.910
but let's pick it up as we come to the end of what I think is this boring stuff

597
00:48:34.911 --> 00:48:36.290
and we'll listen to what they do there.

598
00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:38.440
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

599
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:40.623
<v 0>go ahead.</v>

600
00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:45.940
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

601
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:51.350
<v 0>so they're sitting here in which,</v>

602
00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:52.623
<v 4>yeah,</v>

603
00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:03.480
<v 0>so what kind of cadence is they've given us their deceptive cadence,</v>

604
00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:08.540
deceptive cadence and that
a half step and then it,

605
00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:15.700
<v 4>no,</v>

606
00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.250
<v 0>it doesn't jump to the Aaron Copeland Appalachian Spring,</v>

607
00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:22.000
but it does the same thing.
It does exactly the same thing.

608
00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:23.830
It uses that inner beyond them.

609
00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:29.620
It's going to jump up from the dominant to the tonic and then slide up one more

610
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:30.270
thing.

611
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:35.270
So that we have now a whole section in a flat and the original was in GE,

612
00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:37.870
so he's modulated to a flat.

613
00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:41.470
It's extremely sophisticated involving half-step modulations and things like

614
00:49:41.471 --> 00:49:45.790
that.
Who would have thunk that from the B from the beach boys?

615
00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:50.860
Uh,
all right,
we're going to stop here.
Uh,
we've got sections this week.

616
00:49:50.861 --> 00:49:53.020
We have a test that week from today.

617
00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:58.170
If you look at your emails later in the day,
you will see a,

618
00:49:58.171 --> 00:50:03.171
an email from me saying that we are posting a prep sheet for the tests and it

619
00:50:03.491 --> 00:50:07.330
will tell you all you need to know and how to study over the weekend for the

620
00:50:07.331 --> 00:50:08.950
test next Thursday.

621
00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.460
So let's listen to a little bit of the Erin Copeland as you go out.
