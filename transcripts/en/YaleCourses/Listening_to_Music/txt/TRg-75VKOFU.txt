Speaker 1:          00:02          Okay. Good morning. Over the weekend you were assigned material from chapter one of the text and it dealt really with three famous beginnings of pieces of classical music. Somebody tell me at the outset, what were those three famous pieces? Young lady down here. Okay. Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. What was the second one?

Speaker 2:          00:30          Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:32          yeah, I a piano concerto number one of Tchaikovsky and the third one?

Speaker 1:          00:38          Yeah. This piece by Ricard Strauss with this funny sounding German name, we'll just call it Zuora through struck this profit Zahra through steps. Those were the three pieces and the issues there had to do with musical genre that we're going to talk a little bit more about in a moment and the instruments, the instruments, and you went ahead and worked with listening exercises nine through 11 to engage the musical instruments, um, a bit in those particular exercises. And we have performers here today that are going to, as you can see, a demonstrate some of these instruments instruments for us. Let's make one point very clear at the outset. Oftentimes I get student papers that refer to Beethoven's fifth song or Tchaikovsky's First Piano Song. Is that right? Now that's not, that's not good at all. Uh, are these songs

Speaker 1:          01:32          well, what, what do you have to have to make something, a song, lyrics. You got to have a text. So we don't have in 80% of classical music. We don't have lyrics. We don't have a tech. Well, yes with opera of course, but the other 80% is purely instrumental music. It works its magic again, through purely instrumental means. So we can't really call those songs. And this puzzle me, one day I was sitting there at iTunes and I wanted to buy an interior movement of a Mozart serenade. Ah, so I was all set to purchase this and it said by song, boom, that told me the answer. That's where this terminology comes into play because on iTunes we buy songs. It could be purely instrumental, but it's called by a soul. But we don't want to use that sort of parlance. We want to be more, a bit more sophisticated than that, if you will, and use other terms.

Speaker 1:          02:32          So we'll we'll talk generally about Beethoven's composition or Beethoven's piece or Beethoven's work or his masterwork or chef do for raw, however fancy you want to get with it. We could also go on and be a little more precise and say it belongs to a particular genre. We could use the name of the genre, and I'll be talking a lot about the genre in this course is your aura is simply a fancy word for type or so what genre of peace is this by Beethoven? Well, it's a symphony. Symphonies. Have four movements, have four movements. What's a movement? Well, a movement is simply an independent piece that works. Oftentimes if they're multiple movements in the symphony or concerto worked with other movements, they are independent, yet they are complimentary. Think of, for example, a sculpture garden you might have for independent sculptures in there, but they relate one to another.

Speaker 1:          03:31          They make some sort of special since one to another. So symphonies have these four movements and they usually operate in the following way, a fast opening movement, a slower, more lyrical second movement. Then a third movement that's derived from the dance. And then a fourth movement, fourth movement. That's sort of, again, uptempo, fast in phatic conclusion. Uh, let's see how these play out. Let's see how these play out by means of a quick review of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. So all we're going to do here, Linda, is going to go from the beginning of the track for the first movement, the second movement and so on. And uh, well let's just start here. Let's just by way of, of refreshing our memory, the beginning of Beethoven's fifth symphony.

Speaker 2:          04:28          Okay,

Speaker 1:          04:40          pause it there. And as we said last time, it operates in that fashion and that beginning gives us a good opportunity to make a distinction between two types of melody, between this idea of a motive and a theme. Both are sort of subsets of melody. If you, uh, if you will, uh, as I say in the textbook there, the beginning of the Beethoven fifth is something like a musical punch in the nose, right? Bought out at, I'm sort of grabbing you here, hitting you in the face, whatever. Musically, it's not a very long idea. How many notes is in this opening gambit here? How many pictures for Bop, bop, Bop, bop, short, short, short, long. Okay, so that's a classic example of a motive. A motive is just a little salad Europe, out of which the composure, we'll build other musical material. Now let's contrast that with what happens in the second movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony where we have a lyrical long flowing

Speaker 2:          05:41          theme. Okay?

Speaker 1:          06:00          Okay, we'll stop there. All right, so that went on. If we heard the whole thing, it actually goes on for 32 notes as opposed to just for, so motive versus longer themes, themes, 10 maybe a little bit more lyrical. Now let's go onto the third movement. We said the third movement was danced derived, but in this case with Beethoven, it's a very strange dance. If it is dance derive, it's just a little bit different than most of these third movements, but less listen to it anyway, because I'd like you to, when the brass is, come in, think about what you're hearing and think about that. Visa VI the first movement. So let's hear the third movement now.

Speaker 2:          06:58          Yeah. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:15          okay, so what happened there when the brasses came in? How did that relate to the first movement? Yes. For notes, something as simple as that, that the t, t, t, t, t, t, same rhythmic ideas. So that's usually the motive there and that's how these movements are tied together a little bit. Let's go on to the finale now. And as we listened to the finale, let's think about what we heard at the very beginning and talked about last time that the mood that the beginning of the fifth symphony created for it. We had these adjectives up, your negative, anxious, unsettled. Well how do we feel now about the finale and why

Speaker 2:          07:51          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:24          you just turn the volume down a little bit as we go down. Uh, so why do we feel differently about that? I think we do. What do we feel there? Well, sort of upbeat, positive, what's turned all of this around? What specifically? Well with the first movement, we said he's generally going that kind of idea, but now it's, and we'll explore this when we get to harmony, this idea of major and minors,

Speaker 3:          08:54          that's

Speaker 1:          08:54          a, from the dark

Speaker 4:          08:56          minor to the brighter major. We were going down in the first movement. Now we will,

Speaker 1:          09:03          it's going up and instead of having just the violins playing, we have the trumpets, the heroic trumpets. So it sounds very triumphant, very triumphant. So in this 40 minute interval we've gone sort of through an emotional musical journey here from despair, despondency, uncertainty to whatever to personal trial and in a way that mirrors some of the things that were going on in Beethoven's life. Okay. Let's go on to talk about the second piece. We're finished with this idea of the genre of the four movement. The symphony go on to talk about the piano concerto concertos are generally in three movements. So the concerto is another genre. It's a genre in which a soloist will confront the orchestra and there'll be a kind of give and take, a spirited give and take between the two. So now we are going to listen to it. The beginning of the first movement of Jakafi Skis, a piano concerto. You've worked with this already, so you're a little bit familiar with it. And at the outset here, I have two questions for you. Is the beginning here played, uh, played by the brasses are the strings, in other words, what are the woodwinds, what family of instruments is playing here and his Tchaikovsky using a motive? Or is he using a theme at the very beginning of this concerto?

Speaker 4:          10:24          Okay,

Speaker 1:          10:30          Linda, just off a little bit.

Speaker 2:          10:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          10:39          yeah, please. Let's do that again so we can hear the, you're at the beginning. So what about that theme or motive at the beginning? Moda. All right, so here it was, I think, how many notes in our motive? Same as in the Beethoven. What, why isn't it the say? Well, we got a skippy Beethoven,

Speaker 1:          11:16          uh, here, which a Kowski is coming down just straight down, down a consecutive intervals there for the most part. And both of them are however minor with the checkoff ski. They, all the, the intervals of the, the durations of the same. The Bop, Bop beep up, up, up, up with the, with the Beethoven tee, tee, tee, tee, short, short, short, long. So Schakowsky is keys. Uh, a little bit more neutral in terms of the rhythm. Okay. So then we go on and the piano enters. Oh, what is the panel doing? So let's hear the piano come in just a bit. Just play bit. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          11:53          More.

Speaker 1:          11:58          Okay, let's stop here. So what's the piano up to? Well, the piano is Jeff playing chords, playing them in octave. Six sessions. And we'll talk about that a little bit more too. So why don't we have here in this next section? Do we have a theme or do we have a motive? And which are the violins play? Are they, uh, do they have the theme or the motive or does the piano have the theme or the motive? Let's listen. Okay. So let's, let's stop it there. Uh, so was what the, what were the violins play theme or motive? See, what was the piano doing? Yeah, just the same course. Yadidi Bop,

Speaker 4:          13:23          bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop,

Speaker 1:          13:36          fashion. I'm singing the melody. They're playing a chordal accompaniment against it. All right, let's listen to the next iteration of this team. We've identified this as a theme. Who's got the theme now? Is it exactly the same and what are the strings up to in terms of string technique here?

Speaker 2:          14:22          Just pause it. Sit

Speaker 1:          14:23          there. So, uh, who had the theme cattle now, but was it exactly the same? Not really. It's kind of noodling around with a varying, a little bit. What were the strings doing? They were playing the accompaniment and what string technique where they use it. I think we mentioned that in the first chapter of the book there. Yep. You've got it nice and loud please. Pitsa Kata. Good. Okay. Pizzicato we could write that. We write that as a term of, yeah. Okay. We've got it up there. PITSA Cup. That's a help. Um, so the, in that particular case, we've switched the roles around. Let's, um, let's go ahead and do two to 10. We're going to move this along just a little bit here. Uh, as we come back into this, I think we've got a situation where the, the piano keeps playing the four note modals and keep building it up for tension and there's a cascade and then the theme comes back. Let's see what happens here. Just the motive. One, two, three, four. Okay.

Speaker 2:          15:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:51          All right. So that's an introduction to a three movement. Piano Concerto happens to be the first of the three movements and it's pretty spectacular music. I hope you liked that music. It's one of the, one of the great melodies of all time. It's a, it's a wonderful example of the, of a theme. Having talked just a little bit about genres, we could conclude by saying there are other kinds of genres in music. Of course, we're a, we've been introduced to this idea of the tone poem. The Strauss Zahra through Straw is a tone poem that's a kind of one movement work in which the composure tries to tell a story or play out in an historic event or in the case of the Strauss, I guess to give us the beginning of the contents of a philosophical novel through music. So tone poems or one movement. And we have got other kinds of genres and music.

Speaker 1:          16:42          We've got opera, we've got cantatas, Sonatas, ballets, things such as this. And we'll get to each of those in turn. So that's the end of the discussion of genre. Let's go on now to talk about instruments and how instruments produce sound. Eva Heater. Come on up. This is my friend, longtime colleague, Music Library and extraordinary and professional French horn player, eva heater who will demonstrate here. Come on over here. Right in the center. Jeanne Kimble is in the basement somewhere recording all of this. Oh yes. Very excited to hear what a time to be alive, Huh? Yeah. Um, so, uh, Eva's going to just demonstrate the physical process of playing the French horn.

Speaker 5:          17:24          The Horn obviously is a brass instrument and what makes the sound is a vibrating column of air. In this case, the basic column or there is 12 and a half feet long and there's something called partials or the harmonic series that happens in, in anything with a screening or whatever. But on the horn, it's very distinct and that's what makes the different most let me demonstrate to the harmonic series.

Speaker 3:          17:50          Uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 5:          18:07          no I didn't use no hands. That was just the notes that are naturally on the 12 and a half foot of length of vibrating air. That's, those are the, that's the harmonic series that's on that. And what the balance do is they shorten and lengthen that librarian column of air. Very much like a cello street on think of board. You know, the cellist is always shortening and lengthening the uh, the strings on doing the same thing. I'm just doing it with a series of switches instead of a finger one, which we obviously don't have. Um, okay.

Speaker 1:          18:44          That's fine. That's great. That's, that's the principal. And when she says she overblowing what that means is we'll keep emphasizing this point today that uh, and these partials that wins a sound is made. You have not just one sound, but that tube is dividing it up into sections and all kinds of little sections of that one. The tube are sounding not just the biggest sound, but the partials or the overtones, the heart of the sea intervals in the harmonic series. So, uh, it's a whole series. When we listened to a single tone, it's a whole series. And what ava was doing there is playing out the notes in that series successively. We'll keep banging on that. Now, if you would have a play just the beginning of the Zuora through stroke where the trumpet part, can you do that? Oh Man. What is it? Well, whatever key you're in, what, what a key are you in? What can, would you like me to be in? Well, could you, could we do see?

Speaker 3:          19:43          Oh, okay. Uh, uh hmm. Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:19          That's nice that, that's an, that's another note.

Speaker 4:          20:21          Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay. Ava has another, yeah, another

Speaker 1:          20:27          gig out in Guilford said this morning. So she's going to to run off and I'm going to show you maybe if we can get our slides up, is this overtone series stuff. Okay. Okay. It's a mathematical thing too, which I hope I've got it on the slides. Gentlemen, can you, I'm going to hit what I was told to do. Function F eight. Is that right?

Speaker 2:          20:49          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          20:50          Ha. All right. Something came up and then disappeared. All right, so come, may I have a technical person please bring press it one more time.

Speaker 2:          20:59          Uh, eight.

Speaker 1:          21:03          Okay, so we don't have we done. All right, so let's, I tell you what, we're going to just leave this up and I will bag the other slot. I have slides with all this information on it, but we can't seem to bring these up. Uh, what we've got here is the following, this idea of partials and ava was talking about with ratios two to one, three to, to four to three, five to four, six to five and so on. And the point here is that the way we differentiate between instruments, anybody tell me this? Why are you telling me this? It's always better when students answer. Why does a trumpet, if I ask a trumpet to play this Pete p a trumpet played it, then I ask an oboe to play it. The sound would be very different. Why is that the case?

Speaker 1:          21:52          Gentlemen here, different overtones, well actually they all have the same overtones in a way, the same frequencies with sound, but you've got it a 99% of it. It's which partials are particularly prominent, have extra punch or extra volume to it. Is it the, the, the oboe may have the seventh partial, very strong and the third partial, very strong. Whereas the trumpet, I'm just making all of this up. Of course, the trumpet may have the second partial on the fourth partial and the six partial, so it's, which of these partials are sounding within each of these instruments and the physical properties of each of these instruments are different. It's the particular blend. Here's a really dumb analogy. Any Scotch drinkers in here? No, of course not. You're way too young to do that, but think about a blended scotch. You know, you'll get a little of this little, this little of this and it makes up about whatever it is that you end up with a particular recipe for that liquid.

Speaker 1:          22:48          Well, we have a particular recipe for instrumental Tambre or instrumental color and it's the intensity of the overtones with or partials within each particular instrument that creates that. Okay. Now we're going to go on and talk about a woodwind instrument here. So Linda, come on up. Linda is is a best soonest. Uh, she's also a, this is Linda Paul who will be our, one of our principal tas here. She is a phd candidate in the Department of music. Just passed your qualifying exam with flying colors. So here she is to demonstrate the bassoon for us. Lowest member of the woodwind family.

Speaker 6:          23:27          All right, so you have, you read in the book that the decision is a double reed instrument. And so just to show you what that looks like, you've probably seen it, but if you haven't, two pieces of wood vibrate together. When I blow through them,

Speaker 7:          23:45          always a

Speaker 6:          23:46          check it up before I play in her notes. And as you will probably suspect by the link to the bassoon, it can play very loaded.

Speaker 6:          23:59          And if I put a little rag in the top, I can get it even a little bit lower than that. You didn't bring one, but actually amazingly, it's a very versatile and can also play very high notes. As you can see, there are a lot of keys on it. There are nine keys for my left thumb alone, so I'm kind of switching between these on the back here and many others. And because of that I can do very high and I'll just demonstrate that. Okay, so that's just to give you a sense of the range because of this sort of particular character of the city sound, it's often used to play sort of funny little low note characters in the orchestra. For example, if you're familiar with Peter and the wolf and be different instruments play different characters. The bassoon is the grandfather?

Speaker 2:          25:05          Nope. Nope.

Speaker 1:          25:19          Cool.

Speaker 4:          25:24          Okay, great. Thanks

Speaker 1:          25:26          that. That's really fun. Now Jacob Adams is going, is a professional a violist here in new haven? What's the name of your core tet? Jacob does VINCA string quartet, so keep an eye out for them. They're based here in new haven. She'll come on out, Jacob and um, uh, let, oh he is a violist, not a violinist, but the principle here is pretty much the same. So tell us about the construction of the instrument.

Speaker 8:          25:49          Okay. So obviously we've now seen a little bit of the brass family and the woodwind family and the other principal. A section of the orchestra would, Bob is to be the string family. Um, the viola is very similar to the violence, so anything I say about the viola applies to the violin as well. And of course you all are probably familiar with violence and the size of the violas are a little bit bigger. This particular one's about 16 inches long, um, building so I can show it better, uh, violins or maybe go up about 12 inches. They have a slightly smaller body to them. Um, but violence of els have the same general construction. Um, we, we, uh, all the sounds are produced by the strings, uh, on the instrument and how the bone is pulled across the instruments. The Bose made out of typically horse hair from tales of courses. Um, the strings are now metallic, but 16th, 18th century, they would have been made out of cat gut. Um, that was much more common and still some people,

Speaker 1:          26:48          okay. So I'm sorry we were, I got lots of things going on here. There's money, so just play, um, uh, scale, uh, quickly. And then the Vibrato Pitsa Kado and Tremolo for it.

Speaker 8:          26:59          So again, this is on a viola, so does a deeper darker tamber than a violin. But here's the scale.

Speaker 8:          27:11          Oh, you did something there at the end. Do, do you have too much coffee this morning and started shaking with it? Yeah. So tell us about what you were doing there at the end. So there are all sorts of different little technique things you can do to create different colors and sounds on, on all string instruments. So this applies to any of them. Uh, one of them is the technique you something to do with my left hand where I wiggled it a little bit. It's called the Bravo. You hear the human voices as well. You can do it on other instruments but, and then a string instrument. It's the difference. I'll play a melody without Sobrato and with the grotto so you can see the difference.

Speaker 7:          27:42          Uh, uh,

Speaker 8:          27:54          so that's what the ads are Prato not that interesting in my opinion. So with the Bronto,

Speaker 7:          27:59          mm.

Speaker 8:          28:12          And you can vary the width and the speed and the length, there's a lot of fair. Okay. Then just quickly play a pitch for sure.

Speaker 1:          28:26          Okay. And then finally, Tremolo.

Speaker 8:          28:29          Yes.

Speaker 4:          28:34          Yes.

Speaker 1:          28:35          A little excitement or a little filler to the music sometimes. All right. Great. Thank you, Jacob.

Speaker 4:          28:40          Very much

Speaker 1:          28:46          so. I Dunno if I get, whether technically this will work or not. I've tried all morning to get this to work. I have it up on my screen, but I don't see it up on the screen there. Can I have a tech assistant to do? All right. We'll go back here to try this. It began, nothing happened.

Speaker 4:          29:06          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          29:07          Well that's why I asked somebody to stand up here. Yeah. It doesn't do me much good to have somebody in the back going like this. Okay. What I would like, one I wanted to show you was a clip. Uh, that actually one my daughter brought to my attention. Um, just this past weekend, she was watching television. America has talent. Anybody watched this? Americans talent? And she said, Dad, you've got to watch. This is the most amazing thing. They've got these two guys on here called nothing but strings. So I did, I went to, she did, she sent me the link to Youtube. I'll let see if we can get this to go. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          29:51          Send me fine

Speaker 1:          29:55          to do something. I love with the person that,

Speaker 1:          30:36          uh, so obviously the violin is not just this stodgy old thing from the renaissance. It has some legs today, uh, used in folk music used in, sometimes you see it in, in Nashville, playing with country music, that kind of thing. Uh, is this a travesty to use a violin with, with hip hop here? I guess this is hip hop. Of course not. This is wonderful. This is the best thing that has happened to the violin in the last hundred years. There will be millions of kids out there now to, Gee, I'd like to learn to play the violin too. So this is wonderful. This sort of cross, uh, semination of, of genres here, bringing this particular instrument, the traditional classical violin into the popular realm. All right, so let's put that aside. We've talked a little bit about sound production here. I've got two pieces I'm going to work with here.

Speaker 1:          31:20          Uh, for the end of our session, we have 15 minutes left and here are these two pieces. The first you can see on the board up there is by another Russian composer Modez resort ski. It's called Polish ox card from his work pictures at an exhibition. What happened was he had a friend, the friend died, the friend was an artist. A friend left these pictures as an homage to the painter. Mazurski sat down and tried to come up with, create a musical response to each of these paintings that were on display. Now this is a piece that's always interested me because the painting is very pedestrian. It's of an old Polish ox cart sitting on some godforsaken road in rural Russia somewhere. So how do you make that work as music? How do you turn that visual image in to music? How do you turn that into a sort of live sonic escape?

Speaker 1:          32:19          And I should say at the outset, I'm going to prejudice, you're listening here just a little bit. I hear this as me being in the center and this oxcart starting. Could you start either side? It doesn't matter. Everybody moves left to right. So I'm going to hear this moving left to right. It comes in front of me, almost raw rolls over top of me, runs me and then disappears to my right. So as we listen to this, you think about what are the techniques by which resort ski creates this musical action scene. You should be able to come up with two pretty good ideas here too. Pretty good answers. All right, here we go.

Speaker 2:          32:59          Nice and loud.

Speaker 1:          33:17          The instrument is playing. That is playing is a low tuba, Tuba, low brass instrument. It doesn't sound much like a Tuba cause it's actually playing in the higher register of the instrument, but it is a tube.

Speaker 2:          33:53          Now, this strange, turn it up just a little bit. Streams come in with a counter ID, complimentary ideas. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          35:57          okay. Give me one pretty straight forward way. This happened. What did he do there? Yes. A young lady out here please. Okay. Crescendo from beginning to end.

Speaker 1:          36:15          Yeah, so like a giant wedge. So that's why the cart seems to be in front of you. And so we're talking about musical volume here. It started very quietly. It built up to this huge center in which we had the bass drum pounding away. They're in a snare drum coming in to give the effect of the entire earth is rattling at that particular particular point. And then as it passed by you, the thunder pass by you and off you went into the distance quietly into the distance and it was, we'll come back to that. But uh, uh, how did that happen? We'll listen to the end of that. And just one moment is kind of a disintegration of the sound at the end of this disintegration of the sound at the end. So let's pick it up. So that's one big, one big way. This happened. One, that's probably the big ticket item here. There's another way, a more subtle way. Any thoughts about that?

Speaker 2:          37:13          Yes,

Speaker 1:          37:17          yes. The instrumentation that, can you elaborate on that?

Speaker 2:          37:28          Great.

Speaker 1:          37:31          Right. So there's a kind of wedge shape with regard to the instruments too. He starts with the lowest instruments, the lowest instruments, uh, and then uh, goes to the high instruments and then back to low instruments at the end. Let's just review, well, no, we won't review this. Let's not review that. Okay. We don't have time to review that, but let's go on to say the following that what moves Mussorgsky knew there was a very basic principle of acoustics and what is that principle? Yeah, I beg your pardon. Well, to some extent, I'm going to give an example example of that, of the train kind of going by you and the sound hitting off in the other, other direction to yes, to some extent it is that, yes. Um, uh, but what I was thinking about here is this idea that the lowest sounds create or the longest sound waves and they last the longest, lowest sounds create the largest sound waves and they last the longest.

Speaker 1:          38:32          The lowest sounds lasts the longest. Why might this be the case? Are here, uh, uh, not having too much confidence in our slides this morning. I went ahead and put this one up on the board here. Here is one pitch. Here is a picture of a string, an octave higher, so you can see it this way. As you probably know, if you take a long string and pluck it, it's going to take that long string along time to pass that sort of cycle if you will. Just one pass through that cycle, the string, half the length. We'll pass through that cycle two times so that you can kind of graph these up here as one long, low sound or one faster vibrating sound an octave higher. So again, low sounds or low frequencies travel farther. Now you've experienced this in your own life. You're standing on a street corner here in new haven in the distance.

Speaker 1:          39:29          What do you hear an automobile approaching with a souped up audio system in it and what sound do you hear at the very first room room, room room, that kind of thing. There may be too junior to Du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du, Du. And then maybe some kind of melody will come in and then it'll all come together right in front of you and it kind of disappear in the distance. You're at a football game, you've probably experienced this too. The band is marching on the field. Suddenly they do the doppler effect where they turn their backs to you in a way and they're playing away from you and you hear very little sound. What instrumental sound do you hear? Boom, boom, boom. The bass drum and the Tuba, or in the marching band would be a sousaphone. They would call it the bass drum and Tuba.

Speaker 1:          40:20          So Mazurski knew this kind of thing and because he's a professional musician and was playing off of it to create this rather unusual and remarkable, uh, musical soundscape here. Okay, I have five minutes left. I'd like to do one last piece. It's another piece by Ricard Strauss. It kind of brings us to the end of Ricard Strauss, our discussion of Ricard's Josh, we'll say goodbye to him here in our course, it's called death and transfiguration, death and transfiguration. And I hear this as a companion piece. It kind of pendant to the Zuora through stroke. One sort of opens up the beginning of life here and the other closes it down, uh, through a referencing of death. There's a interesting anecdote about Strauss and that is that on his deathbed, he said to his daughter, Alice, he said, Alice, it's the funniest thing. Dying is exactly as I composed it in death and transfiguration. What an odd thing to say, but in any event, here's how this works. We've been talking about this overtone series with Zahra through Straw, Ava Palade overtone series. He's basically working up to the upper partials. Now. He's going to work down the partials. You're going to close it back down here with death and he's going to close it back down using a process that we frequently encounter in music, and that is this idea of dissonance resolving two consonants. Here's a dissonance.

Speaker 1:          41:57          Here's a consonant.

Speaker 1:          42:01          They're precise technical reasons why these are the way they are, but let me try to, to cut to the chase here with dissonant intervals, they tend to be frequencies that are sounding right next to each other, very close by frequencies. They sound dissonant. If you allow a little bit of spacing, a little more space between your frequencies, they're a little bit farther apart, then you can move from closeness to spacing and you get the consonants. Generally speaking, dissonant intervals have ratios such as nine to eight for the whole step or 17 to 16 for the half step. They're irrational numbers and these irrational numbers like to move to rational numbers. They like to move to consonants as they like to move to intervals that are based on things such as two to one and three to two or maybe four to three. So that's the, the the principle of this idea of dissonance resolving two consonants.

Speaker 1:          42:54          So we're going to listen now to the end of Strauss's. Death and transfiguration did the death year and again we've got the idea of the octave, then the fifth and the fourth week working up farther and farther in these partials and we've got some of these notes right next to each other and they want to move to the stable notes. So we're going to be hearing a lot of a note right above the tonic wanting to pull down to that tonic note. We're going to hear a lot of unknowns right above the dominant, wanting to pull down to the dominant. So let's listen to this. We have about three minutes, I think. Um, we'll hear it and I'll comment a bit as we

Speaker 2:          43:35          go. [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          44:43          yeah, just working with the four note and motive here. Whoa, strange little dissonant chord. They're resolving the consonants here. It's just the basic primordial note upon which all these other tones are built.

Speaker 1:          46:26          Okay. So that's Ricard Strauss as approach to death, not particularly relevant to you young people, but for older gentlemen such as Professor Kagan and myself, we're getting close to that right. Dot. So, uh, thank you all for staying with us this morning and hope you will enjoy that music. We'll see you in section starting this Thursday. If you have any questions, come up and see me or send me an email.
