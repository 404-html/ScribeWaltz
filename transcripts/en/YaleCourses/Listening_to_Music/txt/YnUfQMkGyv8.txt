Speaker 1:          00:01          Let us begin please. Today you should be a fun day for us. We've got some visitors. It's always, uh, this particular exercise is one of the ones that I enjoy most in this course because we get to talk with real performers and find out what's in their head when they perform a concert for us. So our aim today is to continue along this path to make you, in this case, educated critics so that you can go to a concert of classical music and you'll be able to engage it in a productive sort of way, in an educated way. Now there are lots of things we could think about, terms of do's and don'ts when we evaluate material musically in a critical fashion. And we're going to be going through some of those in section starting this evenings. And we'll have a big long list of this is what you put in and review and it's probably not so good to put this in a review.

Speaker 1:          00:55          But generally speaking, when you go to a concert and you review it, whether you do it just for yourself or whether you review it and then write down your thoughts and publish them as a published review, you do the following. You're essentially reviewing the performance. How well did the performance go? How did the, how did the players do? You're not engaging, uh, who the composer is. You're not engaging. When the piece was written, the history of the piece, the historical context, you're not engaging even oddly the meaning of the piece, the meaning of the piece. Now on our concert for Saturday night, we have three pieces, one by Mozart, one by Brahms and one by Beethoven. What's the meaning of the Mozart? The opening piece? Well, the meaning there is its function in a sense. It's in trying to get the concert going. Originally of course he was trying to get the opera going.

Speaker 1:          01:55          Oddly if the music they're in the overture has nothing to do specifically with the music and the opera. There's no music in the opera. That's also used in the overture, but it does have a lot to do psychologically because it's a very intense compressed overture. And the opera itself, if you begin to study that in the way he's linking scenes, in a way, he's moving his harmonic progressions along. It's also a very compressed intense opera. So, uh, some of the psychological state of the opera is encapsulated in that opening overture, but that overture can open other things as well. So they're, the meaning of the Mozart in essence is the function of the piece to get people in, to get them quiet, to get them focused, and to give them a heads up in a way as to the psychological, uh, import of the opera. That's to follow. Now we have also the Beethoven, the pastoral symphony of Beethoven. What do you suppose the meaning of that is a pretty straight forward. Anybody want to take a crack at it? Anybody know anything about the pastoral symphony of Beethoven?

Speaker 1:          03:01          What would you guess? What's it sound like? It sounded like a train, right? Does this sound like midtown Manhattan? Elizabeth? Yeah, the countryside. The kind of leisurely embrace of the countryside, maybe a walk through woods on a beautiful spring day, that kind of thing. Uh, and each of the moments movements plays this out in a different way or sort of an introduction than an introduction to the birds of the forest. And the second movement, uh, pads and romp in the third movement of storm gathers in the fourth movement that we have an extra movement in this particular symphony because we've got Beethoven writing a bit of pictorial music here in the form of a fourth movement that's a storm and then a hymn of thanksgiving. Um, that plays out in basically a Rondo variation form there at the end. So that's the meaning of that and how an individual might embrace the countryside.

Speaker 1:          03:53          A, what's the meaning of the Brahms? What's the meeting of the Bronx? While we've got these variations and they're simply sonic patterns, sonic patterns, uh, and we have patterns, I suppose, in lots of different arts. Think of abstract patterns and De Kooning paintings or Jackson Pollock. We have a beautiful Jackson Pollock over in the Yale Art Gallery. Well that's just sort of abstraction, visual abstraction as well. You can have sonic abstractions as well. I was talking with our conductor that we'll introduce in a moment, uh, yesterday about this. What's the meaning of the Brahms or he got to this in a different sort of way. And maybe I will let the cat out of the bag with that. But it seems to me that what we've got here is an individual or an experience in which we are staying. We have the same frame of reference, that same context, in other words, the theme, but we're going to engage it in six or seven really different ways.

Speaker 1:          04:48          And think of all the times in your life, or you may go into the same context. Uh, you may go into your dorm room and you've had a terrible day and you're furious and you're storming around, or you've had a very pleasant day, or as it's been, uh, a rather revenue neutral day in terms of your emotional content. So maybe it's not particularly, uh, moving one way or the other. You can have the same item that you engage intellectually or psychologically in radically different ways. So this is the same item played out in rather radically different ways musically in this theme and variation set. And we'll say more about that later, but generally, oddly you don't write about these kinds of things when you write a review. What you're writing about again is how well they played the piece. Only if they play it in a way that seems to subvert the meaning as you perceive it.

Speaker 1:          05:42          The meaning of the piece is does the performance a really impact on the meaning of the piece? Then you might say, well, this performance was not successful because as I say it countermanded or what is the meaning of this particular piece as you, the listener, um, perceive that to be oddly also, you don't talk about the form in the pieces. We've, we've been spending all this time on form. Form is a way of getting in there so we can follow along intelligently what's happening in these compositions. But we don't write a review in set in which we say the orchestra started out and we engaged the first theme and then we had a fine transition that went to the second theme. And I really liked that closing theme. It had a lot of harmonic bang to it. We don't want to sort of be led by the nose, if you will, through the form of the piece. But we'll be saying a lot more about this in section. And as I say, we'll have another yet another sheet, uh, to, to hand to you. It helps when you go to a concert to know a little something about the composer. Right. What do you know about Beethoven? What do you think of when you think of Beethoven?

Speaker 1:          07:00          Yes, the pinnacle of all music. Okay, good. That's a, that's an interesting way of putting it. And actually, even if you look at the textbook that you're using there, you've got this, you've got an entire long chapter devoted just to Beethoven there and, but when people write history books, Beethoven is kind of the Lynch Pin. You work up to Beethoven in the new work away from Beethoven. So Beethoven for the 19th century was, um, uh, was an icon. It was, um, the, the pinnacle of what the artist was supposed to be light. But it's not just the musical artists. Beethoven represented more than that. Uh, was he a neat and tidy guy? Was he sort of uptight guy? Did he wear a neck tie and look, look, sort of a constrained in the, uh, appropriate system of the day? I'm the ultimate corporate guy, right? Was Beethoven the ultimate corporate guy?

Speaker 1:          07:54          No. What did he look like? He looked like the prototype of the genius and on the basis of how Beethoven looked and how Beethoven acted, people then began to build this concept of the genius in the 19th century. Beethoven was the building block for this whole idea about what a genius was, how he was supposed to behave, how he was not necessarily, um, uh, to be held to the same standards as the rest of humanity in terms of his behavior to other people. If you had unnecessary to be dishonest, be dishonest. He, Beethoven wasn't a serve as dishonest as sometimes with regard Wagner was, but it was excused because he was a genius. Well this sort of idea begins with Beethoven here in the 19th century. What did Beethoven, right, well, as you can see on your sheet there, but you pick up your sheet.

Speaker 1:          08:42          I think I've got a find it useful to do this from time to time. Just sort of the basic Beethoven if you will. Um, and a list of things. If you want to buy particular pieces or you want to explore particular repertoire of Beethoven, well you can do it in this fashion. So, um, there is, uh, what we need to know about Beethoven on that particular sheet bronze. We talked about, we talked about his pieces. Mozart, we will be talking a lot more about, um, as time goes on, now we have, let's turn to our big sheet here. What are you going to do with this big sheet, isn't it? You can do a couple of things with that big sheet. An energetic student might want to go out and go to iTunes and do what and before the concert. Yeah. Download by. Get the pieces ahead of time. Um, for 99 cents, except with the, with the Beethoven. Why would the Beethoven cost more?

Speaker 2:          09:48          Bye.

Speaker 1:          09:49          Yeah. You got to pay for each of the movement as the way they sell their stuff. Stuff too. And once again, they'll call them soul, right? Each is Ebay. Pardon? And you can go to the music library because Linda has been kind enough to put all of these on reserve for all these pieces on reserve for us also. So you have this big sheet and uh, you can take this, you can engage this material ahead of time with the pieces. We don't have any of these pieces on our cds there. Thousands of zillions of classical pieces of music. We can't put them all on our cds. We have Beethoven's all of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, for example, but we don't have the sixth symphony. But you can get it there on iTunes if you want to. And then you can follow along and ask yourself these questions as you're listening to a recording before the contract.

Speaker 1:          10:35          That would be, that would be a really, um, uh, uh, serious type of preparation for this, uh, feeling that you could simply bring this to the concert. Simply bring this to the concert and then, um, uh, uh, follow along of discretely as the concert is going on and ask yourself these questions and maybe write on it. Probably be good if we didn't have a hundred people going like this during the middle of the concert and we get on the change of peace or some change of movement. So try to keep the, I've seen also students sit there with computers sort of taking notes during it. That's, that's a bit over the top it seems. It seems to me. So it'd be really neat. Uh, somehow what I do actually, what do I do when this is going on because I have to read these reviews, right? I got to read them, so I got to know and the TA's have to know what happened. What I do is I take my program and I do have a pencil there and they take my program and I'll write little notes on my program so that I can remember what the orchestra did at a particular spot. And generally speaking, the sooner you write your review after a performance, uh, the better. Um, so do you have questions about that and we'll be talking more a lot about, about that intersection, uh, starting this evening. Yes. Dan,

Speaker 1:          11:56          how long did it reviews be? 500 words. Two pages. Very good question. We're going to hold you to, that holds you to that. So they're not long, but it forces you to think about what's important and what's not important when you write.

Speaker 2:          12:10          Uh, Roger,

Speaker 1:          12:22          um, I, I basically you're writing about how well they perform. Um, at the end of it, you could throw in a sentence or two to the effect that they met your expectations as to the meaning of this composition as the composer intended it or they did not, but I would not spend a lot of time engaging in the review. Uh, the meaning of the piece.

Speaker 2:          12:45          No.

Speaker 1:          12:47          So we'll, we'll, we'll, you've got the five pieces here and we'll be going over some more of them in section and getting you up to speed in terms of, of the repertoire as, as time goes on. Any other questions before we introduce our first guest?

Speaker 2:          13:03          Yes.

Speaker 1:          13:12          That's to be encouraged. In other words, if you hear this opening overture going to Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. That, that the data that that's way too slow. I'm not feeling it compressed. I'm feeling excited. I'm not feeling energized by that tempo. So you should say there then I think the tempo was too slow.

Speaker 2:          13:35          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          13:36          it didn't, if the music didn't have energy, it didn't excite the listener because the initial tempo was too slow. Anything else? Well, if not, let's go on to introduce our first guest then Bradley Nailer. Here's Bradley's name up there. Bradley is the Prince of Kimono friendly. Bradley is the principal conductor for tomorrow night, and we will be listening to the Saybrook orchestra. And the rest of our discussion today is, uh, basically between you and Bradley with me feeding Bradley questions. I'm trying to think about the kinds of things that you might want to ask, but don't hesitate to jump right in and raise your hand and ask Bradley a question at any point. So, Bradley, you're a student at the school of music, right? Uh, so tell us about your musical training. How'd you get started here?

Speaker 3:          14:24          I sang in choirs, gosh, it was probably eight when I started singing in choirs, but it wasn't until middle school that I started getting serious. My middle school music teacher said, Hey Brad, why don't you try out for this region and choir thing? And then I go, okay, I'll, I'll submit a tape. And I got there and here I was in this room of 25, 15 year old tenors and they were all seeing the same notes at the same time. And I thought, well, that's just a miracle. And so I felt that that point I'd really found what I to do.

Speaker 4:          14:52          Um, went to high school, went to Undergrad where I majored in music just down the road in Providence. And I got a master's degree in choral conducting at Indiana university out in the cornfields. And now I'm back in New England getting an m and a master of musical arts and choral conducting at the Institute of Sacred Music. So the your, for your preparation for this is a little bit unusual for most conductors because I think, uh, rarely are only exceptionally, do you have people beginning in music through vocal music, they'd come around. Now you're, you're leading an orchestra here, so doesn't that put you at something of a disadvantage? I would think to be an orchestral conducted be really good to have started with the violin or maybe the French horn. So you're listening to intonation issues and things like that. I would agree with that. Um, I can't, well with the exception of maybe Robert Shaw, I can't think of a single big name conductor who started as a choral conductor and now is in charge of a, a major symphony orchestra.

Speaker 4:          15:52          The vast majority of them are either string players, keyboard players, a few wind or brass players here and there. But, um, I've done a few things to try and supplement that perceived lack of knowledge. Um, when I was an Undergrad, I took an orchestration class to try and get a sense of what the capabilities and limitations of all the instruments were. A couple of summers ago, I spent a month at Bard College in New York at a, an instrumental conducting workshop where I worked with various conductors. So I've tried to supplement that a, that initial coral leaning. Um, but what about piano now? I mean, I'm always surprised how good pianists these conductors are. So you must have had to practice piano, don't take piano, piano. Um, I wouldn't say extensively, but consistently throughout my young career. Um, because you have to, in order to, to engage the music and we'll talk about this, you have to be able to do, what was the score?

Speaker 4:          16:48          I think you have to be able to play or realize the full score, right? So it might be the kind of thing we would put a score with maybe 20 lines up there on the, on the keyboard here. And Bradley would be able to read through this. And Digest all these 20 lines at once. You pick doesn't sound all that difficult except, except a lot of these lines are not actually written. The notes that are written there are not the ones you play because they're transposing instruments such as the beef, flat clarinet in the beef flat trumpet. So it's really complicated. In fact, Ooh, Ooh, that hurts. That would be like reading a text, uh, in four languages at once. You know, one word is in Cyrillic alphabet and next the Latin alphabet. Next Hebrew alphabet. So your mind has got very quickly to change all this really hard. It takes years and years and years and years of preparation. Well, what do you, what's your goal here? What do you want to do with this? Where do you want to be 15 years from now? Oh, well, I don't

Speaker 3:          17:49          know if there's a white picket fence, but, um, I would like to be teaching at a university directing choruses, working on choral orchestral works, like maybe Haydn's creation or something like that at a great piece from the same period as Beethoven's symphony. So, uh, working at a, at a university, right.

Speaker 1:          18:06          College level as well as maybe a professional chorus or orchestra. Okay. Now here's a question for it might seem like a route one, but I, I get to my class, I get to be ruined if I want to. Um, what makes you think you can do this better than anybody else who says that you'll get to be the boss here? The leader here? A isn't that a bit of Hubris on,

Speaker 3:          18:26          on your part? I think that any conductor has a bit of Hubris in him or her. Um, I guess the short answer to that is that whenever I sit in a rehearsal, I'm using my ears. Whenever I sit in and rehearsal and I'm not conducting, I'm using my ears to try and evaluate what's coming back. And I always find myself forming an opinion. You know, this could be loud or this could be softer. I want to hear that more than I want to hear this other thing. So the only place you can achieve that goal is if you're in front of the house.

Speaker 1:          18:54          Yeah. Oddly, that's what they will be doing though. When they go to this country, you guys will be listening and say, gee, why didn't I love that flute line there? Uh, why wasn't that Flute Line Louder? So he's kind of a critic, but he wants to apply his critical facility here to interpretation. So that's it. To impose his concept of the music, um, on others for the benefit of others. I said, well, what do they have to have to conduct? What's it take to be? What's it take to be a good conductor? You think? Just just that you've got a good insights into the music. Um, well I have, I think just a good insights into the music. Music is youtube readily, but, but I don't think I would be any good as a conductor and I kind of know why. So what do you have to do? What do you have to have to be a good conductor?

Speaker 3:          19:44          I think it's a varied skillset, I think, and don't tell my colleagues I'm saying this, but I think at its basis, the conductor is really just a glorified traffic cop in certain ways. Trying to make Sur that there are no accidents. You don't want the logos to crash into the bassoon. So nobody wants that. You have to make sure that people yield when they need to. If you need to hear the viola line, you've got to have the violence yield. Um, and you just have to make sure that everyone gets to their locations without incident and a, and as fluid.

Speaker 1:          20:15          Yeah. Okay, good. Now here's a, here's a, another component of this though I've heard of people and talk about in terms of books, I have absolute rhythmic, um, sort of an absolute sense of rhythm. I can tell what a particular pulse is. I can identify that for you and I can keep that. And that's why I'm interested in, in becoming conductor or let's say you're conducting, and this is where I would always go. What I have done some conducting, used to conduct the collegium here at Uw. But where I got in trouble was when something was out of tune, I could, hey, that doesn't

Speaker 4:          20:48          sound good, but I couldn't tell them why or what to do to make it sound right. My ear wasn't good enough. So, uh, how good an ear do you have to be to be a conductor? How good, how good do you have to have an ear, not just for pitch, particularly with an orchestra, but also for timber. Ah,

Speaker 3:          21:10          which is the property that distinguishes maybe an oboe sound from a clarinet sound. Of course, if you're playing a piano,

Speaker 4:          21:17          then

Speaker 3:          21:20          you can't change the Tambour of a single piano note. But if you're playing it on a clarinet, it's going to sound very different than if you played on the trumpet. So you have to be able to balance tambors. And I think before the downbeat of the first rehearsal, a conductor really has to have the sound of the piece in his or her ear. So, so, so I know what needs to be pulled out. You know, maybe the third clarinet is a little bit sharp. So I say third clarinet, your B flat makes sure it doesn't sit too high. So I think you have to have the piece in your, in your head. There's a,

Speaker 4:          21:50          an old conductors mantra always had the score in your head and not your head and, well, okay, there are all kinds of things I get asked you about their, uh, what are you going to do in New York? You're the principal conducted and you're doing two of the three pieces you're doing the first half you're doing the Mozart and the Brahms and then, uh, Lauren Quigley will come out. She couldn't be with us today, but Lauren quickly we'll come out and lead the debate over. Are you going to try to conduct any of this without a score? And what advantages and disadvantages? Sometimes you go to concerts and a reviewer might notice that. Um, generally speaking, if you see a conductor conducting without of score, what does that indicate? Well, I think it's always impressive to the ensemble when a conductor's able to conduct without a score.

Speaker 4:          22:33          Uh, last year Helmut [inaudible], who's a famous German conductor, came and worked with some of the ensembles and didn't Mendelssohn's Elijah, which is a huge romantic oratorio about two and a half hours long. The dress rehearsal, he came to the dress rehearsal, put a score down on a music stand, conducted for three hours, never opened it. We were like, wow, this guy knows the score. So my task is to try to get four and a half minutes of Mozart into my head so I don't have to open that score. We'll see tomorrow if I'm able to do it. Um, yeah. So that's sort of talent. And so that's a kind of combination of a photographic memory and a phono graphic memory that you've got to, you've got locked in there, you can hear something just once and it's locked in there. That's the kind of thing Mozart could do and we'll talk more about that later on. Um, and so your, your orchestra will respect you more if you've got this all memorized. Uh, what does it, what does it sort of free you up to do that? Obviously, if you've got, if you're conducting without a score,

Speaker 3:          23:30          I think, I think at its, at its essence, conducting is communicating to the people in front of you and anything that you can get out of the way, uh, between you and the people who are playing the music is, is an advantage. So I think getting the music stand out of the, you're getting the score of the way.

Speaker 1:          23:45          Making sure that they're all times you can actually see the people who are making this music. I think anything you can do to do that is an advantage. Yeah. Great. Um, I want to go back to this question though of ear because I think it's so critical. You were talking about the third clarinet. Don't play too sharp. Well, once again, I'd be sitting there it who's playing what it's wrong. Wondering. All right. Is it the oboes maybe said the clarinet being sharp, the oboes flat. All I hear is a problem. I don't know what, where, what are the problem is. So, um, uh, but so you would have to have a pretty keen sense of pit. Do you have what we call absolute pitch? I don't have absolute pitch. I had a pretty creative relative. Okay. So, um, I always enjoy playing this particular game with, with musicians and people generally where we do an ear training drill and I need somebody, uh, is it Michael?

Speaker 1:          24:41          I just need somebody to come up and play the piano. And just for your bank, some notes on a panel run. Who, who uh, Daniel, you know, do you know your way around a keyboard? You're, you're a guitar player. Sure. Anybody play, uh, a gentlemen here? Come on up. Yeah. Okay. Come on up. And you know what? Yeah, so we're going to be over here, um, uh, and um, Adam come play this game also. Linda, you want to play this down? You go in terms of of pitch. You're name is Robert. Yeah. Um, so, um, uh, and, and Jacob, come on, come on out here also, um, play it started around Middle C and we'll see if anybody can identify any. Linda, you don't want to play. I'd like to have some ladies up here to Santana when you come on up and play the name, that pitch game, and we'll talk about absolute pitch and we'll talk about relative pitch. So, so play a note and we'll see how we do. Oh, it's up to you. A note that's a little lower.

Speaker 5:          25:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          25:57          Does anyone think they know what the note is? But, but don't have anybody up here think they know what it is,

Speaker 5:          26:02          I would guess, but, right.

Speaker 1:          26:06          Um, Bradley, you think you know what it is? Yeah, but I had two guesses in whichever one I say is going to be wrong. I think it's either g or a g sharp. Uh, what, what do you guys think? Okay. Okay. Um, notice how cagey I am here. I haven't committed. Um, yeah. Uh, but, but just at the outset, he played at initial pitch and then what did he do? He dropped it down an optic. Okay. So we think that that's, uh, that's probably isn't a flat or a g sharp, is that correct? Yep. Okay. Now knowing that play another pitch.

Speaker 5:          26:41          Hmm. Go ahead, rob. Anybody know what that is?

Speaker 4:          26:55          Uh, so then the question is, why is this guy teaching this course? Right? Why is he in this profession to begin with? Because, because he's wrestled with this issues and all his life is it, why me? Why can't I do this? And tried to figure it out. Tried to try to use other tricks too to get around this, to overcome this handicap and to hang around with musicians, sort of explain things that they do, that they take in sort of quickly and intuitively that and sort of break them down and explain what it is that they're doing. So at this point, Bradley seems not to be having a trouble with that pitch. I don't know what it is to be that. I could, I could g no. All right. All right. Uh, so I'm out, down, down. I go. Um, but what was that pitch? C sharp. Okay. Um, uh, all right, so let's say now knowing that that's a c sharp, let's see how far. Let's go and we'll go a little faster here. So we don't really, we don't take up too much time.

Speaker 5:          27:50          Another person who knows that Bradley Jacob, we should have them write it on the board,

Speaker 4:          28:02          who doesn't know what it is. Santana.

Speaker 4:          28:12          Anybody know who, what do you think it is? What do you think it is? I'll go with t. So I, but what, what, what was it? Was it, did you, okay. So it seems to me that actually Bradley seems to be winning here. He's tea. This is interesting. Uh, so maybe there is a reason that he's the conductor here. The rest of I'm out the rest of this or are there kind of negotiating with each other and maybe pegging off of what Bradley was saying there. So we'll stop this, but, okay. Thanks guys. Whenever I do here think, well, what song does that start? Or is there a a quarter snorting it? Which I'm committed. I know, for instance, so do you mind if I just, sure. Thanks very much. So for instance, that first note is a g sharp. So I know that the first, uh, the first Aria in Handel's Messiah starts with a really prominent g sharp and the melody. Yana kind of, I kind of know how that sounds. So that's how I figured that was a g sharp. That's the second note he played was a c sharp or d flat and there's this great for aps,

Speaker 4:          29:33          this great d flat. So I kind of find a piece that I, that I can latch onto that's very interesting. In all the years I've been doing that, I, I haven't heard

Speaker 1:          29:42          that particular explanation for it. You know, most people that have absolute pitch boom, they hear it instantaneously. There's someone in this room also was absolute pitch, but I don't want to go go into instances of absolute pitch or about one in 10,000, one in 10,000 sort of instantaneous recognition. He's getting that, but in a different way. He must have some kind of absolute wreck recollection of particular pieces that are intentionally, um, impressed on his oral memory somehow. And he then plays off of those that, that's an interesting way of doing it. But as I say, it's not something I've encountered before. Ah, okay. Well, so that's kind of important though. You've got to have a good ear like that to be able to tell these people your sharp or flat. Now let's say you're in the middle of things and something goes wrong. You Ha you have a sense that you're, you know that your clarinet is a little bit flat. W what do you, what do, you can't just hold up a sign or an arrow going like this, can you, or maybe maybe you can. How do you get it in real time as the pieces that you're conducting and the pieces unfolding. How do you get somebody to correct something in terms of intonation?

Speaker 3:          30:48          I think that there's a difference between what you're doing, a rehearsal in what you're doing, a performance and rehearsal. You'd say, hold up the grants, pause and saint clarinet three fix that in a performance you hope that you have inculcated in your performers a sense of, of pitch and a sense of what their function is. An accord so that if something's going wrong, you just look at them and say, yes, you know you're wrong. Fix it cause you can't stop. You know the traffic cop. If you don't look at the Subaru over here, he's going to crash into a tree. So you have to take care of everybody. But the guy who's running the stop sign, you had to take care of that person first.

Speaker 1:          31:23          So, um, let me ask this. Oftentimes you go to a concert, particularly, um, non professional concerts at the end of a movement, they will stop and tune if we hear in the Beethoven, uh, the tuning between movements, there's, is that a sign that the intonation and the previous movement wasn't all that it might've been?

Speaker 3:          31:44          Hmm. Um, I think it's a bigger problem with early instruments that are, that are a little bit more temperamental. But certainly if we stop in the middle and you hear Gabriel Ellsworth give us a, and we return, then yes. So

Speaker 2:          32:00          that, that would be a pig. No, I just had no problem.

Speaker 1:          32:11          Okay. Um, uh, so there are some things that you can can do in real time and uh, things that, uh, uh, that you just hope that you prepared for pro properly, but keep an eye on that. Whether they, whether they actually tuned between, between movements though now I think we have some other folks who are going to demonstrate some things here. I think we have Katie, uh, driving the v a viola player. The principal. Okay. Katie, come on up. And I don't know if Elana Kagan is here or not. She here. Flutist.

Speaker 4:          32:41          Oh my mind. Maybe she's sleeping in whole too bad. I said I doubt it, but I don't think so. I just don't know. I guess it, I guess it's only, maybe, maybe it's only five after. So we do have, let's, let's talk about the motor. We're going, we've got this opening piece. Um, uh, first of all, which piece of the two frightens you the most? You're the conductor. What are you worried about? What, what scares you when you should step out there? Well, what's easy about the Mozart? Okay, no tempo changes. Fine. So the whole piece is in this, in the same tempo problem. If you don't set the right tempo, you're screwed for four and a half minutes. When I do de de, De, De, De, De, De, De, De, I have to get that dead on so that the whole ensemble knows exactly what the tempo is. But okay, but look, let's say a mess it up in the first couple of beats, can't you correct it. I think a, a good critic as you will all be, would say, well this is classical music, mister nailer and there's nothing in the score that says writ or a cello, Rondo. So actually you should keep whatever tempo is established at the beginning. Yeah. So you're not tempted to get out there and go

Speaker 4:          33:54          like that and know that, I'm always impressed when conductors, they come out, they kind of look at the orchestra and they go and they just start without much in the way of preliminary beats. But that's a, that's kind of risky isn't it? But, uh, what am I conducting? Teachers told me, you know, there's no part in the score that's labeled conductor, so you shouldn't do anything other than what's going to get the people in front of you to play. So there's no point in the beginning going one, two, three, four, [inaudible] did an internet because then you have a conductor solo for two bars and it's not in the score. So, um, so, uh, let's see. Katie, come on up. And do we have a stand for you? Did we not? Well, I'm sure we got one inside here. Similar. Linda maybe are, but no, no.

Speaker 4:          34:37          Um, well you brought one. Okay. Get your standout because we've got the beginning of the overture to, um, uh, the marriage of Figaro here. Shall we, should we play a CD of it or you have, maybe we could, let's talk about Lindt. Well, I tell you what, well, Katie's getting her stand. I, let's talk about Linda. She's got a bassoon part here. What happens at the beginning of this, uh, Bradley in terms of, of the texture. Monophonic homophonic polyphonic monophonic. Why? Because all of the instrument, there are many instruments playing, but they're all playing the same line at the same time. Okay. So, but isn't that a little bit awkward because some of these instruments sort of speak a lot faster than other instruments? Uh, vast, but what would the fast speaking instruments, but they could play very agilely. What would they be? I think the violence probably had the easiest time of this, whereas the celli and the bassoon probably have the toughest time of this cause it takes lower instruments longer for them to speak and make, make their sounds so, um, the cellos and basses and the, the low part of the woodwinds and might have a difficult time here.

Speaker 4:          35:45          So we, uh, Linda has been good enough to be a sacrificial lamb for today and bring in her bassoon. And she sent me an email last night and say, oh, disaster, I cracked my only good read and I'm not gonna I'm not going to bring in, I can't bring in my bassoon. It just won't work. Does it? Come on when I was really counting on this. Please bring in your bassoon. So here is, here is uh, Lynda with a broken reed and um, hi, are you a lay in there? Okay, come on up. Come on up. Great. But, so, um, just come on up and take out your, your flutes and we'll get out the, the music here in just a second. So let's, can we have the beginning of, of the, uh, of the figure. Oh, do you want to conduct this or, or no, heavens, this is chamber music. I said, okay, how about I give you a template and then you guys go to town and again, and again, I think, I think Linda for, for doing this because it's not, it's not an ideal situation. All right, so here's the safe conservative tempo

Speaker 6:          36:50          about that editing, editing, editing, not that bad.

Speaker 4:          36:54          One, two,

Speaker 6:          37:02          the,

Speaker 4:          37:05          Huh,

Speaker 2:          37:09          cool.

Speaker 4:          37:17          Wonderful.

Speaker 2:          37:18          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          37:23          great. The music one 12 orchestra. Um, now you said, well, here's a conservative safe tempo, but what, what, what happens if you don't take a safe tempo? What, uh, what kind of disasters might befall us? Well, I think in this case there wouldn't be a disaster. It just wouldn't go as fast as I had set up. So, uh, I have a recording of, um, I think it's James Leviathan and the metropolitan opera opera orchestra, highest paid orchestra in the country. And they take this at a blistering tempo.

Speaker 6:          37:55          Yeah,

Speaker 4:          37:59          really fast. Yeah. Let's see how close we can get. Uh, how fast you can take something. Sometimes is conditioned by the acoustical environment that you're in. And maybe we'll come back to that about the acoustics of Patel a little bit, a little bit later on. Um, now, uh, let's see. Katie, you're a violist and um, you're the principal. Violist. Then I wanted to ask you, your job is to kind of ride roughshod over the rest of the violas here. Um, and how do you do, isn't it like hurting

Speaker 1:          38:36          rattlesnakes or something like that hat? Supposing you want to get your section to be really precise and really exact and all those boats going up and down at the same time. The articulation, exactly. Exactly the way they should be. Uh, how do you go? You lead by example, but in the actual performance, how do you keep your, your, the rest of those deal with you? The principle,

Speaker 7:          38:58          oh, well, you have to be very confident about what your plan, you can change your mind. So you need to know what you need to come in, what you knew, which direction your go in and show that when you're playing just by being confident. And so then the rest of the people who know that part's very well. Um, but well can call you if they get off and we'll have that little bit of assurance come in.

Speaker 1:          39:24          Great. How do we know that they know their parts really well? What would you imagine might be a tip off? And you're, you're at a concert and you're watching, you're looking what's going look, what would it be a tip off to? Maybe they don't know their parts really well.

Speaker 1:          39:40          They're sitting there with their nose in the music rather than watching the conductor. The more the orchestra is watching the conductor for the cues and the interpretation, the more that says, Hey, they've really got this almost committed to memory. Uh, and they can get in. They can get beyond the notes into the question of interpretation there. Another thing is just a very basic thing is the, Katie has mentioned here is watching, she wants to have very prominent bro boasts strokes. I guess so that everybody, the whole section will be in sync if you see, see this kind of thing in terms of the bowl movement, maybe the articulation really isn't altogether there. They should, all, each of these sections should be going there pretty much the same way it was that, right? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          40:19          And particularly with the string instruments, there's a different sound with the

Speaker 7:          40:24          okay.

Speaker 4:          40:25          Up Is it in term as opposed to a down bow. So an oppose, we'll start very small at down, but you can start very

Speaker 1:          40:31          gruffly. So it does make a difference. So, um, uh, uh, Katie, let me ask you this. Generally speaking, all don't have solos in the repertoire, so what's the hardest thing for you to play there Saturday night? What scares you?

Speaker 7:          40:47          Here's me. Wow. Like you said, we don't have solos, but we are very important to me that we of the upper and the lower strings and other parts are together. Um, and I think other perceptions get used to hearing us play certain parts and when we're not there.

Speaker 1:          41:07          Yeah.

Speaker 7:          41:08          That's not only true for violist. Yeah, pretty much.

Speaker 1:          41:11          Yeah. That's a good point. You're kind of like the glue and particularly I would imagine rhythmically is the, if you, you might be setting really setting the tempo when these other extreme high, lower play them off of the rhythmic tempo that you're setting, setting, they're in the middle. What's the most different? Is there any moment that you sort of get to soar with some music that you like particularly what, what's your favorite moment? Most beautiful moment for you? Can you play a little that rolling. Okay.

Speaker 7:          41:37          Um, and the apartment or we have the melody.

Speaker 1:          41:42          Uh Huh.

Speaker 2:          41:47          Okay.

Speaker 7:          42:26          And that's kind of fun.

Speaker 1:          42:31          Yeah. Well I guess it's like maybe the right guard of the left guard on a football team. Nobody ever notices, but to actually crucial to the overall running of this operation. Um, okay. Now we have also with this, uh, thank you Katie. Be also, we have with this the principal flutist right to Elena Kagan and you've got some heavy duty exposure, particularly in the Beethoven second movement with all of those solos there. Uh, so here's a question for a Katie with, excuse me, Elena w with the Solos that you have to play. Do you ever get nervous?

Speaker 7:          43:05          Of course, definitely. I mean, when you really have a solo on your fingers and you don't have to be nervous, it makes it even more fun and you can always play better when you're not so focused on that. So I certainly try to get beyond being nervous. But then that's definitely there. And the trickier it is, the more nervous I get.

Speaker 1:          43:24          Well what happens to the playing when you get nervous? How can we recognize that you're nervous or you can't?

Speaker 7:          43:31          But I mean a lot of times messing up is a sign of being nervous. Is there a lot of players who will get it right every time and rehearsal and then just the nerves of the concert?

Speaker 1:          43:42          Yeah, that was me. I always said I was the world's greatest warm up pianist and then you get to the moment you have to play and nerves kick in the, you know, just his little fractions of inches on these instruments. The question of life and death. So if your, if your head is it all quivering and can imagine a little violin, they, I did you get this huge vibrato or, so where did this come from? Um, okay. So let's, uh, let's, um, uh, he or if we, if we may, Ilana, some of the, um, the lovely, lovely imitations of bird calls, they're in the second movement of the Beethoven. Um, what would, what would be good for you to, um, to play, choose anything that you like? So this is Beethoven second movement theme and variations and,

Speaker 2:          44:30          okay.

Speaker 7:          44:35          Well there's, if there's one part at the end that definitely sounds like, okay,

Speaker 1:          44:38          you have the interesting, I guess a duet with declare an end that, that sort of thing. Or is that what you're talking about? The end.

Speaker 7:          44:46          There's a lot of intricacies between the hope, the wind instruments having conversations. Um, so I can play a couple of those parts.

Speaker 2:          45:28          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          45:30          You'll hear lots of cascading other woodwinds they choose me is really just said with the oboe and the Clearnet sort of dialoguing against this, um, intonation here. Do you guys practice this individually? Do you have what we would call sectionals where you get together and work this out or you only do this with the full orchestra?

Speaker 7:          45:49          Well, we actually haven't had analysis. That's certainly very common to have sectionals to work it out. But this semester we mostly just worked on it on our own and as a full orchestra. Uh Huh.

Speaker 1:          46:03          Um, one the one thing instruments are out of tune. Is it that the Bradley, what do you think? Is it often the woodwinds that get out of tune?

Speaker 3:          46:15          Um, I think that, uh, you know, I don't want to lay blame or it's not do, but I think that sometimes it's easier for instruments that you can press down to key and no more or less the right support, what note is going to come out. But if you have a string instrument with no frets, like a guitar has frets on its fingerboard but violence and all the string family don't. So that's a little bit more guesswork. So it's really difficult, especially in fast passage work like Katie was playing earlier to get a uniform intonation across the section.

Speaker 1:          46:43          So we have really only about two more minutes left and I'd like to make the following point. One of the things you should be on the look out for is balance over there and what the French horns are doing because this is a really exposed instrument and they're probably going to be up there on risers and that sound tends to Blair fourth and in Patel. So keep an eye out for the French horns. They're really, really be exposed. Um, I have one other line of development here, but I want it before we go. Does anybody out there have a question that you would like to ask Bradley or Katie or Allana?

Speaker 7:          47:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          47:14          All right, let me, uh, ask, asked them this question. Where should we sit? What are the acoustical issues involved in Battelle? Do we want to sit so we can see? And that's not bad. You might say, Hey, well I'll get way up in the front as far as I can and watch this in this intricate orchestra, this great grand machine firing on all cylinders, cylinders here, or do I want to go all the way to the back? And maybe just push away the visual and just enjoy the sale. Because oftentimes in concert halls, the best sound is not a front sailing sailing right over your head. It's coalescing in the back of the hall. So where should we sit?

Speaker 4:          47:51          Well, my favorite place to sit in concerts, so somewhere where I can see that interaction between the different, I guess, gears in the machine as well. Um, so, uh, I would sit somewhere not directly behind the conductor. So somewhere where you can see the players because they're the ones actually making the music. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          48:09          So if you want to go second balcony all the way down as far as you can go, you can actually get up in front of the conductor. You can be almost being the orchestra that way. Now, what about the acoustic last issue here? The Acoustics in Patel, are they, are they pretty good, favorable?

Speaker 4:          48:25          Well, it doesn't matter. Do you have trouble hearing while they're certainly different than the runway practicing? Um, which is why we have a dress rehearsal so that we can adjust our sound according to the acoustics of the room that we're playing in. Um, but I think, uh, Patel is a lot more live, meaning that, um, the sound sort of like live as long.

Speaker 1:          48:49          Yeah. It's resonance. It has a very long reverberation cycle. How do we cut down? How can you help the orchestra? What would you guess what would be the best way you can help the orchestra to bring clarity to their sale and actually allow them to play faster, get that tempo with the Mozart to go faster. If you've got a wall more verberations cycle, little hall, your tempo will go slower. What can you do to help out here now? That 40 and thing, what would you do? Wear a sweater. Bring a teddy bear. Bring your friend, bring your mother, grandmother. Bring as many people. Get as many sound absorbing bodies in there as you possibly can. So we'll see you then Saturday night, eight o'clock and thanks to our guests.

Speaker 7:          49:33          Okay.
