Speaker 1:          00:01          Today we begin a slightly different portion of our course. Uh, we'll be talking about the periods in the history of music beginning with the Middle Ages, and I've pit put the names of those periods that we will be covering in our course up here on the board. Obviously, medieval renaissance, baroque, classical romantic, impressionist modernist. So we could even add to that postmodernist now and probably throw into that a popular music in a general way. We're going to begin here with Gregorian chant, talking about the traditional music of the Roman Catholic Church. We will not be promoting in here the values of the Roman Catholic church anymore. We then we promoted the values of the Jewish religion when we listened to Klezmer music or, uh, the Islamic religion when we listened to the autumn. Or we will be promoting, we will not in fact be promoting the Lutheran tradition when we deal with Bach next time.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Uh, this ain't religion in this course. This is art. So with that, understood. Let's begin with an introduction to medieval music. Starting with Gregorian chant. What is Gregorian chant? Gregorian chant is the monophonic one line music. Oops, I think I need to turn something on here. Excuse me. Monophonic one line, the music of the Roman Catholic church as it existed from the time of the earliest church fathers up until the time of the Council of Trent, the Council of Trent, as you may know from your history courses, was a conclave held in the northern Italian town of Trento, Italy from 1545 to 1563 at which time they tried to combat the effects of the Protestant reformation, instituting reforms within the church, purifying the existing Church of Rome, cleaning up the Catholic Church. In effect, among the things that got purified where the art and the music, no more nudity was allowed in art, in any nudity that was already there.

Speaker 1:          02:19          And religious art was painted over. Any sort of secular tunes were taken out of the church. Snappy rhythms in church music, uh, work proscribed. What music was sung henceforth would be dictated by Rome. No more new chant was composed. So the composition of chant then begin all the way back slightly as shortly after the, the death of Christ and continued into the 16th century. What we call Gregorian chant, really rent. It went on for a period of 1500 years from this. It is obvious then that although it takes its name from Pope Gregory the first, and you have his dates on the board over there. Gregory, the Great Gregorian chant had almost nothing to do with Gregory Gregory was a church administrator, a writer of sermons, and an important theologian, but it's only an historical accident that he is associated with this vast repertoire of Chin. Gregory had an influential biographer, John the Deacon, who ascribed perhaps more to Gregory than he actually accomplished and generally speaking in the Middle Ages, there was this tendency to ascribe to a single or a couple of male authority figures a lot more than they actually did.

Speaker 1:          03:42          The point here is the Gregorian chant was being composed 500 years before Gregory set foot on this earth and nearly a thousand years after. What's the purpose of Gregorian chant? What did it do? Well, it did two things. One, it communicated the message of the church. It allowed for the transmission of the word of God as they, the faithful understood the word and understood God and it transmitted the theology. The message of the church chant then was a medium for the broadcast, literally the broadcast of the word in a resonant acoustical environment such as a stone or Stucco church, one can project, one can impel attacks better if you sing it rather than just simply to claim it as usual. I could say for example, now let us read the Epistle of the blessing apostle Paul to the Romans, but the techs projects better if I sing it. Lexi OIP sterling,

Speaker 2:          04:42          how the odd Roma Aha, no walls

Speaker 1:          04:47          in that fashion, it goes out better and it can reverberate better. Chant used for direct reading directly communicating the tax was generally sill abic chant. In syllabic chant, each syllable has just one note and in syllabic chant, the musical range tends to be rather narrow. The second purpose of chant chant also allowed for a period of reflection upon the subject of the preceding reading. A sermon or a passage of scripture would be followed by a reflective chant. Time for contemplation. This music for reflection upon a preceding religious theme was generally melodramatic. Now, umbrellas, Madec chant is one in which there are many notes for just one syllable of texts. And in millipedes, medic chant, the range tends to be a lot broader. It's more virtuosic. So simple chanting for readings. That's syllabic Chad, more complex chant for moments of personal and reflection. That's Mila's Madec Chin. Let's take an example here. I have my venerable libor usual us up here, and I'm going to sing the Luhya for Easter Sunday. Listen, I'm going to try to sing it, and it's an example of a melodramatic chin. And you'll notice one syllable here, uh Oh, um, is conveyed by probably 30 notes.

Speaker 3:          06:26          Ooh,

Speaker 1:          06:29          Ooh,

Speaker 4:          06:31          yeah. Aw Huh. Aw, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Speaker 1:          06:53          So that's eight mellows, medic chin. A moment of joyful celebration associated with the resurrection of Christ. So that's what chance did. And that's what it does today. It just firstly a medium for the projection of sacred texts. And secondly, a vehicle for spiritual contemplation where it was chance some, well, early on chat with some, and not so much in what we would call public churches, but more in sequestered usually rural monasteries, religious communities segregated by gender. What specifically we would call monasteries for men and convince or nunneries for women. Remember, hamlet enjoining Ofelia get thee to a nunnery. The dominant monastic order for both male and female in the Middle Ages was the Benedictine order founded by benedict of [inaudible] near Rome, about five 30 common era dates and names spelled out on the board from benedict. The church received a code of conduct prescribing how monks and nuns should live the ideal spiritual life while on this earth.

Speaker 1:          08:08          Here is that book I want to purchase. Visit the monastery of Saint John in Collegeville, Minnesota about 60 miles west of Minneapolis. So this is the rule of Saint Benedict. It told the clergy how to spend the day it applied equally to male and female communities. The day was divided in two periods of work and two periods of worship. Pray, singing, chanting, reading scripture. They worked so as to feed themselves and they prayed so as to save their souls. They were not so much interested in good works for the community. They sort of withdrawn from the community, but in personal salvation, saving their own souls, perhaps the souls of as well, the periods during which they worship, we're called the canonical hours. The word Canon in Latin literally means rule a canon is a musical composition that follows a strict rule. One voice has got to follow another exactly in terms of rhythm and pitch from beginning, beginning to end.

Speaker 1:          09:17          But here we have something a little bit different. Canonical hours following the rule. The Canon of Saint Benedict, the hours usually involve praying and reading scripture and in singing and they started early in the morning about four o'clock in most houses at a canonical hour called matins. Next they would go on to celebrate louds about daybreak and so on around the hours ending with vespers and compliant on, I might ask you here, we actually have this service in the Yale community, broadly speaking, it's not particularly, uh, religiously oriented at all. Have any of you gone to the compliance service, uh, at Christ church across from the old bookstore? As I say, it's not particularly a denominational in any way. It's mostly in the dark. It's very reflective. Yes. Michael has, I see some other people have as well. You might check that out Sunday at 10 o'clock in the evening. It's just a lovely time for peace and quiet reflection.

Speaker 1:          10:19          You can think about any god that tuition there I think about and perhaps work through any personal issues that you might want to want to engage as to the mass of the day. We usually think of this as the principle service that strictly speaking was not a canonical hour. It was a special service. Uh, that happened usually at around nine o'clock, celebrated at the high altar of the church. So that's what the clergy did in the Middle Ages by way of worship gathering at these prescribed times to pray and to sing. And that's what the clergy still doesn't bend a dictate Benedictine houses around the world. The most authentic of these benedictine houses is the one that you see on the screen here. At so limb about 150 miles south of Paris some years back. I had the pleasure of living there for a 10 days, uh, to study Gregorian chant.

Speaker 1:          11:15          When you arrive, the Abbott comes out to greet you. He's attended on either side by two acolytes and you go through a ceremony of in which he washes your hand. This washing of the hands was a traditional, still is a traditional gesture by the Benedictines of hospitality and to some extent of humility, you the visitor are assigned to a sale. Let's have the next slide, Jacob, please. There we go. Okay. And all this signal, those. All right, so there we are with the next slot. You are assigned a room. Oh, let's go back to this. A, you're assigned a room in. This building has been worked over, but that's where actually I stayed in the, in that building. In that room, you have a light bulb, you have a desk, you have a bed, some fruit, you have no radio, you have no clock, no television, and certainly no cell phone.

Speaker 1:          12:08          How then do you get up to attend the canonical hours? Because in order to be in this monastery, you are required to attend all of these canonical hours. What is it that wakes you up then, would you imagine? Hmm. Bells. Nice and loud please. Okay. Thank you. Michael Bell's. Okay. The ringing of the bells, they begin to regulate your existence for each of the signal. Each of these canonical hours. Indeed we get our word clock from the medieval French word, close bell and our word, the very word our comes from the Latin aura to pray or Rasia prayer. So we have the sense of praying at regular times, regular intervals around the day at Solum. The Bells call you to the church to hear these canonical hours. They call you to the refectory to consume your meals and I submit that you really haven't dined in this world to you sit down and break dark brown bread with 80 hooded Benedictine speaking in Latin.

Speaker 1:          13:24          If when they are not speaking, they are tapping particular signals on the table and suddenly everybody will rise. Sevenly everybody will bow and visitor is sort of left perplexed as to what is transpiring. But that's, that's what goes on. As I have said, this rule of Saint Benedict formulated in the sixth century, prescribed this cycle of canonical hours. As the Middle Ages proceeded, the cycle of ours was adopted at Cathedral Churches, even though the strict rule for communal living was not the daily timetable of worship was kept. But the idea of eating and sleeping together was abandoned. Cathedrals were much more urban in their location. They were not withdrawn. They were in cities. The clergy administered to the spiritual and social needs of the community. The clergy was celibate de jure, if not de facto. They lived in private homes, not in a communal dormitory, in houses that were situated all around the Cathedral.

Speaker 1:          14:33          Let's take a look at a typical medieval cathedral. And for this, I'm going to choose Chartron. Now. Um, it's not typical. It's the most beautiful. If you have one cathedral to go to. I strong and I think I'd been, to all I know that I'd been to all the big ones and in France, uh, go to sharp for, for several reasons. First of all, it has the most up pristinely preserved town around the back of the church. As you can see, the medieval city from the 12th and 13th centuries is pretty much still there. It has the widest knave of any of these gothic cathedrals. If you look carefully on the floor, you see a medieval labyrinth there. Uh, so it has the best preserved of any of these, uh, uh, cathedral floors. It has the best preserved stain glass, which is, which is famous a world a wide.

Speaker 1:          15:32          Uh, and it has, uh, the original crypt in this building, which extends all the way back in to the, uh, uh, eighth century indeed was part of a preceding church that was built in the course of the eighth through the 11th centuries. And we're going to see now what the cathedral, the Romanesque cathedral and shark looked like before it was built into the one that we know and see today. This is Roman, Nashville. What we saw before was gothic. So here we see here we see, um, a group of clerics centering around Bishop full bear twos there to the right. This illumination dates from right around the year 10 20. We'll return to full bear tooths and here one of his chance at the end of our hour. But for the moment, let's pass on to the women on the left there. Notice that they are out to the side.

Speaker 1:          16:33          They've been segregated. Indeed, they are physically marginalized. Women were to be silent in the church according to the scriptural dictum of Saint Paul. Molliere Takei apt in a crazier, but as we have seen, there was ample opportunity for spiritual contemplation and creativity for women, specifically in the convents. One spiritual leader within the community of Benedictine convents was Hildegard of Bingen. Hildegard lived in the 12th century. She came from the area of being in on the West Bank of the Rhine River in Germany. She grew up in a Benedictine convent. Here is the ruins of that Benedictine convent. And then she went on ultimately to found her own convent. And this is the, these are the ruins or the 17th century drawing of that convent, which is now also, uh, in ruins. Hildegard was a polymath. She could do many things. She wrote on Church administration, on botany, on pharmacology, on medicine, and on music.

Speaker 1:          17:41          Indeed, because of this diversity, we can, I think fairly say that the first renaissance man in actuality was a medieval woman. Hildegard of Bingen, popes and bishops sought her advice in part because she was a visionary. She had visions associated with Dick Christian story to go guard also wrote Gregorian chance. So let's look at some slides of Hildegard. She was famous in her day here we have a manuscript put together in northern Italy about 20 years after her death with the representation of Hildegard up there on the top left. Next slide takes us to a blow up of this. And we see the representation of Hildegard having a Celeste deal vision. That's why the wavy lines going up from her head. She's receiving the Holy Spirit. She is copying down. Know what she, uh, what she perceives. Not on a notebook computer, but on a wax tablet with a large stylists in her right hand.

Speaker 1:          18:46          Her assistant, the one male allowed in this community for the sacraments. Her assistant Volmer peaks in astonished at what he is seeing. A another illustration of the same sort, the phantasmagorical trinity here with God, the Father Christ the warrior slaying the devil that is now trampled on his feet down below. Hildegard is seeing all this as we see from this illumination here. And a blow up of that again shows us the wavy lines, the descent of the Holy Spirit, the writing on the wax tablet this time, her assistant, her favorite assistant Ricarda Ricardo looks in. Um, again, on this particular particular scene, Hildegard's music is distinctive and the texts that she created for this music are even more remarkable, more than any religious poet that I know. And I have studied this to some degree, religious poet of the Middle Ages that I know, uh, her tax of the most startling, her imagery, the most vivid, most graphic, indeed the most beautiful.

Speaker 1:          19:55          She talks of a saint in terms of the sweat of his goodness, shining like a bomb on his forehead of the odor of the sanctity of the Virgin Mary being as sweet as the scent of honeysuckle and Lilac. Hildegard sees the blood of Christ streaming in the heavens, in her own musical creations. With regard to them, she styles herself simply a breadth, a feather on the breadth of God, a feather on the breadth of God. What an interesting metaphor, but very appropriate for this very modest individual she was, but a feather on the breadth of God with regard to her own personal creations, carrying out, going wherever God would send her. Now you have on your cd's four hour course. It's actually CD one track to Hildegard's Oh greenest branch. And when you listen to this, it's actually the basis of a listening exercise that we will get to.

Speaker 1:          20:53          Um, when you listen to this, you might be interested to know that this was recorded right in the base of harkness tower over there was recorded in Brandford Chapel. And although when you read the liner notes and we'll say the Hildegard singers, the Hildegard singers were simply some female graduate students, ladies that were here interested in singing early music that uh, for that particular recording became what I labeled them, the Hildegard singers. So that recording was done over at brand for chapel. But let's listen to another one from a group of four women from New York City. They're called anonymous for they put out wonderful recordings. Um, and it's a good example of melodramatic chant again by Hildegard of Bingen. Now you have the text up on the board here. I don't know if we can read it then I'll read it off to oh, Rubar Sung greenies. Oh, redness of blood qui are key day shell. So ilow flew week seats that flowed down from heaven. Quote, DVT toss, Tate Tate Jeep, which divinity touched two flows, asked view or the flower quote, humans they to to [inaudible], which the wintry breadth of the serpent serpent another words the devil knew qualm lacy will never wound. So that's the uh, tax. Now let's listen to the music of Hildegard of Bingen.

Speaker 5:          23:53          Lovely. So what can we say about Chin by way of conclusion? First of all, of course it is monophonic. We hear only one line monophonic texture chances monophonic changes also unaccompanied as you heard, chant has no meter, no rhythm to it, no regular rhythm, at least it seems to flow as Hildegard says, like a feather on the breath of God. Now chant is enjoying something of a rebirth at the moment. Something of a resurgence of interest ever since the appearance in 19 six, 1996 of this CD simply called Chan. It went platinum in its first year, selling over a million copies, outselling the Beatles, even for a time, and it was succeeded by other chance. CD's all produced appropriately enough by angel records. We had chant to chant three beyond chant, son of chant. Uh, there were Hildegard knockoffs. We had, uh, Matt about monks mad about monks and if we had the original chance CD issued by the Benedictine monks of centered Domingo, Spain. So of course we have a knock off now by the Benz Adriene monks of Santa Monica, California.

Speaker 5:          25:22          Oh, okay. Let's go on to the next slide which should be blank and I don't know what I did with it but just last month off here it is. I don't have a good picture but just last month I went on CNN online. You know you can see the headlines there. There was a headline move over Madonna, I think this was the other Madonna move over Madonna, a CD of the and chance by a group of Cistercian nuns is a surprise crossover best seller reaching the pop charts and you can actually buy this as I did on Amazon or wherever you want to to buy it. Why all this interest in Chin because it has much in common with so called New Age music chant is non confrontational, non assertive. It is somewhat laid back if you will, as the mind and the spirit are allowed to contemplate to form a divine communion.

Speaker 5:          26:20          Perhaps chant is the very opposite of the music of Beethoven. Beethoven tries to convince you to feel a particular way about every moment, every measure in his music. It is very much rhetorical music chant. On the other hand, you can take on your own terms. It is non authoritarian, it is non assertive, non aggressive, it floats unfettered. And many of these same characteristics are found in new age music, hence the newfound popularity of medieval chat. Now let's turn our attention away from Chin away from monophonic music too early polyphony multi voice music, music of the Church of the Middle Ages, but polyphonic music, early polyphonic music for the church was called origanum called organism. It was first created in the great urban gothic cathedrals of friends, most particularly at [inaudible] of Paris. So let's visit here. Our well known not for dom, with the West facade and in some of the famous, uh, latterly edit flying buttresses around to the south side there, the south east side.

Speaker 5:          27:36          It is likely not coincidental that the high walls of this new gothic style were being created. These courses of stone laid one on top of the other at precisely the same time, around 1200. That verticality was being introduced to music. What I mean is that all cathedral organum was built upward above a preexisting chin, bubba preexisting Gregorian chant. The composer took the chant and placed it in the bottom voice and then added other voices up on top of it to form counterpoint against it. It was the job of the tender to take the chance and to hold it out in long notes. That's why the tenor is called what it is or rigidly. It comes from the word Latin 10 EO. I hold or 10 year, uh, in, um, in modern fringe to hold the infinitive there so that we have this idea of one voice, the chant holding out to the long notes underneath.

Speaker 5:          28:39          It was kind of the basis of, of the music. And then up above the composer would create new polyphony. What you see on the screen is an example of this medieval organism. You can see we have four lines, uh, in each, uh, brace in effect. The one with V has just one pitch. You could see the big illumination, Their v and then the pitch f out, uh, to the right of it. And it just sits there because it just holds out the, as the music goes on for many, many, many, many, many, many seconds. And finally go Danay holds that out. Then finally down at the bottom rule wound, as all of this other polyphony goes on up above. Let's listen to an example of some of this medieval sound

Speaker 6:          29:40          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          30:47          and we'll stop it there. So it's very different, but it's very complex at the same time. Again, good example of medieval organ of Medieval polyphonic. But let's turn our attention now away from the music of the Middle Ages in Paris to the renaissance and Rome and specifically to the Sistine Chapel. This Sistine Chapel was the most famous of all churches in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The core of the renaissance. Why? Because it was the private chapel of the pope, not Saint Peter's. Interestingly enough, this is a shot of modern day Saint Peter's. Let's go. There we go. Uh, but this was during the renaissance, only beginning to be constructed following design of who? Of, hmm. Um, which famous painter? Michael Angelo. Yeah. Michael Angelo. I was involved in the design of Saint Peter. Um, but this was not in existence at the time. Were under a discussing here. A big, as an impressive as it may be.

Speaker 5:          31:54          So where the pope was actually worship being for the most part in this period was not in Saint Peter's, but next door in effect over in this building in the Sistine Chapel. And here of course, because it was his own place of worship, he could come in the very best, the best materials of the best artists, the best musicians construction on the Sistine Chapel began in 1477 during the reign of Pope Sixth, this the fourth, hence the name sticks, Sistine Chapel. It's 60th 16 officially. You get the etymological connection there. It's 132 feet long and 45 feet. Why the ceiling? The famous sealing Michelangelo is 70 feet off the floor. Michelangelo painted, as you know, scenes from the Bible, both creation and the expulsion. He also painted scenes, uh, of the civil profits as a written about by Virgil in the Aeneid. The side walls are covered with frescoes of Bata Chally, Para Gino and Rafael here, one by Rafael at the east end where the high altar was situated.

Speaker 5:          33:17          There is the famous last judgment scene by Michelangelo himself painted somewhat later in the 1530s, just as the pope hired the best painters. So he engaged the finest musicians. The incomparable is just scan they prey, which will be the focus of your listening exercise 16 and Giovanni pair Luigi. Dot. Palestrina. You've probably heard the name Palestrina, a prototypical renaissance composer. They composed and they sang both chant and polyphony. They were members of the papal chapel. So a chapel in this period and even today can mean two things. One, the physical building. Let's have another slide. The physical building. So that's one kind of chapel and to the musical ensemble, the choir that performs in this building and the actual paypal chapel. As you can see here, there is a logia that sticks out. And this is where the singers such as just scan the prey and, uh, Giovanni panel, VG.

Speaker 5:          34:28          Dot. Palestrina would stand when they sang before the pope. Now, because this paypal chapel here saying, without any accompaniment, without any accompaniment of instruments whatsoever, even the Oregon, that style of singing came to be called acappella. Literally Acappella CISTINA. So unaccompanied singing means without instruments. If you are in an Octopal, a singing group here at Yale, you are a descendant of this tradition of singing without instruments in the Sistine chapel. That's what acappella means in the chapel, but literally in this pope six stasis chapel here, singing without instruments. In this case, the paypal chapel performed in the paypal chapel standing in as mentioned, the Logia that you see there on the lower right side of your screen. Who were the members of the Papal Chapel? Well, they were all male clerics. We've said that chance was segregated by gender. There were also all female ensembles in this period, but they were in convents, but in monasteries, cathedrals in here, in the paypal chapel. Then as today, the ensembles were all male, but if they were all male, who then saying the soprano when polyphony was performed well at various times, this was done in one of three ways. Males could sing in head voice, which is called falsetto. Any of the gentlemen here ever tried to sing falsetto?

Speaker 6:          36:07          Oh, oh, oh,

Speaker 7:          36:13          Ooh,

Speaker 6:          36:15          oh, oh, oh.

Speaker 5:          36:19          Sounds pretty awful, right? Okay. But if I practice that it ain't bad, I never practice it. Um, but if I practice that you can practice that just like you can any other voice, uh, and it begins to sound better and better and it can function as a soprano line. So that was, that was option one. Option two was to have choir boys, choir boys seeing this up upper part. And as this illustration shows a, this in many ways was a popular medium of performance, the old men and the young choir boys. Uh, but a third possibility that came to be used in the Sistine Chapel during the 16th century West to assign the soprano line to a cash strato, a male who had shown a promising singing voice as a boy and had therefore been subjected to the process of castration to maintain this high voice. Now there was some economic advantage to the Castro because one can strato could make as much noise as three fall status or for choir boys, the Castro had a high voice, but a very big body.

Speaker 5:          37:30          Now. It has always seemed profoundly ironic to me that the one institution most fervently in favor of castration of boys to produce this high powerful voice was the papacy. But that is an historical fact. Indeed. The pope's continued to engage and support Castrati into the early 20th century. We in fact have a recording made in 1905 of the last Castrato to sing in the paypal chapel. Allesandro Moreso [inaudible]. His name is on the board. I will now play a CD of this voice. It will sound very unpleasant for two reasons. One the recording was made in 1905 so it's very old and it has all the surface noise that those old recordings have. And to Maresca, he himself was very old. He was about 70 when this recording was made and who has a good voice, male or female, who has a good voice when they are seven so it doesn't present the cast rato at its best, but at least it will give you an idea of the sound of this lost voice. So we're going to listen to a bit of Castrato. Alexandra Marecki singing the Bach Guna. No Ave Maria.

Speaker 5:          39:54          Okay, let's turn from that very old recording to a modern recording. Now. It's a recording of a piece by Palestrina written around 1594, the Sistine chapel here. Um, it is a song too. It's from a mass and for the parts of the mass, uh, the curator, the glory, et Cetera. See page 83 of your textbook. So it's a song of the mass and just as we have the Hebrew Prophet Isaiah, and when I think we can bring that up now with the next slide on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel painted by Michelangelo Post. Uh, so we had the voice of Isaiah in this mass and in this music for it is from Isaiah that the text song to song to song was dominus Deus, Deus Saba, out comes holy, holy, Holy Lord, God Almighty. Now this piece by Palestrina, uh, and I hope you've everybody got the sheet there.

Speaker 5:          40:50          We've got the sheet of music. You can, there's enough light I think generally to see, uh, what, uh, what you have there. Uh, it is written in for voice polyphony, but the aesthetic impact of this polyphony is pretty much the same as that of Chan. Instead of one line of chant, now we have four independent lines. So we have polyphony. Palestrina has taken a piece of chant slightly indeed. What it was was an old hymn monophonic him. Should I be animated? The line through the addition of simple rhythmic values and placed it in four voices so as to amplify the sense for could do more to amplify the sense of the of the chant. Indeed, this song Tucs has this same relaxed nonaggressive unassertive. You have very beautiful style of chant itself even though there are now four individual parts instead of one, we've got polyphony instead of monopoly.

Speaker 5:          41:53          So you've got the music there. Palestrina is overlaying sewing together here for short chant like phrases and I've numbered them on this sheet one through four. Each of these phrases comes in in turn in each voice, each voice imitating the preceding voice. So we've got imitative counterpoint. These passages of counterpoint are called points of imitation, points of imitation. This is what we get a lot of in renaissance music. So we have four points of imitation in point of fact. It's so they sort of look like for very short expositions in a few, but in this sunk twos in this imitative saunters of Palestrina, uh, each exposition, each of these four little exposition has its own, the subject, its own theme here rather than one dominating the whole few. Okay. So here are the EOM saw and this is number one.

Speaker 4:          42:54          Hahahaha.

Speaker 5:          43:01          And then number point number two begins. No me,

Speaker 4:          43:06          Saba,

Speaker 5:          43:09          uh, number three across the page any soon. [inaudible] uh, and then finally [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          43:20          uh, uh,

Speaker 5:          43:25          see in that fashion show is we listened to this recording. Now I have a question for you here. Who is singing the soprano part? Are these women the singing this or these choirboys saying this are these false set of sending this or these castrati singing this? Let's listen.

Speaker 6:          44:30          Oh,

Speaker 5:          45:48          imitative style relaxed in terms of it's expressive content is very much the, the essence of the acapella style of renaissance vocal music. Uh, and who was singing the soprano part there of our four options. Any thoughts about that? Elizabeth? I can fall setters. Yeah, there was a full meal, false Satish voicing not women, not choir boys and of course Castrati or no are no longer an option. So it was false set. Is there now like to end with one final final thing and that is um, uh, enjoying myself today, indulging myself, dressing up, getting ready for Halloween. Um, but the, the point of this in a way is to try to give you a sense of what this music, and it's a very esoteric kind of music is about, but it really, to do it in the classroom, we would have to take this whole class, we'd have to go to the cathedral, the shark, and we have to sit there and we'd have to be in front of a statue and look at the beauty of that statute.

Speaker 5:          46:51          We have to look at the architecture all around us. We have to look at the beautiful copes on the back of the clergy. We would have to see the beautiful stain glass. We would have to smell the incense that is light. And I thought about doing that, but the fire marshal would probably shut this down. Uh, what we can try to do here, I think I have about a minute left here to go back to the cathedral of sharks. So let's, we have a slide here. Uh, it's a slide once again, of bishop full bear tattoos. Uh, he is the composer of the music that you are about to hear, uh, and again is sung by a female group. However, um, and as this music plays, just sit back and relax. Pretend you are having a transcendental experience yourself. Sit back, relax, and look at some of this glorious is stain glass. Um, an architecture that has been in this cathedral, uh, since the late 12th century.

Speaker 6:          47:47          Sure. Okay. Ooh, Ooh. Oh, Ooh.

Speaker 5:          49:18          So that's all for today. [inaudible] him. Parksville beat him. Good God. Seal Nisa asked, I'll turn on the light so we don't kill ourselves.

Speaker 6:          49:35          Ooh.
