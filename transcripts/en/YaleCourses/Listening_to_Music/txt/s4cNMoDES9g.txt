Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay, let me just check the volume sounds okay. Let's get started this week. We're going to continue our discussion of musical form and we're going to fold that discussion inside of the preparation for, there's a concert which is when Saturday and it is where

Speaker 1:          00:21          Battell chapel should be on the sheet there and it's at 8:00 PM. And we're going to have the Saybrook orchestra perform for us today. We're going to talk about a theme and variations and one of the pieces that's on that concert. And then on Thursday we're going to have the conductor and several of the solo was come in and talk to us about the difficulties of this particular con concerting sort of get us alerted to the sort of thing that we should be on the lookout for as reviewers. We will be continuing with this of course, uh, in sections of this week and when you come to lecture next time, we will give you what I call a prep sheet. Let's start with the guide to all three pieces that are going to be performed. And then when you go to section, you will get, um, a, a sheet and having to do with how you write a review.

Speaker 1:          01:10          It's a whole list of sort of do's and don'ts and writing and review. Those of you that are are, are in the Monday section. We will work this out in advance. We'll talk about that on Thursday, but you may be encouraged to come to an earlier section a, and if that doesn't work out, we're going to reform those Monday sections in a way that will work for you as well. I know there are a couple of students also, they can't be here this weekend. It's inevitable that that's the case. Uh, there will be a makeup concert, a scheduled at a later date. So don't worry about this, but do keep coming because the principles involved in writing a review for this particular concert or identical to whatever concert, uh, uh, you attend. Any questions about that before we get started?

Speaker 2:          01:52          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:53          Okay. If not, let's go ahead and with a concert program. It's kind of fun. I started with this way early, the last, uh, August arranging this. What I wanted to do was get a concert coming, uh, in the middle of the term because I think you're ready now to go at this a serious material concert in the middle of the term performed by an undergraduate orchestra on in which the program would be sort of user friendly. It would be the kinds of things that we had been working with. So I contacted a couple of ensembles, uh, and the Saybrook group a one had the best program and to uh, seem to be quite responsive in getting back to me, but some of the things that we might do and indeed one of the pieces, the Brahms that we're going to talk about, I suggested that they do because I needed for teaching purposes in here, I needed a good theme and variation piece.

Speaker 1:          02:42          Uh, and I've got one in the Beethoven, but, uh, it's not quite as clear cut as this particular one. So as you can see, we have three pieces on this concert. I hope you all have the sheet there. They should be listed, uh, the overture to the marriage of Figaro by Mozart. This is an overture and opening to his opera. The marriage of Figaro and good news here is that this spring, the Eo Opera Company and undergraduate opera company, we'll be performing the marriage of Figaro and his apps is an absolutely delightful opera. I mean, it's to die for, not only is it lots of fun and funny, but it happens to be in terms of the craftsmanship involved, arguably the greatest opera ever written. So we're fortunate to have it here and you'll get a preview of this, uh, this Saturday with the overture that we will here. Then we will go onto a piece by Johann is Brahms. Uh, anybody know anything about Brahms?

Speaker 1:          03:38          Um, they're interesting characters in the history of music. Wagner, he might've been an sob, but nonetheless, he was interesting. Mozart is endlessly fascinating. Bach is interesting in its own way. Beethoven, uh, uh, sort of the prototypical romantic genius. Very interesting. I can't say that Brahms is a person's personal life was all that interesting. So maybe we'll just forget about it. We'll just say that it was born in Homburg, Germany and he died in Vienna and I, I may have put his dates on, on your sheet there. Uh, but he is of course one of the three B's, uh, who are the other two in the history of music. Of course.

Speaker 3:          04:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:17          And Beethoven, I once ask in a quiz in here, uh, who are the three bs of music and a student answered Bach, Beethoven and Heiden. I was very depressed for the rest of the day, but, but Brahms indeed is the third be here. Uh, so we don't want to forget, get about him. He's a very serious composer. He takes everything very seriously. I think I put on your sheet there. Did I or did I not? The kinds of things that he wrote. Yes, I did a four symphonies to piano concertos, a violin concerto, many overtures, many songs, much great chamber music. If you're a violinist and you'll get rather advanced, you can play the beautiful, beautiful Brahms Violin Sonatas. If you're a cellist and you get reasonably advanced, you can play the beautiful cello Sonata. So he wrote a lot of really great chamber music. Oddly, he wrote no program music and we'll talk about that a little bit later on what programs is and he wrote no opera.

Speaker 1:          05:14          Well, so we'll a little bit different. It very much sort of heavy duty, instrumental, instrumental music. Well, let's talk about this. Uh, composition. It will not open the piece. It will be the second on the concert. It won't open the concert would be the second piece. Um, a set of variations on a theme by Josef Haydn. Well, the theme probably isn't really by Josef Haydn, but when bronze got it, everybody thought it was by Josef Haydn is probably just a religious folk song in honor of Saint Anthony, but that's neither here nor there. Uh, the shape of this, a song or theme that, uh, a bronze is working with here is one that we're very familiar with. Now instead of putting a, B, c, B, I could have done that up here. I'm going to flesh this out a little bit. What goal is going to call this antecedent consequence extension consequent, but it's the same. It's the same form that we saw in the Beethoven's Ode to Joy. So it's a familiar organization for a, uh, a musical theme, sort of, uh, opening, closing, extension, and then closing again. And in this particular set of variations, Brahms, we'll do this, which of course is our what? Sign again?

Speaker 4:          06:30          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          06:31          repeat science. So he's going to repeat each of these two sections. Actually, Beethoven did that to some extent that he owed your joy too. So he's got this very straightforward theme with that particular form. Let's listen to the theme and we'll try to pick up where the, uh, antecedent concludes and where the consequent begins. Oh, and before that we could, we could plug in another information. What's the meter? Ask yourself as you listen. What's the meter of this? What's the mode major or minor? What is the base doing? What string technique is the base employee in here? Okay, that's the consequence. Now he's going to repeat it. Let's go back. We'll just move. We'll, I'm sorry. We'll just continue on wherever you are. Linda. Doesn't really matter. Are we continuing? Okay, let's just continue on. Repeat. Here's the antecedent. Here's the consequence.

Speaker 4:          07:48          Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          08:00          Extension, rising melodic sequence. No, he's going to bring it back down. Descending melodic sequence and the consequences.

Speaker 4:          08:20          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          08:29          pause it there. Um, at this point, what he does is take that bomb, that tonic pitch and extended for a long period of time. It's down in the base, it's being held it, this is a device that derives from Oregon technique where organist, we just put his foot or her foot on a particular key and just hold it for a long time. So we call it pedal point. So what Brahms is doing here is sort of extending this tonic harmony by means of a pedal point. So let's listen to this.

Speaker 4:          09:02          Ah,

Speaker 1:          09:10          and now we've got to repeat, I believe. So we're back to the extension going up the sequence. Now back down.

Speaker 4:          09:40          Here's the panel.

Speaker 1:          10:00          Okay, so go ahead to the next spot. So that's the theme. It's, it's rather straight forward and really quite and quite lovely. Uh, the solo instrument there of course, wasn't oboe solo oboe there. So now we're going to go one. We're not going to go to all these variations on your sheet. What about these timings here? Can you come in with a stop clock and, and have, have your or watcher? It's set in a way that it, two minutes and 19 seconds. You expect the first variation to come in. Is that going to work, Oscar? Why won't that work?

Speaker 1:          10:35          A conductor might interpret things his or her own way. We're gonna have both a male and female conductor a on Saturday night. Uh, so yeah, exactly. Um, because different conductors have different ideas about tempo. Brahms would right allegro essay or something like that rather fast. But how fast is rather fast? So they're not precise indication. So these times are approximate here, but I'll give, give you a sense of when things might happen. So we're going to go on now to variation five, I believe, which is at eight minutes and 36 seconds or an approximation there. Up and here we're going to give you maybe the most difficult of all the variations for the orchestra to play. It's very disjunct rhythmically. They're not altogether. It's very contrapuntal. Counterpoint is always harder to play in an orchestra than homophonic because every we've got all these things that have to be coordinated. Um, so let's listen to this. If things, if things seem muddled and unclear in a performance of this piece, my guess is it's, it may well happen here, but let's listen just to do a little bit to show you how difficult and how far away from the theme Brahms can go.

Speaker 1:          12:17          So we'll stop it there. So it's hard for me even to get in terms of the rhythm, there'd be absolutely sure where the beat is because there's so much think of patient. I think that's a very fast one. Two with the triple subdivision under underneath. Uh, but again, the point there may be, Gee, I didn't remember hearing God, where'd that thing go as hard to here? Well, he was varying it so much that he's pretty much totally disguise the theme at that point. Uh, let's go on now to listen to a little bit of variation. Seven, uh, uh, at 1103 or thereabouts. Uh, this is my favorite variation, but let's listen to a bit of it. And see if you like it too.

Speaker 4:          13:14          There's the a section

Speaker 1:          13:18          come see back to

Speaker 1:          13:47          now, what am I doing up here? What is this? Well, what I'm trying to do is indicate what we call a compound meter. It's one of these with, you basically have a two, but you have a triple subdivision and conductors. If if that two is slow enough, might go one, two, three, four, five, six one, two, three, four, five, six. So it'd be interesting to see, maybe we should ask the conductor, uh, on Thursday how, how he or she I f I forget who's conducting exactly which pieces here, how he or she is going to conduct, I was going to do yard duty, Dee Dee Dee a very slow to like that or are we going to really show the subdivision? If he's showing this subdivisions, that's probably a suggestion that maybe he doesn't or she doesn't have quite as much confidence in the orchestra and wants to really show that beat very clearly rather than with a working with a very experienced group where you're just kind of give the large patterns and there'll be able to put it all together.

Speaker 1:          14:44          Now as we continue with this, let's move up to a to 18 or 1218 please Linda. We are now at this spot. We're going to have the extension and it's kind of fun to watch what Brahms is doing here. Brahms is obsessed with rhythm and it drives you nuts when you're a performer of this stuff. One, he's obsessed with variation and two, he's obsessed with rhythm. He will change things even when he doesn't need to change things. And I remember a company, my last child in the Brahms cellos Sonata and I would have to continually change hand positions for no good reason, which is kind of arbitrary that he wanted maybe just a slightly different sale, whereas the sound before the Beethoven would have been satisfied with in Mojo it would have been satisfied with, uh, wouldn't suffice for him. So he's obsessed with variation.

Speaker 1:          15:32          He is obsessed with rhythm and it, and as we listen to this passage, we will see the basic one, two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three, four, five, six and then suddenly he will change it. One, two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three, four, five, six, uh, emphasizing this way that in music has called Hemiola, uh, is probably some kind of Greek root they're having to do with twos and threes. I'm not really sure. Uh, but as you can see, we've got what we had was in effect two units of three. Now we've got three units of too. I remember Leonard Bernstein. I don't know whether it's west side story or not yet. The t, t, t, t, t, t. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. What is that from? Is it from west side story? Okay. Uh, so that's a good example of Hemiola too. I think it's called America or something like that. Uh, so that's what Hemiola is when you're rolling in one of these and you suddenly shift to the other back and back and forth. So let's listen to a love this lovely six, become three groups of two,

Speaker 4:          16:57          one by one, five, six. Let's do that again.

Speaker 1:          17:07          Let's do that again. It took me a while to find the, the six beat there. So go back and a little before.

Speaker 4:          17:19          So here's e bye. And then he goes back.

Speaker 1:          17:52          Okay, well that's just the, um, a little rhythmic Philip there, uh, with Brahms. But it's the kind of thing that keeps interest in his music. Now we're going to go on to the last variation a, and it's an interesting one because it's got two things going on here. He's got a theme and then he's got what we call an Ostinato. And music. Anybody remember? I think we bumped into this term before what an Austin auto is. What does an Ostinato do, Roger? Good. That's it. Exactly. Uh, from the Italian Austin Ra obstinate. And it just repeats the same phrase over and over and over again. So what he's got here repeating oddly, is in the base. There's this tonic escapes from repeating over and over and over, uh, uh, above which we have a very distant variation of the theme. Doesn't sound like the theme very much. So let's listen to the Austin Natto and this highly varied theme up above. Can you hear the bass notice salsa? Yuck. Dee Dee Dee tee tee. What's he throwing in against his basic beat? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          19:49          Tha Tha tha tha tha. Tha. Tha. Tha. Tha. Tha

Speaker 1:          19:52          what? What's that? We've talked about it before. We're beat. We're coming on here. Ball ball one to one and two and one and two. And Yachty. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. What's that? Triplets. Okay, so we talked about that before. So here he's making this more complicated rhythmically by not only using Hemi Olin syncopation, but also threes against two simultaneously. He's throwing in some triplets in the melody up above. Okay, let's continue to just a bit more. Oh, right, right there is fine. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          20:46          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          20:55          so at this point you say, what the heck happened to my seat dod on Bom Bom Bom? I don't remember that at all. If so we've sort of lost track of that as this astronaut or base keeps growing in weight underneath. But gradually, uh, what he does is take that Ostinato and move it up into the upper part of the register of the orchestra and then gradually tr make this transform back into the theme, sort of magically transform itself back into the theme. So let's go on now to 1755 and then we'll pick it, pick it up there if that's okay.

Speaker 4:          21:32          Sounds very confused. But if you listen to the upper register, you can hear the [inaudible] [inaudible] the theme is coming back and the upper woodwind. Okay, so now you think the pieces, yeah,

Speaker 1:          22:38          over slow into tempo. Way Down sell diminishes. Could end it right here.

Speaker 1:          23:03          And that last little bit at the end of course is called the Coda. Right. Okay. So he once again with theme and variations, if you don't give the audience, Dakota, they're expecting next variation to begin. So you got throw in that Cota so that uh, everybody knows, hey, that really was the end. No fooling, uh, questions about that. So that's Brahms' variations on the theme of Haydn. It's, I can't say it's a, it's a very, it's a beautiful piece, but it's a very serious piece, but it's a good piece for you. This is very serious group this year. I'm impressed with the seriousness with which you show up here and as you take this, uh, I gather, I sometimes I see that you're actually much more interested in the classical stuff that we're doing then in the pop stuff, which is not always the case, uh, over the years working with undergraduates. Okay. A question. Yes. Uh, Daniel,

Speaker 1:          23:52          yes. W however disguise it is, how the question is, is the framework of the theme always this ace c business, no matter how far he goes, melodically from the original pattern and how complex in terms of counterpoint and rhythmic permutations he becomes, it still is dropped within this same framework of the a c e c although it admittedly it's pretty difficult to hear sometimes. Yeah. David, Michael, sorry. Uh, that, that I, that is just with this piece here. Uh, you can work with other composers. Paganini is variations on a theme of Rockmont and offer example where the length of the variations will become very different and it'd be, that won't be sort as bad as I like to say box car, like as this arrangement. This is still boxcar. Like even though it's very diversified in terms of what's put in and on those box cars.

Speaker 1:          24:52          Two good questions there. Thanks. All right, uh, having finished theme and variations for the moment, let's go on to talk about Rondo. R o n d o a Rondo. Is that really true? Well, it goes by a couple of different names. Uh, uh, English, call it Rondo form, the Germans call it Rondo form and Mozart wrote, and I've looked at a lot of his autographs wanting to write Rondo. He spelled it r, O, n, d o c news. Ela All falls on the, uh, Hondo say honed. Oh, miss here. But if you go to Italy, they would call it a doornail law. Lochia Jamari toenail. I love these, these, these, uh, latinate languages are so wonderful, aren't they? The way they play with the vowels. Tonello so it's the same idea, a Rondo, a home though and elite Tonello. It's the same principle. And oddly the principal develops right out of the thing that we were talking about.

Speaker 1:          25:49          Uh, and that Frederick introduced this to the idea of verse and chorus because what's involved here is really one musical concept, one big theme coming back again and again and again. Uh, and this goes all the way back to the Middle Ages where they would have soloist singing new versus, and then everybody would sing the chorus. And the thing that we all remember is the chorus. That's the big ticket item. That's the thing that everybody is doing. So that's the thing that keeps coming back again and again and again. So this in an odd way I think is the easiest of these forms to remember. If you hear some music where you get music and then something else and then hit in the face with that same music again, then something else and you get hit in the face of that same music again and then something else.

Speaker 1:          26:33          And then the same music again. That's probably Rondo form and you can, you can give it these different names in different languages, but the, the idea is the same. And as I suggest, it's primordial I think on your sheet to show you how primordial it is. I even gave you the text of a Rondo by Gilead and [inaudible] it goes all the way back into the 15th century. We don't have to go back that far. Uh, and you can see, we'll end up today with a Rondo by Stinger. So, uh, this has been around for a long time. This particular particular form. Um, let's have an introduction to it by listening to a reasonably well known piece by Joel Joseph, who was a composer in residence at the court of King Louis, the 15th at Versailles and in Paris in the early years of the 18th century. You probably know this music because for years it was the background theme or the introductory material for masterpiece theater on public television. So let's listen to a big, uh, a bit of this. And, uh, let me take this material off and we'll chart here and I'll ask you what the meter of this is, but the meter and how many measures of our refrain, our main theme, what we'll call it a here, how many measures we have in our theme.

Speaker 1:          28:19          Let's stop it there. So what'd you think about that? What's the meter? Well, I would try to give that away. Sometimes you listen to music, you can't stop yourself. It's like the end of doctor Strangelove. You ever see that movie get back? Um, so, uh, yeah, it's a piece in Dupal meter. How many, how many measures did we have in our theme? How many measures did we count there? Well, listen to, let's listen to it again.

Speaker 3:          28:45          Right back to the beginning, I guess Linda. Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:00          So what do you think? Eight. Alright, let's put eight up here and let's listen again now. Just continue please.

Speaker 1:          29:20          Oh, we stopped it there. We had how many there? Eight again. So everything is always four's and eight's and music. No, not exactly. If you start with counting measures there in the Brahms, his theme sometimes has five measures in those sections, but this one happens to be a different and more common. Uh, eight plus eight. And actually in reality here, this is just slightly different than the first day of the ending of it is slightly different from the first day. So there we are. We've got our refrain or a theme in place. Our big a idea. Now let's go on to the next material. Stop it there. How many bars did we have there? Well, eight again. Okay, so we could call the Di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, Di team. Different sort of rhythm there. We could call this a bi idea or we could even call it an x does something different, something different. And that lasted for eight bars that get up. Just a couple of Linda if you would please. So we can get back into that be and then we'll go on to the next a.

Speaker 1:          30:39          So here we are with our B. Stop it there. So what happened to our a this time? How long was it? Who still eat? Did we get it again though?

Speaker 3:          31:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:14          Yeah, we've got just one. That statement of it. Why didn't we get it again? Well maybe he didn't need to give it to us again. Ever watched television commercial when they first come on and then what happens to these commercials a couple of months later?

Speaker 3:          31:27          What do they do if gain?

Speaker 1:          31:30          Yeah, they shortened them. They'll run a 60 minute version of it. Then is then a third show, 60 minutes, that'd be interminable. A 62nd version. Then the 32nd version, you psychologically, sublingually, you'll, you're filling in the missing information. So keep an eye on for that kind of thing and go, posers do that too. They know. Well we've heard there's a fair amount of, well we'll, we'll give the psychological a force of the whole thing, but really just give it to them in half. Okay. So, uh, wherever we are there, it uh, but, but yeah, so back in around 45 or so if you can get there. Okay. Here we got a count now. So let's pause there. How long was that section? 20. Yeah, 20 bars. There's a long run of other material and then as you can hear here, our ACM is coming back. Let's see if we get it repeated. Was there a Cota there? No. Um, uh, how did he, how did this particular group of performers make the piece sounds as if it were ending

Speaker 3:          33:40          dead. Daniel. Oh, Angela is it? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          33:46          he retarded. Dee Dee Dee Dee t Todd. Tom Slowed it way down. So if you don't want, that's another way of getting a sense of in here rather than throwing one, some extra bricks to say the thing has concluded harmonically. All right, so that's one. Rondo, let's go into a more sophisticated Rondo. We're going to go onto one by Vivaldi here. Now, this is in the Greek Tonello form, as you'll see when you read the textbook. Um, but the principle is the same. We have a theme that keeps coming back again and again and again. And you all know this theme. You've probably heard it at Starbucks or Oban Pan Eight zillion times, right? Anybody sing it? Anybody remember what the Vivaldi spring concerto sounds like? Okay, Angela is on the roll this morning. So nice and loud. Don't be shy there.

Speaker 3:          34:38          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          34:39          Good. Okay. Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. Tom Potter up. Pop Art. Then we have a second idea.

Speaker 1:          34:53          So here, it's kind of our main theme here is really kind of two ideas a and B. But we're going to just for the sake of argument here, just call this big a here. Okay? So that, that, that's the theme. So let's listen to a bit of this. Um, well, no, we don't even have to listen to this because Angela has given us the return. Lol. So let's go on to the first x here. We've got something else coming in and it's Vivaldi's attempt to write birds chirping away on a beautiful spring morning. So let's listen to the birds here. After the birds Chirp, we get our a coming back. So let's listen to our a, come back here. Okay. So now we're taking a walk through a beautiful forest in the spring day and we see a babbling brook and the brook is foaming surging away. So that's what we've got here.

Speaker 1:          36:16          Was that, that we just heard bom, bom, Bom, bom. Was that something else or was that our rich horn elbow? Jerry. Nice and loud. Okay. Uh, that was my next question. You've jumped to it. So it was the return Anello and my next question is, but what was different about that Writ Ornella? Well, the first time we had it from bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, it's a lower key. So we've had a modulation. This is actually down on the dominant. We don't need to know that. We don't need to know whether it's tonic or dominant, but I think it would be good. We, we heard that as just a little bit different. Its lower, maybe a little darker than the brighter sound up above. So we had that and now let's see what happens. It doesn't have a storm come up and sort of threatened this here in the beautiful forest.

Speaker 4:          37:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          37:12          Lots of Tremolo. Lots of agitation.

Speaker 4:          37:33          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          37:33          What happen?

Speaker 1:          37:42          All right, we'll stop there. Yeah. Yes. That was our red tornado coming back. Our theme coming back. But how is it different? Okay. Yeah it was in mine are young boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. So it had changed key again, we don't need to know what key it went to. If you were a betting man in Las Vegas or betting woman in Las Vegas, what would you say? It went to? The relative minor because about half of the time, uh, that's what they do. And indeed in this, this particular case it went just three half steps down to the relative minor. But hearing that it went to the minor is all we're after here. So this was in a, in a minor key here. And then on it goes, we need in play, play this out to the end. It gives you a sense of how rare Tornillo form can inform this particular Rondo. Let's turn to another one by Mozart here. Uh, yeah, I think we've got time for that. Um, take this off. So it's a horn concerto by Mozart written in the 1870s. Uh, and we're just going to start it out here and we're going to hear the first theme. But Papa, Papa, Papa, Papa, Papa, Papa is the basis of listening. Exercise 26, which we'll get to uh, in a week or so.

Speaker 5:          38:57          Yeah. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          39:12          okay, let's stop there. Why is this an easy theme to remember? Because it's full of

Speaker 6:          39:20          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          39:24          It's a lot of notes, right on the same pitch. Bob Bomb and it's actually starts to dominate.

Speaker 6:          39:28          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          39:30          sort of goes along like that. So we can keep a mental graph of this with our exes now in a second. And then the orchestra repeated it then in a second. The B theme is going to come in and it's going to be very different. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          39:42          Pompom y'all pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, Palm. What's that?

Speaker 1:          39:49          Arpeggio? Okay, so instead of using repeated pitches, we mark the B section of this by the use of lots of leaps here. So we're going to have lots of space between our exit, a bomb bomb bomb. And then it's going to have a couple of different motives in here. But they're all very skippy. They're all very disjunct. And it's these, this junk leaps that mark the B section. So let's just continue.

Speaker 5:          40:24          Okay, jumps.

Speaker 1:          40:52          Now listen to the base here. Who'd at another pedal point, I'm sitting on the dominant. What's this? This is our theme a coming back.

Speaker 5:          41:08          Perfect.

Speaker 1:          41:17          Okay, we're going to stop it here. So here we are at this particular particular juncture. Notice each time the French horn plays the theme than the orchestra repeats it. Now as we go into this section, we'll get a new theme. It's c a and it will be marked an interesting development.

Speaker 4:          41:35          Okay?

Speaker 1:          41:41          What's happened to the mode? So what happened? Did the piece there change to minor change to mitre? So we're, we're moving fast here, we're doing all this and just one hearing. So there we are. Our C section is marked by minor, so let's continue rising sequence here. Melodic seat now falling

Speaker 5:          42:20          well, I'll step lower and lower yet again

Speaker 1:          42:31          and then a sneaks in and here come our jumps. So we're back to be

Speaker 5:          43:10          okay. Okay.

Speaker 1:          43:23          Ooh, let me just step out of cadence. Pause it right there. Seeing the next pitch, well not only bomb, but that somebody starts saying by Tata, Tata, you know what's happening next? You said you have this big long dominant pause [inaudible] and off it goes. You'll play that Linda please.

Speaker 5:          43:46          Perfect.

Speaker 4:          43:59          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          43:59          Now this week we've had our a in the orchestral repeat of it, but we haven't heard this kind of stuff before. What would you imagine is going, what is this? We're listening to new CODA. I'm moving things along here. So we have a Coda and noticed it. Dawn, I forget the particular key. Mozart is working through the Duke of Earl harmony at once again in this particular particular section. So let's listen to a bit of that. And this is just filler arpeggio addict. So that's our Coda again, to show us that the pieces an end, you can end your Rondo and a couple of ways. But the point here is notice the form that has been created by Mozart. And again, it is timeless. I think we have time now to show a slide. Uh, and Jason isn't here today. I wanted him to do this. Uh, I think I can turn this on myself though and we're going to listen to Linda start playing. Yeah, Dustin please.

Speaker 4:          45:34          So let's stop that just

Speaker 1:          45:35          for a moment. Uh, what do I have up here on the board? Anybody ever seen this before? Anybody been there? Where would you imagine it is in French at the Chateau de Shawn Bull, c. H. A. M. B. O. R. D. A. I took this leaning out of a bus and you can see over the left we have one idea, the a idea contrasting idea returned to the, a idea, a largely contrasting idea here in the middle, returned to your central concept, uh, uh, a contrast here that matches this contrast over there. And then the central idea at the end. It's exactly in one of these palindromic a, B, a, c, a, B, a form, the same thing that you get here in the Mozart Horn Concerto. And the same thing that staying in the police ship program in to their particular Rondo. Uh, you've got the sheets on this. Maybe I'll turn the lights back on cause we don't need to see that anymore. Did you like that? You want that back on? Yes. Okay. Yeah, it's pretty, I like it too. Okay. Um, and we can, we can see well enough up here. So let's listen to, I'll just tell you, we've got this initial idea,

Speaker 2:          46:49          uh,

Speaker 1:          46:53          where is, what key is e and h?

Speaker 2:          46:55          MMM.

Speaker 1:          47:00          Again, in the one six, four, five, one Duke of Earl stuff. But interestingly enough here,

Speaker 2:          47:07          half the time he doesn't come back

Speaker 1:          47:14          a deceptive cadence. So he alternates here between authentic cadences and deceptive cadence. So we'll listen to a little bit of it. If we run out of time, then we'll stop.

Speaker 3:          47:29          Okay.

Speaker 4:          47:33          Six, three, four step. There's the six, six, four, five. Can we got to stop it here

Speaker 1:          47:58          or the copyright? People will be all over us. Uh, then it goes onto the beach section. Oh, can't you see? And for that we have the different chord belong to me, my, her mother heartbreak. Okay. We can continue to play now.

Speaker 4:          48:22          All right, let's move it up to the next

Speaker 1:          48:26          stay. I want to get to see, hey, what? Go straight to see. This is pretty cool. What he does here. He's in, in this particular key, and he gives us this sound, kind of a shocking chord change right in the middle of the piece. It's kind of a foot, we would call a flat seventh degree. Let's see if we can hear this total shock and then we'll stop.

Speaker 4:          49:16          Yup.

Speaker 3:          49:20          Premier on out. You give blood in the one, six, four, five, one mentally in this section B section. So that's it. I think we're at a time and I thank you for one third.
