Speaker 1:          00:01          All Right, ladies and gentlemen, let's get started. We are going to continue our discussion of melody. And last Thursday we were talking about melody in terms of scales, major scales, minor scales, chromatic scales. Then we went on to talk a little bit about what it is in a melody that makes us feel the way we do about that particular melody, the major and minor quality of them in the fact that that quality shows up rather early on in the scale. The third step of the scale. Then we talked about conjunct melodies and disjunct melodies, and we ended up talking about Beethoven's Ode to Joy, which he incorporated in the last movement of his last symphony, symphony number nine. And we said that that had a particular quality of phrase construction and a seat and the consequent phrase struggle,

Speaker 2:          01:00          opening it up

Speaker 1:          01:06          and closing it back down. And I was thinking over the weekend of all the, all the pieces that operate that way and the seating, consequently, then it goes all over the extension, the way Beethoven with all with an extension antecedent. Consequently, uh, I was thinking of of a piece of Mozart,

Speaker 3:          01:42          Eh,

Speaker 1:          02:00          Mozart. Well let's listen here just a little bit of what that really hears.

Speaker 4:          02:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Then Nick, go ahead. Sorry.

Speaker 4:          02:21          [inaudible] that's enough

Speaker 1:          02:36          dumb Patrick. Right. Okay. Don't Patrick. All they did was take the theme with the Macarena and the strip away all the rhythmic stuff underneath and put an 18th century Alberti based with it and Mozart would have used and so on. But the point here

Speaker 4:          03:00          is that even the mock arena is using this antecedent and consequence for a structure, something as basic as that. So it's sort of endemic to how melodies are constructed. Uh, now I was thinking and I always liked to try to come up with a new, however I'll be at lane brain ideas for teaching this class. Supposing I got a student up here, I mean, melody, what makes a melody beautiful? What makes a great melody? Anybody know?

Speaker 1:          03:27          Well if you do let me know cause I don't know and nobody really knows it. It's sort of like the definition of pornography. You can know it when you see it or you know it when you hear it. Um, so in, in pursuit of this, I was trying to think, well, maybe I'll have a student come up and try to craft a melody right here. Uh, oh on the spot. And I suppose we could play with that. But then I said, well, it's probably not a good idea because a, uh, no student would really want to do this and be, it would probably take too long to work through all the aspects of it. So what I did, and this was about four o'clock yesterday afternoon, I said, well, all right Craig, you think of a melody. So I started thinking up a melody and I can hope, I hope I can remember how it went, something like that. So what would you give me as a grade for that melody? Come on now. Uh, Daniel, what do I get for that melody?

Speaker 4:          04:50          That was pretty good.

Speaker 1:          04:52          B minus C plus B. Well, we, this is great invasive grade inflation. So I'd been inflated up to a B, but it was kind of, see steam line is um, it wasn't particularly inspire, but in, in crafting that it made me think of all why do I do this at this particular point? And not that well there's certain parameters, certain confines that we're operating with. We've got to be in a scale, certain kinds of phrases, something ending like that in a piece that's going to end here tells me that's gotta be in the middle, that can't come at the end. So there's a syntax here also, we've talked about that before, that musical phrases have to come in a particular order for them to make sense. So, um, instead of working with my lane brain melody, let's work with a great one. We're going to work with a melody by Giacomo Puccini here and you can see his name on the board up there and getting a sense of the melody in question. It's an Aria and we'll talk about when Ari is later, but he's an aria from his opera, Johnny sqeaky. Now that's not a well known opera by Puccini. Can anybody tell me the name of a better known opera by Puccini.

Speaker 5:          06:06          Tosca. Yup. Madame Butterfly.

Speaker 1:          06:10          I haven't hit the most obvious one yet. Libel in for example, all rent was based on level and uh, so he's written a lot of well known opera as this happens to be a lesser known opera, but it has one sort of drop dead beautiful melody in the thick oatmeal bomb beat Bobby no car where a young lady is trying to in effect constant money out of her father. Um, and it's an odd thing. This thing is so beautiful but trying to separate her father for money is an odd thought and it occurs rather early on in the opera too and dramatically. It's not of any particular significance. It's just happens to be an absolutely gorgeous melody that you've all heard many, many times. One day I was, and you'll, you'll recognize it as soon as I started to play. One day I was playing this at home, my then 13 year old son came in and said,

Speaker 5:          06:59          I know that, that's beautiful. That's my boy. He's going to be a music lover. Yeah, that's the background music for grand theft auto.

Speaker 1:          07:13          What's, what's grand theft auto or Chris? Um, well I found out, but it shows you that this, this particular Arya has legs. It's kind of kind of everywhere. So let's listen to a little bit of Puccini's. Amil Bambi. Barberino car.

Speaker 5:          07:31          Okay.

Speaker 3:          07:45          Hey,

Speaker 1:          07:47          okay, let's pause it right there. Let's pause it.

Speaker 6:          07:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:58          What's kind of neat about that right at the outset there?

Speaker 5:          08:04          What's that?

Speaker 6:          08:04          Ooh,

Speaker 1:          08:06          why did you, again, to our spirit soar at that particular point. We've got a large leap there. It's a leap of a, of an often we wouldn't expect you to recognize that, but it's interesting to the fold that in, because we were talking about actives last time. So we have this opening phrase and it's about to be coupled. We're going to continue now with the next phrase that will complete the antecedent friends. So we'll listen. We'll just continue please. Linda is there. So we're sitting here. Can you sing the tonic?

Speaker 4:          08:57          Okay,

Speaker 1:          08:58          well that's where we want to know that that's what you wanted to. So we're in this step right above the time. So that's the end of the aniseed and frames the opening phrase, but we're not on the top. Okay. So now we're going to continue and you can imagine we're going to hear some of that same music, but ultimately it's going to come back to the tonic hadn't gone away with from it. Okay. Little more please. Starting again. Is something interesting happened?

Speaker 7:          09:58          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:02          Oh, here's her tonic. We should be back to our tonic. But that's not exactly what happened.

Speaker 4:          10:10          MMM.

Speaker 1:          10:13          We went to the melody note, but underneath he harmonized it with an unexpected harmony. We expected to hear,

Speaker 4:          10:22          we got,

Speaker 1:          10:25          so we were deceived. They're a little bit, and musicians called this a deceptive cadence, a deceptive cage when the whole thing has been set up to come back to the tonic with the tonic chord underneath, we get something other than the tonic chord. So in music we have two kinds of really a broad categories of cadence. We had this kind of thing called, or where we come back to the expected tonic. We call those authentic keens. We also have another class of, as mentioned to set deceptive cadences where we do things such as we're expecting to go, we go or we go even more bizarre, something like that. You keep the same tonic note in the melody, but you change the harmony underneath, so that's what Puccini has done here. Instead of going there, there, here is a silly analogy. One time I was flying into the city of Minneapolis planes and fasten your seat belts are but Trey's up, et Cetera, except cetera.

Speaker 1:          11:31          Acceptor were coming debt right in there where you can see the the tarmac there and suddenly the plane was in her womb, doesn't land, does a barrel roll most off to the right circles all the way around. Announces there was some piece of equipment on the landing strip and he was doing a flyover in music. You have to do the kind of thing. If a composer has set this up so that you're expecting to go and you don't, you go here. We can't end that way. We just can't end that way. Do we need our daily supply of tonic? So what we going to do as a musical, fly over. He's going to fly all around this thing again and then come back in and this time land on the tonic. So let's listen to the fly over

Speaker 3:          12:25          eh, but it's so lovely he can't stop. So you're going to give you a little reminiscence of the beginning. Here's your,

Speaker 1:          13:17          so just a little reminiscent at the beginning but again coming back in this 10 of course anyone at Tata, so that's the structure of an Aria by Puccini and it is highly structured. It is highly structured. Now I want to talk about another Aria that's structured in a different way and that's by Ricard Wagner. But before we do that, we need to talk about one other process in music and that has to do with something called melodic sequence. And oddly students over the years have had difficulty understanding and hearing melodic sequence. But it's a pretty simple idea. Melodic sequence is simply the repetition of a musical motive at a successively higher or lower degree of the scale. So I could take a take a motive. Anybody want to sing a motor for me here, Daniel, you want to sing a motive? Gimme for notes.

Speaker 3:          14:07          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:13          Okay. So we've set up a descending melodic sequence. Now supposing we did this

Speaker 3:          14:35          and

Speaker 1:          14:35          so forth, that's obviously an snd melodic sequence. So that's what's involved here in generally speaking, going down introduces relaxation, going up, perhaps tension. Um, all right, so that's a little bit of a set up with regard to that. So now we're going to work through this. We'll call it an Aria for the moment of a Wagner in which rather than a structured units, he's going to continually evolve new music but using a motive that he presses up continually through melodic sequence. So it's a slightly different process of melodic structure here. Ricard Bogner and not, um, a very nice man. Not a very nice man. Did it, needless to say it. Um, but he was a spectacular composure and wrote many great things. And one of them, arguably the best that he wrote is his opera, Tristan, Tristan. And it's older, uh, written in 1865. As you can see on the board here and we should know about it because we here at Yale own the piano on which Wagner wrote Tristan, it was at least involved in part of Tristan.

Speaker 1:          15:48          Next time you are walking past due over there, you know the health center at 17, he'll house happening. There's a building there rather foreboding looking. Building inside is a wonderful collection of keyboard instruments. So go in there sometimes and look at the Bechstein piano. This German Piano Bechstein it Wagner worked used when, when working on on Trista. So we have the um, uh, the opera and we're going to start here with a little bit of the, of the plot. It's a story of this English night, Tristan. And this Irish princess is older and it's Trish Danze job to go over to Ireland and sort of pick her up and deliver back to Cornwall where she's supposed to marry a king mark. But on the old route, uh, they inadvertently consume a love potion. So she is passionately in love with him and he with her. So we're going to listen to a little bit of the overture here. Now. Wagner actually called it a prelude. That doesn't matter. Opening, opening music here to um, to Tristan. And I have two questions for you as we listen. Hear what instruments are plain and what musical process is Wagner using it at this point. Okay, Linda.

Speaker 3:          17:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:55          Stop it there. So what instruments were playing here and that little dialog, the dialog between families of instruments, strings and woodwinds. Okay. Alternating back and forth. The strings were at the lower,

Speaker 7:          18:12          then the woodwinds.

Speaker 6:          18:13          Good answer.

Speaker 7:          18:17          Then it

Speaker 1:          18:27          okay. And so on. So what melodic process were they using? Their sequence sequence. All right. And then it sort of chugged along until we got it. What's this? We talked about this before in regard to Ricard Strauss that sound resolving to concert. So it uses the sequence to work up to a climax, hits a dissonance, resulted into concert. Let's listen to him a little bit further along here in the prelude. Linda, if you could move it up to seven 10

Speaker 3:          19:18          [inaudible] is way up here to see what level gets higher and higher in the violin.

Speaker 1:          20:04          And you heard the trumpets coming in.

Speaker 7:          20:05          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          20:10          With that chromatic figure, almost kind of like a sneak rising through it. So it's not only the rising melodic sequence, this is highly chromatic music and that that also produces tension. How do you make love in music? Well, we've got rising dynamic volume. We've gotten rising sequence. It works up to a climax where there is dissonance and then release. So if I'm using rather suggestive language here, it's done intentionally. Uh, this is the St Mary Poppins where the sound of music or Snow White and seven dwarves. This is the passionate story of Tristan and Isolde, lust, desire, carnal knowledge that, that sort of thing. And how does Wagner give you the sentence? How does he communicate this? Well, this idea of continually rising sequence that then hits this climax with a dissident, almost painful this and it's, and then the resolution, uh, musically to duplicating in an odd way, life's processes, the climax of the opera, the real climax.

Speaker 1:          21:11          However, really doesn't come until about three hours into it at the end. Now we have Tristan dying of a mortal wound, uh, is older, is cradling him in her arms, and she seems an Aria, a, we'll call it an Aria. Wagner gave it a different name, the Lebus tote. She's singing about her vision of their life in the hereafter, in the world beyond in the celestial realm. Uh, and so it's called a love death. The Lebus tote here. Um, and it's typical I suppose of the conventions of the romantic period, right? This is a 19th century. This is Romance Tristan and adults. So we're going to pick this up about halfway through the, uh, uh, Lebus toad of, of the Zolder. Uh, and once again, we will hear these little snippets, these motives.

Speaker 1:          22:22          Okay. I don't have absolute pitch. When you're really annoyed with things in life, you can sometimes at least make some fun, enjoy it somehow by trying to figure out what key it's in. Okay. So that was, that was a pipe in f we were listening to it rather unreserved pipe in ethics. Okay. So let's go back to the mid point of the liebers toe here and we're going to hear these little snippets. This is not NSC and the consequent, this is a motive being pushed higher and higher each time to a climax. Here we go.

Speaker 3:          23:04          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          24:07          Oh, is it? There it is. It's glorious. It's Gloria, Sam. And isn't it nice to have our audio system working properly? Again, this is really the first day that has worked properly. Uh, so it's, it, it sounds wonderful. It's glorious. It's a glorious climax that Wagner has been working for for three hours here. And we've got that we've arrived at and now he's going to turn everything around. The entire sentiment is going to change and I think we should be able to, to enumerate here maybe as many as four different ways in which Wagner does to earn our emotions 180 degrees at this point. So we're going to go back and we're going to listen to the climax again, and then we're going to listen to how the music changed. And I want you to, as you sit there to think about what's he doing here? What, what you're the composer, what would, how do you make something go from a, a sort of cradle in your arms to vision of, of, of the world beyond. So think about dynamics, think about Tiempo, think about these sequences, consonance and dissonance, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. Okay, here we go.

Speaker 3:          25:20          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          27:11          hmm. Well I hope you liked that gorgeous stuff. Uh, so get me started here. Get me started. What did you hear there? How did he sort of slow down entire training? Yeah. Okay. The whole thing got softer. So we're going to take the, the basics first and that would be sort of number one on my list. The whole thing got softer. What else happened? Okay. Not only soft, although the voice ended up rather high water. The last salads we've heard also to ended low and we've talked about high and low intention, that sort of thing before softer, maybe lower generally in terms of the test that to test the Torah or the range. What else? Yeah, Christina. Yeah, the tempo got slower. Well, yeah, there were some points that the tempo got slower and we'll talk about that in just a minute if we hit on anything else here. Um, anything else? Instruments, uh, well they weren't playing with loud. They weren't quite as obvious. I'm not sure that they were fewer instruments. My guess is if I were to look at that school, that would be huge and everybody would still be playing. It's just, it sounded fewer because they were playing more quietly. What about, um, the Roger, sorry.

Speaker 1:          28:41          Yeah, he used to, he used the distance. For example, we had that, that sneak ideas like snake in the garden of Eden was riding around there, but then he took it up to or degrees and folded it in the, to a concert. So it was all very consonant at the end. What about the sequence rising? Rising, rising. But here at the end it started. Yeah, it's just repeating the same pictures over and over and over again. So he took that out of the equation too. Each are backed out. This idea of the sequence, it's static at this point. We have Stacy's, we have a rival stability. What were, what was the one thing we haven't mentioned, uh, in terms of the tonality here? They're at the end. What is that last step? Very strongly. The, the tonic. That's the way it was. One of the things was kind of cool here. I'm trying to think of the exact, that kind of sound.

Speaker 6:          30:14          Supposing I went,

Speaker 1:          30:19          does this have any resonance to you?

Speaker 6:          30:21          Uh,

Speaker 1:          30:25          where are you? If you hear that sound?

Speaker 6:          30:29          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          30:32          Maybe he'll commencement where we sing hymns or in a church or something like that. What we would call that.

Speaker 8:          30:38          Aw.

Speaker 1:          30:43          What does that bring to the, it sort of brings a divine benediction here. Now is the 19th century. Like there's more painful minor,

Speaker 1:          30:54          but if you feel you have a sense here at the end that they're living a blessed that existence in heaven, it may because Wagner has folded in sort of subliminally you're below the surface, this, um, uh, cadence that we've have deceptive cadences and we have another kind of cadence here called an Amen cadence, um, that, uh, brings an additional resident in addition to symbolism to the conclusion. So it's a wonderful piece of music. Um, and uh, maybe we, we, I think we have time. Let's listen to just the last few seconds of that again, because it's sort of recaps some of the points we've been making back it up even a couple of seconds before that.

Speaker 3:          31:36          Yeah, that's good. Here's the snake going away. Here's the consonant.

Speaker 1:          32:09          Okay. So that's the leavers tote of Ricard boggling questions about that. Thoughts about that, comments about that.

Speaker 1:          32:18          All right, if not, let's go on to talk about Mozart. A little bit more about Mozart. When here another Aria, uh, by Mozart. And this one does something a little bit different than, well, it's a kind of combination of what we've just studied here. We've got a highly structured Aria by Mozart, yet at the same time we're going to see an example of rising melodic sequence in it. And we have a guest artist today, Lauren Liberal. So Lauren, come on up. Some of you know, Lara, she's in Davenport College and I've known her for years now because she is a music major and I've seen you're seeing in lots of different productions of the school of Music's Orpheus in the underworld a year or so ago. Um, so Laura and I know that you've sung with the Los Angeles opera and I remember that you're saying with David Stern in Brussels, was it Brussels or Paris or both?

Speaker 1:          33:09          Oh, oh yeah, she probably the shadow lay in Paris. Yeah. Yeah. It's a shadow. A theater there. The big metro changing. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so she used a very experienced singer and a very, very good singer. So, but uh, tell us, uh, Lauren, what do you want to do with this? Here you are at Yale. You could do, you could become an opera singer or you hit a good go to law school and worked for Skadden, arps in New York or Los Angeles or whatever you want to do. What? Well, what are you going to do with all this?

Speaker 9:          33:36          Um, I would like to pursue a career in opera last school, not the road from me, although I do like to argue. I'm sorry parents.

Speaker 1:          33:45          So you're going to have the goal. So this year that if you're a senior, are you going to take a year off in an applied directly to a graduate schools in voice? And where are you going to apply if you to do,

Speaker 9:          33:54          actually I'm going to go back to work with David Stern, um, oh, in Paris for a year and a young artist program that they have there. You're in that already are. Yeah, he um, kindly has asked me.

Speaker 1:          34:07          David stern was a Yale undergraduate. He is the son. He was the nicest boy. The son of whom? Of whom stern does that ring a bell? I used to extern to the world famous, the Great British violinist of the 20th century. So David was in, was an undergraduate here, graduated probably 15 or so years ago. Went on to a career in music as a conductor, mostly in Europe, mostly in Europe.

Speaker 9:          34:31          I think. He told me that he went to ta for this class.

Speaker 1:          34:34          He like, he would come in from time to time and we would do things in here as an undergraduate. He was not at the haven. Well if there's any, was conductor the YSL for a couple of years too. Yeah. Um, so he would come in from time to time when we would do different things. So, um, Laura's have as mentioned, a very expensive experiencing are, and we're gonna do a little art ra here out of Mozart's figure robbers opera, the marriage of Figaro 1786 called void case a paytech. So Lauren, can you tell us something about this, that this Aria, who's singing it?

Speaker 9:          35:08          This Aria is sung by kid Rubino who is a young boy. Actually though I'm clearly not a boy wearing pants for the purpose. Um, it's called a trouser role for that reason. Um, sung by a woman in the Sabra. Um,

Speaker 1:          35:24          why did they do that? What? [inaudible] weird opera. People like transvestites or something like this. There are other roles like this is just kind of a convention and in opera kind of a convention.

Speaker 9:          35:38          Yeah, he's a young boy. Um, so maybe they got the higher voice.

Speaker 1:          35:42          Yeah, that's right. He's an adolescent 14. And what's he experiencing

Speaker 9:          35:47          first? Love, basically our first lust. Um, he's not true. He's not sure. So, uh, he's singing to the Countess, uh, with whom he is in love and with a little help from, um, Susanna, Susanna. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          36:04          So he's not, he thinks he's in love with the counters, but maybe it Susan or maybe it's Barbara arena or maybe it's a broomstick over there. It's hard to know exactly what he's in love with it. Age At age 14. Um, and that's the confusion here. So there's a certain palpitation from time to time in the singing. It's, it's intentional here in a certain sense of being flustered. Yeah. Almost. You're agitated, you're flustered, you're uncertain what all these things are. Um, we're going to have Lauren seeing all of this for us. Um, eh, but in order to have this be something other than just a performance, I'd like to work with through different pedagogical issues here. So let's talk about that just for a second. Now at the outset of this, and you guys have your sheets out there, there was a sheet on this music stand back there. Uh, you've got a sheet. So take a look at that and uh, we'll see. What do you see Marcus? Right down here in the front row. What do you see on your sheet by way of music?

Speaker 10:         37:06          It's broken up into two different parts.

Speaker 1:          37:11          Okay. Three. And they're labeled antecedent and consequence. So Mozart's starts out here with the antecedent consequence phrase structure. That was the antecedent. Here it comes.

Speaker 1:          37:38          So antecedent consequence. Then interestingly enough, when the voice comes in, what does he do? What did, what did he do? Then you have to sing. You just don't duplicate what I did. He actually expands the face structure, I guess. Yeah, by adding more material right in the middle, you know, too. So we had an a and B, but he, his mind is such, I mean, I'd never be able to figure that out. And he said, well, Hey, I can open this whole thing up and put in some additional lovely music and then close it back down with my consequent phrase struck. Uh, so we have that. Let's, let's listen to how that plays out. So we'll just start with, uh, with where you come in. Lonely with Voi. Okay.

Speaker 10:         38:17          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          38:19          Rolling.

Speaker 1:          38:44          Okay. And then we go on with a series of phrases. And as you listen to this, you might count the number of bars and phrases here, but generally speaking, they're all four bars in length. Mozart is one of the guys who sort of puts this whole idea of structure with melody on the Mat structure. Symmetry are very important in his compositions. And as we proceed here, the text gets more and more interesting. We start talking about, uh, feelings at line five. They are sent home. Do not fat though, I feel. How would you train? Well, I guess we have it.

Speaker 9:          39:17          Great. Thank you. I feel as though in Italian. Yeah. Emotion. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          39:25          Uh, and, and then sometimes he'd really happy and then sometimes he's sort of despairing. And what's kind of cool it when we get over to this sparing idea here.

Speaker 3:          39:35          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          39:39          here we go again. Then it's going to be burning like a flame and then freezing to death. So we get these weird harmony out here cause he's freezing and thawing. So let's hear just a little bit maybe with, from there at center

Speaker 9:          40:03          dot. Okay.

Speaker 2:          40:14          No. Hello.

Speaker 1:          40:43          Okay, now we're going to go onto a little bit later. Lovely, lovely. Love it. And we're going to go into a little bit later if you can follow on your text too. So speed of a Jmo sends oval there of how B to a tray, most sensors up there and so on. What does Mozart Joe here in terms of structure,

Speaker 9:          41:02          a sequence. Um, I think uh, he repeats the same series of notes, um, progressively higher sort of to illustrate Carol Bruno's rising, uh, an angst slash. Emotion.

Speaker 1:          41:16          Good. So, um, so you pick it up your beef lot there and I'll try to catch up. Yeah, it's the spirit.

Speaker 2:          41:23          Hey Mom.

Speaker 1:          41:49          So notice there, uh, how as we come to the end of that, we work up there. We have the rises up through the melodic sequence, rising melodic sequence. We get Lauren hits that high note up there and then comes off of it. That's the climax, the peak of the whole Aria. And then the base. What's the base doing? It's sort of sneaking back down to the tonic. Okay. So, and when we get back to the tonic, yes. Comes in. We're going to pick it up from there. And um, Lauren, if you could, when we get, we're going to sink through that. We'll get over there to bog d. Dot. Just hold on core and we'll ask them a question. What happened here? What do we have here when we see if you can hold on that quarter. Some from the void?

Speaker 9:          42:47          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          42:50          Oh, hello. Hello.

Speaker 3:          43:14          Oh

Speaker 1:          43:18          Nice. Nice. So what did Mozart do there? What was that perceptive kid had a deceptive cadence. Good. And Marcus scores big today. So we're sitting here on, on this,

Speaker 7:          43:36          oh,

Speaker 1:          43:36          we want it to go, but instead it goes, and then we have our fly over.

Speaker 9:          43:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          44:01          And that's the way it is. So you come back to the tunnel. Okay. We've arrived. We've landed. All right. I think we have time to do the whole thing now from beginning to end, and we'll get our pages and order. And so Lauren labelle singing void case of payday from Mozart's marriage of Figaro.

Speaker 10:         44:39          Ooh.

Speaker 2:          44:45          How's that been? Maybe. Hello?

Speaker 10:         46:40          Oh Wow.

Speaker 2:          46:52          Hello.

Speaker 4:          47:37          Lovely, lovely, lovely. Aren't we fortunate to have such talented students here? Yeah. Okay, well thank you all very much. We'll play a little more Puccini on your way out, and I hope you enjoy this day. As beautiful as all this music has been.
