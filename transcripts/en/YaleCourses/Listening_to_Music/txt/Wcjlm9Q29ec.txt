Speaker 1:          00:01          All right. Let us begin. Let us

Speaker 2:          00:03          look. Turn down the music of Charles ours. We'll come back to Charles, but let us begin with her.

Speaker 1:          00:09          Uh, discussion of musical form, continuing our discussion, musical form. Last time we talked really about three forms. We talked about verse and Chorus in Popular Music and we had wonderful presentation by Frederick Evans and I hope you came away with the following that in dealing with verse and chorus basically leak, you have the same material you have to say musical material coming back again and again and again with the chorus, we actually have the same text coming back again and again and again. But with the verses, although the music is the same, the texts keeps changing each time we get new stroll fees are new versus of tech. So keep that in mind. Verse, Chorus, verse, Chorus. Sometimes this can start with the course. Sometimes there's a harmonic change in here that we would call, uh, the bridge. But essentially it's the repetition of the same material over and over again in terms of the music.

Speaker 1:          01:04          But in terms of the text, you get new texts each time. For the verses. We also talked about the simplest of all of these musical forms ternary form, right? And that was simply this idea of statement, contrast statement. A be a very straightforward, not too much. We need, uh, do with that. Today we're going to go on and talk about theme and variations. And with regard to all three of these, I should say that all three of these forms are very old. I could go back into the Middle Ages and get a response, sorry, of the Middle Ages that is in a be a form. I could go back into the middle ages and pray, bring up an early 15th century English Carol. That's inverse and chorus form. I could go back into the Middle Ages and find you instrumental pieces that are in theme and variation form. So these three are very old now.

Speaker 1:          02:00          The fourth one that we talked about, Sonata Allegro form is an, is adventitious, is something constructed in the 18th century, adventitious to the 18th century. So it was something put together in some that measure by Joseph Haydn and then passed on to his good friend Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. So eight. So Sonata Allegro form, this big complex musical form is a little bit different than the other. It's a lot younger. It's a lot newer beginning with the period of classical music, Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven. All right. With that, by way of a, um, uh, introduction, let's go back to Sonata Allegro form. We said that was the largest, the most complex of these musical form. Why are we dealing with this? Well, next a week from Saturday, we will go to this concert and we will sit there and we will listen to pieces on this concert. The opening piece will be in Sonata, allegro form it be by Mozart.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Then we will have a piece by Johan is Brahms in theme and variation form. Then we will have a symphony by Beethoven in five movements. It's an exception and we'll explain why when we get to it in five movements. But, uh, within those movements, we have a couple of instances of Sonata Allegro form, a couple of instances of theme and variation form and one instance of ternary form. So all of these forms will be necessary. We will have to understand how these forms work in order for us to really engage that particular particular concert. For example, you'll be asked to write a review of that concert and I was thinking this morning, well I kind of mediocre review would say well in the middle of the first movement of the Beethoven piece and we once again we wouldn't call it a song in the middle of the Beethoven a synth first one was a Beethoven symphony.

Speaker 1:          03:52          Things seem to be disorganized. What I'd like to hear there is, well in the development section, in the development section of the first movement of the Beethoven Symphony, uh, it seemed disorganized because the counterpoint was not clear because the imitative entries of the parts was not clearly articulated. And that would be a much more specific sort of response to the music and much more educated if you will, response to the music. So that's where we're going with all this to kind of sort of get you to think about precisely where you are and precisely what should be happening. And then is it really happening the way it should be? Yeah. As said, so not allegro form is the most difficult of these and it takes a little extra time to get familiar with it. We're going to be reviewing this in section starting this evening. And don't forget we have this model of what Sonata Allegro Form Is.

Speaker 1:          04:53          It didn't want to put that up on the board again, did that last time, but you've got it on page one 93 of your textbook. If you weren't that complex diagram one 93 of your textbook. So get familiar with that and do once again bring your books to section. Uh, this time cause we'll need him in section this time. So we've got this complex form and I've thought, I've figured out over the years the, the, the way to sort of wrap your arms around this or get into this, understand this and it, it, it, it involves the fact that music in the classical period is what we would call rhetorical music. It's doing something at every moment. It is doing, as I see it, one of four theme things. It's presenting a theme. So we'll have a, what we call a thematic function. It's moving from point a to point B. Remember with the Beethoven, that's the opening theme. And then the second theme is [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          05:53          Those are both themes that stating something that we can sing that we can remember, but they don't, it has to get from point a to point B, the more lyrical major. So he writes a transition. So the second functional type here is transitional music. We want to be able to differentiate thematic music from transitional music. Then there are passages and in Sonata allegro form, it's in the middle of the movement that are exclusively developmental, where you take the material and play with it, you can make it expand it and change it that way. You could shorten it as Beethoven often doesn't work with just particular motives. Uh, it tends to sound very complex. There's a lot going on in the development section. It's the most polyphonic, most contrapuntal counterpoint polyphony sort of synonymous, uh, the most complex in terms of the counterpoint. And as we said before, it tends to move around a lot because they pass the, the composer's, we'll pass through different keys in the development section.

Speaker 1:          06:56          So we've got so far, three of what we call the four functional types or what I have called the four functional type steam attic, transitional, developmental, and now we have to talk about the last one, which is the simplest in some ways cadential where the composure, we'll just throw on a lot of of heavy, simple harmonic motion to slow the music down psychologically, not the tempo actually, but psychologically sort of bring it to a close so we can say a closing functional type again to review thematic, transitional, developmental and cadential. Those are our four functional types. It will show up with any movement of Sonata. Allegro form question cadential that with a w it was that it that it's Daniel, is that right? Yeah. Yeah. How do you spell that? Oh, well just take Kayden's C, a, d e n s, c e and turn it into cadential t I. A. L. I don't know if my spell checker kicks that word back or not, but we use that term in music a lot.

Speaker 1:          08:05          You know, this was a cadential gesture and suggesting that we're going to get into the end of something. So it, I remember we had cadence been the end of a phrase. Well it's just the end of it and have a section here. Any other questions? That was a good question. All right, so to get rolling with this, let's listen to some music now. Enough talk from me. Let's get listened to some music and I'm going to play for excerpts here mostly here again for Mozart for excerpts and you see if you can identify which of the functional types is in play here. Okay, Linda, here we go.

Speaker 1:          09:04          Okay, we're going to stop there. Let's review just for a moment, how do you tell these folks all types? Well, what are you looking for here listening for? With thematic, you want to be able to kind of singer or you recognize it as something that you could walk out of here. Hammad so something that's that you can sort of take with you. A transitional, this idea of a little bit unsettled in lots of motion. Uh, cadential as I say, that's probably the easiest because bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bom, Bom, bom, bom, something like that. Bringing it to an end and developmental is going to be rather a complex, lots of counterpoint and going on. So let's go, let's go back to the beginning. I messing up Linda here again, but let's go back to oh seven there and we'll start all over with this. With that in mind,

Speaker 3:          09:51          okay? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:19          Okay. So that's number one. Here's extract number two.

Speaker 3:          10:34          Okay. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          10:38          an expert number three.

Speaker 3:          10:42          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:08          And number four. All right, let's go back now. Let's hear one, one more time, and then we're gonna ask for a volunteer to take a stab at which of the four functional types you think this is okay. Number one.

Speaker 3:          12:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:24          Stop right there. So what brave soul, we'll take this one on. Uh,

Speaker 3:          12:31          sorry,

Speaker 1:          12:32          Carolyn, please. Transitional. Uh, that is correct. Yes, that's correct. Now what, what did you hear there? And there's hard to play the whole thing again, but what were you thinking? What came, what, why did you jump to that conclusion?

Speaker 3:          12:49          Wow.

Speaker 1:          12:52          Okay. At the end of it, it did kind of slow down. You had a sense of arrival there. There was lots of motion, there was lots of movement. Lots of movement, and then at the end, a sense of arrival. All right. We've arrived at a new, and probably a theme is going to come in at the, at that point. So that is in fact a transition. Let's listen to, uh, once again to excerpt number two here. If we could, Linda,

Speaker 3:          13:15          sorry, because it's, it seems a lot of, um, a lot of, uh, um, we're not going to kind of in the base and it's really the bleeding into the descending melodic sequence of melody. It's coming to a close

Speaker 1:          13:54          bump. Okay. I think the key there is it's very monotonous. You use the word monotonous. It's very monotonous in a debate.

Speaker 4:          14:01          Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, bom,

Speaker 1:          14:06          or something like that. As the melody cascades down, I guess it, but listening to the base there, you can tell them that's just a very monotonous harmonic pattern. So harmonic patterns in cadential passages here. Cadential functional type tend to be, as Frederick says, monotonous. Okay, let's go on to number three now.

Speaker 3:          14:39          Stop

Speaker 1:          14:41          and Q. That one again. So what do you think about, about that name please? Roger. Okay. Faraway. Roger. Thematic, right? Can you sing it? Play it again for Roger, but really putting Roger on the spot here this morning. But let's, let's see. Uh, if you don't have to be,

Speaker 3:          15:11          I'll play it. The candle.

Speaker 1:          15:16          Okay. So that's it. Okay. Right. Just as I just played it. So, all right, so that is a melody. Let's cue that again. And just while we're at this, notice what Mozart does with his melody after giving it to us, sort of does some very interesting, I think so. So let's have the beginning of that same number three again, please.

Speaker 3:          15:37          So here's our lovely melody, major or minor, major sweet. Sounds delightful. Now watch what he does here. Just drops. If though, just the little twist in mind, same melody, which is lowering that third degree of the scale.

Speaker 1:          16:01          Okay? So that's a good example of, um, see Madec functional type here is extract number four. What about this one? And we'll, we'll just stop it there and you can go onto to the next one. Well, what about that one?

Speaker 3:          16:52          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          16:53          yeah. Go for the obvious answer here. It's going to be named please later. What? I beg your pardon? Developmental and why, what did you will, uh, yeah, because it's the only one that left, et Cetera, et cetera. But, but did you, could you, uh, tell us something that you heard there that sort of backs that up or confirms that it is developmental? Yeah. Many threads weaving it in a t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, all sort of simultaneously many different ideas happening simultaneously. Typical of the complexity of the development section. We've got some more on the tape here. We're not going to go through to them quite socially. Let's play one more. Uh, it could be any one of the four. Here's another one. Number five. I think it's still on track. Track three zero 37.

Speaker 3:          18:07          Okay. Take her, is there a name please? I should know this young lady right in front of Thaddeus. You had your hand up first. Oh, Mary Pat. Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:26          It was transitional. Uh, and it just the one hearing that's awfully good, but you could hear it kind of bill yet. T t t t t t t t t t t t. T. T. T, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, and then it stopped as if it had arrived at the end of the transition. The musical journey was over. So that was transitional. Here's another one.

Speaker 3:          18:47          [inaudible] takers there.

Speaker 1:          19:23          Oh, thirtyish. Okay. Was Developmental. Excellent. Then I guess once again, lots of things going on there. Uh, probably developmental and transitional may sound most similar. They're probably the two that are most difficult to differentiate thematic. Yeah, you can kind of remember that as a melody credential, probably pretty straight forward. Um, uh, so there's a tendency with two confused, the transitional and the developmental. It's just that there's oftentimes a developmental, a lot more counterpoint going on. All right. One last one here and then we'll stop this.

Speaker 3:          20:07          [inaudible]. Okay. Nobody's

Speaker 1:          20:40          driving that sucker into the ground with it. Sort of the sledge hammer, but cadential ending there. Okay. So that should help you. We get the sections this week we're going to be playing pieces and sort of having you track along where we are in Sonata Allegro form. Let's turn our attention now unless they're questions. Any questions about that? If not, let's turn our attention now to theme and variation. We're moving on to theme and variation form, which we will also need for our concerts a week from Saturday. Here. What we have is not this sort of complex organic mixture of many different themes. First theme, second theme, concluding theme and things like that. We have one theme usually, usually just one thing and we will get that theme and then we will get that theme again with something changed and then we will get that material again with something change.

Speaker 1:          21:27          And again with something changed. So think of this as a kind of series of boxcars on the railroad train or something like that. Units more or less the same size, but each of those boxcars going to look a little bit different as it goes by because it might have a little different logo on it, a little bit of different ornamental material on it. All right, so we're going to, uh, uh, let's see for time, maybe, maybe I'll will not do the ivs. We were going to pull it out. Maybe we will have a little bit of a theme demon variations. Again, it goes all the way back to the Middle Ages. Uh, and it, they tend to be written on the rather simple themes, particularly patriotic themes. Maybe I was thinking about this the other day, maybe because patriotic themes are pretty simple. So the simpler the theme, the more likely that theme is to be come the basis of a set of theme and variations. Maybe it gives the composer more freedom to pursue. Now, I think I brought in some variations of Beethoven on God. Save the king. Yeah, here we go. So here's Beethoven writing God, save the king. And here it started.

Speaker 5:          22:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:43          All right, so very simple tune. And then he writes a set of variations. Here's variation one. So there's that tune now in the late 19th, early 20th century. Yale's own Charles Ives and he gives classes, let me know. Oh Nay. 1898, something like that. He used to be the organist and the the first church, the green here. So this is jails. Most famous classical composer wrote a set of variations on this same tune, but they sound a little bit different because it's closer to the modern period and they're performed here on an organ. So Charles Ives variations on America

Speaker 3:          23:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          24:12          talk about a long reverberation time. How long it took that organ sound, the clear that church. Um, so that was written right here in new haven by our own Charles Ives. But again, the point is that it's a very simple idea to rather simple tune. Here's another simple tune that Mozart used. Uh, its original title was variations on [inaudible] Mama. Oh, let me tell you Mama. And it's the, it's a story of a, of a young woman who has gone to the big city and unfortunately lost her virginity. But we know this tune not with that French text, that Mozart first learned it with, but this way.

Speaker 5:          24:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          25:00          Okay. So that, that's the tune. But originally it was a kind of French popular popular song going back into at least the 18th century. Uh, how many different titles can we give to this? What do you know this ash?

Speaker 3:          25:16          Cool.

Speaker 1:          25:17          Twinkle, twinkle little star. Anything else? What bad ba black sheep didn't. Sesame street used to use letters with it. A, B, c, d. Dot. A, B, c, d. And so, so it's gotten a lot of traction over the years. Uh, and here's the melody and here's the first variation. Now my question to you, is this with theme and variation, the components or can keep the theme more or less exactly as it is and change the context around it or he can change the theme. So which does Mozart doing the first one? Very,

Speaker 5:          25:55          oh

Speaker 6:          26:06          yeah.

Speaker 1:          26:08          Thoughts about that? Is he changing the, the theme or is it keeping the team exactly the same and and changing stuff around it? What do you think? Well, what he's doing is changing the theme. The theme would go

Speaker 6:          26:23          right at the beginning instead of I get,

Speaker 1:          26:27          so there's only really one note that's that's that relates to the theme there and then,

Speaker 6:          26:33          well no, I get,

Speaker 1:          26:34          so he's sort of changing the theme by making the notes go quicker and Warner many around those notes. So that's a variation one. Now what variation too? Does he change the theme or does it just changed the, all the stuff around the theme and so on. So what's he doing there,

Speaker 3:          27:17          Caroline?

Speaker 1:          27:20          Changing what? I'm sorry. Couldn't hear. Changing the context. Changing the context. The theme in the right hand stays exactly the same. Uh, okay. Here is the next one. What's that? Well it goes with this. So has he changed the theme? Yeah, he's changed the theme rather considerably there. Indeed. We wouldn't know that that had anything to do with twinkle twinkle little star unless we had had given to his previously as we have the melody. So we are hearing in our inner ear. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          28:09          Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

Speaker 1:          28:21          So we know that's the basis of this and if he wants to deviate from that we can still say, oh yeah, that's related to that is getting rid of the far away from the original because we were sort of locked in the original in our mind, in our ear at that point. Uh, here is, um, oh, let's, yeah, let's skip that one. We don't need it here. What happens? What happens here? Is the theme changed or is it still there? Uh, and the context changed. And what rhythmic device is Mozart using here? So did he change the theme there? Well, basically no, except just a little bit because he was doing what to it.

Speaker 3:          29:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:31          Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bomp using, take a patient. So he was syncopating the theme, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, bom, that kind of, and he did one other little fill up here, if you will, in what we might call the B section of the tune.

Speaker 6:          29:50          The tune originally went and now it's going. And then

Speaker 1:          30:03          so what's he done to the melody? Anybody here that went

Speaker 6:          30:13          Oscar? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          30:15          Yeah. He's filled in the notes of a diatonic major scale. The other nodes, the black key notes. You're making it a chromatic scale season. Enriched it a little bit by means of chromaticism. All right, let's go into another variation by Mozart here. What's the texture of this variation?

Speaker 6:          31:00          MMM.

Speaker 1:          31:09          So you think about the texture of that homophonic monophonic or polyphonic. Polyphonic yeah. Was the imitative or non imitative? Here's the beginning.

Speaker 6:          31:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:28          Imitate. Right. So this is actually a kind of throwback to the sound of Bach and this is what we will be engaging when we come to the fume. It's like Mozart trying to write, uh, in a few goal way here with lots of imitation. And what happened to the mode in this variation?

Speaker 6:          31:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:47          Well as you're running it up as a scale, but what kind of scale? Minor scale. Okay. Um, and then oddly the final, the final variation. A, what does he do to the meter in this last variation? What happens there? We were going to king. Ooh. So what's he done to the meter?

Speaker 6:          32:29          Okay,

Speaker 1:          32:29          well let me strip away the bay. He's changed it to football by throwing in extra bar, a filler in between each of his basic Dupo beads. Then we come to, uh, maybe, okay. Uh, let me just cut to the chase here at the end of this. He's coming in. What's this? All the way to the end now. What do we call this formally about that with regard to Sonata Allegro form, it was one of the parts that shows up also. It's another leg reform has nothing to do really with the theme here. It is a good example of a, a Coda, right? Just something thrown on at the end to say this is the end. What's he doing here? What is this? How complex is this?

Speaker 7:          34:01          It's just

Speaker 1:          34:02          day major trial. He's just automating a major triumph. So it's a good more credential stuff. Sort of very simple material at the end. Okay. Our guest artist is here. I see him at the back can show. Come on up. We're going to do another piece for you and we're going to talk about a little bit about Kensho. Very interesting guy. How many of you know Kensho Watanabe? Seen Kensho around, uh, who's seen Ken show? In what context? Oh, he's in my biochemistry class. All right. Yeah. Cool. So that means he does hardcore sciences and you must too. Good for you. You're, you're better. Far better man than I. Um, all right. So yeah, hardcore sciences, um, uh, anybody else know can show from other contexts. Yeah. Atlanta, he's in the YSL. What does he do in the YSL? You seem sitting all the way to the back. No, you seemed sitting all the way up at the front. He's the concert master of the wire. So, uh, anybody else know Ken on a different context? Any members of [inaudible] Lee College here? Anybody from Berkeley? Nobody from Berkeley. That's a statistical improbability. Uh, but, uh, uh, you're the conductor of the, one of the conductors of the Berkeley Chamber Orchestra, right? Yeah. So he's a conductor to, which is kind of astonishing because he's not really not a very good musician. He doesn't really know very much about music. Can show what note is that. Yeah. What note is this?

Speaker 1:          35:31          But no, it is this. Yeah. So he has a very keen sense of absolute pitch, which, uh, it really helps you out if you're a music legend. He was to say as we will be, we'll be talking more about this. One person in 10,000 has this particular guest gift statistically. So He's a very impressive guy. And he's also in the five year m a a B a program, right? Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, at the end of four years here, in addition, taking all these heavy duty science classes, uh, he's been across the street and you're going to get an inmate in music at the same time. I don't know. He was, he was a couple of minutes late today. And you said he hadn't gotten much sleep. And I can sure as heck understand why. Uh, all right, so we have, uh, a Kensho. What are you up to this year?

Speaker 1:          36:18          Everybody can come see you, um, on, uh, what would that be? The 31st of the, of of October. Yeah. Yes. So the, that you don't want to miss, right? And you kind of have to put that together and maybe that's why you haven't been getting much sleep. So you're putting that together, uh, and tell, and I know that you've got a concert coming up, and if for some reason, God forbid we can't make it to our concert on the 18th or makeup concert, could very well be the one on the 19th. Don't you have a concert on the 19th? Yes.

Speaker 5:          36:50          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          36:53          So if you want to hear Kensho conduct, uh, you could do that on the 19th of October. All right, so we've got a piece here and I don't want to get too far behind. Uh, it's a piece by Correlly. It's based on, uh, a melody and a base pattern melody and a base pattern. And, uh, we'll play through little bits of it here and then, uh, we're going to play the whole thing. Uh, do we need to tune again when you think? Yeah. Okay. Okay. We've tuned the four strings of the violin. We'll play just a little bit. We're going to take this section by section, Jacob Peery. He's going to point things out as we go along a little bit.

Speaker 1:          38:14          Not the most gorgeous sound I've ever heard. It's amazing. But do you have any idea how long it takes to produce a sound like that? I mean, how many years of just sitting there? When did you start playing the violin? When I was almost three. Almost three. So you were a late bloomer that, uh, and you probably so busy with things, but when you were really focusing exclusively on this, how many hours a day would you practice? And that was really focusing to pilot three hours a day, Max for me. I was saying what I'm saying, if you go to conserve it, it's because you got so many other demands on your time. Are you playing any solos around here this year? I should have asked that question. A little recital. Second smells. Okay. All right. Well we'll keep our eye out for that. All right. So that's the theme. Uh, and then, um, on, uh, in variation to the piano will play the, the down beat and, uh, the violin plays off the beat. I think for reasons of time, we won't do that when though. Kensho. Let's go to number three. Where are we good to get a good example of Staccato in the music, sort of short pointed notes.

Speaker 1:          39:31          Okay. So we'll stop there. So when you hear Ken show playing Staccato, then you know that we are in variation. Three variation, uh, for uh, we've got, he's playing 16th notes. Uh, so it's going to go fairly fast here I guess, or maybe not, but he's got a lot too. He's got a lot to do here in variation for

Speaker 5:          40:09          okay.

Speaker 1:          40:09          So he's really, uh, there's going to be workout from me. I hope I can keep up with this lead today. Uh, all right then. Uh, yes, the one who sort of scares me is variation five because then he plays the theme and I have all of this fast stuff underneath. Let's just do a little bit of that.

Speaker 5:          40:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          40:41          How'd that the air, the lovely, lovely theme there. That will, number six is sort of fun because the interest here is in the base of the piano. It's a good example of something we'll be talking a lot about in our course walking babies. Um, so it, it, the notes are all for the most part contiguous and they all come in the same, no value. In this case, the eighth notes, it'd be here's the beat and the, and then he plays the melody against that. Uh, number seven, we have the violin playing arpeggios. We've talked about that. So here's some Arpeggios in the violin.

Speaker 5:          41:27          Huh?

Speaker 1:          41:38          That's, that'll give you a sense of that. Uh, number eight is a tricky one for us to keeping it together because of the triplet patterns. So let's do a little bit with that. And then nine, we have a sort of an interlude. It's like a transition. 10 we're not going to do anything with right now. Uh, the violin plays harmony while there's a kind of fast pattern underneath 11. There's a lot of, oh 11 is sort of my favorite, but it's, it's a, it's a, it's a tricky one because of the syncopation between the two instruments.

Speaker 1:          43:00          So that's kind of a fun one. Um, and let's see, we need to tell them also. Uh, I like number, maybe it's number 13 is really my favorite because I got a very simple theme to play in. He has to work like crazy. And toward the end of that, he's playing triple stops. You know, uh, it's not that the violin just plays one line. The violin can play two notes at the same time. It can play three notes at the same time. And if you really rip across and shift quickly or just move your boat quickly across the strings, you can give the impression of four pitches. But they all four have to be in tune. So you gotta have four fingers usually in four different spots and that's hard to do. You want to play it a triple or quadruple stopped for him. There's just to any old where, yeah,

Speaker 1:          43:47          so when you hear those chords, if violin playing court, oh, that's easy, you know, on a piano or whatever it is, that's easy on the piano. That's hard on the string instruments cause you've got to get four different fingers in four different spots there. Each of those notes have to be adjusted, just fractionally, just right for it to stay in tune. When he does it, you think it's very simple, right? Easy to do takes years to be able to do that. Uh, questions before we launch into this, any questions? So we're going to do the whole thing for you, and it'd be patient. We're going to run over just a little bit today, but believe me, the, uh, particularly the end, you'll like it. So Ken Sho Watanabi playing theme and variations on Carollee's tune and base La Folia.

Speaker 5:          45:56          Yeah, no. Okay.

Speaker 1:          47:57          Okay.

Speaker 5:          48:38          Yeah. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          50:00          Wrong page up here. And I was feeling sorry. Okay. I think we need, okay. Now we are back to the, I had the goal page. Okay.

Speaker 5:          50:16          You stood

Speaker 1:          50:17          on it. I'm very sorry. We found it. Okay. We, we had just have all these pages and Igor rives sometimes. Sorry. Okay.

Speaker 3:          51:41          Yeah,

Speaker 7:          52:23          yeah.

Speaker 3:          52:46          Great. Great. Me just to be able to play with a guy. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Beautiful. Beautiful.
