Speaker 1:          00:01          All right. Good morning. Let us begin. Today we're going to move away from the first dimension of music that we've been looking at, which is duration or time and begin to work with the second which is pitch and melody. And here's an uh, uh, an initial question for you. Think of the texture of music and think of this, these strands of high and low. Where does melody sit in the texture? Is it high, middle, or low? Where is it you think about it conceptually, I'm trying to figure out, well, I got this board up here, this tapestry or whatever. Where's my melody going to be in the texture? High, middle or low? Michael? Yeah, usually hot. Now here's an interesting question for you. Why is it usually hot? There's an acoustical reason for this. Why does the melody show up in the high range? I beg your pardon. It's easier to hear in a high range. Why is it easier to hear in a high range? What about the acoustics here? Once again, laws of acoustics. Why is it easier to hear in a high range? I could play for you. For example, a little bit of Mozart with something like this. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:22          You like that sounds better up there. It doesn't. Why is that the case? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:40          that's it. Exactly. In a melody, we tend to have a lot of rhythmic activity there. It's got to have activity to play itself out as melody melody, but because the way a sound waves operated, we have these low sound waves taking a very long time to clear everything, very long time to clear. The higher frequencies take a lot shorter time to clear their short sound waves. They clear very quickly so we can hear a melody, we can hear a melody more clearly in this higher register and therefore there is always the tendency to have the base plate sort of walls, low notes because those sounds take a long time to clear and melodies play faster rhythms because those sounds clear quickly and we can hear and enjoy the melody. All right. That's just a, an opening thought about why melody show up in the top part of the texture. Let's talk about melody here and let's talk about pitch. We said before that in western music we have musical notation and musical notation has relied on more in western music and any other musical civilization around the world. And in the west, this whole idea of pitch notation goes back to the ninth century when the monks and nuns in Benedictine abbeys in Switzerland and France and Germany, northern Italy started doing this.

Speaker 1:          03:09          They started marking on parchment or slate the general course of a military. Eventually what they did was to separate these

Speaker 1:          03:19          lines into more discreet places, are more discreet pitches. Then around 1000 in northern Italy and enterprising fellow named Guido hereto came along and said, well, you know what? I can, I can get this to show us how far up we are supposed to go by placing it on some kind of grid here. And this is this, this, uh, as I say before, at the beginning of the first graph in the history of the West, this grid of horizontal lines. And we will know that if we're going from here to here, it's got to be exactly this frequency or at least this space. So initially they came up with four lines and eventually five and even six, and then they went back to five by the 15th century. What they also did around the year 1000 was to identify, to label these, uh, particular, uh, spots, spaces in line. So they began to call this a and this B and this, c, d and e, this, f this, g. When they got up here,

Speaker 2:          04:27          they stop. Why did they stop?

Speaker 1:          04:32          Why didn't they keep right on going with g h? I, j. K. L. M. N. O. P. Why don't we sing m's and o's and peas

Speaker 2:          04:37          today? Why did they stop?

Speaker 1:          04:40          Any ideas?

Speaker 2:          04:44          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:46          no, they had this thing, they hit this thing called the octave. Then of course, there's this at and another acoustical phenomena here we've talked about before. What's your relationship within an octave? The string is vibrating higher. One is exactly twice with the lower on the, so they heard this and they heard this is essentially all one sound. So if it's a duplication of sale, let's duplicate the letters. But you can't look at manuscripts of the early 11th century and see it was people singing peas and L's and ooze and ends and things like that. So they became to uniformly adopted system of what's called octave duplication and every musical culture around the world. I've talked with ethnomusicologists about this particular point. Every musical culture around the world, Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian, Indian, African, whatever, they all use this phenomenon of Optus duplication in their music, octave, duplication in the music.

Speaker 1:          05:40          But how they divide up this sonic space within the active can vary rather considerably. Some Arabic music seems to have as many as 14 gradations within the opposite. Now we're going to listen to a piece of music here from the tradition of classical India and I thought we might have a sitar player in here. Somebody I got wind of the fact, we might have the classical Indian musician in our class, somebody that has studied the Sitar and might be able to come in and play one for us, but we don't, we don't have that. So we're going to use a something on our CD's by the world. Famous sitarist Ravi Shankar. Okay. You've probably heard of him. He's actually quite old though. It must be surely isn't as eighties. He was very famous when I was in graduate school. Tons and tons of years ago. So, but he is the venerable sitar player. And here is the pattern of the Raga, we'll call it a scale. It's not really a skill but a but a raga that he is using. It's got only six notes within the office and the sick notes are that particular pattern. It doesn't sound like any skill you we've ever heard of it. So let's listen to Ravi Shankar play a bit of a Raga using a six node scale.

Speaker 1:          07:07          Okay?

Speaker 3:          07:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          07:30          So that gives you a flavor of that and you have that of course on your CD number six 15. Uh, so that's um, that's a, a bit of Sitar music. Now we're going to play another six nodes scale. Let's go onto that one. Linda gets set and this of course is sung by Norah Jones. And as you know from reading the textbook, why do I mention Norah Jones? Or why do we play Norah Jones right after Ravi Shankar? It's his daughter. No, an interesting world. Every Saturday morning and I'm going through stop and shoppers and there is Nora Jones and the background playing and I'm going down the pasta aisle or whatever and I have the daughter of Ravi Shankar over my, over my shoulder. What a world. Huh? Uh, so we're going to listen to just a couple of seconds here of a blues tune by some by Norah Jones. Okay. So we'll just cut. But what she's working losses people, we're not going to listen to the whole thing is this idea of a book.

Speaker 4:          08:54          Yeah. No.

Speaker 3:          09:10          How's that up? Right? One, two, three, four, five, six.

Speaker 1:          09:16          With this one, sometimes major in, sometimes minor, we'll come back to it. So that's another six notes scale, but a different sort of pattern. A different kinds of pattern is a blues scale pattern. Just kind of between the major and minor that we'll, we'll, we'll talk about a little bit later. So two different forms of a six node pattern. Let's go to a five no pattern. If you've ever visited parts of Indonesia, which I have not. And if you've ever visited parts of China, which I have not, um, I am told that you will hear this kind of music. It's played by a traditional Chinese instrument called the are who this I have seen around the world many times and heard it's a two string instrument to produce a particularly beautiful, vibrant tone. So we're going to listen to an r who playing. I think this is track if you want to pursue it, it's track a six CD track 16. Um, let's listen to an r who play a melody by a traditional Chinese composer. We call him an English Abi and you can read about him there in your textbook. Okay, so let's pick that up.

Speaker 1:          11:07          Five notes within the octave just there. So it's a pen and what we call a pentatonic scale pentatonic scale. And that's using a lot of, of Far Eastern cultures, the pentatonic scale to five, five note scale. Yeah. Okay. So we have this whole idea of octave duplication, uh, sometimes six months, sometimes five notes. We in the West have settled on a seven note scale. Why did that happen? Well, we have this idea of the seven oaks

Speaker 3:          11:30          major seven no, the

Speaker 1:          11:34          notes, well, if the answer that we have to go back to ancient Greek music theory, and you read about this as really, really turgid stuff, but believe it or not, I teach a course on this at the graduate level. We have to read the quarter. Linda has to take this kind of stuff from reading era stocks and this and things like this. So what, what we were dealing here with is a situation. The ancient Greeks were very much into mathematics as a way of explaining the world and explaining music in particular and they thought these ratios were primary. So they had the ratio of two to one, which gave them the octave and three to two, which gave them the fifth and four to three, which gave them the fourth. They also, because the system worked out better for their purposes, then jumped to nine to eight, which gave them the whole time.

Speaker 1:          12:14          So they started out there and let's say they were working down here, they filled in the octave up above and then they filled in the fifth and then they filled in the fourth and then they came down a whole step and then they went up a fourth from that whole step and an upper forth from that. And they were filling in in this fashion interestingly enough. And you ever wonder this I, there's sometimes if somebody wandered by keyboards, that's odd. What's the great oddity about the keyboard? Which strange about this keyboard? It's very a symmetrical right? Uh, Marcus. Yeah, it's missing. It's missing some, some notes in here. This is missing something in here and there's missing there. Well what these are where the cracks after the Greeks laid out their fists and force and whole steps, they had these little leftovers. They called them lemurs are, they had these little leftovers in there and that's why we end up with these small distances between BNC.

Speaker 5:          13:07          Yeah. Hot, hot, hot. That's a big step out. Hum. Badadada that's

Speaker 1:          13:13          a small step there. So the scale is actually not equal. A to B is one distance, which is a large one. And BDC is, is only half that distance. And that's because of the way the Greeks laid this thing out with their two to one ratio, street to ratios and so on. But in any event we in, we ended up with this. Now the Greeks, so had a whole series of patterns. They called them mixed of Lydian and hypo mix, the Lydian and Phrygian and hypo fridges and stuff like this. A lot of different patterns. But in the course of history, we settled beginning in the 16th and 17th century down into two just two patterns than what we call the major pattern and the minor pattern. So let's talk about that just for a moment. Uh, and before we do it, I should add one of the things.

Speaker 1:          13:58          How then do we get these other notes up here? We get these other notes up here. Well, well we now call the black notes, although historically keyboards could be either way. You could have these added notes, a black oral, uh, or white, and then these underneath would be buying. So we filled these out sort of in the 14th century. All of this got filled in. These between BNC and enf didn't get filled in because they were already just the smallest amount that they wanted to deal with. Just half steps. So we end up here within an octave. We end up with 12 equal pitches, but we still use this term a seven note scale because we have seven notes within the scale of the major scale and seven notes within the scale of the minor scale. All right, so let's talk about major and minor now and we've put those patterns up here.

Speaker 1:          14:48          This is given for you in your textbook is something of a review. Let's start with a major scale on a c. So here is the symbol for c and the staff. Here is where c would be located on the keyboard. We're going to start here and we had this pattern of the major that goes whole, whole half, whole, whole, whole half step. So we start on c and then we go up to d a whole step. I'm going to write that in here. That's good. Now we go d to e and that's another whole step. Now I have a half step. I got to go up just a half step there and money, but it's just f is just a half step away, so that's good. I don't need to do anything more than that. Now I'm on f here. Oil, I need a whole step. There's my one, I need a whole step. I got to go up to g and then another whole step up to a and then another whole step up to be. And the last one in the major pattern is a half step from B to c.

Speaker 4:          15:46          Ah, there we are and that's good.

Speaker 1:          15:50          So we've got our major scale. Let's talk a little bit about the minor scale. Now it's got it. It's got a different pattern, got a different pattern. They liked melodies to go this way. They're like melodies to go this way. Let's start on the same pitch. See, let's go up a whole step. What's a whole step above c? Just d now we need according to our pattern to go up just a half step. What's a half step above d? Well then we have to think about, we've got to get into these black notes, which can be called sharps or flats. They're called sharps. If they're up above the note in question, this would be some kind of d sharp. They're called flats if they're down below. So flats or below, uh, the sharps take you up a half step. So we went to see two D, we need this pitch here. What are we going to call it

Speaker 1:          16:45          or are we going to call it d sharp? Well we should call it e flat. We should call it e flat and put it up on the Elan. Cause it was kind of a rule here that you have to use up each letter name intern each letter name. In turn we can't go. C, d, d sharp, f we got to go CD, some kind of e f so you gotta go up the alphabet here. All right, so there we are. But is this from d to e a half step? We need a half step here. What we've written is a whole step. So we've got to indicate that this is just a half step away in that fashion. D to e flat. Now what do we do above the flat? Well, the whole step here where there's one half, there's another hand would take us to f whole step above f would take us to, Gee, what am I going to write here from, Gee, I need a half step here is ah, it doesn't matter. Here's the pattern up here. We'll focus on this one. I need a half step above g. What's a half step above g? E flat. Okay. I need a whole step above a flat,

Speaker 3:          17:54          right?

Speaker 1:          17:56          Hmm. Nice and loud please. Edward B flat. Okay. And then at the end of the process, I have another whole step from B flat back to seat. And that gives me back to my, to my active in that fashion. Okay. Well I think that's a straightforward enough if, if you're unsure about that checkout, of course, chapter three in the textbook, uh, where these issues, uh, issues are addressed.

Speaker 1:          18:31          Okay. We've been talking about scales, these idea of major and minor scales, and we said there's seven notes in each of these two scales, 12 pitches altogether within the office. But within the scale, all notes are not the same. There's one note as the primary note, right? What's the primary node call? They'll note around which all of the others, all the others gravitate tonic. No. Okay. Uh, then there's one other that we have to know about. It's called the leading tone and what it does is pull in the, to the tonic. Let's say we're in the key of c here. The leading tone is always the seventh degree. It's always a half step, or it's a half snap. Seventh degree right below, right below the tonic. We might throw it away, man. I thought the tonic was down here. We've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight. Eight is a duplication of one eat in one or the tonic. So seven poles up in two, eight it pulls up into two eight the tonic.

Speaker 6:          19:31          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          19:47          That's the leading toe. Where's it want to go? You can hear it pulling in their opera. Singers love this. They, they love to kind of luxuriate and the opportunity to show off their voice on leading tones, build up expectation. Make you wait even more for that topic. Let's listen to Luciano Pavarotti. Pavarotti seeing a leading tone and it was by coincidence happens to be the one year anniversary of the Pavarotti, his death this week. So here's Luciano Pavarotti, singing, leading tone. The tempo here is very slow and he slows it down even more than, and he just sits out there, this huge wonderful voice that he had on the leading tone. And you can hear him sort of slightly, didn't go, gone. You could hear him slide that leading towed into the, into the, um, into the tonic in that case. Okay. So we've got across the idea of, uh, of tonics and leading tones. So we do tonics. Do we know the time it is? Sing it. Um, so given the setup, you kind of feel that what your Michigan or what this home home pitch is the pitch to which to which you are Greg gravitating most of our popular music folk tall or songs or things like that are written in Dupo meter and in a major key. Occasionally you get things written in triple meter and in a minor key, minor key. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          21:40          Uh,

Speaker 1:          22:03          that's Gershwin, Porgy and bess in minor folks home. Well, civil war, civil war zone and so on. It goes. Occasionally you do run into pop pieces, folk songs in minor, but most of them are in major, probably about 80% in major. Same thing in the classical realm. Linda, what would you say? What percentage of classical pieces are written in minor keys?

Speaker 4:          22:39          Okay,

Speaker 1:          22:40          well, well give us a number. Take only five. Classical. Huh? Maybe a little more than that, but, but, but not, not all that minute. Here's what I don't know. We should, we should do a survey sometime. Go to go through the literature, see what, but most of, for the most part, it shows minor. A major occasionally is chosen. Here's a good example of a minor from the second movement of Beethoven's Third Symphony.

Speaker 4:          23:08          Hmm. No,

Speaker 1:          23:35          but for Mozart, major

Speaker 4:          23:40          difference between major and minor.

Speaker 1:          23:57          So when you used to making associations with major and minor, major, happy, bright, optimistic day, like today, minor, somber. Uh, why is that the case? Is there anything in the physics of this music? No, not really. There's nothing in the loss of physical acoustics here that caused that to be the case. If you look back over it, there was no prejudice major or minor in western music up in about the 16th century. And then people started writing these things called madrigals that were tied to texts and they got in this habit of every time they had a bright happy texts, they'd set this in one kind of, uh, of mode or, or key major, a major mode. And every time it had a sad, when they'd set it in minor, we got used to hearing it that way. So it's kind of cool every time it'll shoe wants to write about the Mary Farmer. Sometimes she'll buy, let's right a funeral march. And there's a tendency also minor, low, major high trying to say, so we get, we get used to this and this point that it is culture rather than acoustics was brought home to me once in a discussion with a student here at Yale who said to me, yeah, but over there at the [inaudible] center, we Jews have lots of happy melodies and they are all in minor what you would call minor. That's what I thought about that. Yeah, that's probably true even though,

Speaker 4:          25:16          hmm.

Speaker 1:          25:22          It's that the Israeli national anthem. I think so. Is that right? What, is that what yes or no? Okay. But it may be how many national anthems around the world do we have in minor keys? And what does this say about the tradition of Jewish music? He, is it, is it really western or is it eastern European or Asian? Even with some Asian influences. Ah, interesting. Interesting issues, uh, issues that can be brought home. This kind of ambiguity. Sometimes you encounter in Klezmer music, any, but what's Klezmer music, sort of Jewish, traditional Jewish folk music. A lot of the coming out of eastern Europe. So we're going to listen to a kind of souped up or rocked up a version of some klezmer music here and what they have a strong bass electric bass underneath. And we're going to listen

Speaker 6:          26:14          to a minor melody with the leading tone thrown in. It gives it this kind of exotic field

Speaker 1:          26:24          and then it will switch major. So let's listen to this bit of Klezmer music. Go back and forth between minor and major

Speaker 3:          26:32          [inaudible]. Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:53          Okay, so that's the intro. Now we're going to go onto the shift. Uh, two major here, another little clip. So there is in major, let's listen a little bit more. It's going to go back to minor and then I think shifts back to major will be a boon to hear. You're the shift turned down just a little bit. Linda, please.

Speaker 3:          27:27          Major, minor. Raise your left hand if you think it's minor. What about this major? My right hand, if it's major, this is major.

Speaker 1:          27:47          It's a little bit of a, of this ambiguity in between major and minor. Any piece of traditional Jewish music. Oh, let's see. We've talked about. Let's talk about hearing. Tell me how we hear these melodies. Um, when the reason that we hear these is this as distinctly different, I think happens rather early on in the scale. Let's think about this for a minute. We've got this scale up. Can we?

Speaker 5:          28:16          Yeah. Um, if you go to this scale

Speaker 1:          28:24          that sound dark, I don't know, 500 years ago, that wouldn't have sounded dark. Now that sounds dark to us, Ahmed,

Speaker 5:          28:30          Yamaha, Yamaha, Tom,

Speaker 1:          28:33          but that darkness occurs very early in the scale. As you can see there. It's the third note we'll be talking about the fact that this is an interval of the third spans, three letter names a little bit later on so that minor third can show up very early in the scale that that's a critical moment in any scale determining how we're going to feel about it and we can just play with that. That particular interval to change entirely the way we feel about particular melodies here is I'm a Christian song. I guess it's joy to the world. The Lord has come. Don't we send you the Christmas Kale or something is seen as a Christmas Carol. Not much joy there. Oh, you like that one. How about you? Or my favorite is

Speaker 1:          29:39          no, you can turn this whole thing. You said Jewish bar Mitzvah or something like that. And you were, you were singing with the Coen brothers down to somewhere in an appellation. What was that wonderful movie though? But it had the Coen brothers and all the great American folk music in it. You are my sunshine. Oh, brother. Where art thou? Wasn't that what it was called brother? Where art thou? Yeah. So, uh, just that little was a switch to turn off a switch there. You can, you can do some great, great things with changing, changing the mode. So we've got scales that are in the major mode. We've got scales in the minor mode. We also have scales in the chromatic mode, and that's when we don't have just seven pitches within this scale. We're going to use all of the pitches, all 12 here, chroma from the is the Greek word for color. So this is a, a more colorful scale. Um, uh, what is it? Well, that's a chromatic scale. We had an example of that the other day working with the Mozart. Uh, where was that in the requiem. Oh, food. Yeah. Remember we had, he was coming up a minor stuff,

Speaker 4:          30:50          gale

Speaker 1:          30:55          and then he at the top

Speaker 4:          30:56          love it,

Speaker 1:          30:58          switched over into a chromatic scale. Here's the story.

Speaker 4:          31:04          Minor chromatic,

Speaker 1:          31:15          um, what does, what does this do to us? Why did he do that? Well, it chromaticism adds tension to music and especially chromaticism that's pulling up scales and go up ed tension music goes up generally. But if you can double that, combine that with chromatic music, then you got a sort of super windy of tension and that's what he's doing. They're trying to build tension as, as the just rise from the graves at the, at that party. At that particular point, the entire compositions are rarely written in the chromatic scale. Yeah. It's, it's kind of a color that you throw in from time to time for a special effect. So we've got the major minor scales, we've got the chromatic scales. We also have what we call conjunct melodies.

Speaker 4:          32:03          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          32:04          Melodies or just kind of running up and down the scale, a neighboring tones. Um, those are two Christmas carols that are very conjunct in, in nature. A good example we used a moment ago of a disjunct melody. Yes.

Speaker 4:          32:26          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          32:28          Can we all sing that? Here we go, ready sing, take me how to the ball game, take me out to the park, et, etc. It's amazing that that melody has become as popular as it has given the fact that it's really hard to sing. It's a very disjunct melody. It's got all these odd leaps at Bop, bop, bop, boop beep. So I was like, sure. And Berg almost, it's sort of off the map here in terms of this junk mis, but nonetheless we have been able to absorb all of that. So melodies can be conjunct or this joke and possibly the most conjunct of all melodies. And the history of music was the melody that we looked at very briefly in the first gathering and that is Beethoven's famous Ode to Joy. Now would the van Beethoven was in his fifties, when he was working on his last symphony, would prove to be as last symphony, his ninth symphony. Uh, and he'd been tinkering with this particular melody all the way back to probably 1803. So it's about 20 years or so. Ninth Symphony is 18, 23, 24 as early as 1823. We know he's working right?

Speaker 1:          33:40          Trying to get this to work just right. And eventually over this 20 year period, he did get it to work just right. Let me swing this board around. Here's the famous melody. I put it in the key, uh, what's called the Bass clef here. And it's in a major key. Uh, we don't need to know what the particular notes are, but let's look at this just for a moment because it's, it works well as a prototype of melody. It does something that a lot of melodies do. First of all, as you can see by the trajectory here, it's very conjunct, right? It's all a neighboring notes here. Uh, if you look at the German and the text, it has to do with xy. UHMM shroom and nearly Yonin the millions be embraced. And this I believe, is that sort of national anthem for the United Nations. So this, this has to be something that we can all see. And if you have conjunct motion, that makes it easier. It's also very symmetrical. As you can see, it's nothing but a pattern of four bars plus four bars plus four bars plus four bucks. And as we said before, music has a syntax so that these phrases have to be in a price range in a particular way. That makes sense. So we start out here with an opening phrase.

Speaker 5:          34:58          No, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

Speaker 1:          35:04          Is that the tonic dot. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          35:05          MMM.

Speaker 1:          35:08          Gained by seeing the tonic. Yeah. Yeah. The tonic is actually over here. It's a little bit lower than that. That was a really hard question and that is amazing that anybody got it. Good. Phew. So what happens here is this opening phrase it, we'll call a musicians like to label stuff just with alphabetical labels to keep it simple. We'll call this phrase a, it sort of opens things up and we refer to this as the antecedent frig. The next phrase be

Speaker 5:          35:39          a lot od Dadadadadada

Speaker 1:          35:41          very similar dot. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          35:43          Aw.

Speaker 1:          35:43          But here it takes the a deviation.

Speaker 5:          35:45          Dot Hot

Speaker 1:          35:47          and gets it back. Gets us back to the tonic. Now we could walk out the door at that point, right. Dot. Um, we've, we're feeling totally stable there. We've got an altogether for the rest of the day. However, it'd be a pretty short melody. So what he then does is write an extension. We'll call this c

Speaker 5:          36:03          yacht hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

Speaker 1:          36:08          Um, ah, very interesting. Put an asterix by this. Beethoven in a way saved this melody. He rescued this melody, which was in danger of becoming excessively s four square by doing, what if I had been writing it?

Speaker 5:          36:23          Todd Todd, Todd, Todd, Todd. Ah, Dadada.

Speaker 1:          36:29          What did Beethoven do here? We talked about it last time. ARRHYTHMIC device syncopation. He brings his opening note that f sharp in a beat early. This should, you would think would be a half note. And this would start on the down beat over here, but he brings in effect the sounds of the downbeat in a beat early. It gives it a little bit of pep there at that particular point. And then what is this here long

Speaker 5:          36:55          you thought? Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot tar. Tar Pop.

Speaker 1:          36:59          Well of course it's a replication of B. We've got to end on the tonic. All pieces of classical or pop one way or the other and on the tonic. Okay, so lets us, let's have us now for Moto over this. Let's all sing this. I think we don't have to read the note. You don't have to sing any text. We're just going to sing la all conduct in four. So sit back.

Speaker 7:          37:26          Well my mama ma ha ha ha ha ha ha.

Speaker 1:          37:29          I believe vocally prepared here. Here. Here we go. I'll give you one, two. Ready Sing,

Speaker 7:          37:38          la La la La Louder loud. Her La La la La la La la La la La la La la La la La la La la La la La la La la La la La la La la La la La la. La, la, la, la, la, la, la. We'll

Speaker 1:          38:20          put a big retard on it. Yeah. So we wanted to bang that syncopation. And then of course there's no sound on the downbeat over here to make the sake of patient shake a patient work. So that's the melody. It seem very simple. It took Beethoven a long time to sort of iron all this out and make this perfect melody, the prototypical melody in a way. And then, uh, in the, uh, early 18, 20. So you decided to incorporate this as the main theme of the last movement, the finale of his last symphony. So this is some of the last music that Beethoven wrote in the setting that we're about to listen to. So let's listen. We're not going to, I think Linda has it said here. We're going to hear the beginning of this and he prejudice it presents this as a series of eight or variation. So here is the first presentation of our melody. Nice and loud. That's okay.

Speaker 3:          39:39          And then he repeats C and B. Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:54          Okay. Now let's pause. Let's pause it right there. Now we're going to go onto the second presentation of the team and I have three questions for you as we do. So where has the theme of the Melody Gone here? Uh, well it's a, is this a motive or a theme, by the way? See, it's not a motive is way too, or was a good example of a theme. It's way too long for a motive. Motive would only go about four or five, six months. So we had this beautiful theme here. Um, and as we listened to this next presentation, where has the theme or Melody Golan, what instruments are playing at now? Uh, what is the texture? Like how many lines can you hear in this texture? How many strands of music do you hear? Can you pick up? And thirdly, what is this texture call? Last time we said we had three kinds of texture and music, which are monophonic. Homophonic can polyphonic which, uh, is this particular texture. Okay, here we go.

Speaker 3:          41:01          That's,

Speaker 1:          41:02          we should have an a previous, yeah, it should be, but that's the next variation. I confused. I confused Linda there.

Speaker 3:          41:13          Here. Great.

Speaker 1:          41:46          Let's just pause it there. So what do you think, how many lines? First of all, where's the melody gone? The scene.

Speaker 3:          41:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:55          It's gone up a little bit and it's being played by what instruments? Yeah. Strings, violins, violins. But not the top. Not The top part of the violence. Family kind of second violin, middle range of the strings here. How many parts do you hear in the, how many separate musical lines there? Marcus? Three. Tell us about those three. We've just talked about one of them, the melody and the violins up above. Can you tell us about some of the others?

Speaker 3:          42:22          Oh,

Speaker 1:          42:26          okay. They're doing like a counterpoint, right? They're doing it. Yeah. Okay. This is, uh, it's too easy. I'm sorry I had to go for that. Um, uh, it, uh, there they are playing a contrapuntal wall. But you're absolutely right. That's the key point. And that then answers mark list. What's the texture? If you got to cut Marcus please. Yeah. Polyphonic so this is polyphony here. What was the third voice? If we had melody up above and kind of a counterpoint, if Marcus says there in the middle, what was the, we had one other part and what was that? Well, let's listen to a little more. We've identified the melody. Let's just, can we just continue from where we are? Okay. Maybe, maybe you jumped ahead as I, as I told you to do. Yeah. No, it's mine, don't you? It's my fault, not yours. So we're going to back it up into that previous variation. Let's just see if we can pick up what the missing third part here. It's a bassoon playing the contrapuntal.

Speaker 3:          43:43          We'll just pause it there.

Speaker 1:          43:50          So what is the third part there? The base? Yeah. Usually in Mel you're going to have a melody. You're going to have a base. So the base is doing stuff.

Speaker 4:          44:00          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          44:13          Underneath here. Um, so there, there's the melody up above this bassoon playing the counterpoint, kind of in the middle. And then the bass player needs notes quietly underneath it. There's a little bit hard to hear. A little. I think we have time. Let's go. Let's just continue right from there a little bit more.

Speaker 3:          44:35          Can you hear the base now? There's the bassoon counterpoint and let's listen to just a little bit.

Speaker 1:          45:06          I'm gonna pause it there. Now let's listen to must be what? The third presentation here of the theme. Where's the theme now? Now, how many parts are there in the texture? Pause it right there. What about that? What's a little bit hard to tell exactly? Isn't it hard to tell? What could you say for sure about it? You've got a melody and where's it going now? Well, it's going up. It's all now in the first violins. What else is in there?

Speaker 3:          46:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          46:08          A base. Yeah, we've got a base and now we, what else? Some other stuff in the middle. And that's, that may be about as much as we can do with that. I mean really, uh, myself included. I could sort of sit there and try to track lines, but I'd have to repeat it. So I think if we said, oh, we got, we got melody, we've got theme, we got base, we've got a bunch of other stuff in the middle. That's just fine and dandy. But the idea that did it all kind of independent points out, once again, that they are playing polyphonic texture. Let's listen to the end of the polyphonic texture then Beethoven and we'll, we'll stop with this. It's Beethoven was like a military general. Interesting. The way he operated. It's setting up these battles and indeed he wrote something called the battle symphony.

Speaker 1:          46:50          And you can just see him how he's kind of marshaling particular forces to do particular things at particular time. So we kind of held back here, the heavy artillery, the heavy artillery in the orchestra is what the brass and sometimes percussion. So it's the brass he's going to bring in at this point. So we'll listen to the end of the third presentation of this with the contrapuntal idea, dominated by strings, melody, base, other stuff in the middle. And then he will bring in the brass for the final statement of this. And, uh, I think our time is about up. So we'll listen to this and you can kind of go out as we hear the, the fourth statement

Speaker 3:          47:28          [inaudible].
