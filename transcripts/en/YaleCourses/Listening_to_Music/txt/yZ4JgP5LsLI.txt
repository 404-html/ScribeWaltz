Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay, good morning. You are the last people left standing, right. I can tell you to beginning of the semester which of these lectures we'll have the lowest attendance rate and it's this one and I'll tell you where it's going to peak again as we get closer to the final exam. But you were the good folks. You're, you're here, you're sticking with it. So good for you. If you can make it the section on tonight and tomorrow, that's great too. What are we doing today? Well, last time we left off talking about opera in the 19th century and the session before that we were talking about the development of the piano in the 19th century. Today, what do we want to do? We're going to talk about the development of the symphony, specifically the symphony orchestra in the course of the 19th century and it did undergo significant changes as we will see.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Uh, what symphonies have we visited here in our course? Who can give me the name of the symphony that we have studied? Roger Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. We did a lot with at the very beginning of the class. And he any other symphony? Elizabeth Beethoven's six, which was the basis of the Saybrook concert. Any other symphonies? Uh, Angela Beethoven's night. Yes, we talked about that in an earlier lecture. Yadadadada odd, odd. Edd, Edd, EDD dating. So we've done a lot of Beethoven. Uh, we haven't [inaudible] the surprise of good, the surprise symphony of Joseph Hide. So we've done some Haydn, uh, anything else we haven't mentioned? Somebody I thought you might mention. Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Mozart. Okay. Mozart d minor symphony. So we've done Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven for the most part, but there's a lot of symphonic composition after these individuals extends into the early 20th century. And that's what we're going to track today. So today's lecture will generally be about the symphony from one animal to the other. M you hear about the three B's and music. While these are the two m's from Mozart to, uh, Gustaf. Moller let's start with Mozart. Let's play just a little bit of his decline and knock music a little night music. It's a, it's a sort of, uh, divertimento evening music for entertainment. Let's listen to a little bit about it and then I'll say something

Speaker 2:          02:28          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          02:49          Let's stop there. What can we say about that music? Well, we've talked a lot about this before. It's very pattern. It's very symmetrical. It's balanced. We have antecedent, consequent and they come into music with the classical period. What about the orchestra? Well, it's rather small in that it's dominated principally by the strings. And we had a couple of listening exercises where we'd see the strings play the themes and then the woodwinds maybe come back to echo them or to answer them. But most of the musical material is getting presented by the, by the strings. Um, the texture, well the texture is rather thin here because it's not a very big orchestra, a thin texture. And what can we say also about the texture? Well, it tends to be rather polyphonic I'm a phonic or monophonic well, in that case homophonic homophonic basically you've got a melody plus a company.

Speaker 1:          03:44          Um, and we could also say something. We've talked about that this music has a kind of rhetorical strategy to it. We have this idea of music. It sounds like a melody, sounds like a theme or music that sounds like it's coming between teams that leading a similar transitional music, um, music that may be a contrasting theme. Usually that ends a section. So it's music that does something, music that's trying to get us from point a to point B and point c and so on. So it's a sort of rhetorical music, teleological music, if you will. Uh, okay, now let's turn to a piece of romantic music. And before we do that, I'm going to say a thing or two about this, a romantic music. It's a piece, uh, by Tchaikovsky from his Romeo and Juliet. And I think we have the titles of the pieces that will be, uh, listening to on the board up there today.

Speaker 1:          04:39          So from his Romeo and Juliet, and you've probably heard this music before because it used to be a lot of it used to be used in cartoon music. You know, anytime there's a love seeing this particular music would, would come on. So what are its qualities here? Uh, well, first of all, it has a long sweeping that melody here in romantic music, long sweeping melody that is rather a symmetrical in shape. Instead of having neat units of two plus two plus two, it could go on over bars or maybe it'll be a seven bar phrase, something like that. So the melodies tend to be long. They tend to be asymmetrical rhythm. Think about rhythm in the music that we've been listening to. My paradigm here is the beginning of the Brandenburg fifth, uh, uh, con Concerto Grosso in which the rhythm starts out [inaudible] it's very regular. It's like a machine gun almost or a sewing machine or some kind of repetitive process there. When we get into the classical period, rhythm is somewhat more relaxed, but it is still a pattern Dum de team that Dah, Dah, Dah,

Speaker 3:          05:52          um, bom, bom, Bom, bom.

Speaker 1:          05:56          But here with this

Speaker 2:          05:57          music in the romantic period, the themes are not only long and asymmetrical, the rhythms don't seem to shake out in patterns that allow us to tap our feet or allow us to conduct it easily. So we have ties over bars. We have lots of syncopation. We have irregular phrasing, somewhat irregular, a metrical patterns as well. Tempo. We've talked a little bit about this before and this idea of tempo robot hoe here in romantic music, we get wild swings of tempo in that they can be coming along at a regular pace and then slow way, way down, and then speed up to get back on track and slow down and so on. And this is part in parcel parcel of the romantic aesthetic in the sense that it tends to swing wildly from one extreme to another wildly in terms of rhythm and wildly in terms of dynamics.

Speaker 2:          06:52          We can go from very, very quiet to very, very loud in a way that Mozart couldn't remember. We were talking about Mozart's piano, which weighed about one 10th of what this piano ways up here. This piano probably weighs about 800 pounds. Mozart's probably weighed about a hundred pounds, so this is much bigger instrument. You can play very quietly on it or you can make a huge sound. And same thing with the orchestra and we'll come back to that point today. Mozart header, a modest orchestra Mauler at the end of this period at a huge orchestra. So this allows for these wild swings. The romantic period is sort of a bipolar period, I guess in turn in terms of music in that regard. Okay. Having said that, let's listen to what we might call a prototypical moment in romantic music. Out of checkoff skis, overture to Romeo and Juliet. Now it starts to build a little bit of melodic sequence working on reaching higher and higher

Speaker 1:          08:51          and we'll phase it out there. So some really remarkable it's made possible by this newly enlarged orchestra. So let's talk about this orchestra for a moment and we're going to reference here our four food types or are for instrumental groups for uh, the, uh, for classical art music, starting with the strings, we don't really have any new instruments here in the romantic period. We still have basically the four string instruments of violin, viola, cello and double bass. But they are different. They're different from the or from the instrument that Mozart was playing. What happened? Well, in the 19th century, the construction of the violin was changed rather significantly. And I think I could just sort of hold my hand out here, maybe demonstrate this kind of thing. First of all, there was a higher bridge put on it. If you have the bridge holding up the strings in a an 18th century violin, it might be like that 19th century violent, like that higher bridge that allows you to have more tension. It puts more tension on, on the entire instrument. And at the same time, the strings that had been used, which were made of anybody have a sense of what violin strings in the 18th century were made up.

Speaker 1:          10:09          Um, Chelsea cat gut sometimes. Yes, yes. Animal lovers, cat gut more normally sheep guts. Okay. So she got, um, uh, and uh, they that wouldn't sustain the attention that could be put on that was not as great as if you were using a wire string. So in the 19th century to technological advances wire, strange, more tension, higher bridge, uh, and to co, well also the fingerboard was extended. It's longer. So oftentimes the strata of areas, they chop off the fingerboard and put another, a new finger board on it and put it all back together again. Um, what else? Uh,

Speaker 4:          10:49          I know I'm missing one other important thing. March. Well maybe that will have to do,

Speaker 1:          10:56          do it for the moment. And what would we end up? Oh, I know it was a boat. The bow, the bow. If you look at an 18th century bone, go to our collection of historical musical instruments on Hillhouse Avenue. The amount of horse hair there is rather narrow. It's almost double when you get to the 19th century boats. So the bow is bigger. So the whole thing is more powerful. And I've asked Jacob just to bring in his a viola, which is fundamentally a 19th century viola in construction. And just rip through a couple of things just to give you a sense of the volume of the instrument

Speaker 4:          11:28          playing it.

Speaker 1:          11:46          Okay. So that's all I wanted him to do. But just to give you a sense that's a big rich south play. A couple of, can you play a couple of chords, may, maybe the ending of something with double and triple stop. Too much volume.

Speaker 1:          12:06          Okay, so big powerful 19th century violin as opposed to the smaller one that Ma the Mozart had. Let's talk about the woodwinds here. In this family. New instruments were introduced. First of all, we have the Piccolo up at the top. We've heard the Piccolo before. Remember in the storm scene of the pastoral symphony number six of Beethoven storm scene, if you wanted to get a sense of the whistling wind up there and that's what he did, he had to pick a low point, way away a pie and you could hear it. There's kind of gave that effect. Uh, at the other end of the extreme, we have the double, uh, the contract or double bassoon being added, the low bassoon playing down an octave lower than a, is that correct, Linda planed down an octave or even lower than that.

Speaker 2:          12:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:52          It's enormous. And actually I think the bassoon, the contra pursuant plays lower than any instrument in the orchestra. Is that correct? In terms of actual frequency. So it's adding to the both the high and the low range of the, of the woodwind family. And a new instrument was introduced actually it had been around in certain quarters, a new instrument called the English horn. And I think we have that up there on our list of terms. Uh, is the English horn from England and is it a horn? No, it's actually from France and Germany. And it's a woodwind instrument. It's not a brass instrument at all. It's kind of a low or tenor oboe. So it's a kind of oboe in a tenor range, but it has a, a beautiful rich quality to it. And it's somewhat nostalgic quality. Arguably, the most famous English horn passage is the one that you're about to hear, uh, which comes from the slow movement of divorce shocks, New World Symphony, which as you might suspect, was written here in the United States actually in Spillville, Iowa in New York City and in Spillville, Iowa. So here's a little bit of the English horn solo out of the new World Symphony.

Speaker 1:          14:58          It's lovely. Lovely. It's funny about using 40 can do for you. My mother's family would actually from Iowa farm family, from Iowa and as a child they took me to spill. I would get in the car, we're going to get culture this afternoon, pneumo softball games. We're going for culture. So we went to Spillville. I can't hear that music without thinking of that particular family or those particular people in Iowa. It's weird. It's kind of a, as we said before, music is kind of an entry to the inner recesses of your memory sometimes, uh, in any of it. Aside from that discourteous, let us continue now with the brass family. Uh, we, what were the two instruments in the orchestra that we have encountered up to this point in terms of brass instruments? What have we heard? And in a symphony, Elizabeth, uh, the trumpet and the trombone.

Speaker 1:          15:46          Okay, fair enough. Trumpet and trombone. And there's one other important one that actually was in the orchestra before the trombone. Chris, the French Horn and employee. In fact that trumpet and French Horn, we're kind of in their first. Then Beethoven with the fifth symphony brings in the trombone, but it's not until the 19th century that the trombone gets added to the orchestra. Where does Beethoven do so? Well, he does it in the finale of his fifth symphony when he wants this particularly a powerful brass sound. So let's listen to the um, uh, opening of the finale of the fifth symphony where the trombones are brought into the orchestra for the first time for this particular effect.

Speaker 2:          16:33          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          17:26          So that's how Beethoven gets this kind of heroic effect. He's doing three things here in the finale. One switching from minor major, uh, he has it's very triadic theme and he's bringing in the heavy artillery, the newly invented heavy artillery, or at least newly introduced heavy artillery of the there. And it gives it this powerful, if you will in the vernacular sort of ballsy effect with that brass. And this got extended to the low brass as well. The one family and the brasses that we've talked about that we haven't really explained in terms of the history of the orchestra. Is the Tuba here? When does the Tuba get introduced? Well, it gets introduced right about this time, about 1825, 1830 or so. The first composer to use the Tuba, um, uh, in an orchestral piece was Hector barely o's in this San phony phone testes that we're going to be embracing and sections, uh, this week.

Speaker 1:          18:28          So we have the Tuba coming in here and actually it was, as you can see there, I'm originally an instrument called the office lead. It was a French instrument and barely owes heard this as a kind of giant key bugle in the military bands of the period. Think of the French Revolution. Think of the Nepal Napoleonic wars, all of these troops marching up and down with the brass bands along the showns, the lycee. He hears this, he brings US military instrument into the symphonic orchestra to add depth to the lower part of the brass. Says, let's go back to our divorce Jacques piece here. Divorce Jacques New World Symphony second movement. And here we can hear the uh, uh, the, the power and the depth of the newly enlarge brass section

Speaker 1:          19:48          by the two buttons. So that, that something of the Brass Group as an ensemble, let's think of these instruments individually. If we look back at a symphony by Mozart, not only is the orchestra stronger, but how he is using these brass instrument is very different. Uh, we looked at the French horn before and we're now going to focus on the French horn in the very beginning of our course, we had professional French horn just in here, eva heater, and she played. Does anybody remember anything of interest about the instrument that she played and how it differed from the modern French horn? What didn't that instrument have that the modern French horn has? Uh, Roger Keys.

Speaker 1:          20:32          Okay. Keys or valves. Yeah, that's it. Exactly. Keys or vows that gets put on the instrument. Uh, instead of sliding in these crooks and exchanging the length of pipe. That way they figured out a way of having vowels and you could do it quickly and with keys, but that's a century invention. 18th Century Horn, just kind of overblown and it could play some things such as data. I'm very easily repeated pitchers that [inaudible] at the top upon remember our horn concerto of Mozart or a bomb bomb bomb. It could overblow up the harmonic frequencies up the partials, as we said before, uh, with ease, but it couldn't play chromatic kinds of things. And as a result, it's kind of stuck there in the background, kind of providing what I'd like to think of as a sonic glue for the orchestra. But it rarely plays any solos in the orchestral fabric outside of the concerto. Well, let's see what happens to the French horn inside of the orchestra here in the 19th century where it begins to come forth as a solo instrument because the melody it can play is so much more complex and much more interesting. So here's a famous a French horn lick out of Brahms first symphony

Speaker 2:          22:08          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          22:59          back to the horns. Listen to the depths.

Speaker 1:          23:15          Okay, we're going to stop it there. So, so lovely passage, but it's featuring the brasses and particularly the Solo French horn. I guess the thing also did notice here it is how slow the music is going. Slowly, the music is really just cut of all slow down and kind of going at a crawl here. Um, and that's an interesting point about the whole 19th century notion of time and what they thought about time and the passage of time, you know, it, the early 19th century, beginning of the discovery of the whole discipline of paleontology and how old the earth was and how, how many years a civilization had existed and so on. And there's all getting extended and said Biblically, five to 7,000 years, now it's 25 million years, which of course has been greatly extended since then. But everything here is being allowed to slow down. And by way of reference, let's go back to our Mozart here and think about how he constructed it.

Speaker 2:          24:14          MMM.

Speaker 1:          24:20          Well there we had the, again, the beginning of Anna Karenina music and he has a chordal pattern. Triadic going up that pattern last about four seconds. If it bombed, two, three, four come down. One, two, three, four, four seconds on each court. He's moving through his material rather quickly and we'll say why in a moment. Now by way of contrast, let's go to music. Oh 60 or so later years or so later in the middle of the of the 19th century and focus on an overture by Wagner here overture to the flying Dutchman. Um, and we're going to listen to just the end of this insertive think about how long Wagner can sit on each chord. Mozart thought he could sit on each cord here for about four seconds. How long does Wagner sit on the court?

Speaker 2:          25:12          Okay. [inaudible] all one chord change another cord.

Speaker 5:          25:41          There's triadic notes in that one chord. Changes that to minor, just drops the third down. Same Chord. And now back to the original

Speaker 2:          25:53          holding that one.

Speaker 1:          25:56          Okay. Are we on the counter there? Nine 52 so we had 52 seconds of music there and we went through three chords. So we're averaging about 18 seconds per cord, something like that. Four or five times more than Mozart was doing. How can Wagner do that? How can Wagner do that? What's the difference? Why did Mozart have to move through his courts faster? What's happening in this music?

Speaker 1:          26:39          Supposing you've tried to play that Wagner music with Mozart orchestra, it wouldn't work. It wouldn't work. Once I had this dinky little orchestra, how many people were in Mozart's orchestra? Well, depends on where he was at a given time. Haydn's first orchestra had 16 people in it. Mozart, when he gave a concert in Vienna, usually wanted about 30 to 33. We would get to Beethoven. We're up to 50 to 60 in a typical Beethoven Ian Orchestra in Vienna, 1810 or so. As we move into the later part of the century, these orchestras keep adding more and more instruments, more and more players. You've got to balance, well, if you're gonna have all this brass, you've got a brown ones than with more string players. So we're getting up to 80, 90 a hundred by the end of the 19th century. So this, uh, this is, um, an important point. Mozart had a very small orchestra and as a result, or maybe, uh, he could get away with what he had because he had great musical ideas right? He had to have great musical ideas because the sound itself wasn't going to rescue him with Wagner and these later composers, they may not always have to have the greatest of musical ideas. The triad is not a particularly novel musical idea. Uh, but he can get away with just taking,

Speaker 1:          28:05          you can get away with doing that and it sounds great. I mean everybody, it didn't, we like that Wagner there and then it sounded terrific and it's just because he's got this huge orchestra sound per se is replacing musical idea, Mozart, terrific ideas, Wagner, terrific orchestra, and he knew how to, how to use it. So, uh, being an orchestra allows longer movements. I have said before, I think it is axiomatic and music, the more people you have on a stage or involved in performance, the longer that performance is going to take. And with regard to the symphony, how long does a movement within a Mozart symphony take? If you were to look at the cds appear of a Mozart Symphony, what would you guess first movement of Mozart's g minor symphony. How long does that go?

Speaker 1:          29:00          Yeah, who said that? I can't. Okay. Oscar says seven minutes. Yeah. And actually that's about right for the g minor symphony. It's ended up one of the shorter ones that most people will say five to 10 minutes, 10 minutes outside. If we get to Beethoven, how long will a movement of Beethoven take? Well, about 20 minutes. Uh, sometimes with his bigger symphonies, like three, five, and nine, when we get to, uh, um, Mahler and Brookner, the, um, uh, length of the movements can go on even more. And an entire symphony of Mahler might go on for an hour and a half. So these are bigger. The big orchestra has led to longer symphonies. Um, and the of obviously is very luxuriant, very opulent, uh, sound in music, probably never gets any more opulent than it does here at the end of the 19th century to other aspects involved here having to do with the physical world and in a way, technology of course, the 19th century as the period of the industrial revolution.

Speaker 1:          30:04          And some of these innovations, uh, in terms of metallurgy and a design got applied to musical instruments. For example, how many have ever played the flute in here? Okay. A number of people, both male and female. And if you look, I remember the video we saw of a baroque flute, it had actually had very rudimentary key pad on it and you look at a modern flute and he's got this kid system with all these things up there, all of the different keys and extenders and that's all an invention of the 19th century that it completely reconfigured the flute and how you play it in the 19th century. And we've talked about all these other instruments that got added. Uh, so I kind of, technological revolution was applied to musical instruments too. But the most interesting thing is, uh, when you got all these instruments together, how much sound they could make. Let's say you were in the 19th, you lived in the 19th century and you wanted to hear the biggest sound that could be made. What do you think you would do? Where would you hear the loudest sale? Um, Jennifer. An Oregon. Okay, that's good. That's pretty good. Um, uh, though it wouldn't have sounded as loud then as it does now because now we're using something else. I'll get to, but that's a good start. Okay. Anything else? Doesn't have to be musical.

Speaker 1:          31:32          What would get, what would give the biggest sound? Sarah.

Speaker 2:          31:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:40          I beg your pardon. Acoustics in music halls. Yeah, we're going to come to that. But just in the real world, you're in the city of London, what's going to annoy you the most? Make the biggest sale. Roger. A big, uh, possibly a bell. Yeah, but that's back when we've had those since the Middle Ages. I was thinking of two things. Cannons. PLO. Okay. Huge firepower there. Huge, loud sound, deafening war. And one other thing that came in the 19th century steam engines and all the things that it could produce, trains, steam, whistles, this kind of thing. But the third thing really is this orchestra. When all of these new instruments are coming together in such large numbers, and once you have them all together, you've got to have a place to put them. So they started building new concert halls and concert halls. A particularly good acoustically, the model for this, and I don't know if I put this yes, we did.

Speaker 1:          32:31          Okay. It's up there in the board. It's in Vienna, it's called the [inaudible] and it's a famous hall and it's a remarkable hall. Maybe the most perfect musical hall ever built. That was the prototype. And then other concert hall builders around the world began to adopt it. We adopted it here in the United States. Anybody think of a concert hall in the United States that is particularly famous and, uh, acoustically beautiful outside of Carnegie Hall that I'll talk about in a moment. What other one? There's one other, one, early concert hall in the United States Symphony Hall in Boston. If you're ever in Boston, anybody from Massachusetts here? Anybody been to symphony hall? Okay, go in there. It's a knockoff of the music for Ryan. So if you want to see what Vianna looks like, go to Symphony Hall in Boston. Uh, there's another one, uh, that, uh, is very close to us here. It's pretty close to the, this design and where is that built? About the same time.

Speaker 6:          33:35          Our Own

Speaker 1:          33:36          Woolsey Hall, a big hall seating about 2,500 people. Uh, if you're ever in Woolsey, notice the fundamentally rectangular design on it. Go in and look at the floor. It has a suspended floor there and it has a suspended floor for particular reason. That floor serves as a resonator and there are other resonators are around that we need to go into. But next time you're in Wellesley, go in and bounce because that's in on that floor. It's designed to have the sound resonate more. Now, what's the problem with Woolsey? Why don't, uh, string quartets like playing and wolves?

Speaker 6:          34:17          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          34:18          It's too booming. Okay. It's too resonant. But what was the model? The model is, it gets a Roger.

Speaker 6:          34:28          Okay,

Speaker 1:          34:28          well, it was partly built for the Oregon. Yeah. Shit. What's bills for the Oregon? But Woolsey Hall can sound absolutely marvelous for a symphony orchestra, not booming and not overly resonant. If what happens,

Speaker 6:          34:40          I'm Robert.

Speaker 1:          34:43          If it's full of people because people absorb sound. So all of the booming, there's the long reverberations cycle gets sucked out of it into our bodies, um, as sound absorbers and it produces is absolutely spectacular symphonic sound. So that was the model and that's enough. It's a great, and I was struck the other day when he went to Nashville, they've done the knockoff of the music for Ryan in Nashville in that Schermer Horn symphony hall down there too. It's, it's, it's, I mean it's, it's, it's brazen, but you know, uh, just take that design from Vienna and put it right there in the middle of Nashville. Pretty interesting. Okay. So that's another thing we have to kind of keep, keep track of. Carnegie Hall is a little bit different in terms of, of it's, it's designed. Um, all right, now let's take a look at what I call the main line here of symphonic composers. And it's mostly a German tradition, right? At German symphonic tradition. Uh, but that became the model for the United States and that's why they brought divorce Jacques here. Tchaikovsky came to the United States and was involved in, in the opening of Carnegie Hall in New York City in 1893, uh, as you can see running from Mozart down to Gustaf Moller not all of them were German. A woohoo up there is not German.

Speaker 6:          36:00          Roger Schakowsky

Speaker 1:          36:02          was from where? Russia. Who else is not German?

Speaker 6:          36:07          Uh, Oscar, I became pregnant. Um,

Speaker 1:          36:13          barely owes, oh yes. I'm sorry. Of course. Barely. I see. He's of course French. Uh, and we'll talk about it Hayman section tonight. Uh, anybody else? Well, divorce Jacques, he's check. Okay. So, but they are all in this fundamentally German educated tradition extending really from Bach in, but he didn't write symphonies into Mozart. Haydn, Beethoven down tomorrow. So we're going to go to the end of the line now and talk a little bit about Gustaf Moller and if you listen to ever heard a symphony of Mahler, if you've heard any music of Mahler, raise your hand.

Speaker 1:          36:47          Okay. I would say about a third of, of our class has, let's, um, uh, talk about that just for a moment. Uh, I would say if you haven't been introduced to Mahler, uh, don't miss this one. It's really great stuff and I hope to be able to convince you of that. Uh, here today. If you're, you're, you're kind enough to come along with this here in this trip along the road of high art music. Uh, and we don't want to miss the pinnacle in a way of high art music for me. These two m's are very important. Mozart and Mahler, they write some really astonishing music in different kinds of ways. So Gustaf Moller, who was he? Well, he was a Jew, born in Moravia, which is a section of checklists. The Voc Kia got his musical education in Vienna, was a pianist and principally a conductor. He earned his living conducting and he went all around the world conducting, and we'll talk more about that next time where, where he conducted.

Speaker 1:          37:44          Um, and he composed mostly in the summertime. He would go out to the Alps and one of these mountain retreats where you could have solitude and he would compose. And in the course of time, he wrote principally nine symphonies and something we're going to talk about next time, which is the orchestral song, but we're focusing on just one that symphony today. Indeed, his first symphony, 1888 it starts in an unusual way with a kind of homage to Beethoven, homage to Beethoven, because the beginning of this Mahler's first symphony sounds like the beginning of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, but let's just listen to a bit of it. Oftentimes with Mahler, people talk about the cosmic quality of Ma Maulers music. Well, what does that mean? What kind of sound is cosmic? Well, maybe it's kind of open. Maybe it's kind of hollow. Maybe it seems to endlessly spacey in that way. So here's a good example of of Mahler style particularly is cosmic style.

Speaker 2:          38:42          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          39:18          okay. We'll just stop it there. And those trumpets were sort of offstage trumpets perhaps giving you more sense of a far out distance. So that's the beginning of the first movement. And I've put this diagram up here because it's interesting that so much of the material that he is working with derives from a particular complex, a particular cell of material. Mauler is a developer, and that's generally speaking what this German mainline tradition is into. Not always. Schakowsky is not a developer. He has trouble when it comes to developing themes. But Beethoven, Mozart of developer, Beethoven is a developer. Brahms is a developer. Mauler is a developer. And what they develop is a, as I say, a nexus of musical material. So this here is the initial idea. Um, and we can go back to our technique. He all team Paul, be minute, we'll go back down to the palm palm, which we'll loop back to the tonic. So we could have one more x down here, but it's the same x is up there. All right? So that's, that's the essential motive of the first movement. Uh, let's go on to hear just a little bit of the second movement, which is a delightful scared. So here of the first symphony of Mahler, just the scared. So,

Speaker 2:          40:43          hmm. All right. Just enough of that.

Speaker 1:          40:58          And now we're going to go into a very strange movement. The third movement, the slow movement, and bring symphonies. We usually have fast, slow, scared. So fast finale. Well, in the late 18th, early 19th century, sometimes they'd switched those. They put the scare. So number two, and then Z, sketch of minuet number two, and then the slow movement number three. So here we got the slow movement is number three. Let's listen to a bit of it. See if you can recognize the melody that Maulers working with here. Okay, let's pause it here. I saw a smile come over Jacob's face out there. Um, Jacob,

Speaker 2:          41:57          okay.

Speaker 1:          41:58          [inaudible] Shaka or in German? Bruder Martin, brother Martin. Forever a shock. Uh, but what happened to, to brother Martin or for Frere Jacques here, he got zapped into the minor. Okay, so this is a kind of gloomy forever Shaka. It's a weird, uh, a movement in, in a way. It's taking the familiar and making it weirdly unfamiliar. So that's what happens here in the, uh, uh, slow third movement. Now we're going to pass on to the, uh, uh, fourth movement because that's the big ticket item for today, this morning. And I think we have time to cover it. Um, it's going to start out with this gigantic kind of opening fireworks of just pure orchestral sound and introduction. And then a couple of themes we'll crop out.

Speaker 3:          42:48          Did he mean bom, Bom, Bom, Bom,

Speaker 1:          42:52          um, and then a little bit later,

Speaker 3:          42:54          even bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, bom, Bom, bom.

Speaker 1:          42:59          So we have these two themes here that would be working with, and we'll pick up some of the themes a little bit later on. So let's hear in all get, get ready for a big explosion here. The beginning of the finale.

Speaker 2:          43:15          [inaudible] [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible], [inaudible] [inaudible], we'll

Speaker 1:          44:32          can phase that out. So that's the first, the material there. Uh, and you have the, using the same kind of exiting process that we began of course with, we can make use of it here to kind of track a, remember these particular themes. Uh, myself, I can't always hear them, but if I can visualize him, it helps me. All right, so we're going to now go on to the second theme area. He's essentially following our Sonata Allegro form here. Um, and we have a long passage. It goes on for about three minutes, but it's a quintessential moment of romantic music. It's along the same lines of the checkoff ski that we've heard before. So let's just start out here and we'll listen and we'll comment on what's romantic about the music that we're hearing. End of end of transition here comes to theme. All right, let's just pause it here for a second. What's romantic about that?

Speaker 2:          46:16          Go on. So listen.

Speaker 1:          46:19          Okay. Yeah, it's a lot of Smyrna notes, whether that, yeah, it kind of inspires us to romance. I'm not really sure, but it's not precise. It's not marching along. It's not discrete frequencies. Now, what instrument is carrying the melody here is particularly good at that kind of, oh, what's the germ German word in Vienna? Schlog goober or something like that for whipped cream kind of sound. Probably some German native Germany's in here. Can tell me. Um, uh, Elizabeth, what instrument is playing that? The violins, and this is a, this is it, because the violence had this capacity for Bronto and the slide between pitches, it gives us this kind of romantic effect. So it's not, it's not marching along at any kind of precise way here. Um, all right. So that's my principle point of warm, lush string sale. Let's go on.

Speaker 2:          47:13          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          47:17          Uh, okay. So we jumped ahead to the next rather than pausing. You know, that's my, that's my, that's my, that's my, uh, uh, prob, well, I tell you what, that's okay. Uh, we're getting close to end of things any way. Um, none of the, I think, uh, we really have only about two minutes left and I do want it to, everybody was good enough to show up on time, so I'm going to let you leave on time. Uh, let's go, just to give you a sense of the sound here. Let's go to the very end of this. So let's go to, if you would please, around 1630. Uh, it's a long moment, about 20 minutes to, as long we got about two minutes, two, three minutes to go. Uh, and you're going to hear this extreme or Castro contrast here, uh, as it gets bigger and bigger. Notice that we had a minor theme here. The same theme comes back, but he takes out all of the chromatic minor sound and makes it all major and we're going to get lots of heroic trumpet's going up with that addition to our theme. Think about this. This I'd like to think of as the last gasp of the, uh, traditional high art classical orchestra. It never got any better than this. It never got any bigger than this for reasons that will maybe comment on after. So let's listen and in one comment at the end,

Speaker 2:          48:46          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          51:11          and one final thought. Why did it stop here? Why did, what happened in the history of art, music to change everything? Anybody have any idea?

Speaker 6:          51:24          Uh, Daniel,

Speaker 1:          51:27          exactly. That's what happened. Electronically produced sound where you could control, you can control the decibel level and reproduce it. People started staying home and playing recordings and they could manipulate the volume anyway they wanted at that particular point. Okay. Thanks for staying on a have a great break. We may hope see it sections tonight, uh, and Friday and Monday when you get back.
