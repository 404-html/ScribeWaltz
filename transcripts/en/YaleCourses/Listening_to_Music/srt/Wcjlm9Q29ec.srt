1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,950
All right. Let us begin. Let us

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,560
look. Turn down the music of Charles
ours. We'll come back to Charles,

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,170
but let us begin with her.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,340
Uh, discussion of musical form,
continuing our discussion, musical form.

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,400
Last time we talked
really about three forms.

6
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:22,401
We talked about verse and Chorus in
Popular Music and we had wonderful

7
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:27,411
presentation by Frederick Evans and I
hope you came away with the following that

8
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:31,410
in dealing with verse and
chorus basically leak,

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,090
you have the same material you have to
say musical material coming back again

10
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:38,340
and again and again with the chorus,

11
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:42,210
we actually have the same text coming
back again and again and again.

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,480
But with the verses,
although the music is the same,

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,660
the texts keeps changing each time we
get new stroll fees are new versus of

14
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:53,850
tech. So keep that in mind.
Verse, Chorus, verse, Chorus.

15
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,890
Sometimes this can start with the course.

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,790
Sometimes there's a harmonic change in
here that we would call, uh, the bridge.

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,390
But essentially it's the repetition of
the same material over and over again in

18
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:07,500
terms of the music. But in terms of
the text, you get new texts each time.

19
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,980
For the verses.
We also talked about the

20
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,690
simplest of all of these musical
forms ternary form, right?

21
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:18,960
And that was simply this idea of
statement, contrast statement.

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,370
A be a very straightforward,
not too much. We need, uh,

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,360
do with that.

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,740
Today we're going to go on and
talk about theme and variations.

25
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,960
And with regard to all three of these,

26
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,990
I should say that all three
of these forms are very old.

27
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,010
I could go back into the Middle
Ages and get a response, sorry,

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,430
of the Middle Ages that is in a be a form.

29
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,020
I could go back into the
middle ages and pray,

30
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,000
bring up an early 15th
century English Carol.

31
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,180
That's inverse and chorus form.

32
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,190
I could go back into the Middle Ages and
find you instrumental pieces that are

33
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,990
in theme and variation form.
So these three are very old now.

34
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,970
The fourth one that we talked about,

35
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,830
Sonata Allegro form is an,
is adventitious,

36
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:10,650
is something constructed
in the 18th century,

37
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:12,870
adventitious to the 18th century.

38
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,950
So it was something put together in some
that measure by Joseph Haydn and then

39
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:21,060
passed on to his good friend
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. So eight.

40
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,650
So Sonata Allegro form,

41
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:26,850
this big complex musical form is a
little bit different than the other.

42
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,050
It's a lot younger.

43
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:32,790
It's a lot newer beginning with the
period of classical music, Mozart,

44
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,590
Haydn, and Beethoven. All right.
With that, by way of a, um,

45
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,370
uh, introduction, let's go
back to Sonata Allegro form.

46
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:44,910
We said that was the largest,
the most complex of these musical form.

47
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,100
Why are we dealing with this?
Well, next a week from Saturday,

48
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,180
we will go to this concert and we will
sit there and we will listen to pieces on

49
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:57,450
this concert.
The opening piece will be in Sonata,

50
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:59,920
allegro form it be by Mozart.

51
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,240
Then we will have a piece by Johan is
Brahms in theme and variation form.

52
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,530
Then we will have a symphony
by Beethoven in five movements.

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,880
It's an exception and we'll explain why
when we get to it in five movements. But,

54
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,470
uh,
within those movements,

55
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:18,340
we have a couple of instances
of Sonata Allegro form,

56
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:22,180
a couple of instances of theme and
variation form and one instance of ternary

57
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:25,690
form.
So all of these forms will be necessary.

58
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:30,691
We will have to understand how these forms
work in order for us to really engage

59
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:35,050
that particular particular concert.
For example,

60
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,160
you'll be asked to write a review of
that concert and I was thinking this

61
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,510
morning, well I kind of mediocre review
would say well in the middle of the first

62
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:47,500
movement of the Beethoven piece and we
once again we wouldn't call it a song in

63
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:52,000
the middle of the Beethoven a synth
first one was a Beethoven symphony.

64
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,420
Things seem to be disorganized.

65
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,130
What I'd like to hear there is,
well in the development section,

66
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,020
in the development section of the first
movement of the Beethoven Symphony,

67
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:05,830
uh,

68
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:10,830
it seemed disorganized because the
counterpoint was not clear because the

69
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:17,680
imitative entries of the parts
was not clearly articulated.

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,540
And that would be a much more specific
sort of response to the music and much

71
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,510
more educated if you will,
response to the music.

72
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,140
So that's where we're going with all
this to kind of sort of get you to think

73
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:33,820
about precisely where you are and
precisely what should be happening.

74
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:38,020
And then is it really happening the
way it should be? Yeah. As said,

75
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:41,800
so not allegro form is the most difficult
of these and it takes a little extra

76
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:43,150
time to get familiar with it.

77
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,270
We're going to be reviewing this
in section starting this evening.

78
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,010
And don't forget we have this model
of what Sonata Allegro Form Is.

79
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,900
It didn't want to put that up on
the board again, did that last time,

80
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,930
but you've got it on page
one 93 of your textbook.

81
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,620
If you weren't that complex
diagram one 93 of your textbook.

82
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:07,450
So get familiar with that and do once
again bring your books to section. Uh,

83
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,480
this time cause we'll need
him in section this time.

84
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,750
So we've got this complex
form and I've thought,

85
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:16,240
I've figured out over the years the,
the,

86
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,900
the way to sort of wrap your arms
around this or get into this,

87
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,610
understand this and it, it, it,

88
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,850
it involves the fact that music in the
classical period is what we would call

89
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,340
rhetorical music. It's doing something
at every moment. It is doing,

90
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:38,110
as I see it, one of four theme
things. It's presenting a theme.

91
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,590
So we'll have a,
what we call a thematic function.

92
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,880
It's moving from point a to point B.

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,990
Remember with the Beethoven,
that's the opening theme.

94
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:51,170
And then the second theme is [inaudible].

95
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,320
Those are both themes that stating
something that we can sing that we can

96
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,040
remember,
but they don't,

97
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:03,290
it has to get from point a to point B,

98
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,830
the more lyrical major.
So he writes a transition.

99
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,660
So the second functional type
here is transitional music.

100
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,220
We want to be able to differentiate
thematic music from transitional music.

101
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,810
Then there are passages
and in Sonata allegro form,

102
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,860
it's in the middle of the movement
that are exclusively developmental,

103
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,350
where you take the
material and play with it,

104
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:29,870
you can make it expand it
and change it that way.

105
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:33,020
You could shorten it as Beethoven
often doesn't work with just particular

106
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,710
motives. Uh, it tends
to sound very complex.

107
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:41,330
There's a lot going on in the development
section. It's the most polyphonic,

108
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,770
most contrapuntal counterpoint
polyphony sort of synonymous, uh,

109
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:49,490
the most complex in terms of the
counterpoint. And as we said before,

110
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,510
it tends to move around a lot because
they pass the, the composer's,

111
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:56,030
we'll pass through different
keys in the development section.

112
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,100
So we've got so far,

113
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,780
three of what we call the four functional
types or what I have called the four

114
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:06,440
functional type steam attic,
transitional, developmental,

115
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,690
and now we have to talk
about the last one,

116
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:13,400
which is the simplest in some ways
cadential where the composure,

117
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:17,150
we'll just throw on a lot of of heavy,

118
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,180
simple harmonic motion to slow
the music down psychologically,

119
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,260
not the tempo actually,

120
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:29,261
but psychologically sort of bring it
to a close so we can say a closing

121
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:34,130
functional type again to review thematic,
transitional,

122
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:36,470
developmental and cadential.

123
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,390
Those are our four functional types. It
will show up with any movement of Sonata.

124
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:42,830
Allegro form question

125
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,300
cadential that with a w it was that it
that it's Daniel, is that right? Yeah.

126
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,870
Yeah. How do you spell that? Oh,
well just take Kayden's C, a,

127
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:55,320
d e n s,

128
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,080
c e and turn it into cadential t I. A. L.

129
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,650
I don't know if my spell checker
kicks that word back or not,

130
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,600
but we use that term in music a lot.
You know,

131
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:10,190
this was a cadential gesture
and suggesting that we're
going to get into the end

132
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:14,240
of something. So it, I remember we
had cadence been the end of a phrase.

133
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:17,450
Well it's just the end of it and have
a section here. Any other questions?

134
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:20,480
That was a good question. All
right, so to get rolling with this,

135
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:22,610
let's listen to some music now.
Enough talk from me.

136
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:27,050
Let's get listened to some music and I'm
going to play for excerpts here mostly

137
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:32,051
here again for Mozart for excerpts and
you see if you can identify which of the

138
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:35,960
functional types is in play
here. Okay, Linda, here we go.

139
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,890
Okay, we're going to stop there.
Let's review just for a moment,

140
00:09:06,891 --> 00:09:08,960
how do you tell these folks all types?
Well,

141
00:09:08,961 --> 00:09:12,260
what are you looking for here
listening for? With thematic,

142
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,950
you want to be able to kind of singer or
you recognize it as something that you

143
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:16,910
could walk out of here.

144
00:09:16,911 --> 00:09:21,830
Hammad so something that's that you can
sort of take with you. A transitional,

145
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,520
this idea of a little bit
unsettled in lots of motion.

146
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,020
Uh, cadential as I say, that's
probably the easiest because
bump, bump, bump, bump,

147
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:34,370
bump, bump, bump, bump, bom, Bom,
bom, bom, something like that.

148
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:39,371
Bringing it to an end and developmental
is going to be rather a complex,

149
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:43,310
lots of counterpoint and going on. So
let's go, let's go back to the beginning.

150
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:44,980
I messing up Linda here again,

151
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,160
but let's go back to oh seven there
and we'll start all over with this.

152
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,060
With that in mind,

153
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,173
okay?

154
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,763
Yeah.

155
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,060
Okay. So that's number one.
Here's extract number two.

156
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,410
Okay.
Yeah,

157
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,080
an expert number three.

158
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,013
Okay.

159
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,160
And number four.

160
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,530
All right, let's go back now.
Let's hear one, one more time,

161
00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:53,710
and then we're gonna ask for a volunteer
to take a stab at which of the four

162
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:56,470
functional types you think this is okay.
Number one.

163
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,010
Okay.

164
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,430
Stop right there. So what brave
soul, we'll take this one on.

165
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,913
Uh,

166
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,833
sorry,

167
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:36,470
Carolyn, please. Transitional. Uh,

168
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,010
that is correct. Yes, that's correct.
Now what, what did you hear there?

169
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:42,590
And there's hard to play the whole
thing again, but what were you thinking?

170
00:12:42,591 --> 00:12:46,430
What came, what, why did
you jump to that conclusion?

171
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,953
Wow.

172
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,700
Okay. At the end of it, it
did kind of slow down. You
had a sense of arrival there.

173
00:12:57,701 --> 00:13:00,700
There was lots of motion, there was
lots of movement. Lots of movement,

174
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,080
and then at the end, a sense of arrival.
All right. We've arrived at a new,

175
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:07,750
and probably a theme is going to
come in at the, at that point.

176
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:11,710
So that is in fact a
transition. Let's listen to, uh,

177
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,490
once again to excerpt number
two here. If we could, Linda,

178
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,783
sorry,

179
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,640
because it's, it seems a
lot of, um, a lot of, uh,

180
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,720
um, we're not going to kind of in the
base and it's really the bleeding into the

181
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:53,290
descending melodic sequence of melody.
It's coming to a close

182
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,190
bump. Okay. I think the key
there is it's very monotonous.

183
00:13:58,191 --> 00:14:01,010
You use the word monotonous.
It's very monotonous in a debate.

184
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:06,040
Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, bom,

185
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,540
or something like that. As the
melody cascades down, I guess it,

186
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,740
but listening to the base there,

187
00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:14,080
you can tell them that's just a
very monotonous harmonic pattern.

188
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:18,030
So harmonic patterns in
cadential passages here.

189
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,560
Cadential functional type tend to be,
as Frederick says, monotonous. Okay,

190
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,510
let's go on to number three now.

191
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,633
Stop

192
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,720
and Q. That one again. So
what do you think about,
about that name please? Roger.

193
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,510
Okay. Faraway. Roger. Thematic, right?

194
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,900
Can you sing it?
Play it again for Roger,

195
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,670
but really putting Roger on the spot here
this morning. But let's, let's see. Uh,

196
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,370
if you don't have to be,

197
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,700
I'll play it.
The candle.

198
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,420
Okay. So that's it. Okay. Right. Just
as I just played it. So, all right,

199
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:24,340
so that is a melody. Let's cue that
again. And just while we're at this,

200
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,000
notice what Mozart does with his
melody after giving it to us,

201
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,510
sort of does some very interesting,
I think so.

202
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,440
So let's have the beginning of that
same number three again, please.

203
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,910
So here's our lovely melody,
major or minor,

204
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,810
major sweet.
Sounds delightful.

205
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,660
Now watch what he does
here. Just drops. If though,

206
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,480
just the little twist in mind,
same melody,

207
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,060
which is lowering that
third degree of the scale.

208
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,000
Okay? So that's a good example of, um,

209
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,460
see Madec functional type here is
extract number four. What about this one?

210
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,860
And we'll, we'll just stop it there and
you can go onto to the next one. Well,

211
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:51,694
what about that one?

212
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:52,943
Yeah,

213
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,950
yeah.
Go for the obvious answer here.

214
00:16:55,951 --> 00:17:00,900
It's going to be named please
later. What? I beg your pardon?

215
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,470
Developmental and why, what
did you will, uh, yeah,

216
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:07,890
because it's the only one that left,
et Cetera, et cetera. But, but did you,

217
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:09,260
could you,
uh,

218
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,070
tell us something that you heard there
that sort of backs that up or confirms

219
00:17:14,071 --> 00:17:18,240
that it is developmental?
Yeah.

220
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:23,190
Many threads weaving it in
a t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t,

221
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,370
t, t, t, t,

222
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:31,020
all sort of simultaneously many
different ideas happening simultaneously.

223
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,200
Typical of the complexity
of the development section.

224
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,790
We've got some more on the tape here.

225
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,740
We're not going to go through to them
quite socially. Let's play one more. Uh,

226
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,380
it could be any one of the four.
Here's another one. Number five.

227
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,610
I think it's still on track.
Track three zero 37.

228
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,180
Okay. Take her, is there

229
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,880
a name please?

230
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:20,570
I should know this young lady
right in front of Thaddeus.

231
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,730
You had your hand up
first. Oh, Mary Pat. Okay.

232
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,590
It was transitional. Uh, and it just
the one hearing that's awfully good,

233
00:18:29,591 --> 00:18:34,510
but you could hear it kind of
bill yet. T t t t t t t t t
t t t. T. T. T, t, t, t, t,

234
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:35,530
t, t, t, t, t,

235
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,850
and then it stopped as if it had
arrived at the end of the transition.

236
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:44,590
The musical journey was over. So that
was transitional. Here's another one.

237
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:52,950
[inaudible]

238
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,440
takers there.

239
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,030
Oh, thirtyish. Okay. Was
Developmental. Excellent.

240
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,740
Then I guess once again, lots
of things going on there. Uh,

241
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:36,190
probably developmental and
transitional may sound most similar.

242
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,250
They're probably the two that are most
difficult to differentiate thematic.

243
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,960
Yeah, you can kind of remember
that as a melody credential,

244
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:46,910
probably pretty straight forward. Um, uh,

245
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,660
so there's a tendency with two confused,

246
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,270
the transitional and the developmental.

247
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:54,250
It's just that there's
oftentimes a developmental,

248
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:57,160
a lot more counterpoint going on.
All right.

249
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,740
One last one here and
then we'll stop this.

250
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:12,060
[inaudible].

251
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,053
Okay.
Nobody's

252
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,830
driving that sucker into the ground
with it. Sort of the sledge hammer,

253
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:47,010
but cadential ending there.
Okay. So that should help you.

254
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,440
We get the sections this week we're
going to be playing pieces and sort of

255
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:53,710
having you track along where
we are in Sonata Allegro form.

256
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,360
Let's turn our attention now
unless they're questions.
Any questions about that?

257
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,320
If not, let's turn our attention
now to theme and variation.

258
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:03,930
We're moving on to theme
and variation form,

259
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,510
which we will also need for our
concerts a week from Saturday. Here.

260
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:11,950
What we have is not this sort of complex
organic mixture of many different

261
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:15,310
themes. First theme, second theme,
concluding theme and things like that.

262
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,800
We have one theme usually,

263
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,940
usually just one thing and we will get
that theme and then we will get that

264
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:26,560
theme again with something changed and
then we will get that material again with

265
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:29,440
something change.
And again with something changed.

266
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:34,030
So think of this as a kind of series
of boxcars on the railroad train or

267
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:37,870
something like that.
Units more or less the same size,

268
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,080
but each of those boxcars going to look
a little bit different as it goes by

269
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:43,510
because it might have a
little different logo on it,

270
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:48,340
a little bit of different
ornamental material on it.
All right, so we're going to,

271
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,670
uh, uh, let's see for time, maybe,

272
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,440
maybe I'll will not do the ivs.
We were going to pull it out.

273
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:59,500
Maybe we will have a little bit of
a theme demon variations. Again,

274
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:03,700
it goes all the way back to
the Middle Ages. Uh, and it,

275
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,660
they tend to be written on
the rather simple themes,

276
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:11,500
particularly patriotic themes. Maybe I
was thinking about this the other day,

277
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:14,620
maybe because patriotic
themes are pretty simple.

278
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,720
So the simpler the theme,

279
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,820
the more likely that theme is to be
come the basis of a set of theme and

280
00:22:21,821 --> 00:22:22,810
variations.

281
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,430
Maybe it gives the composer
more freedom to pursue. Now,

282
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:32,200
I think I brought in some
variations of Beethoven on God.

283
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:35,530
Save the king. Yeah, here we go.

284
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:39,940
So here's Beethoven writing God,
save the king. And here it started.

285
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,703
Yeah.

286
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,830
All right, so very simple tune. And
then he writes a set of variations.

287
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,880
Here's variation one.

288
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:08,410
So there's that tune now in the late 19th,
early 20th century.

289
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:11,770
Yale's own Charles Ives and
he gives classes, let me know.

290
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,480
Oh Nay. 1898, something like that.

291
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:20,350
He used to be the organist and the
the first church, the green here.

292
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:21,250
So this is jails.

293
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:26,251
Most famous classical composer wrote
a set of variations on this same tune,

294
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,010
but they sound a little bit different
because it's closer to the modern period

295
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,420
and they're performed here on an organ.
So Charles Ives variations on America

296
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,880
[inaudible]

297
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,460
talk about a long reverberation time.
How long it took that organ sound,

298
00:24:15,461 --> 00:24:17,280
the clear that church.
Um,

299
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,780
so that was written right here in new
haven by our own Charles Ives. But again,

300
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:26,500
the point is that it's a very
simple idea to rather simple tune.

301
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,910
Here's another simple
tune that Mozart used. Uh,

302
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,860
its original title was variations
on [inaudible] Mama. Oh,

303
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,160
let me tell you Mama. And
it's the, it's a story of a,

304
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,060
of a young woman who has gone to the
big city and unfortunately lost her

305
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,140
virginity.

306
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:48,580
But we know this tune not
with that French text,

307
00:24:48,581 --> 00:24:51,850
that Mozart first learned it with,
but this way.

308
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,053
Okay.

309
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,480
Okay. So that, that's the tune.

310
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:07,220
But originally it was a kind of French
popular popular song going back into at

311
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:09,710
least the 18th century.
Uh,

312
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,650
how many different titles
can we give to this?

313
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,750
What do you know this ash?

314
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:17,280
Cool.

315
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,500
Twinkle, twinkle little
star. Anything else?

316
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,070
What bad ba black sheep didn't.

317
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:27,870
Sesame street used to use letters
with it. A, B, c, d. Dot. A, B,

318
00:25:27,871 --> 00:25:32,610
c, d. And so, so it's gotten a
lot of traction over the years.

319
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,260
Uh,
and here's the melody

320
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,750
and here's the first variation.
Now my question to you,

321
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:42,940
is this with theme and variation,

322
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,660
the components or can keep the theme
more or less exactly as it is and change

323
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:51,670
the context around it or
he can change the theme.

324
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,570
So which does Mozart doing the first one?
Very,

325
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,123
oh

326
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,013
yeah.

327
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,640
Thoughts about that?
Is he changing the,

328
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,380
the theme or is it keeping the team
exactly the same and and changing stuff

329
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:18,990
around it? What do you think? Well,

330
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,660
what he's doing is changing the theme.
The theme would go

331
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,910
right at the beginning instead of I get,

332
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,860
so there's only really one note that's
that's that relates to the theme there

333
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,873
and then,

334
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,933
well no,
I get,

335
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,040
so he's sort of changing the theme by
making the notes go quicker and Warner

336
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,450
many around those notes.
So that's a variation one.

337
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,890
Now what variation too? Does he change
the theme or does it just changed the,

338
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:48,420
all the stuff around the theme

339
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,160
and so on.
So what's he doing there,

340
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,603
Caroline?

341
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:24,980
Changing what? I'm sorry.
Couldn't hear. Changing the
context. Changing the context.

342
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:29,540
The theme in the right hand
stays exactly the same. Uh,

343
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:32,240
okay.
Here is the next one.

344
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,090
What's that?
Well it goes with this.

345
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,920
So has he changed the theme?
Yeah,

346
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:55,220
he's changed the theme rather
considerably there. Indeed.

347
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,700
We wouldn't know that that had anything
to do with twinkle twinkle little star

348
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
unless we had had given to his
previously as we have the melody.

349
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,320
So we are hearing in our inner ear.
Yeah.

350
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,260
Ah, ah, ah,

351
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,060
ah,
ah.

352
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:26,550
So we know that's the basis of this and
if he wants to deviate from that we can

353
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:27,181
still say,
oh yeah,

354
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:30,570
that's related to that is getting rid of
the far away from the original because

355
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:34,500
we were sort of locked in
the original in our mind,

356
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:39,550
in our ear at that point.
Uh, here is, um, oh,

357
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:43,410
let's, yeah, let's skip that one.
We don't need it here. What happens?

358
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,520
What happens here?

359
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,740
Is the theme changed or is it still there?

360
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,540
Uh, and the context changed. And what
rhythmic device is Mozart using here?

361
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:24,580
So did he change the theme there?
Well,

362
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:28,630
basically no, except just a little
bit because he was doing what to it.

363
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,270
Okay.

364
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:35,920
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump,
bomp using, take a patient.

365
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,520
So he was syncopating the theme,
Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, bom,

366
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:44,680
that kind of, and he did one other
little fill up here, if you will,

367
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,200
in what we might call the
B section of the tune.

368
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,450
The tune originally went

369
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,473
and now it's going.

370
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,503
And then

371
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:08,340
so what's he done to the melody?
Anybody here that went

372
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,060
Oscar?
Yeah.

373
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:19,820
Yeah. He's filled in the notes
of a diatonic major scale.

374
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,540
The other nodes, the black key notes.
You're making it a chromatic scale season.

375
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,820
Enriched it a little bit by
means of chromaticism. All right,

376
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,640
let's go into another
variation by Mozart here.

377
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,110
What's the texture of this variation?

378
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,353
MMM.

379
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,090
So you think about the texture of that

380
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,110
homophonic monophonic or polyphonic.
Polyphonic yeah.

381
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,620
Was the imitative or non imitative?
Here's the beginning.

382
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,080
Okay.

383
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,920
Imitate.
Right.

384
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:33,540
So this is actually a kind of throwback
to the sound of Bach and this is what we

385
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:37,990
will be engaging when we come to the fume.
It's like Mozart trying to write, uh,

386
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,220
in a few goal way here
with lots of imitation.

387
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,340
And what happened to the
mode in this variation?

388
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:47,970
Okay.

389
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,910
Well as you're running it up as a scale,
but what kind of scale? Minor scale.

390
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,010
Okay. Um, and then oddly the final,

391
00:32:01,011 --> 00:32:05,450
the final variation. A, what does he
do to the meter in this last variation?

392
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,260
What happens there?
We were going to king.

393
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,860
Ooh.
So what's he done to the meter?

394
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,780
Okay,

395
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,430
well let me strip away the bay.

396
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:48,760
He's changed it to football
by throwing in extra bar,

397
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:53,761
a filler in between each
of his basic Dupo beads.

398
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,380
Then we come to, uh, maybe, okay. Uh,

399
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,730
let me just cut to the chase here
at the end of this. He's coming in.

400
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,850
What's this? All the way to the end
now. What do we call this formally

401
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,060
about that with regard
to Sonata Allegro form,

402
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,920
it was one of the parts
that shows up also.

403
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:39,920
It's another leg reform has nothing
to do really with the theme here.

404
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:43,700
It is a good example of a, a Coda, right?

405
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:46,530
Just something thrown on at
the end to say this is the end.

406
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,570
What's he doing here? What
is this? How complex is this?

407
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,450
It's just

408
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:07,520
day major trial.
He's just automating a major triumph.

409
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,780
So it's a good more credential stuff.
Sort of very simple material at the end.

410
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,380
Okay. Our guest artist is here. I see
him at the back can show. Come on up.

411
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,560
We're going to do another piece for you
and we're going to talk about a little

412
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:22,070
bit about Kensho. Very interesting guy.
How many of you know Kensho Watanabe?

413
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,870
Seen Kensho around, uh,
who's seen Ken show?

414
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:32,040
In what context?
Oh,

415
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:34,800
he's in my biochemistry
class. All right. Yeah. Cool.

416
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,540
So that means he does hardcore sciences
and you must too. Good for you. You're,

417
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:42,560
you're better. Far better man
than I. Um, all right. So yeah,

418
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,330
hardcore sciences, um, uh,

419
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:49,020
anybody else know can show from
other contexts. Yeah. Atlanta,

420
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,830
he's in the YSL.
What does he do in the YSL?

421
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,470
You seem sitting all the way to the back.
No,

422
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:58,910
you seemed sitting all
the way up at the front.

423
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:01,370
He's the concert master
of the wire. So, uh,

424
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,800
anybody else know Ken
on a different context?

425
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:07,100
Any members of [inaudible] Lee
College here? Anybody from Berkeley?

426
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:13,070
Nobody from Berkeley. That's a statistical
improbability. Uh, but, uh, uh,

427
00:35:13,071 --> 00:35:14,240
you're the conductor of the,

428
00:35:14,241 --> 00:35:17,390
one of the conductors of the Berkeley
Chamber Orchestra, right? Yeah.

429
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,770
So he's a conductor to,

430
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,470
which is kind of astonishing because
he's not really not a very good musician.

431
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:27,460
He doesn't really know very much about
music. Can show what note is that.

432
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,480
Yeah. What note is this?
But no, it is this.

433
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,050
Yeah. So he has a very keen
sense of absolute pitch,

434
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:44,360
which, uh, it really helps you
out if you're a music legend.

435
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,430
He was to say as we will be,
we'll be talking more about this.

436
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,140
One person in 10,000 has this
particular guest gift statistically.

437
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,820
So He's a very impressive guy.

438
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,970
And he's also in the five
year m a a B a program,

439
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,060
right? Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, at the
end of four years here, in addition,

440
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:05,440
taking all these heavy
duty science classes, uh,

441
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,430
he's been across the street and you're
going to get an inmate in music at the

442
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:11,280
same time. I don't know. He was, he
was a couple of minutes late today.

443
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,400
And you said he hadn't gotten much sleep.
And I can sure as heck understand why.

444
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,360
Uh, all right, so we have, uh, a
Kensho. What are you up to this year?

445
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,890
Everybody can come see you,
um, on, uh, what would that be?

446
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:27,800
The 31st of the, of of October. Yeah.

447
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,190
Yes. So the, that you
don't want to miss, right?

448
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,910
And you kind of have to put that together
and maybe that's why you haven't been

449
00:36:32,911 --> 00:36:37,020
getting much sleep. So you're
putting that together, uh, and tell,

450
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:40,200
and I know that you've
got a concert coming up,

451
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,030
and if for some reason,

452
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,200
God forbid we can't make it to our
concert on the 18th or makeup concert,

453
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:49,680
could very well be the one on the 19th.
Don't you have a concert on the 19th? Yes.

454
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,163
Yeah.

455
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:56,360
So if you want to hear Kensho conduct,
uh,

456
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,770
you could do that on the 19th of October.
All right,

457
00:36:59,771 --> 00:37:03,040
so we've got a piece here and I
don't want to get too far behind. Uh,

458
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:06,540
it's a piece by Correlly.
It's based on, uh,

459
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,380
a melody and a base pattern
melody and a base pattern.

460
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,230
And, uh, we'll play through little
bits of it here and then, uh,

461
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,160
we're going to play the whole thing. Uh,
do we need to tune again when you think?

462
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,023
Yeah.
Okay.

463
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:43,460
Okay. We've tuned the four strings of
the violin. We'll play just a little bit.

464
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,710
We're going to take this
section by section, Jacob Peery.

465
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:47,750
He's going to point things out
as we go along a little bit.

466
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,320
Not the most gorgeous sound
I've ever heard. It's amazing.

467
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:22,640
But do you have any idea how long it takes
to produce a sound like that? I mean,

468
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:26,210
how many years of just sitting there?
When did you start playing the violin?

469
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,290
When I was almost three. Almost three.
So you were a late bloomer that,

470
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,710
uh,
and you probably so busy with things,

471
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,770
but when you were really
focusing exclusively on this,

472
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:40,630
how many hours a day would you practice?

473
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:45,220
And that was really focusing to
pilot three hours a day, Max for me.

474
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:46,870
I was saying what I'm saying,
if you go to conserve it,

475
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,850
it's because you got so many
other demands on your time.

476
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,040
Are you playing any solos
around here this year?

477
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:55,470
I should have asked that
question. A little recital.
Second smells. Okay. All right.

478
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,680
Well we'll keep our eye out for that. All
right. So that's the theme. Uh, and then,

479
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:04,960
um, on, uh, in variation to the piano
will play the, the down beat and, uh,

480
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:07,660
the violin plays off the beat.
I think for reasons of time,

481
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:10,750
we won't do that when though.
Kensho. Let's go to number three.

482
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:14,830
Where are we good to get a good
example of Staccato in the music,

483
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,240
sort of short pointed notes.

484
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:34,980
Okay. So we'll stop there. So when
you hear Ken show playing Staccato,

485
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:39,840
then you know that we are in variation.
Three variation,

486
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,200
uh, for uh, we've got, he's
playing 16th notes. Uh,

487
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,540
so it's going to go fairly fast
here I guess, or maybe not,

488
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:51,980
but he's got a lot too.
He's got a lot to do here in variation for

489
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,400
okay.

490
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,950
So he's really, uh, there's
going to be workout from me.

491
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:16,600
I hope I can keep up with this
lead today. Uh, all right then. Uh,

492
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,961
yes,

493
00:40:16,961 --> 00:40:20,830
the one who sort of scares me is variation
five because then he plays the theme

494
00:40:20,831 --> 00:40:24,520
and I have all of this fast
stuff underneath. Let's just
do a little bit of that.

495
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,880
Okay.

496
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,000
How'd that the air, the lovely,
lovely theme there. That will,

497
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:50,001
number six is sort of fun because the
interest here is in the base of the piano.

498
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:54,310
It's a good example of something we'll
be talking a lot about in our course

499
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,070
walking babies. Um, so it, it,

500
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:02,970
the notes are all for the most part
contiguous and they all come in the same,

501
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:07,020
no value. In this case, the eighth
notes, it'd be here's the beat and the,

502
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:17,260
and then he plays the melody against that.
Uh,

503
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:22,010
number seven,
we have the violin playing arpeggios.

504
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:25,250
We've talked about that.
So here's some Arpeggios in the violin.

505
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,273
Huh?

506
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,530
That's, that'll give
you a sense of that. Uh,

507
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:46,000
number eight is a tricky one for us
to keeping it together because of the

508
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:48,670
triplet patterns.
So let's do a little bit with that.

509
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:16,910
And then nine, we have a sort of an
interlude. It's like a transition.

510
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,130
10 we're not going to do
anything with right now. Uh,

511
00:42:21,131 --> 00:42:25,760
the violin plays harmony while there's
a kind of fast pattern underneath 11.

512
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:29,540
There's a lot of, oh 11 is sort of my
favorite, but it's, it's a, it's a,

513
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,380
it's a tricky one because of the
syncopation between the two instruments.

514
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,930
So that's kind of a fun
one. Um, and let's see,

515
00:43:03,931 --> 00:43:07,560
we need to tell them
also. Uh, I like number,

516
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:11,070
maybe it's number 13 is really my favorite
because I got a very simple theme to

517
00:43:11,071 --> 00:43:14,220
play in. He has to work like
crazy. And toward the end of that,

518
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,330
he's playing triple stops. You know, uh,

519
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,230
it's not that the violin
just plays one line.

520
00:43:19,231 --> 00:43:21,660
The violin can play two
notes at the same time.

521
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,310
It can play three notes at the same time.

522
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:28,290
And if you really rip across and shift
quickly or just move your boat quickly

523
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:30,930
across the strings, you can give
the impression of four pitches.

524
00:43:30,931 --> 00:43:32,410
But they all four have to be in tune.

525
00:43:32,411 --> 00:43:35,580
So you gotta have four fingers usually
in four different spots and that's hard

526
00:43:35,581 --> 00:43:38,490
to do. You want to play it a triple
or quadruple stopped for him.

527
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,370
There's just to any old where,
yeah,

528
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,730
so when you hear those chords, if violin
playing court, oh, that's easy, you know,

529
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:53,190
on a piano or whatever it is,

530
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:55,860
that's easy on the piano.

531
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,130
That's hard on the string instruments
cause you've got to get four different

532
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:03,600
fingers in four different spots there.
Each of those notes have to be adjusted,

533
00:44:03,601 --> 00:44:06,560
just fractionally, just right for
it to stay in tune. When he does it,

534
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:11,130
you think it's very simple, right? Easy
to do takes years to be able to do that.

535
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:16,680
Uh, questions before we launch
into this, any questions?

536
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:19,440
So we're going to do the whole
thing for you, and it'd be patient.

537
00:44:19,441 --> 00:44:23,420
We're going to run over just a little
bit today, but believe me, the, uh,

538
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,710
particularly the end,
you'll like it.

539
00:44:25,711 --> 00:44:30,711
So Ken Sho Watanabi playing theme and
variations on Carollee's tune and base La

540
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,073
Folia.

541
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:57,743
Yeah,

542
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,593
no.

543
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,613
Okay.

544
00:47:57,830 --> 00:47:58,663
Okay.

545
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,273
Yeah.

546
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:58,993
Hmm.

547
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,840
Wrong page up here. And I
was feeling sorry. Okay.

548
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:09,530
I think we need, okay. Now we are back
to the, I had the goal page. Okay.

549
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:17,300
You stood

550
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,830
on it. I'm very sorry.
We found it. Okay. We,

551
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:24,080
we had just have all these pages
and Igor rives sometimes. Sorry.

552
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:28,633
Okay.

553
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,613
Yeah,

554
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,973
yeah.

555
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:49,910
Great. Great. Me just to
be able to play with a guy.

556
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,170
Thank you so much. Thank you
so much. Beautiful. Beautiful.
