1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,620
Okay. Good Morning Ladies and
gentlemen. My name is Craig Wright,

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,890
and this is listening to music and most
basic course that the department of

3
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:14,580
music has to offer. It's aim is to
teach you how to listen to music.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,770
Wait a minute, you say that's
preposterous. I listened
to music all the time.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,510
I got what?
My iPod,

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,340
I downloading MP three files
continually swapping files.

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,160
Uh, I've gotten my car. Uh, what, what did
we call those things in the automobile?

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,620
Where you, is it a dat tape that you
can take your iPod and plug it into the,

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,060
you're the stereo system in your car?
I've got that. I listened to music,

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,740
my dorm room off my computer
and the bookstore, wherever.

11
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:45,030
I Bet I listened to a lot more
music than you do. You old goat.

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,050
Uh, and, and you're
right. You probably do.

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,010
But what kind of music are
you listening to? Well,

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,250
probably pop music and that's fine.
That's okay. Fair enough. Pop Music.

15
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,290
But are you getting the most out
of this particular experience?

16
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:05,700
Are you getting the most out
of your listening experience?

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,760
I contend that perhaps you are not,
that,

18
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,620
that you are not maximizing the time
using that time most profitably.

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,020
A,
how do I know this?

20
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:20,550
What makes me think that you are not
getting as much as you possibly can out of

21
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,020
your music? Well experienced
to some degree, but also, uh,

22
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:28,500
an experiment that I did just last
weekend. I have four children.

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,530
The last of the four has now turned 17.

24
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,400
So I said last weekend, Chris, he's,
you know, always with the IPAD. Chris,

25
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,660
what are you listening to? Go Away.
You're bothering that kind of thing.

26
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,470
You're ruining my life again.
So, uh, but uh, come on, let,

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,710
let me listen to this. Let me,
this is, what are you listening to?

28
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:48,120
So I listened to it and I said,
all right,

29
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:52,310
here you listen to this and tell me
what you're hearing. And what did,

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,510
what was he tracking?
He was tracking the text.

31
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,010
He was tracking the beat of the
peace. I ask him, well, what,

32
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:02,310
what's the mode of the piece?
What's the meter of the piece?

33
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,650
What's the base doing?
Can you follow the baseline there?

34
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,180
Can you identify any chords in this
particular piece? Nothing. Zero.

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,600
And this from a reasonably sophisticated
kid who's had 12 years of serious cello

36
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:18,480
lessons. And that brings up, I suppose,

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,970
a point,
uh,

38
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,240
that although I don't know
much about your music,

39
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,300
I think I can teach you a great deal
about your music by using the paradigms of

40
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:34,530
classical music. So we were talking a lot
about classical music in here, Mozart,

41
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:38,490
Bach, Beethoven. It will
be the locus of our course.

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,750
How many of you already
listen to classical music?
Raise your hand. Okay, great.

43
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,100
A lot of you, and that's wonderful. I'd be
interested to know, gentlemen down here,

44
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,430
how do you do this?
Is it streaming off of your computer?

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,780
Are you downloading MP three
files and saving them? How?
Tell me how do you do it?

46
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,950
You go to youtube. All right, very
interesting. I should have known that,

47
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:02,110
but I didn't.
You go to youtube and you listen there.

48
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:07,150
Anybody else do it a different
way? Yes. On the radio.

49
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:11,710
Okay, that's interesting.
We'll come, we'll come back
to that point. Anything else?

50
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:16,360
Anybody? Yes. Okay. Your
parents' cds or records.

51
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,640
That's wonderful.
They have sort of the old technology here,

52
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:23,570
but some of those old, old recordings
might be, uh, a very, uh, very, very, uh,

53
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,930
good.
Now here's a question for you.

54
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:31,110
Why would we want to listen to
classical music? Why do, why, uh,

55
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,030
who, who just answered
the question for me here,

56
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,430
those folks that raised your hand, what
a gentlemen here again, I'll pay your,

57
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,120
your, my sacrificial lamb this morning.
Uh, why do you like to listen to,

58
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:44,830
why would you want to listen
to classical music? Okay,

59
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,780
very interesting. Um, national
public radio asked exactly this,

60
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,470
uh, this question in a
survey a year or so ago,

61
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,740
and they got the following
principle responses back.

62
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,230
Why do people listen to classical music?
One,

63
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,160
it helps them relax and relieve
stress. So that's, this is,

64
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,320
this is perhaps the principle
reason to helps us center the mind,

65
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,110
allowing the listener to concentrate.
Three,

66
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,290
classical music provides a vision of a
better world vision of a better world,

67
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:22,330
a refuge of beauty, of majesty,
perhaps of even of, of love.

68
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:24,490
And sometimes,
at least for me personally,

69
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,840
it suggests that there might be
something out there, God or whatever,

70
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,240
bigger than ourselves.

71
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,800
And it asks us to think
sometimes think about things.

72
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,080
Uh, the, that's what I think these great
fine arts do great literature, poetry,

73
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,760
painting, music. They show
what human beings can be,

74
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:48,130
the capacity of the human spirit.

75
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,210
They suggest to us as indicated.
Maybe there is something,

76
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,800
a larger spirit out there,

77
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:57,670
then our sales and they get us to think
they could get me to think frequently

78
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:02,650
about what I'm doing on this earth.
What are you doing on this earth? No,

79
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,983
don't answer that.

80
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,890
What am I doing on this earth with
regard to this particular course?

81
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,780
What am I trying to accomplish in here?
Uh,

82
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,420
well maybe two things.
One,

83
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,040
change your personality,
change your personality.

84
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,110
I want to make you a richer person,

85
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,830
a broader person by instilling you with,
uh,

86
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:29,860
an an ending,

87
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,390
a deep and abiding understanding
of classical music.

88
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:38,860
So that's part of this. And not just here
for Yale, but for your life after Yale.

89
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,810
Uh, I would hope that how you
lead your life 10 years from now,

90
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,400
20 years from now,
30 years from now,

91
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,410
would have been significantly influenced
by this particular experience in this

92
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:54,910
course. And secondly, if I'm
successful in my teaching,

93
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,940
I will accomplish this second aim here
I will impart to you a love of classical

94
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,960
music you through later on you after Yale,

95
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:10,340
your attendance at concerts, buying
one fashion or another, downloading MP,

96
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:13,490
three files with iTunes or
whatever it happens to be.

97
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,100
Maybe being members of your local
symphony board, opera companies,

98
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:20,480
something like that, may be giving
music lessons to your children.

99
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,640
You will become the purveyors of
classical music thereafter. You,

100
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:26,710
the intelligentsia,

101
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,720
the next generation will be those that
preserve this great treasure of western

102
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:37,160
culture. And it is a great
treasure of Western culture.

103
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,950
Okay,
how are we going to do all of this?

104
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:44,210
How are we going to accomplish these
two things on our list of agenda here?

105
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,290
Uh, what are the mechanics of the
course? Did you all get a syllabus?

106
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,440
Everybody's got a syllabus. I should
have brought one up here, but I didn't,

107
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:54,500
it doesn't matter. Uh, first
three, four weeks or so,

108
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:57,500
we'll be following the elements of music,
rhythm,

109
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,100
melody and harmony,
and then a test.

110
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,610
Next we will deal with what's the most,

111
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,440
arguably the single most important thing
when we listened to any piece of music.

112
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:12,860
And that is it's musical form.
Here's a question for you.

113
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:16,580
I was thinking about this the other day
or so preparing the lecture for today.

114
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,180
What's the most common type of musical
form in pop music when you listen to pop

115
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:24,920
music? Do you ever think
about the form of the music?

116
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:32,050
Can anybody name a form of pop music?
Any one for him?

117
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,400
Yeah.

118
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,960
Well maybe verse and chorus. Think
about that. That shows up a lot,

119
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,460
a lot of stuff.
And we'll come back to that.

120
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:43,070
We'll talk about version of course
when we get to the issue of form. Uh,

121
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,160
and then toward the end of the course
we will turn to the question of musical

122
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:53,620
style. How does a piece of Pop music
differ from a piece of classical music?

123
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:55,570
We sort of all know this intuitively,

124
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,900
but can we articulate why this particular
difference about musical style was

125
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,800
driven home to me the other days. Last
Friday I was walking across the campus.

126
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:08,890
Maybe you saw this to
corner of Elm and college.

127
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:13,780
There's a large flat bed truck out there
and there were these people on this

128
00:08:13,781 --> 00:08:18,530
truck getting you trying to
sell you audio equipment. Uh,

129
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,680
and they had a big banner up there.
It said pump up your room. Okay,

130
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,450
so then to encourage
you to pump up the room,

131
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,080
they had music playing and this is the
kind of music that they had on that

132
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:32,980
flatbed truck.

133
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,040
Okay. So I'm feeling, feeling

134
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,040
very pumped up at that particular point

135
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,860
and my cell phone rings.
Okay, this is true.

136
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,040
My cell phone rings and because one has
the capacity now days to select your own

137
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,240
ringtone. Right? I have mine
selected not to that sound,

138
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,440
but to Mozart.
So I hear this sound on my telephone.

139
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,830
Linda's moving this around here,
just a second.

140
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:17,970
And it will give us a sense of the
difference in style between pop music and

141
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:21,240
classical music. How does this,
but what we're here differ,

142
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:24,900
can you give me say three or four reasons
why what we're about to hear differs

143
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:26,250
from what we just heard.

144
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,720
Okay.
Mozart

145
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,120
[inaudible].

146
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,190
Okay. Let's just stop right there
and you can go onto the next. Uh,

147
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,050
can anyone tell me what, what's
different difference between these two?

148
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,660
What's the Po, what did the Depop
piece that it's rave till dawn.

149
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,380
That's my own, that album. I'll have, you
know, rave till dawn. Gentlemen back here.

150
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,843
Okay.

151
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:10,580
Uh, yes, that's probably true. That's
probably true as a general observation,

152
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:13,550
whether it comes through clearly
on these two, this comparison,

153
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,850
I'm not quite so sure. Uh, but they're,

154
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,490
I wouldn't say there's a great
deal of detail in the first one.

155
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:23,390
There's a lot of repetition. That's
where I, you know, once that gets going,

156
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:27,890
it goes for a long period of time.
Anything else? Yes. Oh, melody.

157
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:32,710
Which one had the melody?
Yeah. [inaudible] Tata.

158
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,890
Tata. The first I couldn't pick out
any melody at all. It was all what?

159
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,860
Rhythm and beat.
Okay.

160
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,420
So repetitious rhythm beats
strong pulsation to it. Uh,

161
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:48,260
what was making that sound?
What were the instruments playing in the,

162
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,200
okay.
In the Mozart there were violin,

163
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:57,201
so acoustical instruments as a as opposed
to synthetic sound with regard to the

164
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:58,950
pop music.

165
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,420
So what we will be doing
is differentiating pop
from classical and also

166
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:08,280
differentiating within styles of classical
music. You're driving down the road,

167
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,060
you who was the FM listener over there,

168
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:14,640
you turn on your radio,

169
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:18,540
your car radio to your FM
classical music station.

170
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,480
And what number approximately
would you go to?

171
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,980
Okay,

172
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,730
yeah. Or anywhere your
home camp edition. Okay.

173
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,810
98 that's pretty high. What
to what town is that? We will,

174
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,100
oh that's Chicago. Well they're
elevated people in Chicago and sure.

175
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,570
Normally normally where you go is
all the way down in the low numbers,

176
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:47,571
particularly here in Connecticut it's
a 89.5 90.1 90.5 my favorite is 91.5

177
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,410
generally speaking,
you want to find a classical music,

178
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:56,410
you go to the left of your FM dial and
fish around down there and your national

179
00:11:56,411 --> 00:12:00,130
public radio. Okay, so that's how we do
it. But you've got your car radio going.

180
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,430
Music comes on.
Is it broke or romantic?

181
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,670
Is it medieval or modern is a
Bach or is it Beethoven? Well,

182
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,320
those sorts of answers,

183
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:11,680
those sorts of issues of the sorts of
things that we'll get to when we come to

184
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:16,390
the question of musical style toward
the end of the course. Okay. Materials,

185
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,990
materials.
A textbook here is the textbook.

186
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,780
It is my own textbook listening to music.
Now in the fifth edition.

187
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,830
Uh, I'm very proud of it actually. It's
used across all across the United States.

188
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,390
Uh, it used across the world about to
come out in a Chinese edition for Heaven's

189
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:37,450
sakes. Um, what was it?

190
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,470
It was simply my lecture notes from
this particular course that I've been

191
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:44,200
teaching here for a long time.
I had these lecture notes.

192
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:47,560
I had all of these listening exercises.
Basically just put it in a textbook.

193
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:51,430
So this is all material for Yale students,
you know,

194
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:56,490
material design here at Yale for Yale
students at the back of the book,

195
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,100
I think I took mine out, but the back of
the book you will see wrapped with it,

196
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,090
an intro CD introductory CT might be
interested to know that a lot of the

197
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:08,320
material, they're actually recorded by
Yale undergraduates. We paid them for it.

198
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,510
We paid people across
the street school music,

199
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,880
but this again is kind of
native local Yale produce here.

200
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,970
So we have to hit,

201
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,970
we get the textbook and then with the
textbook we recommend getting access to

202
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:23,260
this six CD set.

203
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:28,180
This material will be necessary to do
the listening exercises for the course,

204
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,850
which is sort of the
backbone of the course.

205
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:35,851
There are a couple of copies of this on
reserve in the music library and you can

206
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:40,210
go over there inside of of
Sterling Memorial Library
and do the listening there

207
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:41,044
if you want.

208
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,920
But one way or another you got to get
ahold of this if you decide to buy it.

209
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:49,921
It has one particular virtue and that is
you end up with an excellent library of

210
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:55,030
classical music that will
last you for a lifetime.

211
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,190
Years after the fact.

212
00:13:57,191 --> 00:14:01,870
I get email from emails from students
nowadays, they usually begin,

213
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,700
hey professor or yo professor,
something like this.

214
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,230
I lost CD four to my six CD set.

215
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,290
Can you get me a replacement?
Yes I can.

216
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:19,090
And I do send them a replacement. Not
too hard to do. Send them a replacement.

217
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,230
So if you get the CD set,

218
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:23,080
not only do you get a wonderful
beginning library of classical music,

219
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,560
but in effect you get a lifestyle
lifetime service contract with it.

220
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:34,270
Uh, okay. Requirements. You
can see this on the sheets too.

221
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:38,200
You've got the couple of tests here.
We have to write a short music paper.

222
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:40,300
We're all going to go to the concert.
I concert,

223
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:42,040
I think this year we're going to go here.
The Saybrook,

224
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,230
a youth orchestra and I put
on the, uh, a sheet this year.

225
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:51,370
I think I'm going to try to
count 5% for class participation.

226
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,940
We will be taking attendance
in the lecture. Yeah, I
know it's babies. I'm sorry,

227
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,700
but I take this very seriously.
I really do.

228
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,920
It's my lifeblood.
And I want you to take this seriously too.

229
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:08,390
I want you to come to class. I want
you to come, come to lectures. Um,

230
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,240
so we have the two lectures
each week that you'll come to.

231
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,880
Sections are also also mandatory.

232
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:17,840
We have three wonderful
specially selected a in here.

233
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:21,170
We'll introduce you to the next time.
So come to two lectures,

234
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:25,370
one section and do the work regularly.
Now sections,

235
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,350
they start on Thursday and go through a
Monday cycle. They do not start tonight.

236
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,610
They start next Thursday in the cycle.
You can go online and sign up there,

237
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,570
but you're still shopping. So we're not
starting sections tonight. You may not,

238
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:43,100
may or may not be taking this course.
Do the assignments,

239
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:45,620
these listening exercises on time.

240
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,160
Music is an orally perceived phenomena.

241
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,170
Music isn't orally perceived phenomena.

242
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:55,880
You can't cram information about music,

243
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:59,480
the sound of music into your
head the night before a test,

244
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,510
the way you might be able to in an
English course or a history course.

245
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,580
Uh,
the way we hear music,

246
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:10,850
the way our mind processes music is very,

247
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:15,410
very different from this
other kind of information, uh,

248
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,400
very different from history or
economics to make this point.

249
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,580
Let me see if we can get my helper here,

250
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:27,080
technical person to bring up a slide
for me. And my question to you is,

251
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,240
as this slide comes up,
is the following, uh,

252
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,750
where in the brain is
music processed primarily?

253
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,670
Where, where do we process?
Anybody know the answer to that?

254
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,040
You buy take psychology courses and
a neurobiological courses. Yeah,

255
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,880
she had a lady out here.
Do you have a sense of that

256
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,540
left side of the brain that sounds like
the old, maybe the old creativity theory.

257
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,360
Uh, could we, and that's possible.
Um, uh, in, in a way it's, it's,

258
00:16:58,361 --> 00:17:02,780
it's correct. Um, oh. Anything more
specific? All right. Here's our brain.

259
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:04,910
We took this off of the Internet.
All right.

260
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:08,990
That's why it's all in French because
it's not copyrighted and we have to be

261
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:11,750
careful with that in here with these
camera rolling. Camera's rolling.

262
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,710
So we have the 12
separate browser on that.

263
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,290
It just means the brain stem and
the cerebellum and then the t,

264
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:22,830
the temporal lobe, the frontal lobe,
the parietal and the occipital lobe.

265
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,400
So where is music and language process?

266
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,380
Anybody here's just
somebody raising your hand.

267
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,333
Wow.

268
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,900
Yes. The temporal lobe is
where your hearing goes on.

269
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:39,110
It doesn't matter whether you're hearing
language or whether you're hearing

270
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:39,944
music.

271
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:45,070
Most of the processing happens
in the primary auditory cortex,

272
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,130
both left and right of the temporal lobe.
If you're factoring in,

273
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:52,800
let's say I had to remember to
play something at the keyboard,

274
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,120
well there I might be factoring in the
frontal lobe because much of the short

275
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:59,010
term memory in particular
is in the frontal lobe.

276
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,800
Let's say I went to play a piece.

277
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,610
I didn't think about that
actually a minute ago.

278
00:18:09,611 --> 00:18:12,250
I didn't even know what he's going
to play, but I remembered that.

279
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,730
Am I thinking back then? Oil starts
and see and let's get you up there.

280
00:18:15,731 --> 00:18:19,900
It's got a G. No, it's like athletes.
It's muscle memory. You know,

281
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,010
you do that 8 billion times in your
life and you can hit a good top spin

282
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:25,300
backhand a,

283
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:29,200
it's muscle memory and that happens in
the Perry that's mostly in the perinatal

284
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,390
here. I've got a score
up here. If I'm looking,

285
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,310
then I've got the visual cortex engaged.
So doing music, if I'm sight reading,

286
00:18:36,311 --> 00:18:40,450
playing, it's a very complex thing, but
most of the, let's shut this down there.

287
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:41,470
We'll go back to the other screen.

288
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,680
Most of this music and language
processing happens in the,

289
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,510
the, as I mentioned, the left
and right auditory cortex. Um,

290
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,020
therefore, where am I going
with all this? Therefore,

291
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,690
the pedagogical techniques
that we use in teaching,

292
00:19:01,691 --> 00:19:05,650
listening to music are virtually
identical to those that we use in teaching

293
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,790
language.

294
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,980
There's a great deal of similarity here
because it's just processing sound. Uh,

295
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:11,741
this was a point,

296
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:15,070
I was listening to some national
public radio thing the other day.

297
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:20,120
Can you get my screen back up full
size here so I can see this? Um, uh,

298
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,790
listening to something that had a
psychologist talking about the correlation

299
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:28,060
between sound and music and they said it
was something about music is sometimes

300
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:31,630
very strange, sometimes very
strange, sometimes very strange,

301
00:19:31,631 --> 00:19:34,690
sometimes very strange.
The, the, the, the,

302
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,830
the TTP and that sort of brought
home to me, the Texas irrelevant.

303
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,250
The idea that music really is sound
and that language is just sounds,

304
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,310
it's a very thin line between the two,

305
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,810
but we therefore used the same pedagogical
methods in the sense that we've got

306
00:19:49,811 --> 00:19:51,790
to do the following.

307
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,900
If you ever read the course descriptions
of French one 15 or Chinese language

308
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:59,980
basic intro to Chinese, they say,
I think I wrote it down here. Uh,

309
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,560
this process of gradual assimilation.
Yes,

310
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,600
daily participation in language
labs required. So daily,

311
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,170
daily is the key thing here. You've
got to do this gradual assimilation.

312
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,770
So learning to listen to music is
just like listening to language.

313
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:16,240
We've got to do a little bit every day.

314
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:20,560
You got to turn in these listening
exercises in a regular fashion and come to

315
00:20:20,561 --> 00:20:22,930
class.
This is a beginning course.

316
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,530
I assume that you know nothing starting
from ground zero here and build it up.

317
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,760
Uh, alright. I've talked,
I've droned on here.

318
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,710
Let me ask you if you have questions
about, uh, the course generally.

319
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,660
Do you have questions of me at this point?

320
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,600
Yes.
Gentleman in the back,

321
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,550
the formats of the tests will be
very clearly laid out for you.

322
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:52,360
There'll be a little bit of written work,
there'll be a fair amount of listening.

323
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:52,870
Uh,

324
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,980
you will be given a list of pieces that
you'll have to prepare for a little bit

325
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:59,890
and then we will play out of the,
out of those particular pieces.

326
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,290
But most importantly,
I will give you a prep sheet.

327
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,340
Each test comes in advance with a prep
sheet telling you how to get ready for

328
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:10,750
that particular test. Good. Good question
though. Thank you. Anything else?

329
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,190
Okay. If not, let's go onto the following.

330
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,240
We're going to have a diagnostic quiz in
here. We're taking a quiz the first day.

331
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,820
Now that's on the back
of your hand out there.

332
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,900
This is not really a quiz cause we're not
gonna. We're not gonna collect it. Uh,

333
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,780
you can throw it away,
going out.

334
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,240
It's in here to intend
it to do two things.

335
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,390
One to show you something about the method
that we will be using in here and the

336
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:41,020
two to show you something
of the level of this course,

337
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,220
the level of the course,

338
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,800
the questions that I'm
asking on this quiz,

339
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,030
questions asked on the quiz or the types
of things we would expect you to know

340
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:56,530
at the end of the course. Not
now, but at the end of the course.

341
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,110
Some of these are difficult.
Uh,

342
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,640
so if you find yourself getting
most of these answers correct,

343
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,090
then don't take this course. You'd be
wasting your time wasting your money here.

344
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:11,650
So don't, don't do this. If you, if you
find at the end of this, you got 16, 17,

345
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,450
18 of these, correct. All right,

346
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,350
let's start with a little bit of
classical music here. And this, uh,

347
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,870
engages questions one and two,

348
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:25,290
who is the composer of the piece that
you're about to hear and what is its title

349
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:26,740
or what's it call?

350
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,953
Okay.

351
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,450
Okay. So let's see. Let's do,

352
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,080
I'm going to ask Linda to cue the next
piece here while we talk about that.

353
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:52,980
Just for a moment. The composer,
anybody know the composer of this?

354
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:56,880
Raise your hand. Okay. Um, some
people do, some people don't.

355
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:01,860
A gentleman over here. Dark shirt.
Okay. That is Beethoven. Look big, Ben.

356
00:23:01,861 --> 00:23:06,450
Beethoven, and do you know the name of
the piece? Okay. Symphony number five.

357
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,690
Now if you're sitting next to this
gentleman, Oh God, this guy knows so much.

358
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,960
I'm going to, I'm going to go
down the tube in this course. No,

359
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,530
don't be intimidated by,
by this. As I say, we're,

360
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:16,890
we're going to build
everybody up here together.

361
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,820
So that was Beethoven's Fifth Symphony,
the beginning of it.

362
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:23,190
A famous passage in the
history of classical music.

363
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,040
Let's listen to another composition here.

364
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:31,041
Who's the composer of this and what in
what composition is this piece used?

365
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,733
Probably

366
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,540
enough. It there. So who has the composure
of that? Anybody know the answer?

367
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:12,820
Fewer people do. A young lady out here
in the green, did you have your hand up

368
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,200
again? Beethoven? What's
the, what's the win?

369
00:24:17,201 --> 00:24:20,410
What composition does Beethoven
used this particular piece,

370
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,210
they know generally here. Okay,
in the ninth symphony. Again,

371
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,360
if you're saying, oh, I'm getting
really worried now, don't be,

372
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,960
don't be worried here. Uh,
okay. So Ninth Symphony.

373
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:36,990
Now I believe that music
works a magical potion,

374
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:43,470
a magical spell on it. Music gets
us to do particular kinds of things,

375
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,900
gets us to feel particular kinds of ways.

376
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,140
And I think these two pieces by the same
composer get caused us to feel very,

377
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,050
very different cause a different mood,

378
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,870
different psychological
state to come over us.

379
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,350
One of them goes this way.

380
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,463
Okay.

381
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,363
And the other,

382
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,500
I want to do a little experiment.
I've never done this before,

383
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,300
never done this before, but
um, like to do the following.

384
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,200
And that is to ask you,
uh,

385
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,720
to think about what mood each
piece causes you to fall into.

386
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:36,420
And I've put some adjectives up on the
board up there and I've grouped them by

387
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,770
R's and L's because I'm going to ask you
to raise your right hand if you respond

388
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:45,330
one way, uh, to a piece and your
left hand if you respond the other.

389
00:25:45,331 --> 00:25:49,890
So under the our group there,
we've got positive, happy,
secure. Under the El Group,

390
00:25:49,891 --> 00:25:53,310
we've got a negative, anxious, unsettled.

391
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,720
So I've chosen pieces maybe with slightly
different fields here. Let's see.

392
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,610
Let's see what we do with
this. Now. A piece number one.

393
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,133
Oh,

394
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,640
how'd you feel about that?
Now here's piece too.

395
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,213
Uh,

396
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,800
all right. So here's one.
If I'm gonna play it again.

397
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:18,923
Yeah.

398
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:27,560
If you raise your right hand or
left hand as your response to that.

399
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,910
Okay,
here's piece one.

400
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,600
MMM.

401
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,670
Right hand or left hand.
All right.

402
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,760
So those of you that are raising your
hand and some aren't raising their hands,

403
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:46,230
but that's okay.
Uh,

404
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,180
those of you a unit almost unanimously
say that the Beethoven Fifth Symphony

405
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:54,210
sounded somewhat ominous to,
is somewhat faithful to us.

406
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:59,010
And the Beethoven Ninth
Symphony conversely has a
different sort of feel to it.

407
00:26:59,340 --> 00:26:59,731
Indeed.

408
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:03,780
Does anybody know the title
of the Beethoven Ninth
Symphony was the setting of a

409
00:27:03,781 --> 00:27:08,610
poem by Friedrich Schiller
called Ode to Joy. Oh to joy.

410
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,260
So how does Beethoven go about
making the Ode to Joy Joyful?

411
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,700
What does he do here? This is what
we're going to be doing in our course.

412
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:19,440
We're going to be
zeroing in on this music.

413
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,830
Can anybody tell me why
to a person in this room?

414
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:27,810
We all responded positively to the Ninth
Symphony and somewhat more anxiously to

415
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:30,990
the fifth symphony.
You have to tell me one thing.

416
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,110
Okay. Major and minor. Now
once again, you, you're,

417
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:38,340
you're out here in front.

418
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:43,100
You've been listening to your parents'
records and cds and, uh, so, so maybe, Eh,

419
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,040
uh, I'm delighted that you know this, but
maybe this is too far too far. Um, uh,

420
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,170
below what your d your dignity here.
So, but, but good for you. Alright,

421
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,820
we've got this idea of major chords and
minor chords. So let me ask you this,

422
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,350
uh, which I think this is a quiz question
here, would probably number five,

423
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:05,480
which is this a major chord or a minor

424
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,160
as opposed to,

425
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,313
oh,

426
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,170
the first one is a minor chord.

427
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,020
The second one is a major chord.

428
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,350
We could call them triads and we'll be
talking about with that. Yes. Before.

429
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,830
So that's one reason, major versus
minor. Here's a question for you.

430
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:30,963
What about this?

431
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,690
Let me take the rhythm out of it.

432
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:40,560
That's a bit skippy, isn't it? It
doesn't move around a lot. Whereas the,

433
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,080
if I take the rhythm out
of the night symphony,

434
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:52,860
really Beethoven,
they're just going up and down a scale.

435
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:54,600
So it's very conjunct.

436
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,230
We have the difference between
conjunct music with the

437
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,400
disjunct music

438
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:08,590
and that perhaps adds to the unsettled
quality of the Beethoven Fifth Symphony.

439
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,740
Here's something else,
and I guess it's a quiz question.

440
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,190
I think I'm asking you there.
Uh,

441
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:18,010
it has to do about a home pitch.

442
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:22,860
Music gravitates around a home
pitch. Uh, and in the Beethoven Fisam

443
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:23,863
[inaudible]

444
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,730
we still haven't gotten the home pitch.
We go that far.

445
00:29:31,731 --> 00:29:34,430
We still haven't heard the homepage.
Anybody's sing the homepage.

446
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,043
[inaudible]

447
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,833
um,

448
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,040
but he hasn't given it to us and maybe
why this sounds so this junk and so

449
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,330
unsettled,
uh,

450
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:50,530
apart from the skippy nature of the
melody is that we are not given at the

451
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:53,980
outset the home pitch.
Whereas with the Ninth Symphony,

452
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,400
second phrase,

453
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,160
that's the home pitch there and we all
feel sort of secure in that whole pitch.

454
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,180
There's another reason I think these
two sound differently and that is the

455
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:11,800
following. What's the direction generally
of Beethoven's fifth symphony here,

456
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,540
downs generally going down.

457
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,580
So the direction that music goes can
also affect how we feel about it,

458
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,640
our mood about it.
So I think the next question,

459
00:30:26,641 --> 00:30:29,940
I play another piece for going to play
this from to piano a little bit. Um,

460
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,720
and I ask you the name of
the composer of this piece.

461
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:38,870
It's a little bit less well known than
maybe not a what it's called and when in

462
00:30:40,441 --> 00:30:41,970
the history of music it was written,

463
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,040
if I know that piece in
the name of the composer.

464
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,853
Yeah.

465
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,940
Okay.
Debbie,

466
00:31:07,941 --> 00:31:12,210
you see a French composer writing at
the end of the 19th century in the

467
00:31:12,211 --> 00:31:16,860
impressionist style and the pieces
called Moonlight Clair de Lune.

468
00:31:16,861 --> 00:31:21,210
But again, you make, you'll come out
of this course four months from now.

469
00:31:21,211 --> 00:31:25,320
You'll know all of this stuff. Now
you're not supposed to know any of this.

470
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:29,190
What I'm interested in is your
emotional response to this.

471
00:31:29,191 --> 00:31:33,510
How do you feel about this music?
What kind of mood does it put you in?

472
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,170
How do you feel about that?
Anybody wanted, tell me about that.

473
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:15,910
Okay.

474
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:20,820
Whoops. I heard is I heard nice
and loud please. Serene. Yeah.

475
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,490
Serene. Why does it feel serene? Boy,

476
00:32:24,491 --> 00:32:27,790
I wish I could play my rave till dawn CD.
Right?

477
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,600
Ciao.

478
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,250
Okay. There's no beat
to it. All right. The,

479
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,190
it's very language in of the pulse here.

480
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,910
It's very understated in terms of a,
B,

481
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,020
you'd be hard pressed to identify
what the meter of that is.

482
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,770
So that's one reason. And of course
the what, where am I going with the,

483
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:56,510
the next important point about what's
happening in this music that makes us feel

484
00:32:56,511 --> 00:33:00,890
serene,
relaxed because it's all going down.

485
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,350
And only when we get here,

486
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:25,090
do our spirits soar upward
at that particular point,
at that particular point.

487
00:33:25,091 --> 00:33:30,000
So again, direction in music also is
important with how we respond to it.

488
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,740
So what do we, what are we going
over here? Major versus minor,

489
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:37,030
a disjunct versus conjunct. What else? Um,

490
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:41,140
strongly felt tonal key,
which is called,

491
00:33:41,141 --> 00:33:44,890
I don't know if I mentioned that they're
not the tonic key. The tonic pitch,

492
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:48,860
the tonic pitch there. And this
idea of the direction of the music.

493
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:51,520
All of these will have
to be thinking about,

494
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,690
thinking about as we listen
to music in this course.

495
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:59,410
Uh, okay. Now let's see.

496
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,943
Okay.

497
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,300
I think I want to do the following.

498
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,563
Yeah.

499
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,370
Here's a question for you.
Here's a question, completely
different subject here.

500
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:13,923
Um,

501
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,850
what are the two dimensions
of music dimensions of music?

502
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,940
I think about dimensions of
painting or architecture perhaps,

503
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:25,780
but what are the two dimensions of music?
Ever thought about that?

504
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:31,830
Can anybody give me one? Well
pitch. Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

505
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,020
Okay. Pitch. And what would
the other one be? Time. Okay.

506
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,420
Pitch and time or pitch and duration.
Excellent.

507
00:34:39,421 --> 00:34:42,550
So those are the two dimensions of music.
And we'll deed,

508
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,920
we could even call them the axes of music
because we tend to think of pitch on a

509
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:49,830
vertical access. We talk in terms
of high pitch and low pitch,

510
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,600
although we'll find tune that next time.

511
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,090
And then we had this
idea of duration or time,

512
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:58,950
which we tend to write out in symbols
that move from your left to right,

513
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:03,920
left to right. So what I'd like to
do now is focus on a piece that, uh,

514
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,950
emphasizes for grounds.
Just the first axes pitch.

515
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,270
And here is a question for you.
Uh,

516
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:16,490
how many have you have you have
heard regards Strauss's also Brock.

517
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,690
Zahra through stripe?

518
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:20,580
Yeah.

519
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,920
Okay. How many in a night,
baby? Courageous here.

520
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:26,590
How many have not heard Ricard
Strauss is also sprocket?

521
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,980
Xero through is to raise
your hand nice and big. Okay.

522
00:35:28,981 --> 00:35:33,060
The overwhelming majority of people wrong.

523
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,400
You all have heard this many times.
It's used continuously. A movie score,

524
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:41,340
television, radio commercials.
It's all over the place.

525
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,460
As soon as I start to play it, uh,
at least once we get into it, you'll,

526
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,750
you'll feel, oh yeah, I've heard that.

527
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:50,751
So this is a piece by Strauss where
he's trying to resurrect the content or

528
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:55,170
mirror the content of a philosophical
novel by Friedrich Neetsy,

529
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,810
thus spoke Zahra through stress.

530
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,820
And it's about the unleashing of human
capacity as it comes forth from the

531
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:07,941
primordial earth here and
Strauss in attempting to do this,

532
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:12,780
we'll use the orchestra duty picked here.
In this particular case,

533
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:17,760
perhaps the rise of human power may be
as metaphorically represented by the sun.

534
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:22,080
So here is Strauss depicting
the rise of the sun.

535
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:26,220
And the first question I think that you
have on the quiz here is the following.

536
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,580
Um,

537
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,460
what keyboard instrument is playing here?
It's a keyboard instrument.

538
00:36:33,461 --> 00:36:35,520
So let's listen to just a little
bit of this please. Linda.

539
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:45,960
Yeah.

540
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,220
Okay. Let's stop there. Because of the
condition of the amplifier this morning,

541
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,020
you can't really hear what that is.

542
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:57,021
What that is is an organ pipe of the type
of Oregon that we have over in Woolsey

543
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,990
Hall. 32 feet tall. This
gigantic sounds right.

544
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,430
Oh,

545
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:06,880
down there. So that's what
he's trying to set up. Okay.

546
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:12,030
Then a brass instrument enters and what
is the name of this brass instrument?

547
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,580
Okay. Yeah, go ahead.

548
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,640
Precaution instrument.

549
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,570
Yeah,

550
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:57,080
let's stop it there.
So the brass instrument is the,

551
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:01,610
is a trumpet. Okay. That's what
that is. It's coming up there.

552
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,890
Let's talk about what we've
got on the board here.

553
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,840
We can see we have these
low pitches of wool.

554
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:12,630
Oh, what did I just say? Bom. Bom.

555
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,050
Almost the same sounding pitch,
right? Well, we'll talk about this.

556
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:17,070
This is called an octave.

557
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:22,620
It has to do with frequency ratios that
will go into a little bit next time.

558
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:27,140
So he's coming up initially
just through octaves. Um,

559
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,040
then the next page on the trumpet,

560
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,050
Bom Bom is actually the
interval of the fifth he m bomb.

561
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,310
That's a fourth,
but it happens

562
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:40,270
to produce an octo bom bom against that.
Then the first time

563
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,620
bom bom.

564
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:48,260
So he came up a major third there and
then quickly backed off it just a half

565
00:38:48,261 --> 00:38:48,980
step lower,

566
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:53,900
which completely gave it a different
feel to bright shiny major and in dark

567
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:54,883
minor.

568
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,490
Then a percussion instrument came in.
Uh,

569
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:06,440
he may know what that was.
Okay. Um, tell me what it was.

570
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,590
Nice and loud.
Yell it out there.

571
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:14,570
It or sometimes called a kettle drum
and it was playing two different pitches

572
00:39:14,571 --> 00:39:18,050
actually sort of playing this
pitch and this pitch the octave.

573
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,640
And then the fifth,

574
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:25,430
the fifth degree of the scale after the
tonic is the next most important. Um,

575
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,240
and it's called the dominant,
the dominant note. Okay.

576
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,670
So that's what that is in that
particular quick question.

577
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,080
So the Timpani comes in and it goes crazy,
right?

578
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,300
Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom,
Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, bom.

579
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:42,630
It comes back to the tonic. At which
point the trumpet takes over again.

580
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:46,640
So let's listen to just a little bit
more and I think, well, let's listen.

581
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,700
I forget where we left off.

582
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,800
Okay, let's stop it
here. Now at this point,

583
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:05,070
what happens is the trumpet fall.

584
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,900
Hello

585
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,230
all the way up there. It's
going to jump way, way up. Uh,

586
00:40:10,231 --> 00:40:12,180
so let's listen to that.

587
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:32,600
Okay.
Stop

588
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:36,440
that right here. What's happening?
It interests me acoustically. Again,

589
00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:37,280
we'll come back to it.

590
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,730
Is that we're getting up toward here
and notice how these pitches in terms of

591
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:43,790
their fruit ratio frequencies
are getting very close together.

592
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,833
So we're going to go

593
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,860
bomb

594
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,920
you sing the next note

595
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:55,370
bomb. There it is up there. Okay,
good. You got it. Come a louder. Um,

596
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,293
coraggio.

597
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,070
Okay, so there we are there.
My question on the quiz,

598
00:40:59,071 --> 00:41:00,180
here's what's this one called?

599
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,040
Ah,

600
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:05,530
bomb.

601
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:09,890
Okay. So this is a, this is a leading
tone going in, into that particular ended,

602
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,780
that particular note.
So let's listen to hear again,

603
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,320
just the very end of this with the
spectacular sound of the orchestra.

604
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:37,180
[inaudible]

605
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:45,300
and they're at the end, you could
hear the organ a little bit better.

606
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,720
So that's how it using
some of these basic ratios,

607
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:54,160
he gives us this primordial type of
music and it's quite spectacular.

608
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:57,790
It's quite spectacular
because here in the 1890s,

609
00:41:57,791 --> 00:42:02,350
we have the apex of the western
classical orchestra, this big, beautiful,

610
00:42:02,351 --> 00:42:06,640
powerful instrument. Uh, okay.

611
00:42:06,641 --> 00:42:09,040
We've talked a little
bit about pitch here.

612
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,550
Let's go on to talk about
the other axis of music.

613
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,780
And that is rhythm or duration.
Now in music,

614
00:42:16,781 --> 00:42:20,210
as you probably know, we've already
talked a little bit about this. Um,

615
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,640
we have the importance of the beat beats,

616
00:42:27,641 --> 00:42:30,880
very important in music and
generally speaking, in, in music,

617
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:35,440
we divide the beat,
we organize it into groups,

618
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,710
beats kind of like the heartbeat.
It's kind of like the basic pulse of

619
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,320
Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, bom.

620
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,600
But w w given our psychological makeup,

621
00:42:45,601 --> 00:42:50,010
we tend to divide these up into units
of January two and generally three.

622
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,010
And if we have groups of two,

623
00:42:53,011 --> 00:42:56,970
we call that Dupo meter two to three,
we call that of course triple meter.

624
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,330
How do we indicate these?
Well by some kind of conducting pattern,

625
00:43:00,331 --> 00:43:05,220
we'll come back to this. You'll all be
conducting in here. So [inaudible] one,

626
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,130
two, one two, one two, one

627
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,850
bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom,

628
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:13,780
Bom Bom,

629
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,410
one strong beat, one weak,
be strong, weak, strong,

630
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,300
weak in that fashion.
And conversely of course triple is strong,

631
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:28,130
weak, weak, strong, weak, weak with
two week between each strong B.

632
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:33,500
So here's a question for you. Who wrote
the musical? It's on your quiz there.

633
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:38,740
Chicago. Anybody know the
answer to that? Ha. Okay. Uh,

634
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,050
how many, how many don't
know. Arousing show of hands.

635
00:43:42,051 --> 00:43:45,440
You don't know who wrote Chicago?
This is amazing to me.

636
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,900
This guy is the stealth bomber of music.

637
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,830
How nobody could know the name of this
person that has given us so much great

638
00:43:51,831 --> 00:43:56,050
music, cabaret, Chicago songs that
you go around singing in. You know,

639
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:59,300
having your ear all the time.
John Kander lives down in New York City,

640
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,950
writes them,
writes a lot of this stuff.

641
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:05,810
So we're going to listen to a track
out of John Kander Chicago here.

642
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:07,250
And the question,
uh,

643
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:12,380
that's an issue in play at the moment
is what's the meter of this cut from

644
00:44:12,381 --> 00:44:13,214
Chicago?

645
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,920
[inaudible]

646
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,980
okay. Um, here's
something of May interest.

647
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:30,290
You will be playing a
lot of pop music in here,

648
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:34,800
but they will generally be short clips
of pop music. Why is that the case?

649
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,273
Yeah.

650
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:41,980
Big, big for copyright reasons,
right? Yeah. For copyright reasons.

651
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:45,980
So we've heard a passage
here. What was the, uh,

652
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,410
meter of that section?
Gentleman down here, you seem
to be moving with the music,

653
00:44:50,411 --> 00:44:53,860
which is very good. What did
you think? Dupler triple. Okay.

654
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:57,430
DUPA now I would come to, that's correct.
I would come right back to you with,

655
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:01,930
yeah. You intuited that, but can you
explain to me what you were hearing?

656
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:07,240
What did you hear that allowed your
brain to instantly go to that decision?

657
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:11,760
Make that correct decision?
Any ideas? Anybody?

658
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:17,280
Okay. Cut Time. What accent on one.

659
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:19,740
But what part of the music
were you listening to?

660
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:27,400
Yeah, yeah. That's it. Some, but
somebody is actually going don, Don, Don,

661
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:28,680
and it's actually the base.

662
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:32,150
So we'll be wanting to zero in on the
base in a big way in music bum bump,

663
00:45:32,151 --> 00:45:35,520
because that's oftentimes you're giving
as much more information than the Melody

664
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:39,300
Bom, Bom, Bom. So there we had
an example of Duplo. Let's see,

665
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:42,330
we got another extra here.
Let's listen to a little bit of that.

666
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:50,780
[inaudible]

667
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:55,120
so what about that one?

668
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:56,720
Yeah,

669
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,450
yeah. You know the setup here.
We did Dupal then we got to
do triple. Okay, so that,

670
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,980
but you can hear fun to the
strong, weak, weak, strong, weak,

671
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:08,970
weak in that fashion. All right, now
let's listen to a little bit more of this.

672
00:46:08,971 --> 00:46:12,750
And something interesting happens
to the beat. It slows down,

673
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:17,760
what do we call the passage of
music in which the beat slows down?

674
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:21,510
What's being applied? What's being
affected here? What's being used here?

675
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,693
Okay.

676
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,350
Okay. Very simple word there. Retard.
Okay, so the music has retarded.

677
00:46:36,351 --> 00:46:37,184
We have the,

678
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:42,410
the pulse being slowed down and almost
like a law of physics if something slows

679
00:46:42,741 --> 00:46:45,380
down, an opposite and equal reaction. Now,

680
00:46:45,381 --> 00:46:48,440
John Kander makes the music accelerate.
Oh,

681
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:52,340
so let's watch a wonderful
example of ECT, cello, Rondo here,

682
00:46:57,230 --> 00:46:59,640
let me,

683
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,040
okay,
so at that point,

684
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:11,620
the music begins to speed up
with the Accela Rondo. Now, uh,

685
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:14,110
we're getting close as you might
imagine to the end. Indeed,

686
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,550
he wants to drive to the end.
Do you ever notice this?

687
00:47:16,551 --> 00:47:19,760
And musical compositions keep an eye
out for this, particularly in pop music?

688
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:22,580
They've got an idea,
but they've got to fill up a track.

689
00:47:22,581 --> 00:47:25,700
They really need three good three
minutes and 30 seconds here they'll have

690
00:47:25,701 --> 00:47:29,210
something going and then
almost unbeknownst to you,

691
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:33,580
they will take that and lifted it up.
In terms of the pitch content,

692
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,560
what does that call when you change
the fundamental pitch in a ps,

693
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:41,380
going to a different pitch level?

694
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,200
Anybody know about that called modulation?

695
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:47,470
And this is sort of where it will be
really, really four months from now.

696
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,600
Modulation, it's very subtle, very
subtle. A lot of what we were doing.

697
00:47:52,601 --> 00:47:56,320
Today's PR is very straight forward.
The idea of duplo versus triple meter,

698
00:47:56,590 --> 00:48:01,000
but most modulations we don't
usually hear. So let's listen to,

699
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:04,000
we got two more cuts to do
and then I'll let you go. Uh,

700
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:09,010
let's listen to John Kander sit on one
pitch level and then suddenly raised the

701
00:48:09,521 --> 00:48:13,060
whole thing up.
Raising up music builds excitement.

702
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:16,883
Yes,

703
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:28,323
yes.

704
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:36,540
Okay, let's stop there. Now he builds,
I think this is the last question.

705
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:40,110
What do we call this last chord when
we've already talked about if it's not the

706
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,590
tonic chord, it's the, anybody remembered
the second most important pitch,

707
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:48,660
that dominant. So let's watch John
Kander sit on the dominant chord now

708
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:55,180
[inaudible]

709
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:09,310
and now you seeing the tonnage.

710
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,980
MMM,

711
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,560
okay.
Hit the tonic.

712
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:24,270
[inaudible]

713
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,490
okay,

714
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:31,490
so these are the kinds of things we
will be doing if you decide to take this

715
00:49:31,491 --> 00:49:34,610
course, get ahold of the
materials for next Tuesday.

716
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:39,320
Do listening exercises one and
nine through 11. I'll see you then.
