1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:06,030
So good morning. Uh, I bring you
news from Nashville, Nashville.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,190
Um, very interesting. Nashville,
it's such an interesting weekend.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,490
Friday night went to this spectacular
concert of Mozart doing the Mozart requiem

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,070
in this $135 million concert hall that
they have put built for classical music

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,660
in the city of Nashville. The next
afternoon, Saturday afternoon,

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,850
I walked across the street. I could've
have gone two blocks to watch it.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,100
I'm a hockey game.

8
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:35,130
They have a hockey team in Nashville or
three blocks in the other direction to

9
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:37,620
watch the titans play in football,
stand by one,

10
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:40,680
just one block to the
country music hall of fame.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,720
So I spent three hours in the country
music hall of fame and absolutely

12
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:46,554
fascinated,

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,850
but it got even better because Sunday
morning there I was at the airport about

14
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,990
to fly out of Nashville and I'm sitting
there and you know how you were queuing

15
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:58,590
up to get and go out your gate to
get on your airplane and you're,

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,580
they've CNN is playing on the television
there. It was wonderful. What did I hear?

17
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,623
Okay.

18
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,220
Oh, Mozart, Mozart right
here in the airport.

19
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:15,620
In Nashville and then
we had one on from that.

20
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:18,140
There was another commercial and they used

21
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,170
and so on. I do. One of us does
strange, wonderful war. What a strange,

22
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:36,730
wonderful country to have
such diversity ethnically,

23
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,440
politically, uh, and musically. Uh,

24
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,330
and at the same time to have a sense
that there's this little person who was

25
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:46,060
only about five feet,
three inches tall,

26
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:50,830
probably weighed about 110 pounds.
Sitting in a room in Vienna,

27
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:51,491
Austria,

28
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:56,491
more than 200 years ago could
create this beauty that we still,

29
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,510
um,
engaged today,

30
00:01:58,511 --> 00:02:02,230
whether consciously or subconsciously
when we're sitting in an airport in

31
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:06,520
Nashville, Tennessee,
right? Astonishing. What,

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,890
what the brain sometimes experiences.
Well,

33
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:10,600
today we're going to talk about Mozart.

34
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,030
Now the Muse music that you just heard.
Let's play just a little of it. Linda.

35
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:17,120
Let's start with a,

36
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,500
it should be tracked and there the
little g minor symphony of Mozart.

37
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,730
Let's just play it a little bit of it.

38
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:50,950
Okay.

39
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,980
Let's just stop it there. And we're going
to come back to this in just a second.

40
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,910
It's music of the classical period.
It's music of Mozart.

41
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:02,080
It happens to me what's called little g
minor symphony and contrast that to the

42
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,950
music that you heard in
section last week by Bach

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,820
and so on where he gets a concerto
going. Dot. T, t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t,

44
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:23,500
t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t,
t, t, t, t, t, t, t, t,

45
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,670
and it sort of chugs along in that same
fashion chosen along in fact for about

46
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:30,930
nine minutes and 20 seconds,

47
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,980
all with the music having the same
general tenor, the same general mood,

48
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,790
the same general feeling to it.
That's baroque music.

49
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,540
Once you get an ethos
established in baroque music,

50
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:47,070
it will carry through from beginning
to end of a particular movement or a

51
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:51,060
particular piece. It doesn't
change. Uh, generally speaking,

52
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,610
when we get to the classical
period, however, and we're here,

53
00:03:53,611 --> 00:03:57,750
we're talking roughly 1750
up to around 1820 or so,

54
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,400
things get a little bit different. We
get change within a particular movement.

55
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,900
Change might be from regular to irregular.
Rhythm for example,

56
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:10,170
are from very loud too.
Two very quiet. And this,

57
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,440
this push for change only accelerates
as we go into the romantic period where

58
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:20,070
you get these wild swings of emotion,

59
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:25,071
these wild swings of musical mood to
kind of bipolar music in the 19th century

60
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,420
when this begins in the classical period.

61
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:32,421
So let's go back and hear the beginning
of this symphony number 25 in g minor of

62
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:37,410
Mozart. And notice here we begin minor
key, lots of syncopation agitation.

63
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,510
And within about 40 seconds,

64
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,630
Mozart has morphed into a
completely different mood.

65
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,390
Major key oboe solo.
Uh,

66
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,310
the music is very lyrical. Uh,
the meter now is co or the,

67
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,300
the rhythms are all lined up to come
on the beat rather than off the beat.

68
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:58,020
Watch how we had this transformation
of mood within a rather short period of

69
00:04:58,021 --> 00:04:58,854
time.

70
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,680
Okay.
Completely different sort of music.

71
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,000
Now that sound that you just heard
there is the opening music for the film

72
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,500
Amadeus. How many have seen the movie or
film Amadeus? If you haven't go see it.

73
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,720
It's just not to be believed.
It is so good.

74
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,130
And it doesn't age either because
it's all done in period costumes.

75
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:00,200
So you don't know that
anything has really changed.

76
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,980
It's a wonderful movie is
based on two premises. One,

77
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,160
what does mediocrity do in the
face of absolute genius and to,

78
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,210
isn't that ironic?

79
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:16,211
Isn't it somehow unfair
that this God given talent,

80
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:21,311
this great creature comes to earth in
the form of this sort of childish lout I.

81
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,660
E. Mozart. Uh, uh, and it, we'll
explore that just to just a little bit.

82
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:31,400
And how does someone like Peter Schaeffer
who created the play and on which was

83
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,660
built the, uh, the film Emma Days, how did
they create a character like this? Well,

84
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,790
they use memoirs of the time,
letters of the time,

85
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:41,930
primary source documents of the time.
You may remember in Amadeus,

86
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,110
and I put a picture of this
and the textbook because I
think it's actually very

87
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:47,840
important trying to get
inside of Mozart's head

88
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,600
that Mozart often composed on a
billiard table billiard table.

89
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:57,620
That's what we see in Amadeus. Is
this true? Yes, it is actually true.

90
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:00,110
If you look at the probate list of Mozart,
uh,

91
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:02,360
they went through his apartment
after he died in the inventory,

92
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:05,030
all the furniture and said where
everything was in his bedroom.

93
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:09,170
He had a billiards table, not a
pool table, but a billiards table.

94
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,670
There's an important difference here
because billiards of course involves, uh,

95
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,680
angles m and a. There is a report
from one of, of Mozart's friends,

96
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:22,080
a tender micro Kelly who
said in his memoirs quote,

97
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,940
he was fond of billiards and had an
excellent billiard table in his home.

98
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,470
Many and many a game I played with him,
but always came off second best.

99
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,310
Um,
and Mozart had other interests to his,

100
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,820
one of his other interests was arithmetic.

101
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,790
And if you look at the Mozart autographs,
uh,

102
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,680
and particularly the Mozart sketches,

103
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:47,420
you will see that he fills the margins
oftentimes with numbers doing various

104
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,700
basic calculations and sometimes
some fundamental Algebraic, uh,

105
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,730
formulations.

106
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,830
Why this fascination with
numbers and shapes and patterns.

107
00:07:57,831 --> 00:08:01,040
He would go into a restaurant. He would
be seen folding his napkin this way,

108
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,530
this way, this way,
when he writes letters,

109
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,360
he oftentimes writes the word
backwards. He loves anagrams. Um,

110
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,870
and, and I could give you lots
of specific instances of that.

111
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,620
Another aspect of this is Mozart.
The mimic.

112
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Mozart had an incredible capacity
to imitate other individuals,

113
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:24,300
their facial gestures there,
their dialects. We can't,

114
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,780
don't have time to go into
it. There's dialects. Um,

115
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,130
and he was fluent learn languages.
Lickety split fluent Italian,

116
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:35,810
fluent French, fluent English. Of course,
in addition to his, his, uh, native,

117
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,360
uh,
German and he had a great musical memory.

118
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:41,030
He could retain all of
this sound famous story.

119
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:45,980
He goes into Sistine Chapel in Rome.
We saw pictures of that two weeks ago.

120
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,060
He hears one piece that couldn't
be performed anywhere else. Uh,

121
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,140
it had never been published, only supposed
to be performed in the paypal chapel.

122
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,063
He goes in once,

123
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,790
here's it walks back to his hotel and
writes the whole thing down. Well,

124
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:04,650
what is all of this? Uh, well, it's
the capacity, I suppose. What, what,

125
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,100
what is, what is, uh, uh, um,

126
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,330
uh, what is the brain doing
up there? We've got this,

127
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,240
this Oregon probably the least understood.

128
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:19,230
And we have these various parts of
the brain sound processing for music,

129
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:23,340
sound processing for the
line, for languages happening
most in the temporal lobe,

130
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:25,410
but engaging various kinds of,

131
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,650
of near term and longterm memory in
the frontal lobe and probably in the

132
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,370
hippocampus as well.
If you have absolute pitch,

133
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,050
sometimes you short circuit,

134
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:42,000
apparently this whole process because
that's being recognized, uh, in, in the,

135
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,720
uh, in the brain stem and so on. Um,

136
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,920
so there's lots going on here and
I've given you this sheet, uh,

137
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,260
in which w a Yale neuroscientist,
uh,

138
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,020
David Ross a couple of years ago,

139
00:09:55,021 --> 00:10:00,021
he was the basis of an article in the
Yale Alumni magazine is your brain in

140
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:01,710
tune,
uh,

141
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,730
and it talks about things such as the
incidents of absolute pitch in this world.

142
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,870
Uh, roughly one person
in every 10,000, uh,

143
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,640
has it. So these are the, these are the
kinds of things that interest about us,

144
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:19,830
about Mozart. Oddly, we can,

145
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,650
we know more about Mozart
than we know about Picasso.

146
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,760
Picasso lived in great artists,
great genius here in the 20th century,

147
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,970
died about 1971 [inaudible] 70.

148
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:33,971
[inaudible] but we can get inside of
Mozart's head more intentionally and when

149
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:34,890
know more about him.

150
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,550
And we can't about Picasso because
Mozart left us a tongue of letters.

151
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:41,220
I just grabbed something.
It was in my bookshelf in my office.

152
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:45,930
Here's volume two of a five
volume set of letters by Mozart.

153
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,950
So he was always writing letters
to him principally to his father.

154
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,810
And it's on the basis of this kind of
thing that we get a sense of who Mozart

155
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:59,400
was. Um, the, the portrayal
of Mozart and Emma Dios says,

156
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:04,290
I say is just absolutely
wrong. It couldn't be more
wrong. The movie is brilliant,

157
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,410
the premise is brilliant,
but the portrayal of Mozart couldn't,

158
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,070
couldn't be more off the
track. A, here's just one,

159
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:16,210
a letter from those in the
collected letters of Mozart
that always interests me.

160
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,090
It's writing to his father's 1781 about
the time the death of one of his good

161
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:24,420
friends friend was named
count von hots failed.

162
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,090
And this is what Mozart says about death.

163
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,690
Death is the true goal of our lives.

164
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,950
And I have made myself so eloquent with
it during the past two years that I see

165
00:11:34,951 --> 00:11:38,730
it as the true and best friend of mankind.
Indeed,

166
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,340
the idea of it no longer
holds any terror for me,

167
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,660
but rather much that is tranquil and
comforting and I thank God that he has

168
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:50,280
granted me the good fortune to obtain
the opportunity of regarding death as the

169
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:52,200
key to our true happiness.

170
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,620
I never retire at night without
considering that as young as I am.

171
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,860
Perhaps I may be no more on the moral yet.

172
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,660
Not One of those who know me could say
that I am more rows or melancholy and for

173
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:09,661
this I thank my create her daily and wish
hardly the same happiness may be given

174
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:10,930
to my fellow man.

175
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,100
I clearly explained my way of looking at
the matter on the occasion of the death

176
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:20,101
of my very dear best friend count von
hots felt he was just 31 like myself.

177
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,250
I do not grieve for him,
but from the bottom of my heart,

178
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:29,200
for myself and for all who knew
him as well as I end quote now,

179
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:31,660
ironically at age 31,

180
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:36,340
how many more years did Mozart
himself have the live yeah, for he,

181
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,980
he did not make it to 36.
He wrote this stuff,

182
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:42,430
you'd go in our music library over there
and you could extend your hands like

183
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:46,300
this and you would not be
able to encompass all of
the music that's been edited

184
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:51,250
by Mozart. Uh, and he did all of
that. Uh, by the time he was, uh,

185
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,260
uh, was 36. So Mozart's, it's
an interesting character.

186
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,060
Uh, he may have had no formal education,
didn't spend a minute in school.

187
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,270
Why not?
Well,

188
00:13:06,271 --> 00:13:08,370
they didn't have mandatory
education that period.

189
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:12,500
He was recognized very early on to be
a musical genius. And his father, uh,

190
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,740
nourished him at home, took
them all around the world
to showcase these talents.

191
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,390
Uh, and as he was sort of educated as a
person in the world and his father did

192
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:26,220
teaching many, many things as,
as he went, went through life.

193
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,180
Um, okay. So what kind of
music did Mozart, right,

194
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:32,850
what's special about Mozart's music?
Well,

195
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,880
let me try to encapsulate this in a
simple way by saying let's focus on four

196
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:42,660
things that are peculiar about
Mozart's music or, um, uh,

197
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,540
individual about Mozart's music.
The first,

198
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:50,541
I would say this infallible sense of
balance and proportion and fallible sense

199
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:52,500
of balance and proportion.
Yes,

200
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:57,501
we are in the classical period in the
history of music and that's why we call it

201
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,810
the classical period because
everything does seem to be imbalanced.

202
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,890
There's not an excessive
degree of ornamentation.

203
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:07,680
The way you find that sometimes in,
in Baroque art for example,

204
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:11,250
everything is balanced and it,
it is still the norm. Today.

205
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,940
I was dumbfounded looking at that
new concert hall in Nashville.

206
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:19,650
What did they do? Say it's a knock off
of the u s treasury building or the, the,

207
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:23,250
uh, Federal Reserve building
in Washington DC. You know,

208
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,070
the basic pedimento them up there,
the columns and all of this.

209
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,090
That's classical architecture. Everything
in perfect balance. Well, in music,

210
00:14:30,091 --> 00:14:33,930
we begin to get this for the first
time here in the classical period.

211
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:39,210
Remember when we were studying measures
and bars and phrases and I would have

212
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:44,211
you count measures and invariably we
would find that things are two plus two

213
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:47,670
four plus four eight plus eight and
that kind of thing. Very symmetrical.

214
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,460
Well this comes into music here for the
first time in a big way in the classical

215
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:56,780
period. So let's just refresh our memory
here. Here is the Ra of wake case up.

216
00:14:56,781 --> 00:15:01,760
Hey Tay by Mozart,
which we had Lauren liberal sing for us,

217
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:05,540
but just the beginning of us have it
to get a sense in our ears. Once again,

218
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,330
what's a an antecedent
and consequent phrase,

219
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,390
antecedent

220
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,533
consequence,

221
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:27,763
antecedent.

222
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,960
Oh it up.
And then shirts

223
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,660
the consequence.

224
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,500
Okay,
we'll just stop it right there.

225
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:55,190
But everything in four plus four you
can go right to the entire Aria and it's

226
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:57,470
organized that way. All
right, so that's one point.

227
00:15:57,471 --> 00:16:02,471
One balance shaping perfect proportion
point to the capacity to make something

228
00:16:03,741 --> 00:16:07,430
very beautiful out of the
simplest of materials.

229
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,790
It's sort of oxy moron here with Mozart.

230
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,890
The group is sometimes the simpler
it is, the more beautiful it is. A,

231
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,700
here is the piece they were playing
in the airport in Nashville.

232
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:22,790
It's out of a piano concerto of Mozart.

233
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,630
It's the one in c major that's
listed on your sheet there.

234
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:31,520
It's called the Elvira Maddigan concerto
because few years ago they used it as

235
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:33,330
background,
uh,

236
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,350
music for a movie that we're film that
was based on a novel of Thomas Hardy.

237
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:44,450
Is that right? Elvira Madigan? I
think that's correct. In any event,

238
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:45,284
here's the music.

239
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,810
And so I'm going to just stop there
for a second. Let's look at this.

240
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:17,923
What's that?

241
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,190
Nobody yell it out nicely.

242
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,093
Wow.

243
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,280
Daniel May Daniels has major try it.
Absolutely right.

244
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:31,990
So he's just ornamenting it a little bit.
Now what's this?

245
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,070
Just to scale, he's up on the
fifth five, four, three, two.

246
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,620
He makes a little more
interesting by doing this.

247
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,530
A little chromaticism inserted there.
So the best stuff we talked about,

248
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:53,850
the beginning of the class, try
Ed goes up, comes down to scale.

249
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,460
It fills in the triad coming down
the scale. Chromatic inflection.

250
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,633
Next phrase

251
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,250
gets back to the opening idea.
But how's he do that?

252
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,230
This is an interesting chord and we
should focus on it just for a minute.

253
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:21,280
It's called a dominant seventh chord.
Here's our basic c major triad,

254
00:18:21,281 --> 00:18:25,810
CEG Ya Todd Hall,
and it's made up of two thirds.

255
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:28,480
If we put one more third up there,

256
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,910
Yattaw Tom Paul,

257
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,590
that would get us up to a seventh chord.
Why is it called a seventh chord? Again?

258
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:40,030
Because it spans seven
letter names, CDE. She a B,

259
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,240
so total of seven letter names up there,
but it's,

260
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,070
it's simply a triad with another third,
uh,

261
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:50,110
thrown up there on top.
So we get that idea

262
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,120
back to the tonic

263
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,450
diminished chord.

264
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,670
And so us a little trill at the
end and that's it. It's very,

265
00:19:21,671 --> 00:19:24,340
very simple material,
but it's so beautiful.

266
00:19:24,341 --> 00:19:27,880
And so last thing that you can hear it
once again in the airport in Nashville.

267
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,500
All right,
0.3 0.3 what I would say,

268
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:36,490
our wild swings of mood with Mozart,
uh,

269
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:39,430
it begins to come in as mentioned
in the classical period.

270
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:42,610
This change of mood within a
single composition composition.

271
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,530
But with Mozart is particularly intense
because he likes to swing really quickly

272
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:49,150
between major and minor keys.

273
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,180
And he likes to go between diatonic
chromatic really quickly and likes to play

274
00:19:54,731 --> 00:19:57,790
off different dynamic levels,
loud and soft.

275
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,050
And that's the essence of
drama, right? Contrast conflict.

276
00:20:02,051 --> 00:20:03,700
That's where we get drama.

277
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:08,790
So let's listen to a bit of the Kung
Fu totties out of the requiem mass.

278
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,500
We talked a bit about
this a little bit before,

279
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,940
but it wouldn't hurt to hear it again.

280
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:17,941
So we're gonna start here down low and
demon land in minor agitation and then

281
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:21,400
we'll shift up into the
higher heavenly realm.

282
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,970
Oops,
what was that?

283
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,410
Yeah, you had it as a listening exercise.
But while Linda goes for, for that, uh,

284
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,790
that, uh, that particular, uh, uh,

285
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:40,810
tracked or do I haven't not
marked correctly there. Ally, uh,

286
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:46,040
run, take a look at the CD there.
Um, or it should be on the,

287
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:50,280
the uh, um, yeah,

288
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,470
I think it's true. It should be track
11 or so down there. What's it say?

289
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,430
It says 10 and what it is at 11,

290
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,890
I incorrectly marked at my fault.
It's track 11 rather than 10.

291
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:07,600
So here and that was the big g minor
symphony of Mozart. Uh, that was,

292
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,340
that was inadvertently played here.

293
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,340
Now we're going to go to the con
Futon [inaudible] out of the DC,

294
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:13,780
right of the requiem,
mass

295
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,740
[inaudible]

296
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,400
completely new environment

297
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,960
and then back to the original.

298
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,730
So that's 0.3, strong contrast and
sometimes rather abrupt contracts.

299
00:22:03,731 --> 00:22:07,990
And here's the fourth and final point.
Inexhaustible melodic supply.

300
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:11,770
Fake community of imagination.
When it comes to melody,

301
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,300
this is an interesting thing.

302
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:15,520
It's something I'm studying
in my own work at the moment,

303
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,700
looking at a lot of Mozart's
sketches and Mozart.

304
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:20,290
Sometimes we'd have to sketch something.

305
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,870
He'd sometimes getting a little bit of
trouble and have to write something.

306
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:26,440
For the most part he had to all in his
head. He's just writing it down. Uh,

307
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:29,070
but sometimes he did have to sketch
things when he gets in trouble,

308
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,980
has to sketch. It's contrapuntal
issues. Contrapuntal issues,

309
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,490
never melody.

310
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,890
Now you're looking at Beethoven sketches
in the Beethoven sketchbooks and

311
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,461
Beethoven.

312
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:44,170
We'll wrestle with trying to craft or
get this melody exactly the way he wants

313
00:22:44,171 --> 00:22:47,590
it over and over again.
A ratio after a ratio.

314
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,010
When you look at the Beethoven section of
the textbook there, there's a, uh, a, um,

315
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,860
a facsimile of out of the bay,

316
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,090
the second movement of the Beethoven
Fifth Symphony. Notice all the erasers.

317
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,870
They're in constant corrections.
It took him about 20 years before.

318
00:23:01,871 --> 00:23:03,160
He was happy with

319
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,550
worked

320
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,550
on that theme for a long,
long time before he got exact.

321
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,300
That would never happen with Mozart.
This just flowed perfectly.

322
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,130
Now we're going to play an example here.

323
00:23:16,131 --> 00:23:20,570
I've never used this in any
kind of public forum before.

324
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,040
I'd be interested to see
how it comes across. Uh,

325
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,950
it's an example of Mozart writing
church music for a soprano Solo.

326
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,660
Actually the soprano that had to sing it
was his wife, so she was pretty good. Um,

327
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,930
so let's just listen to
a chunk out of a mass,

328
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:41,140
the c minor mass by Mozart and see this
sense of melody that just as perfect and

329
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:47,990
just kind of go on. I'm perfectly
shaped, perfectly proportion,

330
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,550
but you don't have a sense
that he's struggling with
this. It just seems so easy.

331
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,593
Oh,

332
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:05,950
okay.

333
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,890
Uh, so it should be, uh, uh, track, uh, 11

334
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,870
there are,
I believe that's it.

335
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,313
Hi.

336
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:45,580
Ooh,
just

337
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,470
positive.
We're just breaking into the middle of it.

338
00:25:47,471 --> 00:25:48,910
This guy could go on forever with it,

339
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,430
with this kind of thing and
sometimes you've got him in trouble.

340
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,750
Sometimes it got him in trouble.
Uh,

341
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,290
what I mean by that is that
there are two famous, uh,

342
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:58,300
anecdotes coming from Mozart's life.

343
00:25:58,301 --> 00:26:01,120
One at the time of the production
of the induction, the Seraglio,

344
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:01,990
the emperor's there,

345
00:26:01,991 --> 00:26:06,530
and amber says all well and good
[inaudible] my dear friend Mozart. Um,

346
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,510
but uh,

347
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:12,280
far too many notes in Mozart's
repose a response was, uh,

348
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:12,940
uh,

349
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,940
not one nor no more or less than
absolutely necessary your majesty.

350
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,900
Then at the end of the performance,

351
00:26:22,901 --> 00:26:26,510
the first Viennese performance
of Don Giovanni, uh, the emperor,

352
00:26:26,511 --> 00:26:28,720
same emperor Joseph the second said,

353
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:33,610
too much meat for the teeth of my Viennese
dear Mozart to which the repost this

354
00:26:33,611 --> 00:26:38,320
time was well, let them chew on it
a while. They'll get used to it.

355
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,350
Um, and they did and getting used
to it. But unfortunately, uh,

356
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,720
by time Mozart was dead. Um,
so he didn't, he didn't, uh,

357
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,390
live actually to see the success of,
of his particular vision.

358
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:56,170
So, uh, with Mozart, there is this
sense of music that is divinely, uh,

359
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:01,080
shape, divinely proportion,
sort of endless variety,
not one the note too many,

360
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:03,930
not one note too few.
And indeed in his day,

361
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:07,860
Mozart Bruce referred
to as the divine Mozart.

362
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,450
We still call them the divine Mojo.

363
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,890
It's interesting what labels
get put on particular composers.

364
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:17,310
Bach for example,
I'm not sure we'd call Bach divine.

365
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:21,060
We have the stalwart Bach, the
Industria in industrial, uh,

366
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,980
industrious Bach, for example,
Beethoven, the powerful Bach, the stripe,

367
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:31,000
the powerful composure, the
striving composer, uh, uh,

368
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:37,370
I can sort of relate to Bach in a way
with his 20 children or with Beethoven in

369
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:41,970
the chaos. You look at a Beethoven score
and it's this train wreck. You know,

370
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:44,820
these scribbled here, we're trying
to correct this and wrote this out.

371
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:48,790
And then he has his dinner falls
over top of the manuscript.

372
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:53,010
So he's got to sweep that away. It's just
his whole life kind of chaotic there.

373
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,940
But with most artists,
all sort of crystal clear and crisp,

374
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:00,390
perfectly organized almost
from the get go in these, uh,

375
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:02,910
autograph scores.
And that's what we mean sort of by the,

376
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:07,360
the divine nature of, of the music, uh,

377
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,730
sort of heavenly scent music.
It's an interesting phenomena.

378
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:16,620
This idea of art and religion
and, and, and why we have,

379
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:19,680
um, have these kinds of things. Um,

380
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,990
I often think of myself, I'm
not a particularly religious
person, but, but I, I,

381
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:30,430
I am one of these people that kind of
take a art and turn it into religion in a

382
00:28:30,661 --> 00:28:32,100
kind of odd kind of way.

383
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:37,280
And I think it is possible to see
visions of the divine working with,

384
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,280
with art. And occasionally I
do get this and in an odd way,

385
00:28:41,281 --> 00:28:44,370
this isn't this what art is
supposed to all be about.

386
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,410
I mean, why do we have art?
What does it do for us?

387
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,740
It gives us a sense of something better,

388
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,890
a vision of something better than this
stupid mundane in the vernacular crap

389
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,920
that we have to deal with on a,
on the quo DTN basis out here.

390
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:03,210
There could be something better.

391
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:05,790
There's something bigger and
better out there than we are.

392
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:10,760
That in essence is what what are is all
about. And sometimes you can see it and,

393
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,720
and I think you can see it or you should
seem to be getting near to it. Well,

394
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,990
one of the experiences my life standing
at the west end of the Cathedral Shark

395
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:23,040
on a bright sunny day when
the, the backend of the
church is still cold and dark.

396
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,000
But all of these beautiful blue light
streaming through streaming through the

397
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:28,950
stained glass in music,

398
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,490
it often happens sometimes maybe with
Gustaf Moller but Patrik particularly with

399
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:38,220
Mozart, particularly with Mozart.
And I think it has to do with the,

400
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,650
the sense of,

401
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:43,780
of balance and crystalline clarity,
uh,

402
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,580
that's operating there.

403
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:48,250
So that's what you get with most
started crystalline clarity,

404
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:52,570
balance and performance, uh,
balancing and proportion.

405
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:57,870
And sometimes with Mozart You
get vision of Hell as well.

406
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,780
When he switches off into to the minors.
So it's a,

407
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:06,490
it's a kind of total cosmos.
And I was struck recently, uh,

408
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:10,000
when I came across a
passage of Yohanis Kepler.

409
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,950
Now don't get me wrong here,

410
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,600
I don't sit around reading the
astrophysicists. Yohanas Kepler,

411
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:18,660
I was reading something
else and this happened,

412
00:30:18,661 --> 00:30:22,480
that crop up as quote
from Kepler came up in it.

413
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,720
How many of you in your physics courses,
they mentioned Kepler at all? All right.

414
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:28,870
So, you know, you guys know kept her
a lot better than I do. Let's not,

415
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:34,090
let's not put on airs here,
but this is what a Kepler said.

416
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,390
Uh, and it seemed like a really
good passage to me. All right?

417
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:40,990
He's talking about music
here and humanity, man,

418
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:46,230
the ape of his creator has discovered the
art of music so that he might play the

419
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:48,880
everlasting,

420
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:53,881
this of all created time in some short
part of an hour by means of an artistic

421
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,840
Concorde of many voices and instruments
that he might to some extent tastes the

422
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:06,460
satisfaction of God,
the workman through music,

423
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:11,560
God, the workman through
music. Interesting idea.
Now in the same, same vein.

424
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:13,810
However, what does music,
what does art do for us?

425
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:17,440
I was struck there in the
country music hall of fame, uh,

426
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:20,620
on Saturday in which, um, the, you know,

427
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:24,580
you go into these things is rock and
roll hall and you push a button and then

428
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,400
the one of these artists will
come and talk to you or you know,

429
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,190
the recorded thing there or
sometimes they'll play music.

430
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,480
Well they had African American country
singer Charley Pride there. Um,

431
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,580
and he had something to say, ah, I
didn't get it down exactly, you know,

432
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:42,790
verbatim. But this is the gist of
it. I went back and wrote it down.

433
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,980
This is what Charlie pride had to say.

434
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,930
Music is a bridge to my
dis distant memories.

435
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,430
When I hear a piece,

436
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:56,431
it reminds me of a time or an event of
my childhood or my youth music carries me

437
00:31:57,101 --> 00:31:57,934
back.
There.

438
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:03,180
It is a line that links me into
the deep reservoir of my memory.

439
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:09,040
So that, that I think is also true.
That's another thing that music does for,

440
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,470
had called.
And I bet you've experienced this too.

441
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,840
So pristine and the way you hear,

442
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,530
you hear something that reminds you when
you first heard that piece or what you

443
00:32:17,531 --> 00:32:21,430
were doing or perhaps a person
or an environment. So those are,

444
00:32:21,431 --> 00:32:25,360
those are the two advantages of, of
music. There are others you can dance to,

445
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:27,490
which I can relax you, et
Cetera, et cetera. But,

446
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,280
but this idea of tapping into who you are,

447
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,570
you the whole who you are as a person
through a getting you back in touch with

448
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:39,350
your inner memories and
also perhaps giving you hope
that there is something out

449
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:42,730
there better than what we deal
with on a daily basis. Um,

450
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,700
these are two important aspects
of music in it. Interesting.

451
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:49,100
That one would come from
the astrophysicists,

452
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:52,550
Kepler and the other from the
country music singer, Charley Pride.

453
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:56,780
But that's one of the wonders of the
diversity of, of music I suppose.

454
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,910
Um,
okay.

455
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,530
Well we don't guarantee you hear any
kind of divine experience as part of

456
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:05,380
signing up for music.
One 12,

457
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:08,660
the divine transcendental experience
is not an entitlement here.

458
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:13,280
We don't guarantee it. But you may
have years at some point in your life.

459
00:33:13,281 --> 00:33:17,930
And I suspect it will come in
some way in association with art,

460
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:21,620
whether the visual arts,
architecture and music, whatever. Uh,

461
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:24,530
and it may come in music
with music of Mozart,

462
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,410
but how can you sort
of load the dice here?

463
00:33:27,411 --> 00:33:32,180
How can you get things in your favor?
How could you put yourself,

464
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:37,070
you know, success in life is
positioning. Your CSA is lucky. Well,

465
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,700
you put yourself there
to be, to be lucky. Uh,

466
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:43,280
how can you get in a position
to have this experience?

467
00:33:43,281 --> 00:33:47,570
We'll take a look at the sheet. I sit
as sitting there last night, uh, typing,

468
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:50,840
typing this up, seeing him, and we
used to put these lists on the board,

469
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:52,190
but then the list got so long.

470
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:56,930
I just started to just to put them on a
sheet for today. Uh, so here's the list.

471
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,050
Okay.

472
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:02,800
Craig's essential Mozart if you will,
a piano concertos.

473
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:04,690
Mozart's sort of invented
the piano concerto.

474
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:09,520
We're going to watch a concerto
shortly, uh, in, um, in music, uh,

475
00:34:09,521 --> 00:34:12,490
in section.
I'm going to just recommend this to you.

476
00:34:12,491 --> 00:34:15,340
I see we have our performers here.
We're going to go on now.

477
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,750
We'll end up here a little bit with
some, uh, talking about opera here.

478
00:34:19,751 --> 00:34:24,130
You can read through this. Mozart wrote
three great operas, a marriage of Figaro,

479
00:34:24,131 --> 00:34:26,740
Don Giovanni, uh, the magic flute.

480
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:32,020
And we're now going to segue over
to, uh, the discussion of opera.

481
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,770
Uh, what's opera musically?
Heightened drama.

482
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,450
Music is there behind the
drama and it reinforces it.

483
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:44,200
It does the same thing in film.
Ever. Think about horror films.

484
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,690
What's The scariest horror
film you've ever seen?

485
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:52,640
A J Chucky.

486
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,400
Okay. There's, there's one
I don't know about that. Uh,
shining, something like that.

487
00:34:58,401 --> 00:34:59,450
I don't know.
Think of something.

488
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,290
I don't get scared when watching
a movie until what happens.

489
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,710
I see some really scary
visual. Come on. What,

490
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,880
what scares you in movies? So
posting, they took the sound,

491
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,230
the sound track out of these horror films,
you wouldn't be frightened at all.

492
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,530
It's w I think we have a much
more visceral response to sound.

493
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:23,531
And we do two visual images and that's
what's going on globally in opera.

494
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:26,960
And opera, as you know, is made
up of an introductory overture.

495
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:31,961
And then these numbers such as recitatives
where the composer tells you what's

496
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,320
going on. You remember the,
the bugs bunny cartoons,

497
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:39,810
I guess it's Warner brothers
cartoon. Be Very quiet. Hi,

498
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:43,260
I'm hunting. Why bit that
kind of thing, you know,

499
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,210
so that's a rested to teeth.
What's, what's going on. Um,

500
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:52,170
then somebody will come out and sing
about how they felt about what just

501
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:55,570
happened. That's what goes
on in an Aria. And Ari is,

502
00:35:55,571 --> 00:35:58,110
we'll tend to repeat words and,
and on and on.

503
00:35:58,111 --> 00:36:02,730
It goes to give a sense of emotion and
their choruses involved in it from time

504
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:07,710
to time too. As we mentioned, Mozart
wrote three, um, wonderful operas,

505
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:11,010
two of them by the librettist Lorenzo
de Ponti read in Your Textbook.

506
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:14,730
There's a box on Lorenzo dupont. It
absolutely fascinating life, far,

507
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,730
far more fascinating than
fiction could ever make it.

508
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:22,680
But we're going to talk
now about Don Giovanni.

509
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:27,060
Uh, what music is this? Linda? Can
we have the next piece of music?

510
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:32,890
[inaudible]

511
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,033
okay.

512
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,200
[inaudible]

513
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,300
what's that? Nice and loud.
Somebody got it out there.

514
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,040
Overture to Don Giovanni overture.
Don Giovanni.

515
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,920
You headed the basis of your listening
exercise 25 and Sonata Allegro form.

516
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,100
But it's a different side of Mozart,
different sides of Mozart.

517
00:36:57,101 --> 00:37:01,990
This is the demonic demonic Mozart.
It's the story of a Ma as kind of a rake,

518
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,010
misogynist,

519
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:08,011
a woman hater who tries to seduce every
woman that comes into view simply for

520
00:37:08,261 --> 00:37:11,170
the sadistic pleasure of doing so.

521
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,930
So that's the basis of this.

522
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,080
It's an interesting
time in the history of,

523
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:22,110
of intellectual processes and
political process is to here we have,

524
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,950
uh, uh, a story that involves male,

525
00:37:26,951 --> 00:37:31,290
female that don't, don't be distracted
because this is one of our cast members.

526
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,960
It's about to come up with the dog and
he's bringing Richard along with him. No,

527
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,670
no, don't go away. Um, so, uh,

528
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:40,760
we have this conflict between
male and female interests.

529
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,760
We also have the social being played
out here because we have the high class

530
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,130
nobleman who goes around disguised and,

531
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,130
and seducing women as the villain.

532
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,600
And the noble people here are actually
the peasants and servants who are doing

533
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,280
his bidding. So that's the kind of of
tension that exists here in Don Giovanni.

534
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,360
And note the year up there
on the board. 17 uh, what's,

535
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,150
I guess it's on your
sheet for Don Giovanni,

536
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:12,151
right down there at the bottom 1788
the year before the French revolution.

537
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:16,180
Okay. Richard, if you would join
me please, that would be great.

538
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:19,990
We have a guest with us today and we're
going to introduce him. Richard Lawley,

539
00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:24,880
how many of you know who Richard Lolly
is? Okay. Oh God, the famous guy already.

540
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,720
Um,

541
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Richard is a professor of music here at
Yale and what really annoys me is that a

542
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:32,740
year or so ago,

543
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:37,740
he won the single most important
prize at Yale University.

544
00:38:38,361 --> 00:38:43,100
And what is it the prize for the
best teacher at Yale? How many uh,

545
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:46,180
undergraduate instructors do?
We have here? Four, five, 600,

546
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,300
numero uno over there. Uh, but
more equally interesting. Um,

547
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,810
he is also what,

548
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,073
hmm,

549
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,640
incoming master of Jonathan Edwards
college starting for next semester,

550
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,070
starting in January.
And he happens to be a darn good singer,

551
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,690
as you will see here in just a minute.

552
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,750
So we're going to start out here
with a little of this. And, uh,

553
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:13,160
Richard and his friend are going
to help us out here. Hi there.

554
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:18,290
Um, and did, uh, okay. So,

555
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:24,170
uh, so, uh, Jacob come on up. All
we've got here is an Aria first for,

556
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:29,040
um, Leparello who's The servant of
Don Giovanni. He's a kind of, of,

557
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,760
had low on the academic totem pole.

558
00:39:31,761 --> 00:39:35,480
He's kind of like a ta in life here.
So we've called on,

559
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,850
we've called on Jacob,
we've called on Jacob. Oh,

560
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:44,750
there he is. Okay. So this is
Leparello and as you'll notice,

561
00:39:44,751 --> 00:39:49,250
Mozart crafts the music to fit Leparello.
It's not high falutin music.

562
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:51,400
It has a rather narrow range.
It doesn't go with,

563
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:55,400
it has a lot of pattern respite to
in Vinod. And at the very beginning,

564
00:39:55,401 --> 00:39:58,220
Mozart kind of blocks
out this pacing idea.

565
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:01,250
Leparello is down underneath a balcony.

566
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,700
Don Giovanni is up above
trying to seduce Dona Ana, um,

567
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:09,500
and he's impatient and he hates this
position in life in which he has been put

568
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,580
running errands.

569
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,353
Nice.

570
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,333
Yeah.

571
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:31,800
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

572
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:49,900
And thanks to Santana also
who learned this part in one
day, basically, right? Yup.

573
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:54,340
All right, so things have not gone
well this time unexpectedly. Uh,

574
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,520
Ana has been able to rebuff Don Giovanni
and she now wants to unmask him and she

575
00:42:00,221 --> 00:42:03,850
would then find out that he's really the
leading noble men of the town wants to

576
00:42:03,851 --> 00:42:08,470
unmask him. She chases him after him
out of the p runs away, she's screaming,

577
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,190
she calls for her father,
uh,

578
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,460
who is the aging commendatory
and the commendatory, excuse me,

579
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:20,230
they come into Toray, um,
confronts Don Giovanni,

580
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:21,130
uh,

581
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:26,130
tries to challenge him to a duel
and they engage in such a duel.

582
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,280
So let's,
uh,

583
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:32,270
we'll have don Giovanni come up and
let me grab the commendatory music.

584
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:36,640
Oh, don't touch that. Commendatory
music. Great. Here we go. Thanks.

585
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,563
Yeah,

586
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:42,770
so I have, um, Richard,

587
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,390
I'm told that they would like us to
be sort of out here. Okay. All right.

588
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:50,480
So, uh, here comes the commendatory.

589
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:55,400
Here comes the minor music and we're
going to have a confrontation between the

590
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:56,121
commendatory,

591
00:42:56,121 --> 00:43:01,121
the old commander and the
youthful spry vocally,

592
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,080
uh,
skillful Don Giovanni.

593
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,730
Well,
here's the bill

594
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,060
fights with bald head.
Oh,

595
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:27,903
word

596
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:36,780
tried
hard head

597
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:51,140
meeting hall.
Oh,

598
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:56,953
you

599
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,833
is.

600
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:27,420
All right,
we cut that.

601
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:30,923
Yeah.

602
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:40,200
So then there is a little dining
scene and if I were blocking this,

603
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,830
I would have don Giovanni,
something like this,

604
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,640
having just been stabbed. Okay. Excuse me.

605
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:50,070
The commendatory would
just be stabbed like this.

606
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,900
Don Giovanni was over top of him.

607
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:56,400
Roadside Mozart wrote this exquisite
little trio here. He goes by very quickly,

608
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,570
nobody ever noticed it.

609
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:01,180
But if some of the most beautiful
music that he ever wrote, um,

610
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,670
we ended up on the diminished chord and
then Santana plays a diminished chord

611
00:45:05,671 --> 00:45:08,400
again at the top of that line
where he gets stabbed. Yep.

612
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,790
MMM.

613
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,520
Okay. And then we had this little
trio Leparello are you back there?

614
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:17,970
Leparello okay. Uh, he is just cowering.

615
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:20,010
He just wants to get out and he
just wants to get out of here.

616
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:23,040
This is the worst thing he's ever seen.
Don Giovanni's a bit surprised,

617
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:27,250
but he says you had coming to in the
commendatory is about to, to, uh,

618
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:32,100
buy the farm here. He's on his way out. So
it's just this little, bro, I don't know,

619
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,800
10 12 measures are so of
exquisitely beautiful music.

620
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:36,240
And we'll do it nice and slowly for you

621
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:42,883
dead,

622
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,080
my child.

623
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:08,913
Oh

624
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,653
No.

625
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,590
Okay.
So that's that scene

626
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,290
and on to the next, and we have,
we'll run over a minute or two,

627
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:12,090
but it'll be well worth it.
Uh,

628
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:17,120
Don Giovanni goes onto another seduction
in which he attempts to engage,

629
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,980
uh, in an amorous compromise. The
peasant girl is there, Lena, uh,

630
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:26,550
they engage in a little bit of
recitatives. He makes his advanced.

631
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,800
She is initially intrigued.
Will she

632
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:33,010
succumb to his advances?
Let's find out

633
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,640
afraid of fortune.

634
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,340
I hear too often how,
you know, the mentoring

635
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:02,190
slanderous ravings of the Mbse
all night.

636
00:48:02,191 --> 00:48:07,100
Not both has an honesty native
to his blue. He not afraid

637
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,550
to. Fortunately, we'll be married today.

638
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:17,030
No longer.

639
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:18,843
Yeah.

640
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:21,783
Amen.

641
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:29,913
No,

642
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,350
that's fine.

643
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:53,330
Too
small.

644
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,020
Calm to me or no

645
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:19,403
on?

646
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,310
No, no, I'm good.

647
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,830
Why not?

648
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:52,463
Hi.

649
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,613
That's all.

650
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:02,303
Hello.

651
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:44,220
Oh,
no.

652
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:08,283
Ooh.

653
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,873
Hello.

654
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,260
That's it for today. Next week.
We're doing during the demo room.
