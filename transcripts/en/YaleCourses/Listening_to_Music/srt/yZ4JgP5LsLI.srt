1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,660
Okay,
good morning.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,220
You are the last people left standing,
right.

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,690
I can tell you to beginning
of the semester which of
these lectures we'll have

4
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:15,800
the lowest attendance rate and it's this
one and I'll tell you where it's going

5
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:20,150
to peak again as we get closer to the
final exam. But you were the good folks.

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,760
You're, you're here, you're
sticking with it. So good for you.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,300
If you can make it the section on
tonight and tomorrow, that's great too.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,340
What are we doing today?
Well,

9
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:33,110
last time we left off talking about
opera in the 19th century and the session

10
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:38,060
before that we were talking about the
development of the piano in the 19th

11
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:40,970
century. Today, what do we want to do?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,210
We're going to talk about the
development of the symphony,

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,300
specifically the symphony orchestra in
the course of the 19th century and it did

14
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:53,600
undergo significant
changes as we will see. Uh,

15
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:57,980
what symphonies have we
visited here in our course?

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,770
Who can give me the name of the
symphony that we have studied?

17
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:03,500
Roger Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

18
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:07,310
We did a lot with at the very beginning
of the class. And he any other symphony?

19
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,610
Elizabeth Beethoven's six,

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,440
which was the basis of the Saybrook
concert. Any other symphonies? Uh,

21
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:20,150
Angela Beethoven's night. Yes, we
talked about that in an earlier lecture.

22
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:24,740
Yadadadada odd, odd. Edd, Edd, EDD
dating. So we've done a lot of Beethoven.

23
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,360
Uh, we haven't [inaudible]
the surprise of good,

24
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,710
the surprise symphony of Joseph
Hide. So we've done some Haydn, uh,

25
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:36,830
anything else we haven't mentioned?
Somebody I thought you might mention.

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,080
Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee
Mozart. Okay. Mozart d minor symphony.

27
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,020
So we've done Mozart, Haydn,
and Beethoven for the most part,

28
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,970
but there's a lot of symphonic composition
after these individuals extends into

29
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:53,030
the early 20th century. And that's
what we're going to track today.

30
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,060
So today's lecture will generally be
about the symphony from one animal to the

31
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:02,720
other.
M you hear about the three B's and music.

32
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:06,260
While these are the two m's
from Mozart to, uh, Gustaf.

33
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,300
Moller let's start with Mozart.

34
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,860
Let's play just a little
bit of his decline and knock
music a little night music.

35
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:17,300
It's a, it's a sort of, uh, divertimento
evening music for entertainment.

36
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:20,120
Let's listen to a little bit about
it and then I'll say something

37
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,170
[inaudible].

38
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,100
Let's stop there. What can we
say about that music? Well,

39
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:57,000
we've talked a lot about this before.
It's very pattern. It's very symmetrical.

40
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:58,590
It's balanced.
We have antecedent,

41
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,110
consequent and they come into
music with the classical period.

42
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,880
What about the orchestra?
Well,

43
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:08,881
it's rather small in that it's
dominated principally by the strings.

44
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:12,670
And we had a couple of listening exercises
where we'd see the strings play the

45
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:17,050
themes and then the woodwinds maybe come
back to echo them or to answer them.

46
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:21,460
But most of the musical material is
getting presented by the, by the strings.

47
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,200
Um,
the texture,

48
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,230
well the texture is rather thin here
because it's not a very big orchestra,

49
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,100
a thin texture. And what can we
say also about the texture? Well,

50
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:38,101
it tends to be rather polyphonic
I'm a phonic or monophonic well,

51
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:43,681
in that case homophonic
homophonic basically you've
got a melody plus a company.

52
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,150
Um,
and we could also say something.

53
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:51,151
We've talked about that this music has
a kind of rhetorical strategy to it.

54
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,100
We have this idea of music.
It sounds like a melody,

55
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:58,930
sounds like a theme or music that sounds
like it's coming between teams that

56
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:03,730
leading a similar transitional music, um,
music that may be a contrasting theme.

57
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,720
Usually that ends a section.
So it's music that does something,

58
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,730
music that's trying to get us from point
a to point B and point c and so on.

59
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:16,870
So it's a sort of rhetorical music,
teleological music,

60
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,350
if you will. Uh, okay,

61
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,670
now let's turn to a
piece of romantic music.

62
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:28,600
And before we do that, I'm going
to say a thing or two about this,

63
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,840
a romantic music. It's a piece, uh,

64
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,600
by Tchaikovsky from his Romeo and Juliet.

65
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:37,590
And I think we have the titles
of the pieces that will be, uh,

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,740
listening to on the board up there today.
So from his Romeo and Juliet,

67
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,940
and you've probably heard this music
before because it used to be a lot of it

68
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:48,220
used to be used in cartoon music.
You know,

69
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:52,300
anytime there's a love seeing this
particular music would, would come on.

70
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:55,720
So what are its qualities
here? Uh, well, first of all,

71
00:04:55,721 --> 00:05:00,490
it has a long sweeping that
melody here in romantic music,

72
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:05,491
long sweeping melody that is
rather a symmetrical in shape.

73
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,590
Instead of having neat units
of two plus two plus two,

74
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,750
it could go on over bars or maybe
it'll be a seven bar phrase,

75
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:16,120
something like that.
So the melodies tend to be long.

76
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:19,330
They tend to be asymmetrical rhythm.

77
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,690
Think about rhythm in the music
that we've been listening to.

78
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,670
My paradigm here is the beginning
of the Brandenburg fifth, uh, uh,

79
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,700
con Concerto Grosso in which the
rhythm starts out [inaudible] it's very

80
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:38,741
regular.

81
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:42,640
It's like a machine gun almost or a
sewing machine or some kind of repetitive

82
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,490
process there.
When we get into the classical period,

83
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,860
rhythm is somewhat more relaxed,

84
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:52,290
but it is still a pattern Dum
de team that Dah, Dah, Dah,

85
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,890
um, bom, bom, Bom, bom.

86
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,800
But here with this

87
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,570
music in the romantic period, the themes
are not only long and asymmetrical,

88
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,780
the rhythms don't seem to shake out in
patterns that allow us to tap our feet or

89
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:12,730
allow us to conduct it easily.
So we have ties over bars.

90
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,330
We have lots of syncopation. We have
irregular phrasing, somewhat irregular,

91
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,950
a metrical patterns as well.
Tempo.

92
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,430
We've talked a little bit about this
before and this idea of tempo robot hoe

93
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:26,630
here in romantic music,

94
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,460
we get wild swings of tempo in that they
can be coming along at a regular pace

95
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:33,050
and then slow way,
way down,

96
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:36,230
and then speed up to get back on
track and slow down and so on.

97
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,530
And this is part in parcel parcel of the
romantic aesthetic in the sense that it

98
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:47,561
tends to swing wildly from one extreme
to another wildly in terms of rhythm and

99
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:54,410
wildly in terms of dynamics. We can
go from very, very quiet to very,

100
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:57,380
very loud in a way that
Mozart couldn't remember.

101
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:58,730
We were talking about Mozart's piano,

102
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:02,510
which weighed about one 10th of
what this piano ways up here.

103
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:04,880
This piano probably
weighs about 800 pounds.

104
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,910
Mozart's probably weighed
about a hundred pounds,

105
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,410
so this is much bigger instrument.

106
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,180
You can play very quietly on it
or you can make a huge sound.

107
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:16,850
And same thing with the orchestra and
we'll come back to that point today.

108
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,713
Mozart header,

109
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,650
a modest orchestra Mauler at the end
of this period at a huge orchestra.

110
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:24,510
So this allows for these wild swings.

111
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,620
The romantic period is
sort of a bipolar period,

112
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:31,880
I guess in turn in terms of music in
that regard. Okay. Having said that,

113
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:36,881
let's listen to what we might call a
prototypical moment in romantic music.

114
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,060
Out of checkoff skis,
overture to Romeo and Juliet.

115
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,980
Now it starts to build a little
bit of melodic sequence working on

116
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,350
reaching higher and higher

117
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,040
and we'll phase it out there.

118
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,100
So some really remarkable it's made
possible by this newly enlarged orchestra.

119
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,790
So let's talk about this orchestra for
a moment and we're going to reference

120
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:07,791
here our four food types or are
for instrumental groups for uh,

121
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,640
the, uh, for classical art
music, starting with the strings,

122
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,660
we don't really have any new
instruments here in the romantic period.

123
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,280
We still have basically the four
string instruments of violin, viola,

124
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:23,520
cello and double bass.
But they are different.

125
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,610
They're different from the or from the
instrument that Mozart was playing.

126
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,860
What happened? Well, in the 19th century,

127
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,610
the construction of the violin
was changed rather significantly.

128
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,420
And I think I could just sort
of hold my hand out here,

129
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,790
maybe demonstrate this kind of thing.
First of all,

130
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,640
there was a higher bridge put on it.

131
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,560
If you have the bridge holding up the
strings in a an 18th century violin,

132
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,750
it might be like that
19th century violent,

133
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:52,751
like that higher bridge that
allows you to have more tension.

134
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:57,030
It puts more tension on,
on the entire instrument.

135
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,000
And at the same time,

136
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,610
the strings that had been used,

137
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:06,570
which were made of anybody have a sense
of what violin strings in the 18th

138
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:09,440
century were made up.
Um,

139
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,880
Chelsea cat gut sometimes.
Yes, yes. Animal lovers,

140
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:18,470
cat gut more normally sheep
guts. Okay. So she got, um,

141
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,180
uh,
and uh,

142
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:24,110
they that wouldn't sustain the attention
that could be put on that was not as

143
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:27,080
great as if you were using a wire string.

144
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,560
So in the 19th century to
technological advances wire, strange,

145
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,170
more tension, higher
bridge, uh, and to co,

146
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,240
well also the fingerboard was extended.
It's longer.

147
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,860
So oftentimes the strata of areas, they
chop off the fingerboard and put another,

148
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,370
a new finger board on it and put
it all back together again. Um,

149
00:10:46,371 --> 00:10:49,040
what else?
Uh,

150
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,420
I know I'm missing one other
important thing. March.

151
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,030
Well maybe that will have to do,

152
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,680
do it for the moment. And what would we
end up? Oh, I know it was a boat. The bow,

153
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,960
the bow.
If you look at an 18th century bone,

154
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:05,380
go to our collection of historical
musical instruments on Hillhouse Avenue.

155
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,590
The amount of horse hair
there is rather narrow.

156
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,700
It's almost double when you get to the
19th century boats. So the bow is bigger.

157
00:11:12,701 --> 00:11:14,440
So the whole thing is more powerful.

158
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,350
And I've asked Jacob just
to bring in his a viola,

159
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,340
which is fundamentally a 19th
century viola in construction.

160
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,580
And just rip through a couple of things
just to give you a sense of the volume

161
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:25,414
of the instrument

162
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,540
playing it.

163
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,320
Okay.
So that's all I wanted him to do.

164
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,730
But just to give you a sense that's
a big rich south play. A couple of,

165
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,160
can you play a couple of chords,
may,

166
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:56,010
maybe the ending of something with
double and triple stop. Too much volume.

167
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,380
Okay,

168
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,820
so big powerful 19th century violin as
opposed to the smaller one that Ma the

169
00:12:11,821 --> 00:12:15,510
Mozart had. Let's talk about the
woodwinds here. In this family.

170
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,680
New instruments were introduced. First of
all, we have the Piccolo up at the top.

171
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,390
We've heard the Piccolo before.

172
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,660
Remember in the storm scene of the
pastoral symphony number six of Beethoven

173
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:28,074
storm scene,

174
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,320
if you wanted to get a sense of the
whistling wind up there and that's what he

175
00:12:31,321 --> 00:12:34,620
did, he had to pick a low point, way
away a pie and you could hear it.

176
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:38,640
There's kind of gave that effect.
Uh, at the other end of the extreme,

177
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:42,690
we have the double, uh, the contract
or double bassoon being added,

178
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:47,490
the low bassoon playing down an
octave lower than a, is that correct,

179
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:49,800
Linda planed down an octave
or even lower than that.

180
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,393
Okay.

181
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,270
It's enormous.
And actually I think the bassoon,

182
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,210
the contra pursuant plays lower than
any instrument in the orchestra.

183
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,370
Is that correct?
In terms of actual frequency.

184
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,730
So it's adding to the both the
high and the low range of the,

185
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,080
of the woodwind family.

186
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:09,250
And a new instrument was introduced
actually it had been around in certain

187
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:12,220
quarters,
a new instrument called the English horn.

188
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:15,660
And I think we have that up
there on our list of terms. Uh,

189
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,540
is the English horn from
England and is it a horn? No,

190
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,500
it's actually from France and Germany.
And it's a woodwind instrument.

191
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:25,120
It's not a brass instrument at all.

192
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,540
It's kind of a low or tenor oboe.

193
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,400
So it's a kind of oboe in a tenor range,
but it has a,

194
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:37,510
a beautiful rich quality to it. And it's
somewhat nostalgic quality. Arguably,

195
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:42,390
the most famous English horn passage is
the one that you're about to hear, uh,

196
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,020
which comes from the slow movement of
divorce shocks, New World Symphony,

197
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,610
which as you might suspect,

198
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:51,700
was written here in the United
States actually in Spillville,

199
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,520
Iowa in New York City and in Spillville,
Iowa.

200
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:58,960
So here's a little bit of the English
horn solo out of the new World Symphony.

201
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,090
It's lovely. Lovely. It's funny
about using 40 can do for you.

202
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,960
My mother's family would
actually from Iowa farm family,

203
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:10,160
from Iowa and as a child they took
me to spill. I would get in the car,

204
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:13,250
we're going to get culture this afternoon,
pneumo softball games.

205
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:15,740
We're going for culture.
So we went to Spillville.

206
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,880
I can't hear that music without thinking
of that particular family or those

207
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:23,210
particular people in Iowa. It's weird.
It's kind of a, as we said before,

208
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:27,800
music is kind of an entry to the inner
recesses of your memory sometimes,

209
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,180
uh, in any of it. Aside
from that discourteous,

210
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,800
let us continue now with
the brass family. Uh, we,

211
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:37,670
what were the two instruments in the
orchestra that we have encountered up to

212
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:42,230
this point in terms of brass instruments?
What have we heard? And in a symphony,

213
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:47,120
Elizabeth, uh, the trumpet and
the trombone. Okay, fair enough.

214
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:48,440
Trumpet and trombone.

215
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,890
And there's one other important one that
actually was in the orchestra before

216
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:55,700
the trombone. Chris, the
French Horn and employee.

217
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:58,490
In fact that trumpet and French Horn,
we're kind of in their first.

218
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,990
Then Beethoven with the fifth
symphony brings in the trombone,

219
00:16:02,991 --> 00:16:06,920
but it's not until the 19th century
that the trombone gets added to the

220
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:09,650
orchestra. Where does
Beethoven do so? Well,

221
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:14,651
he does it in the finale of his fifth
symphony when he wants this particularly a

222
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,040
powerful brass sound.
So let's listen to the um,

223
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,270
uh,

224
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:28,270
opening of the finale of
the fifth symphony where the
trombones are brought into

225
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:32,480
the orchestra for the first
time for this particular effect.

226
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,160
[inaudible].

227
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,000
So that's how Beethoven gets
this kind of heroic effect.

228
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:33,070
He's doing three things here in the
finale. One switching from minor

229
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,780
major,
uh,

230
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:43,020
he has it's very triadic theme and
he's bringing in the heavy artillery,

231
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,910
the newly invented heavy artillery,

232
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:50,220
or at least newly introduced
heavy artillery of the there.

233
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,950
And it gives it this powerful,

234
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:57,030
if you will in the vernacular sort
of ballsy effect with that brass.

235
00:17:57,031 --> 00:17:59,790
And this got extended to
the low brass as well.

236
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,960
The one family and the brasses that
we've talked about that we haven't really

237
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:07,380
explained in terms of the history
of the orchestra. Is the Tuba here?

238
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,940
When does the Tuba get introduced? Well,
it gets introduced right about this time,

239
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,540
about 1825,
1830 or so.

240
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:19,950
The first composer to
use the Tuba, um, uh,

241
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,980
in an orchestral piece was Hector barely
o's in this San phony phone testes that

242
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,380
we're going to be embracing
and sections, uh, this week.

243
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,030
So we have the Tuba coming in here and
actually it was, as you can see there,

244
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,480
I'm originally an instrument
called the office lead.

245
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,720
It was a French instrument and barely
owes heard this as a kind of giant key

246
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:46,260
bugle in the military bands of the period.
Think of the French Revolution.

247
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:48,390
Think of the Nepal Napoleonic wars,

248
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,150
all of these troops marching up and down
with the brass bands along the showns,

249
00:18:52,151 --> 00:18:53,610
the lycee.
He hears this,

250
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,530
he brings US military instrument into
the symphonic orchestra to add depth to

251
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:00,840
the lower part of the brass.
Says,

252
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,380
let's go back to our
divorce Jacques piece here.

253
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:09,260
Divorce Jacques New World Symphony second
movement. And here we can hear the uh,

254
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,243
uh,
the,

255
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,550
the power and the depth of the
newly enlarge brass section

256
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:52,250
by the two buttons.
So that,

257
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:55,570
that something of the
Brass Group as an ensemble,

258
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:57,970
let's think of these
instruments individually.

259
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,110
If we look back at a symphony by Mozart,
not only is the orchestra stronger,

260
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:06,050
but how he is using these brass
instrument is very different. Uh,

261
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,940
we looked at the French horn before and
we're now going to focus on the French

262
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:11,440
horn in the very beginning of our course,

263
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:15,310
we had professional French horn just
in here, eva heater, and she played.

264
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:19,330
Does anybody remember anything of interest
about the instrument that she played

265
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:21,670
and how it differed from
the modern French horn?

266
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,920
What didn't that instrument have
that the modern French horn has?

267
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:32,660
Uh, Roger Keys. Okay.

268
00:20:32,661 --> 00:20:34,850
Keys or valves. Yeah, that's it. Exactly.

269
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:38,490
Keys or vows that gets
put on the instrument. Uh,

270
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,410
instead of sliding in these crooks
and exchanging the length of pipe.

271
00:20:42,411 --> 00:20:45,950
That way they figured out a way of having
vowels and you could do it quickly and

272
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,600
with keys, but that's a century
invention. 18th Century Horn,

273
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:53,820
just kind of overblown and it could
play some things such as data.

274
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:59,030
I'm very easily repeated pitchers that
[inaudible] at the top upon remember our

275
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,200
horn concerto of Mozart
or a bomb bomb bomb.

276
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:08,560
It could overblow up the harmonic
frequencies up the partials,

277
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:13,060
as we said before, uh, with ease, but it
couldn't play chromatic kinds of things.

278
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:15,310
And as a result, it's kind of
stuck there in the background,

279
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:19,780
kind of providing what I'd like to think
of as a sonic glue for the orchestra.

280
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:24,781
But it rarely plays any solos in the
orchestral fabric outside of the concerto.

281
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,440
Well,

282
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,440
let's see what happens to the French
horn inside of the orchestra here in the

283
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:37,060
19th century where it begins to come
forth as a solo instrument because the

284
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:41,650
melody it can play is so much more
complex and much more interesting.

285
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:46,651
So here's a famous a French horn
lick out of Brahms first symphony

286
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:13,780
[inaudible]

287
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,010
back to the horns.

288
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,920
Listen to the depths. Okay,
we're going to stop it there.

289
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,690
So,
so lovely passage,

290
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:22,260
but it's featuring the brasses and
particularly the Solo French horn.

291
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,480
I guess the thing also did notice here it
is how slow the music is going. Slowly,

292
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:32,190
the music is really just cut of all slow
down and kind of going at a crawl here.

293
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:33,120
Um,

294
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,120
and that's an interesting point about
the whole 19th century notion of time and

295
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:42,820
what they thought about time and
the passage of time, you know, it,

296
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,920
the early 19th century,

297
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:48,921
beginning of the discovery of the whole
discipline of paleontology and how old

298
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:50,540
the earth was and how,

299
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:54,890
how many years a civilization
had existed and so on.

300
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:59,150
And there's all getting extended and
said Biblically, five to 7,000 years,

301
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,890
now it's 25 million years, which of course
has been greatly extended since then.

302
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:08,750
But everything here is being allowed
to slow down. And by way of reference,

303
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:13,670
let's go back to our Mozart here and
think about how he constructed it.

304
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,053
MMM.

305
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,830
Well there we had the,
again,

306
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:25,520
the beginning of Anna Karenina
music and he has a chordal pattern.

307
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:29,840
Triadic going up that pattern last
about four seconds. If it bombed,

308
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,400
two, three, four come down. One, two,

309
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,390
three, four, four seconds on each court.

310
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:43,540
He's moving through his material rather
quickly and we'll say why in a moment.

311
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,600
Now by way of contrast,
let's go to music.

312
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:52,690
Oh 60 or so later years or so later in
the middle of the of the 19th century and

313
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:57,980
focus on an overture by Wagner here
overture to the flying Dutchman.

314
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,143
Um,

315
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:04,420
and we're going to listen to just the end
of this insertive think about how long

316
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:07,030
Wagner can sit on each chord.

317
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,160
Mozart thought he could sit on each
cord here for about four seconds.

318
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,170
How long does Wagner sit on the court?

319
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,160
Okay.

320
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,160
[inaudible] all one chord change

321
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,130
another cord.

322
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,600
There's triadic notes in that one chord.
Changes that to minor,

323
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:48,210
just drops the third down.
Same Chord.

324
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,350
And now back to the original

325
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,990
holding that one.

326
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,753
Okay.

327
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,700
Are we on the counter there?

328
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:11,870
Nine 52 so we had 52 seconds of music
there and we went through three chords.

329
00:26:14,461 --> 00:26:19,020
So we're averaging about 18 seconds
per cord, something like that.

330
00:26:19,021 --> 00:26:23,270
Four or five times more
than Mozart was doing.

331
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:28,020
How can Wagner do that? How can
Wagner do that? What's the difference?

332
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,350
Why did Mozart have to move
through his courts faster?

333
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,820
What's happening in this music?

334
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,020
Supposing you've tried to play that
Wagner music with Mozart orchestra,

335
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,840
it wouldn't work. It wouldn't work.
Once I had this dinky little orchestra,

336
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,140
how many people were in
Mozart's orchestra? Well,

337
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,980
depends on where he was at a given time.

338
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:56,970
Haydn's first orchestra had
16 people in it. Mozart,

339
00:26:56,971 --> 00:27:00,570
when he gave a concert in Vienna,
usually wanted about 30 to 33.

340
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,830
We would get to Beethoven.

341
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:06,750
We're up to 50 to 60 in a typical
Beethoven Ian Orchestra in Vienna,

342
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:10,800
1810 or so. As we move into
the later part of the century,

343
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:14,460
these orchestras keep adding more and
more instruments, more and more players.

344
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:16,200
You've got to balance, well, if
you're gonna have all this brass,

345
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:20,070
you've got a brown ones than with more
string players. So we're getting up to 80,

346
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:24,750
90 a hundred by the end
of the 19th century.

347
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,680
So this, uh, this is,
um, an important point.

348
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,510
Mozart had a very small orchestra
and as a result, or maybe,

349
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,170
uh,

350
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:39,170
he could get away with what he had
because he had great musical ideas right?

351
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,730
He had to have great musical ideas
because the sound itself wasn't going to

352
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:48,540
rescue him with Wagner
and these later composers,

353
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:52,380
they may not always have to have
the greatest of musical ideas.

354
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:56,380
The triad is not a particularly
novel musical idea. Uh,

355
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,980
but he can get away with just taking,

356
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,480
you can get away with doing that and it
sounds great. I mean everybody, it didn't,

357
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:12,780
we like that Wagner there and then it
sounded terrific and it's just because

358
00:28:12,781 --> 00:28:17,781
he's got this huge orchestra sound
per se is replacing musical idea,

359
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:23,250
Mozart, terrific ideas,
Wagner, terrific orchestra,

360
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,360
and he knew how to, how to use it. So, uh,

361
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,030
being an orchestra allows longer
movements. I have said before,

362
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:34,770
I think it is axiomatic and music,

363
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,820
the more people you have on a
stage or involved in performance,

364
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,670
the longer that performance
is going to take.

365
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,700
And with regard to the symphony,

366
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:49,140
how long does a movement
within a Mozart symphony take?

367
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:52,440
If you were to look at the cds
appear of a Mozart Symphony,

368
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:56,130
what would you guess first movement
of Mozart's g minor symphony.

369
00:28:56,131 --> 00:29:00,990
How long does that go?
Yeah,

370
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:04,080
who said that? I can't. Okay.
Oscar says seven minutes. Yeah.

371
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,390
And actually that's about
right for the g minor symphony.

372
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:09,780
It's ended up one of the shorter ones
that most people will say five to 10

373
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:12,900
minutes, 10 minutes outside.
If we get to Beethoven,

374
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,520
how long will a movement of Beethoven
take? Well, about 20 minutes.

375
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,260
Uh, sometimes with his bigger
symphonies, like three, five, and nine,

376
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:27,470
when we get to, uh, um,
Mahler and Brookner, the, um,

377
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,930
uh, length of the movements
can go on even more.

378
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:34,440
And an entire symphony of Mahler
might go on for an hour and a half.

379
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,550
So these are bigger.

380
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:40,250
The big orchestra has led
to longer symphonies. Um,

381
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:44,740
and the of obviously is very
luxuriant, very opulent, uh,

382
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,060
sound in music,

383
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:51,061
probably never gets any more opulent
than it does here at the end of the 19th

384
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:56,521
century to other aspects involved here
having to do with the physical world and

385
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,940
in a way,
technology of course,

386
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:04,120
the 19th century as the period
of the industrial revolution.

387
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,970
And some of these innovations,
uh,

388
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:11,110
in terms of metallurgy and a design
got applied to musical instruments.

389
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:15,790
For example, how many have ever
played the flute in here? Okay.

390
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,120
A number of people, both male
and female. And if you look,

391
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,670
I remember the video we
saw of a baroque flute,

392
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:26,380
it had actually had very rudimentary
key pad on it and you look at a modern

393
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:29,620
flute and he's got this kid system
with all these things up there,

394
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:33,850
all of the different keys and extenders
and that's all an invention of the 19th

395
00:30:33,851 --> 00:30:38,770
century that it completely reconfigured
the flute and how you play it in the

396
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:42,850
19th century. And we've talked about all
these other instruments that got added.

397
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,770
Uh, so I kind of, technological revolution
was applied to musical instruments too.

398
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:51,300
But the most interesting thing is,
uh,

399
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:56,140
when you got all these instruments
together, how much sound they could make.

400
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,120
Let's say you were in the 19th,

401
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:02,950
you lived in the 19th century and you
wanted to hear the biggest sound that

402
00:31:02,951 --> 00:31:05,380
could be made.
What do you think you would do?

403
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,870
Where would you hear the loudest sale?

404
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:17,310
Um, Jennifer. An Oregon.
Okay, that's good.

405
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,010
That's pretty good. Um, uh,

406
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:25,740
though it wouldn't have sounded as loud
then as it does now because now we're

407
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:30,000
using something else. I'll get to, but
that's a good start. Okay. Anything else?

408
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:34,920
Doesn't have to be musical. What would
get, what would give the biggest sound?

409
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,750
Sarah.

410
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,123
Okay.

411
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,330
I beg your pardon. Acoustics in music
halls. Yeah, we're going to come to that.

412
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,600
But just in the real world,
you're in the city of London,

413
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:50,230
what's going to annoy you the
most? Make the biggest sale. Roger.

414
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,040
A big, uh, possibly a bell. Yeah,

415
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,290
but that's back when we've had
those since the Middle Ages.

416
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,150
I was thinking of two
things. Cannons. PLO. Okay.

417
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,360
Huge firepower there. Huge,
loud sound, deafening war.

418
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:08,290
And one other thing that came in the
19th century steam engines and all the

419
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:11,800
things that it could produce, trains,
steam, whistles, this kind of thing.

420
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:14,530
But the third thing
really is this orchestra.

421
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,310
When all of these new instruments are
coming together in such large numbers,

422
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,970
and once you have them all together,
you've got to have a place to put them.

423
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:26,100
So they started building new
concert halls and concert halls.

424
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,590
A particularly good acoustically,
the model for this,

425
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:32,920
and I don't know if I put this yes, we
did. Okay. It's up there in the board.

426
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,761
It's in Vienna,

427
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:38,761
it's called the [inaudible] and it's a
famous hall and it's a remarkable hall.

428
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,820
Maybe the most perfect musical hall
ever built. That was the prototype.

429
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:48,710
And then other concert hall builders
around the world began to adopt it.

430
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,350
We adopted it here in the United States.

431
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Anybody think of a concert hall in the
United States that is particularly famous

432
00:32:57,171 --> 00:32:58,004
and,
uh,

433
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:03,050
acoustically beautiful outside of Carnegie
Hall that I'll talk about in a moment.

434
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,750
What other one? There's one other, one,

435
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,590
early concert hall in the United
States Symphony Hall in Boston.

436
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,080
If you're ever in Boston,
anybody from Massachusetts here?

437
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,780
Anybody been to symphony
hall? Okay, go in there.

438
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,690
It's a knockoff of the music for Ryan.

439
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:21,260
So if you want to see what Vianna looks
like, go to Symphony Hall in Boston. Uh,

440
00:33:21,261 --> 00:33:26,090
there's another one, uh, that,
uh, is very close to us here.

441
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,880
It's pretty close to the,

442
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:33,140
this design and where is that built?
About the same time.

443
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,863
Our Own

444
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:41,080
Woolsey Hall, a big hall
seating about 2,500 people. Uh,

445
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:44,890
if you're ever in Woolsey, notice the
fundamentally rectangular design on it.

446
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,900
Go in and look at the floor.

447
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:51,930
It has a suspended floor there and it
has a suspended floor for particular

448
00:33:52,061 --> 00:33:52,481
reason.

449
00:33:52,481 --> 00:33:57,481
That floor serves as a resonator and
there are other resonators are around that

450
00:33:58,091 --> 00:34:00,300
we need to go into.
But next time you're in Wellesley,

451
00:34:00,301 --> 00:34:03,100
go in and bounce because
that's in on that floor.

452
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,510
It's designed to have the
sound resonate more. Now,

453
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:12,160
what's the problem with
Woolsey? Why don't, uh,

454
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,830
string quartets like playing and wolves?

455
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,913
Hmm.

456
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:23,550
It's too booming. Okay. It's too
resonant. But what was the model?

457
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,430
The model is,
it gets a Roger.

458
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:28,410
Okay,

459
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:31,440
well, it was partly built for the Oregon.
Yeah. Shit. What's bills for the Oregon?

460
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:35,880
But Woolsey Hall can sound absolutely
marvelous for a symphony orchestra,

461
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:39,540
not booming and not overly resonant.
If what happens,

462
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:41,890
I'm Robert.

463
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,550
If it's full of people because people
absorb sound. So all of the booming,

464
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:52,030
there's the long reverberations cycle
gets sucked out of it into our bodies, um,

465
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,870
as sound absorbers and it produces is
absolutely spectacular symphonic sound.

466
00:34:56,871 --> 00:34:58,940
So that was the model and that's enough.
It's a great,

467
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,160
and I was struck the other
day when he went to Nashville,

468
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,490
they've done the knockoff of the music
for Ryan in Nashville in that Schermer

469
00:35:05,491 --> 00:35:09,290
Horn symphony hall down there too.
It's, it's, it's, I mean it's, it's,

470
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,390
it's brazen, but you know, uh,

471
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,660
just take that design from Vienna and
put it right there in the middle of

472
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:16,940
Nashville. Pretty interesting. Okay.

473
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:20,120
So that's another thing we have
to kind of keep, keep track of.

474
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:23,510
Carnegie Hall is a little bit
different in terms of, of it's,

475
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:26,810
it's designed. Um, all right,

476
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,840
now let's take a look at what I call the
main line here of symphonic composers.

477
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,610
And it's mostly a German tradition,
right? At German symphonic tradition. Uh,

478
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:41,460
but that became the model for the United
States and that's why they brought

479
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:45,180
divorce Jacques here. Tchaikovsky came
to the United States and was involved in,

480
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:49,140
in the opening of Carnegie
Hall in New York City in 1893,

481
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:50,370
uh,

482
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:55,370
as you can see running from Mozart down
to Gustaf Moller not all of them were

483
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,700
German.
A woohoo up there is not German.

484
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,460
Roger Schakowsky

485
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,950
was from where? Russia.
Who else is not German?

486
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,000
Uh, Oscar, I became pregnant.

487
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,873
Um,

488
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:18,160
barely owes, oh yes. I'm sorry. Of course.
Barely. I see. He's of course French. Uh,

489
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:21,530
and we'll talk about it Hayman section
tonight. Uh, anybody else? Well,

490
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:26,370
divorce Jacques, he's check. Okay. So,

491
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:30,810
but they are all in this fundamentally
German educated tradition extending

492
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:34,740
really from Bach in, but he didn't
write symphonies into Mozart. Haydn,

493
00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:36,330
Beethoven down tomorrow.

494
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:39,660
So we're going to go to the end of the
line now and talk a little bit about

495
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:43,530
Gustaf Moller and if you listen to
ever heard a symphony of Mahler,

496
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:47,920
if you've heard any music of
Mahler, raise your hand. Okay.

497
00:36:47,921 --> 00:36:52,870
I would say about a third of,
of our class has, let's, um, uh,

498
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,880
talk about that just for a moment.
Uh,

499
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:59,060
I would say if you haven't
been introduced to Mahler, uh,

500
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,070
don't miss this one.

501
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,870
It's really great stuff and I hope to
be able to convince you of that. Uh,

502
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,460
here today. If you're, you're,

503
00:37:06,461 --> 00:37:10,600
you're kind enough to come along with
this here in this trip along the road of

504
00:37:10,601 --> 00:37:12,580
high art music.
Uh,

505
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,230
and we don't want to miss the pinnacle
in a way of high art music for me.

506
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:20,740
These two m's are very important.
Mozart and Mahler,

507
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,310
they write some really astonishing
music in different kinds of ways.

508
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:28,870
So Gustaf Moller, who was he? Well,
he was a Jew, born in Moravia,

509
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,270
which is a section of checklists.

510
00:37:31,271 --> 00:37:34,510
The Voc Kia got his musical
education in Vienna,

511
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,790
was a pianist and principally a conductor.

512
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:41,380
He earned his living conducting and he
went all around the world conducting,

513
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:45,310
and we'll talk more about that next
time where, where he conducted. Um,

514
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,310
and he composed mostly in the summertime.

515
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,940
He would go out to the Alps and one of
these mountain retreats where you could

516
00:37:51,941 --> 00:37:54,970
have solitude and he would compose.
And in the course of time,

517
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,870
he wrote principally nine symphonies
and something we're going to talk about

518
00:37:58,871 --> 00:38:01,570
next time,
which is the orchestral song,

519
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:05,830
but we're focusing on just one
that symphony today. Indeed,

520
00:38:05,831 --> 00:38:07,690
his first symphony,

521
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,720
1888 it starts in an unusual way
with a kind of homage to Beethoven,

522
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,860
homage to Beethoven,

523
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:18,700
because the beginning of this Mahler's
first symphony sounds like the beginning

524
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,350
of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony,
but let's just listen to a bit of it.

525
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,760
Oftentimes with Mahler,

526
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:29,530
people talk about the cosmic
quality of Ma Maulers music. Well,

527
00:38:29,531 --> 00:38:33,130
what does that mean? What kind of sound
is cosmic? Well, maybe it's kind of open.

528
00:38:33,131 --> 00:38:37,210
Maybe it's kind of hollow. Maybe it
seems to endlessly spacey in that way.

529
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:42,211
So here's a good example of of Mahler
style particularly is cosmic style.

530
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,463
Yeah,

531
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,470
okay.
We'll just stop it there.

532
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:23,370
And those trumpets were sort of offstage
trumpets perhaps giving you more sense

533
00:39:23,371 --> 00:39:25,140
of a far out distance.

534
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,980
So that's the beginning
of the first movement.

535
00:39:28,981 --> 00:39:32,880
And I've put this diagram up here because
it's interesting that so much of the

536
00:39:32,881 --> 00:39:37,260
material that he is working with
derives from a particular complex,

537
00:39:37,261 --> 00:39:41,370
a particular cell of material.
Mauler is a developer,

538
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,690
and that's generally speaking what
this German mainline tradition is into.

539
00:39:45,691 --> 00:39:47,880
Not always.
Schakowsky is not a developer.

540
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:51,560
He has trouble when it comes to
developing themes. But Beethoven,

541
00:39:51,561 --> 00:39:55,530
Mozart of developer, Beethoven is
a developer. Brahms is a developer.

542
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,100
Mauler is a developer. And what
they develop is a, as I say,

543
00:39:59,101 --> 00:40:00,990
a nexus of musical material.

544
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:04,290
So this here is the initial idea.

545
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,600
Um, and we can go back to our
technique. He all team Paul,

546
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,570
be minute,
we'll go back down to the palm palm,

547
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:27,990
which we'll loop back to the tonic.
So we could have one more x down here,

548
00:40:27,991 --> 00:40:30,720
but it's the same x is up
there. All right? So that's,

549
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,750
that's the essential motive
of the first movement. Uh,

550
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,540
let's go on to hear just a little
bit of the second movement,

551
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:39,930
which is a delightful scared.
So here of the first symphony of Mahler,

552
00:40:39,931 --> 00:40:41,130
just the scared.
So,

553
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,333
hmm.

554
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:56,250
All
right.

555
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,030
Just enough of that.

556
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,830
And now we're going to go into a very
strange movement. The third movement,

557
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:06,330
the slow movement, and bring symphonies.
We usually have fast, slow, scared.

558
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:10,230
So fast finale. Well, in the
late 18th, early 19th century,

559
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:14,820
sometimes they'd switched those. They
put the scare. So number two, and then Z,

560
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,940
sketch of minuet number two,
and then the slow movement number three.

561
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:21,600
So here we got the slow movement is
number three. Let's listen to a bit of it.

562
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,410
See if you can recognize the melody
that Maulers working with here.

563
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:56,190
Okay, let's pause it here. I saw a smile
come over Jacob's face out there. Um,

564
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,070
Jacob,

565
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:57,903
okay.

566
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:03,540
[inaudible] Shaka or in German? Bruder
Martin, brother Martin. Forever a shock.

567
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:08,640
Uh, but what happened to, to brother
Martin or for Frere Jacques here,

568
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:13,350
he got zapped into the minor.
Okay,

569
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:18,260
so this is a kind of gloomy
forever Shaka. It's a weird, uh,

570
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,920
a movement in,
in a way.

571
00:42:19,921 --> 00:42:23,460
It's taking the familiar and
making it weirdly unfamiliar.

572
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:27,570
So that's what happens here in
the, uh, uh, slow third movement.

573
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,160
Now we're going to pass on to the, uh, uh,

574
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:35,580
fourth movement because that's the big
ticket item for today, this morning.

575
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:37,920
And I think we have time to cover it.
Um,

576
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:43,100
it's going to start out with this
gigantic kind of opening fireworks of just

577
00:42:43,441 --> 00:42:46,170
pure orchestral sound and introduction.

578
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:48,600
And then a couple of
themes we'll crop out.

579
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:52,380
Did he mean bom, Bom, Bom, Bom,

580
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,380
um,
and then a little bit later,

581
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,570
even bom, Bom, Bom, Bom,
Bom, Bom, bom, Bom, bom.

582
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:03,010
So we have these two themes
here that would be working with,

583
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,120
and we'll pick up some of the
themes a little bit later on.

584
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,960
So let's hear in all get,
get ready for a big explosion here.

585
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,820
The beginning of the finale.

586
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:20,210
[inaudible] [inaudible],

587
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:31,770
[inaudible],

588
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,260
[inaudible],

589
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,200
[inaudible], [inaudible] [inaudible],

590
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,090
we'll

591
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:36,330
can phase that out. So that's the first,
the material there. Uh, and you have the,

592
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,020
using the same kind of exiting
process that we began of course with,

593
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,190
we can make use of it here to kind of
track a, remember these particular themes.

594
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:49,320
Uh, myself, I can't always hear them,
but if I can visualize him, it helps me.

595
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,820
All right, so we're going to now
go on to the second theme area.

596
00:44:53,821 --> 00:44:57,560
He's essentially following our
Sonata Allegro form here. Um,

597
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,750
and we have a long passage.
It goes on for about three minutes,

598
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,620
but it's a quintessential
moment of romantic music.

599
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:08,730
It's along the same lines of the
checkoff ski that we've heard before.

600
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:12,630
So let's just start out here and we'll
listen and we'll comment on what's

601
00:45:12,631 --> 00:45:14,850
romantic about the music
that we're hearing.

602
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:20,720
End of end of transition
here comes to theme.

603
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,770
All right, let's just pause it here for
a second. What's romantic about that?

604
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,190
Go on.
So listen.

605
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,320
Okay. Yeah, it's a lot of Smyrna notes,

606
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:27,950
whether that, yeah, it kind of inspires
us to romance. I'm not really sure,

607
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:32,180
but it's not precise. It's not marching
along. It's not discrete frequencies. Now,

608
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:37,220
what instrument is carrying the melody
here is particularly good at that kind of,

609
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:41,360
oh,
what's the germ German word in Vienna?

610
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:45,080
Schlog goober or something like that
for whipped cream kind of sound.

611
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,610
Probably some German native Germany's
in here. Can tell me. Um, uh, Elizabeth,

612
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:53,930
what instrument is playing that?
The violins,

613
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,560
and this is a,
this is it,

614
00:46:55,561 --> 00:47:00,060
because the violence had this capacity
for Bronto and the slide between pitches,

615
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:03,360
it gives us this kind of romantic effect.
So it's not,

616
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,980
it's not marching along at any kind
of precise way here. Um, all right.

617
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:12,870
So that's my principle point of
warm, lush string sale. Let's go on.

618
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,513
Yeah.

619
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:18,290
Uh,
okay.

620
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:23,090
So we jumped ahead to the next rather
than pausing. You know, that's my,

621
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:27,950
that's my, that's my, that's
my, uh, uh, prob, well, I tell
you what, that's okay. Uh,

622
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,980
we're getting close to end of things
any way. Um, none of the, I think,

623
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:36,530
uh, we really have only about two
minutes left and I do want it to,

624
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,370
everybody was good enough
to show up on time,

625
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:42,310
so I'm going to let you
leave on time. Uh, let's go,

626
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:46,930
just to give you a sense of the sound
here. Let's go to the very end of this.

627
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:51,360
So let's go to, if you would
please, around 1630. Uh,

628
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,420
it's a long moment, about 20 minutes to,
as long we got about two minutes, two,

629
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:56,810
three minutes to go.
Uh,

630
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:01,300
and you're going to hear this
extreme or Castro contrast here, uh,

631
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,870
as it gets bigger and bigger.
Notice that we had a minor theme here.

632
00:48:04,871 --> 00:48:06,340
The same theme comes back,

633
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:11,341
but he takes out all of the chromatic
minor sound and makes it all major and

634
00:48:12,311 --> 00:48:16,240
we're going to get lots of
heroic trumpet's going up
with that addition to our

635
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:18,160
theme.
Think about this.

636
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:23,230
This I'd like to think of
as the last gasp of the,

637
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,680
uh,
traditional high art classical orchestra.

638
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:30,280
It never got any better than this.

639
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:35,281
It never got any bigger than this for
reasons that will maybe comment on after.

640
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,960
So let's listen and in
one comment at the end,

641
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:51,230
[inaudible] [inaudible]

642
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:05,300
[inaudible]

643
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:16,330
and one final thought. Why
did it stop here? Why did,

644
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:19,020
what happened in the history of art,

645
00:51:19,021 --> 00:51:22,950
music to change everything?
Anybody have any idea?

646
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,753
Uh,
Daniel,

647
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:29,650
exactly.
That's what happened.

648
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:33,130
Electronically produced sound
where you could control,

649
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:36,790
you can control the decibel
level and reproduce it.

650
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:41,791
People started staying home and playing
recordings and they could manipulate the

651
00:51:42,191 --> 00:51:45,040
volume anyway they wanted at
that particular point. Okay.

652
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:49,240
Thanks for staying on a have
a great break. We may hope
see it sections tonight,

653
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,030
uh,
and Friday and Monday when you get back.
