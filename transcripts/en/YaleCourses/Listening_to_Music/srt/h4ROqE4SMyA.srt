1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,560
Okay. Now what I'd like
to do is something, uh,

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,060
that you'll probably cut out
because of copyright issues,

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,980
but it's a kind of fun warm up.
Anyway,

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,950
so we're going to go ahead and do
this and then we'll actually start,

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,910
I got about a one minute warm up here,
ladies and gentlemen, and we've got Linda.

6
00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:18,520
Paul is like a Vegas show act.
Okay.

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,060
She's going to warm us up and we're going
to get up and we're going to get into

8
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:22,690
it here,

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:27,690
right off the bat in our exploration
of Dupal and triple meter.

10
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:29,230
So here we go.
Linda Paul.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,270
All right,

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,860
everybody standing.

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,263
It'll be worth it

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,330
for the DUPLO meter.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,950
You have the parked to the
side. It's okay. Pick a march,

16
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,070
which put, gets the downbeat right
or left. Okay. Sorry. Didn't know.

17
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,783
Yeah,

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,220
you can do this on your test too.

19
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,340
10 Julene trees.

20
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,660
Marmalades guy

21
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,600
because you sick white.
Slowly got it.

22
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,813
Go.

23
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,243
Wow.

24
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,750
Okay.
We got that

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,113
bridge.

26
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,870
No,
from the ridiculous to the,

27
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,040
we're going to go to our first slide

28
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,990
and that takes us to the question of sale.
We,

29
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,090
we hadn't never really nailed this down.
I don't think when an instrument,

30
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:58,520
any instrument,
the piano plays a note.

31
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,800
What you hear is one fundamental pitch.

32
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,850
You are also hearing very
small amounts of other pitches.

33
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,090
Usually these get charted out into
the so called overtones 32 partials or

34
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,160
overtones.
And you can see them playing out here.

35
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,550
The amount of force in each of those
partials we'll call it the amplitude of

36
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:25,660
each of the partials varies according
to the acoustical properties of a

37
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:30,610
particular instrument so that each of
these peaks here represents a particular

38
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,360
partial.

39
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,980
But you can see that they do not
decline in any kind of straight decline.

40
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,940
Some of them bump up from time
to time more, um, uh, push.

41
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:44,140
They're more volume there.
So when we hear any particular sound,

42
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:49,141
again we're hearing an amalgam of
many sounds and the particular,

43
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,110
the importance of each of these partials
in the aggregate of sound is what gives

44
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:59,350
it its particular color.
If you've ever worked with a synthesizer,

45
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:00,970
I think in very simple terms here,

46
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:04,810
what an electronic synthesizer
does is to his play with these.

47
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,030
They can push down the seventh partial,
they can bring up the ninth partial,

48
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,860
they can push down the 13th partial and
bring up the 15th and thereby change the

49
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:16,990
sound of the clarinet into a French horn.

50
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,330
They play with these partials
on each of these notes,

51
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,540
but this is just one sound with all
of these other things mixed in to uh,

52
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:29,380
the, the Midland that produces the quality
or Tambour of a particular instrument.

53
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,120
Okay,
that's that point.

54
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,360
Now we're going to go on and review
a few things that we talked about.

55
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:36,670
Last lecture.
Remember we were talking about beat,

56
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:39,940
which is this sort of regular pulse,
the pulse of life,

57
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:42,820
the pulse of music that
comes at regular intervals.

58
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,800
We were talking about the subdivision of
that Paul Paul's the kind of organizing

59
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,830
of that pulse in two meters and that we
had this capacity to indicate what the

60
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,300
meter was by these numbers.
Two, four and three,

61
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:00,970
four for Dupo and triple meter.

62
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:06,150
Remember we were demonstrating
listening to the Ravel Bolero there,

63
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:09,670
we had rhythms super imposed.

64
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:12,040
We had two prominent rhythms up above.

65
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,610
The rhythm is simply these patterns
usually repeating patterns of longs and

66
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:21,820
shore that get super imposed,
as I say,

67
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:26,380
are set up above the
basic beat underneath.

68
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,440
We also learn from the Ravel's Bolero
that nobody actually plays the beat.

69
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,950
That's too basic,

70
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,160
but our mind hearing all of these complex
rhythms extrapolates the beat from

71
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,570
this complexity. Okay. That
by way of a quick review. Now,

72
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:48,160
two other terms that we have touched on.
What's tempo in music?

73
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,220
What's tempo in music? Yes. Gentlemen,

74
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,340
the pace or speed of the of the piece,

75
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,290
particularly the beat, the beat
will, will do control that.

76
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:07,790
So it's the pace or speed of
the beep. Thanks very much. Uh,

77
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,320
we can take a particular here
I'm conducting three one, two,

78
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:17,300
three, one, two, three, one, two,
three, one, two, three, one, two, three.

79
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,140
Obviously I'm accelerating there.
We use the fancy Italian term at cello.

80
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:25,970
Rondo for that, we could be going
with a very fast tempo. Three one,

81
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,890
two, three, one, two, three,
one, two, three and slow it down.

82
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,100
Obviously we would be retarding the
music Ritardando or a retard at that

83
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:39,920
particular point. All right.
With that. By way of background,

84
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:44,921
let's go on to to what we might call
rhythmic devices here to rhythmic devices.

85
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,410
The first is syncopation.

86
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,810
We worked a little bit with
this last time for syncopation.

87
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,620
Let's go to the board over here.

88
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:59,890
If we have a particular rhythm and this
is a rhythm and hear the beats in the

89
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:04,120
meter underneath, we would
be coming along. One, two,

90
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,600
one, two. Uh, okay.

91
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,730
Obviously this is the bar of syncopation.

92
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,030
We did this in section last week,

93
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,140
but you can see that this
node is the syncopated note.

94
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,160
It's jumping into early.
We expect it to sound there.

95
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,080
So what sick a patient is,
is simply a,

96
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:30,230
the insertion of an impulse,
a, uh, a hit, if you will, uh,

97
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,830
at a metrical place that
we do not expect it to be.

98
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:38,420
Usually the metrical impulses on the beat.
With syncopation,

99
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:43,550
the impulse can come suddenly off the
beat comes suddenly off the beat and it

100
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:48,380
kind of gives it a little snapper
jet we jazzy aspect to, uh,

101
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,860
to the music. We talked about
that in the Cole Porter last time.

102
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,170
Here's what I remember
a couple of years ago,

103
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:57,890
there's a clothing store called Tj Maxx,
Tj Maxx.

104
00:07:57,891 --> 00:08:01,320
They had this little jingle
out there yet at that, that,
that, that, that, that, that,

105
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,380
that just a little bit,

106
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,620
and this then you were
supposed to say Tj Maxx,

107
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,670
I'll remember Tj Maxx forever because
of this guy's little syncopation.

108
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,190
It's in there.
We really remember these musical,

109
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:16,790
think about back in your childhood,
your nursery rhymes and capacity,

110
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,000
oral material to be retained.
Okay. Death Dot. Duh.

111
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,860
Here's beat to it jumps into early.

112
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:24,610
This actually I think the
from the Greek Word Cinco,

113
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,420
batch y n k o p e Cinco pay, is
that how you pronounce it? Uh,

114
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,560
but it means to kind of cut short,

115
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,120
to cut short and therefore
get Ian a little bit earlier.

116
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,770
Now the master of syncopation of
course in music was Scott Joplin,

117
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,050
African American composer writing,
uh,

118
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,960
a lot around the area of St Louis in
the turn of the 20th century. You know,

119
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:51,320
his music from pieces
such as the entertainer.

120
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,930
So let's play just a little bit of the
entertainer very slowly. Um, and I,

121
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,600
my question to you is,
where's the syncopation?

122
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,780
Is it in the left hand of the piano
or in the right hand of the piano?

123
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,850
Is it in the base or the melody?

124
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,720
Where's the sake of patient lefthand?
Right. Right. Base is just going, well,

125
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:37,800
what is the base going

126
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,850
in that fashion?

127
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:55,440
One is playing eith those one
and two and subdivided the beef.

128
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,400
Where's the syncopation?

129
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,460
It's their Yachty, the,
the, the, the and so on.

130
00:10:03,461 --> 00:10:04,810
So you're tapping your foot,

131
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,610
you're tapping the beat and a lot
of the music is coming off the beat.

132
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,900
Let's see if we can do that.

133
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,800
Let's see if we can create our
own syncopated orchestra here.

134
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,850
We've got an example up here.
This is the conception of it.

135
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,360
Let's see if we can actually execute it.
What I'd like you to do,

136
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:23,890
everybody tap your foot.

137
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:28,000
We're going to do this in forge just
for just because I think it works out

138
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:32,980
better. So everybody tap your foot
with a four beat. Here we go. One, two,

139
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,990
three, four, one, two, three,
four. I'm nice and loud and on.

140
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,940
I want to hear it. Okay. Now take
your hand on a chair, your notebook,

141
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:44,140
your computer or whatever,

142
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,120
and do sink a patient off of
that according to this pattern.

143
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:51,360
One, two, ready, go.

144
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,920
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

145
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,080
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

146
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,700
uh, uh, uh, Tom.

147
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,710
Okay, good. I see Daniel down
here. He's got this nail. Okay. Um,

148
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,000
so that's what I think a patient is and
it isn't much more difficult than that.

149
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:17,110
The second rhythmic device that we have
to be aware of the music we frequently

150
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:22,000
encounter is this concept of the triplet.
Now, most music that we listened to,

151
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:25,330
and here's a good example
because it, uh, uh,

152
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:27,850
it plays it out so clearly in the melody.

153
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,740
Most music that we listened to
a takes the beat one, two, one,

154
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:37,630
two and subdivides it into two one
and two. And musicians like this,

155
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:40,570
an visit one and two and one and two.

156
00:11:40,571 --> 00:11:42,610
And so each quarter note
has two eighth notes.

157
00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:46,640
We could also take the two ways
notes and divide them into two uh,

158
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,320
16th notes. And then we get oh, one
and a two and a one and a two. I,

159
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,050
or something,
something like that.

160
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,293
Hmm.

161
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:04,140
Yeah. That, that, that, that, that,
that, that, that, but of course, most,

162
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,720
most music,
although it operates that way,

163
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,340
not all music continues in that
fashion. Oftentimes. Occasionally.

164
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,440
Can you hear off the time
somewhere between the two,

165
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:18,630
the beat is divided into three. So what
I've got here is an example of that.

166
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:23,620
It's actually what we call my country.
Tis of Thee, I think. Montana,

167
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,870
the Dotcom, palm, Palm, palm, Palm, Palm.

168
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,000
So that's it. I think it's been set by
a number of composers over the years.

169
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,870
Beethoven said it, uh,
under the heading of God.

170
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:41,780
Save the King George the
third or somebody, uh,

171
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,820
no problem. George third,
probably dead by then. Um,

172
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,250
who was King of England?
Uh, let's say an 18, 10.

173
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,680
Who knows that answer? I don't know.
George. The third would have been dead.

174
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,830
A. Okay. So in any event, we're
coming along toward the end of it.

175
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,043
Oh.

176
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,610
So you can hear ya'll Tathata PARP arm,

177
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,850
the triplet being inserted.

178
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:19,660
So a triplet is simply insertion
of three notes in the place of two.

179
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,560
Not more complicated than that. A,
here's what we expect what that De,

180
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,820
but we get di Di di, di, di, di, di, di,

181
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,700
di yet at decrepit.

182
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:36,270
The interesting thing here is that
the base continues along with the DUPO

183
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:37,480
pattern.
The Bass is going

184
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,380
where the upper voice has.

185
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,470
Beethoven could have made
that base go with triplets.

186
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:48,820
Two actually it's all set up for it.

187
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,940
Both melody in base could
have had the triplet,

188
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,240
but he chose to have the DUPO and
the base, the triple up above.

189
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,030
Let's see if we can do that.

190
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,130
It's a little bit of a
challenge for the performance.

191
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,140
Let's see if you can tap your
left hand to a Dupo pattern. One,

192
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,520
two,
one,

193
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,080
two and then take your right hand and
do a triplet against it in the triple a

194
00:14:14,081 --> 00:14:16,960
pattern. One, two, ready, go.

195
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,480
Yeah. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

196
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,940
one to two. It's harder
in your thing, right?

197
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,160
But that's the kind of
thing that musicians,

198
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:33,161
particularly a percussion players
have to be able to execute.

199
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,910
All right now, um, and
insertion sort of discourses.

200
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:41,930
We're going to talk a little bit about
musical texture, musical texture.

201
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:46,070
This is discussed in your,
in your textbook in example.

202
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,500
In example, are chapter
six in chapter six, uh,

203
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,110
texture and music is the
dispositions of the musical lines.

204
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,780
I was trying to think this morning of an
analogy and I thought I came up with a

205
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:00,250
good one.

206
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,040
It has to do with tapestries and carpets
and things like that where you weave

207
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,880
different strands in in different ways
and somewhere in my deep recesses I have

208
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:12,470
these, these were words, web and warp or
something like that. Does that make any,

209
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:15,470
does that have any resonance
to, you know, all right.

210
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,020
I think it's out there in weaving.
I got to dig it out.

211
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:20,960
I tried to find it on Google
really quick and nothing came up,

212
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,320
but I think there's this idea of how
you organize a tapestry in that fashion.

213
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,760
In any event,
in music,

214
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:29,690
we have different strands and these
trends can be organized in different ways.

215
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:31,190
We simplified by saying this,

216
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:34,190
that there are saying that there
are three fundamental textures,

217
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,170
monophonic texture,

218
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,130
homophonic texture and polyphonic texture.

219
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,450
And to exemplify this one day.
The curve to me.

220
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Well why not take a tune that everybody
knows amazing grace and sort of said it

221
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:53,990
in different ways to exemplify
these three textures.

222
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,950
So that's what we've got on the sheet for
today. Everybody's got the sheet there.

223
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,840
And what I would like to do is
just have every one, all of this.

224
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:05,030
We'll just seeing law here.
We won't sing.

225
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,940
The tech will just sing amazing grace.

226
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:12,470
And what kind of started at pitch
dog? Hey, pretty good today. Okay,

227
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,330
so,

228
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,630
so we'll start it at pitch there and
I'll give you two and then we'll sing law

229
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:21,260
and we will exemplify monophonic texture.
Here we go.

230
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,760
One sing

231
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:28,050
la La la La la La la,

232
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:31,760
la La.

233
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,000
Okay.
That's all we have to do.

234
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,750
You don't have to read the notes cause
you've got the, the sound in your ears,

235
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:40,620
part of your oral memory.
So that's monophonic texture.

236
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,480
Just one pitch actually. Was it just
one pitch? What do you think about that?

237
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,630
How many pitches? Let's do this
again. We'll sing it again.

238
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,890
How many actual frequencies are
we generating here? One sick,

239
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,810
la, la, la, la, la,

240
00:16:57,811 --> 00:17:01,650
la, la, la La.

241
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,480
So how many pitches are we generating

242
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,290
really to the gentlemen are
singing and one off. Do you have,

243
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,710
we're singing below middle c

244
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,190
and the ladies are singing.

245
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,663
Yeah,

246
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,620
but that's still a monophonic texture.
They'll, those notes have the same names.

247
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,780
W W we were going day gea show.

248
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,420
As long as the notes have the same
names where it sounds the same,

249
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:32,360
even though there may be
Optiv doubling in there,

250
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:36,440
we still think of that as monophonic
texture. Linda, come on up.

251
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:41,010
We're going to exemplify
homophonic texture here. Um, and,

252
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:45,820
and we want you to sing the melody and
we'll try to do the parts underneath it.

253
00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:49,650
It homophonic texture is where
it all lines up pretty together.

254
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,900
All the parts are changing together.

255
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,810
One,
sin,

256
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:00,570
La, la, la, la,

257
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,420
la. Ah, ah,

258
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,070
ah.

259
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,630
One more time. We need it. We're
going to get our third ready.

260
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,573
Safe.

261
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,450
Ah,

262
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,553
yeah.

263
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,230
Ah,

264
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,510
how sweet it is.
Okay.

265
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,370
So that's how sweet sounding homophonic
texture mostly just course. Thanks Linda.

266
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,610
Um, then we can take this and turn
it into something a lot more complex.

267
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:40,470
We'll sing a lot of lines going their
own way. This we call polyphony.

268
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,220
We also used the word counterpoint,
sort of synonymous with it.

269
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,430
So part three down there at the bottom,

270
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:51,600
we've got an example of polyphony where
I've taken the tune and sort of set it

271
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:52,980
against itself a little bit.
Yeah.

272
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,183
MMM.

273
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,420
So it's just a lot more complex.

274
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:30,421
A lot of independent lines going on up
above take of one line sync of a group of

275
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:34,030
lines. Here's one sound,
here's a group of sound.

276
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,551
Different pitches in it.

277
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:40,900
Actually three different pitches near
as opposed to just one pitch, one pitch,

278
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,520
three pitches or three or four pitches.
Moving at different in different ways.

279
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,980
Kind of independent [inaudible].
So that's a different thing.

280
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,950
I'm a monophonic homophonic
in polyphonic texture.

281
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,300
Now we're going to turn focus here just
a bit more on polyphonic texture because

282
00:19:55,301 --> 00:19:58,240
there are two types of polyphonic texture.
Uh,

283
00:19:58,241 --> 00:20:02,530
the first we'll call imitative polyphonic
texture. And here in amazing grace,

284
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:06,790
we really do have imitative polyphonic
texture because you, as you can see,

285
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,900
we have in the base there Inbar to
the base imitating the upper right.

286
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,323
Pardon?

287
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,800
And then toward the end there in bar 13.
Okay.

288
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,253
The base,

289
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,710
and I've added an extra note, it occurred
to me, hey, I could take that theme in,

290
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:30,090
term it up by side down against
itself and it would work.

291
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,270
So that's called musical inversion.
Bock bock would like that he likes,

292
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:40,930
he's kind of mind games with,
with music. So it's complex stuff.

293
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,450
This polyphony work,
this counterpoint.

294
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,650
So this is imitative counterpoint because
there's one idea that keeps back and

295
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,510
back.

296
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,880
Now there's another kind of counterpoint
called free counterpoint where it's

297
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:55,300
highly independent
lines, uh, are sounding,

298
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,780
but they're not imitating one or another.

299
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:02,650
Let's listen to just a section of this.
We should have this,

300
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,460
it's Louis Armstrong and we'll talk
more about Louis Armstrong as we proceed

301
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:08,840
here.
So listen to a good example of,

302
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,820
of non imitative texture.
Polyphonic texture.

303
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,940
Pretty cool stuff, Huh? Where
was Louis Armstrong from?

304
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,890
Chicago actually did recordings in
Chicago, but he wasn't from Chicago.

305
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,040
Where's the heart and soul and jazz
in America? New Orleans, right? Yeah.

306
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,300
That's why it's so important culturally
for the history of the United States.

307
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,610
So what we want to do now is to begin
to think about counting measures,

308
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:04,930
counting majors, accounting majors. Uh,

309
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:07,760
and we're going to do this by
staying with this piece of,

310
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,420
of Louis Armstrong here.

311
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,690
And we need to be able to count measures
so that we can figure out the syntax of

312
00:22:16,381 --> 00:22:21,350
music. Music is a language and it is
made up of his same syntax and syntax,

313
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,050
you know, consists of phrases and the
order in which those phrases occur.

314
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,050
But maybe even before we can
recognize the syntax of music,

315
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:31,350
we have to figure out what a phrase is.
So to do that,

316
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:36,030
we've got to be able to count measures.
How do we do this? Well, musicians,

317
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:39,930
again, have developed a following
sort of process, let's say.

318
00:22:39,931 --> 00:22:43,440
Oftentimes orchestral musicians, they're
sitting there and they're not playing,

319
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:46,140
so they have to be able to
count for a long period of time.

320
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:50,610
So it'd be going along in this fashion.
Let's say it's Dupal one to two,

321
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,550
to three to four,
two,

322
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,630
they're just adding introduced as
on each down. It's a very simple,

323
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:02,200
simple idea. Oops, I may have
hit the wrong button here. Um,

324
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,140
so that's what we're going to do.

325
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,630
Think of these poor French horn
players in the orchestra. They have,

326
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,810
they play so rarely, and then it's
so important when they do play,

327
00:23:09,811 --> 00:23:14,540
they'd be out there 78 to 79 to 82 81,
two.

328
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,880
You've got to count forever.
We won't have to count quite that long,

329
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,900
but even before we can't, we've got to
figure out what the meter of the music is.

330
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,390
So let's start with that.
Now. What's the, uh,

331
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,520
let's go back or I guess we're
going to go to the beginning.

332
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:29,340
What's the meter of this piece? And then
we'll go ahead and count some measures.

333
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,700
Got that.
So it's Dupal meter.

334
00:23:47,701 --> 00:23:50,910
Our brains got all that stuff coming in
there and we're probably focusing a lot

335
00:23:50,911 --> 00:23:53,820
on amazing. Boom. Both the
Tuba that's playing there.

336
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,480
So let's go on now we're going to
hear Louis Armstrong himself. Play.

337
00:23:57,481 --> 00:24:00,600
What instrument did Louis Armstrong play?
Trumpet.

338
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,160
And he had this wonderful rich
sound, but boy it was, it was a big,

339
00:24:05,161 --> 00:24:08,580
huge sound. Kind of the ultimate
in your face trumpet player.

340
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,510
So we're going to hear a solo by Louis
Armstrong now and let's count along.

341
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,900
Once the phrase begins, I'll get you
started and then you count the measures.

342
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:16,763
Here we go.

343
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,510
Let's start it again. I didn't,
it started writing where? Uh,

344
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,980
right where the phrase being, here
we go. Ready? But that's not, no,

345
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,200
they're just to just go back where
you were. That's fine. That's great.

346
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,003
Go ahead.

347
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,820
And then he disappeared.
So how many bars did you count there?

348
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,840
How long was the phrase that be
Armstrong play eight measures.

349
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,890
Everybody agree with that?
Anybody stay?

350
00:24:55,891 --> 00:25:00,891
Seven better say eight in music
asymmetry is not the norm in music.

351
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:05,550
So eight to eight is a good bet there.
Let's go back in here. Another solo.

352
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,070
So wonderful clarinet solo by, by someone
named Johnny Dobbs. Long dead of course.

353
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:12,090
But one of the most beautiful,
beautiful,

354
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:18,110
incredible clarinet solo you'll ever
want to hear. How long is this a solo?

355
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:20,570
How long has this phrase
here by Johnny Dobbs?

356
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,773
Here we go.

357
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,900
1616. So twice as long. But that,
that, that's, that's sort of good news.

358
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,940
A lot of music is made up of these two,

359
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:57,230
four and four for sorts of aggregates.
Uh,

360
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,500
and then we'll just go on to listen
to the end of this where every in,

361
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:07,070
it's hard to know again what the
melody is or what the phrase is here.

362
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:11,990
It's just everybody playing.
Remember, are they using music here?

363
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,110
Could these gentlemen read music?

364
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:19,450
It's not clear that this
particular group could, it's all,

365
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,610
I'm sure Lou Lou yarn trail
would read some music, but again,

366
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,850
we're just getting away of what he's
doing. All of this was was orally,

367
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:31,220
orally transmitted in orally taught.
So let's listen to the end of,

368
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:32,390
it's called willy the weeper.

369
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,670
You're going to have it as one
of your listening exercises.

370
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,380
Let's listen to the end of it here.

371
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,890
Yeah. Okay. Here we go with, okay.

372
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,780
In high school band here,
what do you call that at the end?

373
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,460
You still call it that Stinger.

374
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,700
The end sort of a syncopated
bounce at the end of the day.

375
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,540
How long was that particular phrase?
16 bars there again,

376
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,500
and they are perfect example of free
counterpoint. You've got the trombone,

377
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:26,500
the clarinet.
The Trump,

378
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:30,300
but they're all just doing their own
thing in the context of the harmonies that

379
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:34,020
are playing out here. And it's just,
it's just magical. Just magical.

380
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,000
I think we're happy music,
right?

381
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,260
How could you possibly be sad when
listening to that kind of music and they

382
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,990
played this kind of music coming
back from funerals, you know,

383
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:46,020
you're dancing into heaven
is that kind of thing. Yeah,

384
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,800
I bet there's heavenly music
of that short. Uh, okay.

385
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,010
Now let's go onto another thing that
we'll want to be doing here and that I

386
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:57,180
guess he is, um, taking a little
bit of rhythmic dictation,

387
00:27:57,181 --> 00:28:01,980
writing down some simple, some simple
rhythms. How are we going to do this?

388
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,970
Why do we want to do this?
Why do we want to do this?

389
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,390
Because we want to remember things.
Volk Gong.

390
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,810
Amadeus Mozart had a
very good musical memory.

391
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:17,730
There are lots of stories about
Mozart's musical memory. In 1778,

392
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:19,350
he was in the town of Manheim.

393
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,550
He heard a string quartet
by a man named convening.

394
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,070
It was never published
or no recordings of it.

395
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:30,570
Mozart goes to Paris about six months
later. He bumps into Cam beanie. He said,

396
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:32,180
Oh yeah, it can be any. I remember you,

397
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:37,580
I heard your string quartet in Monheim
and he sits down at the piano and plays

398
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:40,710
this thing. You know, he didn't have,
actually, he wasn't studying this thing.

399
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:43,020
It wasn't trying to memorize it.
He heard it just once.

400
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:46,080
Six months later he could remember
will movement of a string quartet.

401
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,270
Another famous story in 1770,
he goes into Rome,

402
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,210
into the Sistine Chapel. It's
holy week. He goes to hear the,

403
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:58,240
the well known Misa Ray ray of, of, of uh,

404
00:28:58,241 --> 00:29:00,480
lay Greg Gregorio Alegra.
Uh,

405
00:29:00,481 --> 00:29:04,020
you're not supposed to copy this
piece because it's supposed to be only

406
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:08,940
performed in the Sistine Chapel.
Mozart in goes in, he hears it.

407
00:29:08,941 --> 00:29:11,910
He and his father walked back to
the end where they are staying.

408
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,020
He writes down this four to five minute
composition note for note and just one

409
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:20,330
city. That's pretty scary,
wouldn't it be, I mean,

410
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,840
just off on a different planet in terms
of your capacity to process or old

411
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,690
material. But we, I can't do
that. I couldn't begin to do
that. How much can I hear?

412
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,930
Two seconds, three seconds, four
seconds. I could probably remember that.

413
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:34,350
And he's hearing multiple
parts, not just melody. Uh,

414
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,090
so we have to come up,

415
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:40,500
we mortals have to come up with some
other device and our device to remember

416
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:42,160
things just to try to write it down.

417
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,040
Because my premise here is
if you can write music down,

418
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,870
clearly you are hearing
it clearly and you,

419
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:52,180
you would have a better chance of
remembering it if you could write it down.

420
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:55,720
So it, it just helps us focus
on these isolated events.

421
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,350
We're not going to try to remember
everything in music too complex.

422
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:03,190
We're going to focus on the simple
salient things. It could be an instrument,

423
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,900
could be an important rhythm.

424
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,440
So let's listen to some more
music of Mussorgsky here.

425
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,850
Modesta Mussorgsky we had that
very interesting piece last time.

426
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:17,320
Polish ox cart where he used
this principle of low sounds,

427
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:22,360
produce, uh, some, uh, sound
waves that stay forever.

428
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,970
And we hear those low
sounds first and last.

429
00:30:24,971 --> 00:30:28,810
So here we're going to hear another piece
from that pictures at an exhibition.

430
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,620
It's called great gate of Kiev.
So let's listen to a little of this,

431
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,250
17 or 1874 I believe,

432
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,020
or 1870 surely.

433
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,680
And let's listen to a bit of it and then
we're going to focus just on the rhythm

434
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:57,050
start can die.

435
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:17,340
Interesting. There are two
possible explanations to to this.

436
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,930
Some of you are going with
a very slow tempo. One, two,

437
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:27,060
one, two others are a bit
uncomfortable. That Dee Dee, Dee Dee,

438
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,410
you're going twice as fast, which
is correct. Well, for our purposes,

439
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,200
both are correct and we'll know how to
figure this out on test. If you say, ah,

440
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,270
you've got two measures here and you're
writing particular symbols will know

441
00:31:39,271 --> 00:31:42,120
that you heard with this, with
the slower possibility, uh,

442
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:44,400
if you've got four measures
and different symbols,

443
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,910
you're clearly subdividing the beat,
but hearing that as the beat. So,

444
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:51,630
so all I'm really interested
in here is the idea that,

445
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,440
that we have a Dupal meter.
Having said that,

446
00:31:55,441 --> 00:31:59,750
let's assume that we do have
the slower tempo here. One,

447
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,480
uh,
let me play a little bit at the piano.

448
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,280
Jimmy, be moving rather
slowly. Let's all sing it.

449
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,820
La,
la,

450
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,150
la, la, la. La La.

451
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,300
Okay. So that's the music.
Now having done this setup,

452
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,360
if you think about it and think about
the fact that what note symbol gets the

453
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:37,600
beat in our course quarter note.
Okay.

454
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,330
Um,

455
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,470
so every gesture of the hand is going
to be the equivalent of a quarter note.

456
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,690
What's going to be my first note symbol?

457
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,680
MMM,

458
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:48,530
yeah,

459
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,840
yeah. I have no, here's one
gesture. Here's another gesture.

460
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,900
MMM.

461
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,400
MMM.

462
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:00,700
Okay. So I've got you going there. You
take your piece of paper. Now if you,

463
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:04,130
if you want to hum the piece just quietly
to yourself, that's fine. That's good.

464
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:08,010
If I hear lots of buzzing out there,
that means you're into it. So a home,

465
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:09,920
the piece a little bit to
yourself and with George Skis.

466
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:15,130
Great Gate of Kiev here and pictures of
exhibition and see if you can write down

467
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,630
those particular symbols.

468
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,413
Okay.

469
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,520
Okay, let's sing it again.
Here we go. Ready Go.

470
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,930
La La,

471
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:51,060
la La la,
la La.

472
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,130
Let's focus

473
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,460
la La la

474
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,130
just on that unit that measure

475
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,180
la La la.

476
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,030
Having trouble with this.
Look at this.

477
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:06,220
La La la one gesture to notes,

478
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:09,130
two pitchers law.
What should those,

479
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,790
what should the rhythmic value
of those two pitches? Bee Larva.

480
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,080
Yeah,
too.

481
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,160
And within one beat would
give us eighth notes. Okay.

482
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:21,140
So let's finish it off one more
time. He'll be ready. Go. Okay.

483
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:26,150
La, la, la, la,

484
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,870
la,
la La.

485
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:33,270
So what should we write up here? I lost
my black marker, but that doesn't matter.

486
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:33,670
Okay.

487
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:37,040
La La

488
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,290
la, which I right now,
well those are the two A's.

489
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:44,980
And as we were talking about La La,
then what?

490
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,980
La La

491
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,300
one note for each gesture.

492
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:55,910
And we've just done a rhythmic dictation
of the beginning of Mussorgsky's great

493
00:34:55,911 --> 00:34:58,910
gate of Kiev from
pictures at an exhibition.

494
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,750
So you're not going to forget the this
particular melody and it's because it

495
00:35:02,751 --> 00:35:03,950
sounds so grand.

496
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,980
There's another reason we're not going
to forget it if you focused on it in that

497
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:09,890
way. So when we later on we're dealing
with symphonies and things like that,

498
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:13,700
you'd may be sketching
little motivity can snippets,

499
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:16,310
little rhythmic snippets that
you'll file away. All right,

500
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,200
let's listen a little bit
more to the missorts skeet.

501
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,790
And then we're going to go on just
a bit more to the next excerpt.

502
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:24,800
And here's my question for you.

503
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,970
You're going to hear the violins
play a running scale. Yachty,

504
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,090
Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee
Dee Dee Dee, if our beat is this. Yeah.

505
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,550
T t t t t. T. T. T. T. T. T. T.

506
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:39,810
What note values are in music of the
violinists at this particular moment?

507
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,350
You don't even have to see the score.
You can figure it out.

508
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,513
Yeah.

509
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,050
So what, what, what no value
are they playing their 16th?

510
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:09,060
Because we've got four impulses.
Dizzy yet. T t, t, t, t.

511
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:11,550
T for each beat.
Let's go on to the next here.

512
00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:15,150
Now a couple of questions we could ask.
The theme comes back.

513
00:36:15,151 --> 00:36:16,500
We're going to listen to it again.

514
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:21,830
What string technique of the violins
using at this particular moment and,

515
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,380
and then, uh, what rhythmic
device does the trumpet in Church.

516
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:31,440
So let's focus on the streams first.
We may hear this twice. Go ahead Linda.

517
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:39,210
[inaudible]

518
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,640
okay. To, what are they doing
there? What are they playing there?

519
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:51,900
Tremolo just kind of Filler,
right when we need a big sound here.

520
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:55,300
Let's get the violins to kind of
fill in sonic space. It's kind of,

521
00:36:55,301 --> 00:36:58,670
it must be something in cooking like that.
Use cornstarch or something. A filler,

522
00:36:58,671 --> 00:37:00,410
I don't know. Just to make,
give them something body.

523
00:37:00,411 --> 00:37:02,690
So this is kind of giving
the music body here.

524
00:37:02,691 --> 00:37:06,890
It's no not particular
interest melodically. Now
when the trumpet interest,

525
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,910
something of interest happens, what?
Rhythmic devices. The trumpet ensured him.

526
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:15,110
So let's go back to the same spot. Well
here the Tremolo and then the trumpet.

527
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:18,470
Here we go. Notice that the tempo
is slowed down a bit here also.

528
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:20,560
Yeah,

529
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,760
same,
same passage.

530
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:42,870
[inaudible] [inaudible]

531
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,300
we'll phase it out there. So what did the
trumpet and shirt, what? Rhythmic device,

532
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:06,880
triplets, Jacobi feed, bop, bop,
bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

533
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:11,700
So the focusing on rhythm can tell
us a lot about the detail, uh,

534
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:16,700
going on in pop music or in classical
music in particular. I'd like to end,

535
00:38:16,701 --> 00:38:20,660
I think I have a few minutes here.
I'd like to end with a particular piece.

536
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,190
We were talking about Mozart before,

537
00:38:22,191 --> 00:38:26,060
and we're going to go on now
to talk about Mozart's requiem.

538
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:30,710
It's a requiem mass. What's a mash?
Well, a mass is a genre of music.

539
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,850
Obviously it's a religious service as
well, but it says genre of music like the,

540
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:39,940
where they can share it though. Bach
wrote a mass, Mozart wrote many masses.

541
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:43,900
Beethoven wrote two
important masses and so on.

542
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,520
So it's a genre of music.

543
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:50,140
The requiem mass is a particular
kind of mass. It's a mass,

544
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,750
obviously for a death and burial.

545
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:56,770
And the commemorates of
those who have died. Uh,

546
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,810
unlike the regular mass,

547
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:03,010
the requiem mass has a very special
movement associated with it.

548
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:07,510
It's called the DA's earring. The
day of Wrath. It's just a long,

549
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,430
long texts that set to music.

550
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:13,480
But that text has V is
drawn from apocalypse,

551
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,130
the images of apocalypse.

552
00:39:15,131 --> 00:39:18,980
And have you ever read
the book of Apocalypse or
revelation? You know, it's hell.

553
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:22,330
Fire and brimstone, the
Day of judgment, damnation,

554
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,780
election into the group
of the blessing and so on.

555
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:30,520
So it's a very vivid kind of text,
very vivid kind of texts.

556
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,730
Now I was going to put that text up on
the board. And to be honest with you,

557
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,480
I forgot to do that. So I'm going to
have to see if I can remember this text.

558
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,690
But here's the tea.

559
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:43,710
We're going to focus now on
the two sections of this work.

560
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,110
The conflict totties and
the lock Cremosa Dh Ila,

561
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,740
they are both subsets of the DAC ray,

562
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,330
the confluent totties,
uh,

563
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,470
go the Texas follows Kung
Fu totties melodic t's,

564
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:00,040
woke out and welcome a
coon Benny deek teas.

565
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:04,010
So on one side here we've got
the totties melodic [inaudible].

566
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,350
These are the downed on the other side,
we've got WOCA welcome a call me,

567
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:11,860
call me coon. Benedictus. These are the,

568
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:17,950
the blessing. Okay. Ever
been to a medieval cathedral.
You walk in the front door,

569
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:23,010
Christ in majesty on the left side of
the damned writhing and on the right side

570
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:26,020
are the blessed that looking at good deal,
happier.

571
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,280
So most of them may have had this image
in mind of the damned and the elect,

572
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:34,990
but he sure was able to set it this
text through music by using a couple of

573
00:40:34,991 --> 00:40:39,340
devices. The first of these is
rhythmic. So we're going to turn now,

574
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:42,490
I guess we'll turn off the lights and
we're going to go to a couple of slides

575
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:43,180
here.

576
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,590
Let's take a look at the rhythm
he associates with the dam.

577
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:52,390
Uh, what kind of rhythm do we get
with the day? Well, we're going to,

578
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,380
where would you expect to find the damn
in the high register? The low registers,

579
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:01,570
the lower registers, they're way down
29th Canto of hell or somewhere. Uh,

580
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,780
so here's what we find
and as you can see there,

581
00:41:04,781 --> 00:41:08,500
is this bass rhythm moving slowly or,
or quickly?

582
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,050
Very quickly it's going like this.

583
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:17,370
[inaudible] so

584
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,000
it's also doing what?
Going up or down? Up.

585
00:41:29,001 --> 00:41:32,090
It keeps rising up. This
builds tension. Okay.

586
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,540
Are these folk singing there where
they've got this kind of music? Yeah.

587
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:43,920
Is this called joke music? Step
wise music or jumpy? Skippy music.

588
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,700
Pretty skippy.
Is it constant music or Disney music?

589
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,370
Very dissonant as it major or minor.

590
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,600
Cause you'd get about four things.
He's working with your,

591
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,970
but rhythm is very important.

592
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:04,210
Now eventually the elect to
come here and their rhythm.

593
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,100
What do they have? Are they high
or low? Well, they're way up high.

594
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:10,940
You can see them in the sopranos and
Altos up there and they just sit there on

595
00:42:10,941 --> 00:42:13,040
that pitch.
A long note,

596
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,300
I don't have the next page.

597
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,010
That's what they do. It's
consonant, it's in major,

598
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:34,150
it's high and most important.
The rhythm is very uncomplicated.

599
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,770
The notes are long and slow.

600
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:40,090
So let's listen to Mozart's
depiction of Hell and heaven here.

601
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:46,380
[inaudible]

602
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:30,990
to hill and then back. It goes back and
forth to rhythmically very different,

603
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,600
uh, concepts. Now,

604
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:38,460
Mozart died in December, 1791 he
wasn't planning on dying. Actually,

605
00:43:38,461 --> 00:43:42,300
his death came rather suddenly and he
was working on a requiem that someone had

606
00:43:42,301 --> 00:43:45,600
commissioned from him under
rather mysterious circumstances.

607
00:43:45,601 --> 00:43:49,330
And he began to think of it as well
as his own requiem. Uh, indeed,

608
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,340
he didn't actually finish it up. Brian,
if I could have the next slide please.

609
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:57,330
Here from the Austrian National
Library where I was, uh,

610
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,950
last summer photographing and having a
wonderful time is the last page of the

611
00:44:01,951 --> 00:44:04,620
Mozart Mozart ever wrote here.

612
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:09,390
This is the locking Molson's sort of
breaking off and he doesn't finish this

613
00:44:09,391 --> 00:44:11,960
particular movement. It's the last
movement that he was working on,

614
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:16,110
but he has a student, their fronts
Havi sue smile and sue smile, uh,

615
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:20,610
was given instructions and probably
sketch pages as well as to how to finish

616
00:44:20,611 --> 00:44:24,270
this. So Mozart was able to finish it
and it looks, or, excuse me, excuse my,

617
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,850
was able to finish it and it looks
like this. Next slide please.

618
00:44:26,851 --> 00:44:30,390
Prime here we have a score of it,

619
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,550
of the peace.

620
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,750
And there just a couple of details
that I want to point out here.

621
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:41,660
It begins with what I always hear
is a kind of funeral cortege idea.

622
00:44:41,661 --> 00:44:45,970
Of course it's in minor and the voices
will come in, but the base is going

623
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:57,580
sort of plodding along and a baked sick
Dupo but with a triple subdivision under

624
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:01,940
neath of that.
And then at the words you can see,

625
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:07,130
well maybe you can't see, but the text
is on that terrible sorrowful day.

626
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:10,070
We have the words,

627
00:45:10,071 --> 00:45:15,071
where is it [inaudible] x Favi Law
on which research it will come forth

628
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:20,440
research. It will come up out
of the ashes, homo ratios,

629
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:25,340
the just person to be judged,
the just person to be judged.

630
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,410
And notice how it's like the coffins
opening up and here comes Mozart's soprano

631
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:31,244
line.

632
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:42,380
Wow. What a run. But it's all
kind of texts depiction here.

633
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:47,650
And then in the next page he's going to
take that same rising line and assign it

634
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:51,020
to the basis.
Um,

635
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,590
let's go on Brian to the next slide
and then we're going to go back.

636
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:58,950
Then we have the change of text here,
who week air goal parched a days,

637
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
therefore save God parquet imperative
savers p a zoo yeas who dominate.

638
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:10,250
And at that text what he does
is shift from this dark minor.

639
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,630
And you can write on the words
the age too. He's already

640
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:20,830
mm,

641
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,660
sweet, Major. And then he'll
work his way back, right?

642
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,310
The minor.

643
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:34,290
As the funeral cortege continues and this
time the line will go down instead of

644
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:38,310
rising up. So this goes
on for a while. Uh, Brian,

645
00:46:38,311 --> 00:46:41,370
if we could go back to the previous slide,
we're going to start,

646
00:46:41,371 --> 00:46:42,870
we're going to listen
to the entire movement.

647
00:46:42,871 --> 00:46:46,950
It runs about a barely a four minutes.
So bear with me here.

648
00:46:46,951 --> 00:46:51,330
Will run about 30 seconds over
as we listened to the, uh,

649
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,640
lock Cremosa out of the DAC,

650
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:58,110
right as the requiem mass of Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart written in Vienna,

651
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,510
1791.

652
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,193
Nice and loud.

653
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,573
Yeah.

654
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:53,990
Uh,

655
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,640
[inaudible] hey Courtney.

656
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:23,410
Now the basis

657
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,120
quiet prayer

658
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,040
change to
major

659
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:36,830
and the modulation change of key for
major to back to minor as the Cortez and

660
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,690
start up again. Next slide, right.

661
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:47,770
Nice clarinet sound there.
Here comes our core with the base

662
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
[inaudible].

663
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,083
Hello?

664
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:02,640
[inaudible].

665
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:15,580
So that's the last music of Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart and his pupil.

666
00:51:15,721 --> 00:51:18,710
So smile and a little bit not
to leave you in a somber mood.

667
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,260
Let's listen to Louis Armstrong's,
we'd go out dancing to happen.
