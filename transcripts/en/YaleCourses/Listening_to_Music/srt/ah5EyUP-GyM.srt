1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,880
All Right, ladies and
gentlemen, let's get started.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,820
We are going to continue
our discussion of melody.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:11,920
And last Thursday we were talking
about melody in terms of scales,

4
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:15,250
major scales, minor
scales, chromatic scales.

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:21,060
Then we went on to talk a little bit
about what it is in a melody that makes us

6
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:24,940
feel the way we do about
that particular melody,

7
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:29,941
the major and minor quality of them
in the fact that that quality shows up

8
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:33,550
rather early on in the scale.

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,530
The third step of the scale.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,460
Then we talked about conjunct
melodies and disjunct melodies,

11
00:00:39,461 --> 00:00:43,060
and we ended up talking
about Beethoven's Ode to Joy,

12
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:47,200
which he incorporated in the last
movement of his last symphony,

13
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:48,550
symphony number nine.

14
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:54,150
And we said that that had a particular
quality of phrase construction and a seat

15
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:57,110
and the consequent phrase struggle,

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,560
opening it up

17
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,040
and closing it back down. And I was
thinking over the weekend of all the,

18
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,310
all the pieces that operate that way

19
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,363
and the seating,

20
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,350
consequently,
then it goes all over the extension,

21
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:28,330
the way Beethoven with
all with an extension

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,073
antecedent.

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,450
Consequently, uh, I was thinking
of of a piece of Mozart,

24
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,463
Eh,

25
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,920
Mozart. Well let's listen here just a
little bit of what that really hears.

26
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,643
Okay.

27
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,380
Then Nick, go ahead. Sorry.

28
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,930
[inaudible] that's enough

29
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,920
dumb Patrick. Right. Okay. Don't Patrick.

30
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:43,270
All they did was take the theme with
the Macarena and the strip away all the

31
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:47,100
rhythmic stuff underneath and put an
18th century Alberti based with it and

32
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:47,934
Mozart would have used

33
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,280
and so on.
But the point here

34
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,200
is that even the mock arena is using
this antecedent and consequence for a

35
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,150
structure,
something as basic as that.

36
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,660
So it's sort of endemic to how
melodies are constructed. Uh,

37
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,800
now I was thinking and I always
liked to try to come up with a new,

38
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:18,430
however I'll be at lane brain
ideas for teaching this class.

39
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,540
Supposing I got a student up here, I mean,
melody, what makes a melody beautiful?

40
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,630
What makes a great melody?
Anybody know?

41
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,020
Well if you do let me know cause I
don't know and nobody really knows it.

42
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,300
It's sort of like the
definition of pornography.

43
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:38,940
You can know it when you see it or you
know it when you hear it. Um, so in,

44
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,920
in pursuit of this, I was
trying to think, well,

45
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,450
maybe I'll have a student come up and
try to craft a melody right here. Uh,

46
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:51,250
oh on the spot. And I suppose we could
play with that. But then I said, well,

47
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:54,220
it's probably not a good idea because a,
uh,

48
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,860
no student would really
want to do this and be,

49
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,490
it would probably take too long to
work through all the aspects of it.

50
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,000
So what I did, and this was about four
o'clock yesterday afternoon, I said, well,

51
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:06,130
all right Craig,
you think of a melody.

52
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,530
So I started thinking up
a melody and I can hope,

53
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:10,090
I hope I can remember how it went,

54
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,720
something like that. So what would you
give me as a grade for that melody?

55
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,160
Come on now. Uh, Daniel, what
do I get for that melody?

56
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,803
That was pretty good.

57
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,860
B minus C plus B. Well, we,

58
00:04:56,861 --> 00:05:00,910
this is great invasive grade inflation.
So I'd been inflated up to a B,

59
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:04,580
but it was kind of,
see steam line is um,

60
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,240
it wasn't particularly inspire,
but in,

61
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:11,590
in crafting that it made me think of
all why do I do this at this particular

62
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:14,530
point? And not that well
there's certain parameters,

63
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:18,630
certain confines that we're operating
with. We've got to be in a scale,

64
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,150
certain kinds of phrases,

65
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,690
something ending like that in a piece
that's going to end here tells me that's

66
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:32,470
gotta be in the middle, that can't come
at the end. So there's a syntax here also,

67
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:33,700
we've talked about that before,

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
that musical phrases have to come in a
particular order for them to make sense.

69
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:44,260
So, um, instead of working with my lane
brain melody, let's work with a great one.

70
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,640
We're going to work with a melody by
Giacomo Puccini here and you can see his

71
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:53,170
name on the board up there and getting
a sense of the melody in question.

72
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,230
It's an Aria and we'll talk
about when Ari is later,

73
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,360
but he's an aria from his opera,
Johnny sqeaky.

74
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,060
Now that's not a well
known opera by Puccini.

75
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,300
Can anybody tell me the name of
a better known opera by Puccini.

76
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,630
Tosca. Yup. Madame Butterfly.

77
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,000
I haven't hit the most obvious one yet.
Libel in for example,

78
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:16,240
all rent was based on level and uh,

79
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,590
so he's written a lot of well known opera
as this happens to be a lesser known

80
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:19,831
opera,

81
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:24,831
but it has one sort of drop dead beautiful
melody in the thick oatmeal bomb beat

82
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,750
Bobby no car where a young lady is trying
to in effect constant money out of her

83
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:33,060
father. Um, and it's an odd thing.

84
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:38,061
This thing is so beautiful but trying to
separate her father for money is an odd

85
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:42,690
thought and it occurs rather early
on in the opera too and dramatically.

86
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:44,940
It's not of any particular significance.

87
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,950
It's just happens to be an absolutely
gorgeous melody that you've all heard

88
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,380
many, many times. One
day I was, and you'll,

89
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:54,000
you'll recognize it as
soon as I started to play.

90
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,320
One day I was playing this at home,

91
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,340
my then 13 year old son came in and said,

92
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,130
I know that,
that's beautiful.

93
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,730
That's my boy. He's going
to be a music lover. Yeah,

94
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,460
that's the background
music for grand theft auto.

95
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,630
What's, what's grand theft auto
or Chris? Um, well I found out,

96
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,610
but it shows you that this,
this particular Arya has legs.

97
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:27,320
It's kind of kind of everywhere. So let's
listen to a little bit of Puccini's.

98
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,960
Amil Bambi.
Barberino car.

99
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,443
Okay.

100
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,120
Hey,

101
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,830
okay, let's pause it right
there. Let's pause it.

102
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,490
Okay.

103
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,160
What's kind of neat about that
right at the outset there?

104
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:04,980
What's that?

105
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,813
Ooh,

106
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,020
why did you, again, to our spirit
soar at that particular point.

107
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,860
We've got a large leap there.
It's a leap of a,

108
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,490
of an often we wouldn't
expect you to recognize that,

109
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:21,320
but it's interesting to the fold that in,

110
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:23,210
because we were talking
about actives last time.

111
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,660
So we have this opening phrase
and it's about to be coupled.

112
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:31,661
We're going to continue now with the
next phrase that will complete the

113
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,690
antecedent friends. So we'll listen.
We'll just continue please. Linda

114
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,370
is there. So we're sitting
here. Can you sing the tonic?

115
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,310
Okay,

116
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,250
well that's where we want to know
that that's what you wanted to.

117
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,730
So we're in this step
right above the time.

118
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,930
So that's the end of the aniseed
and frames the opening phrase,

119
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,510
but we're not on the top.
Okay.

120
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,200
So now we're going to continue and you
can imagine we're going to hear some of

121
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:13,400
that same music,

122
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,410
but ultimately it's going to come back
to the tonic hadn't gone away with from

123
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:21,670
it. Okay. Little more please.

124
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,390
Starting again.

125
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,090
Is something interesting happened?

126
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,193
Yeah.

127
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,150
Oh, here's her tonic. We
should be back to our tonic.

128
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,160
But that's not exactly what happened.

129
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,053
MMM.

130
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,880
We went to the melody note,

131
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:20,290
but underneath he harmonized it with an
unexpected harmony. We expected to hear,

132
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,983
we got,

133
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,320
so we were deceived.
They're a little bit,

134
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:29,930
and musicians called
this a deceptive cadence,

135
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,040
a deceptive cage when the whole thing
has been set up to come back to the tonic

136
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:38,750
with the tonic chord underneath, we get
something other than the tonic chord.

137
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,160
So in music we have two kinds of
really a broad categories of cadence.

138
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:44,310
We had this kind of thing called,

139
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,640
or where we come back
to the expected tonic.

140
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:53,510
We call those authentic keens.
We also have another class of,

141
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,320
as mentioned to set deceptive
cadences where we do things such as

142
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,180
we're expecting to go,
we go or we go even more bizarre,

143
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,180
something like that. You keep the
same tonic note in the melody,

144
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:15,210
but you change the harmony underneath,
so that's what Puccini has done here.

145
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,950
Instead of going there,
there,

146
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,150
here is a silly analogy.

147
00:11:23,151 --> 00:11:26,990
One time I was flying into the city of
Minneapolis planes and fasten your seat

148
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:31,440
belts are but Trey's up,
et Cetera, except cetera.

149
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,420
Acceptor were coming debt right in there
where you can see the the tarmac there

150
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:38,180
and suddenly the plane was in her womb,
doesn't land,

151
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:43,750
does a barrel roll most off to the
right circles all the way around.

152
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,160
Announces there was some piece of
equipment on the landing strip and he was

153
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:53,800
doing a flyover in music.
You have to do the kind of thing.

154
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,830
If a composer has set this up so that
you're expecting to go and you don't,

155
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:03,070
you go here. We can't end that
way. We just can't end that way.

156
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:07,420
Do we need our daily supply of tonic?
So what we going to do as a musical,

157
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:08,080
fly over.

158
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,310
He's going to fly all around this thing
again and then come back in and this

159
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:16,580
time land on the tonic.
So let's listen to the fly over

160
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,473
eh,

161
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,530
but it's so lovely he can't stop.

162
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:52,170
So you're going to give you
a little reminiscence of
the beginning. Here's your,

163
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,890
so just a little reminiscent at the
beginning but again coming back in this 10

164
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:22,060
of course anyone at Tata,

165
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:26,870
so that's the structure of an Aria by
Puccini and it is highly structured.

166
00:13:26,871 --> 00:13:27,950
It is highly structured.

167
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,450
Now I want to talk about another Aria
that's structured in a different way and

168
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:34,940
that's by Ricard Wagner.
But before we do that,

169
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:38,960
we need to talk about one other process
in music and that has to do with

170
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:40,790
something called melodic sequence.

171
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,650
And oddly students over the years have
had difficulty understanding and hearing

172
00:13:45,651 --> 00:13:48,500
melodic sequence.
But it's a pretty simple idea.

173
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,830
Melodic sequence is simply the repetition
of a musical motive at a successively

174
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,340
higher or lower degree of the scale.

175
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,440
So I could take a take a motive. Anybody
want to sing a motor for me here, Daniel,

176
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:05,570
you want to sing a motive?
Gimme for notes.

177
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,573
Yeah.

178
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,953
Okay.

179
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,550
So we've set up a
descending melodic sequence.

180
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,830
Now supposing we did this

181
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:35,460
and

182
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,360
so forth,
that's obviously an snd melodic sequence.

183
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,360
So that's what's involved
here in generally speaking,

184
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,800
going down introduces relaxation,
going up, perhaps tension.

185
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,530
Um, all right, so that's a little
bit of a set up with regard to that.

186
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:54,200
So now we're going to work through this.

187
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,510
We'll call it an Aria for the moment
of a Wagner in which rather than a

188
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:00,860
structured units,

189
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:05,861
he's going to continually evolve new music
but using a motive that he presses up

190
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,330
continually through melodic sequence.

191
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:15,260
So it's a slightly different
process of melodic structure here.

192
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,510
Ricard Bogner and not,
um, a very nice man.

193
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,570
Not a very nice man. Did
it, needless to say it. Um,

194
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,650
but he was a spectacular composure and
wrote many great things. And one of them,

195
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:32,090
arguably the best that he wrote
is his opera, Tristan, Tristan.

196
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,780
And it's older, uh, written in 1865.

197
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:40,190
As you can see on the board here and we
should know about it because we here at

198
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:45,191
Yale own the piano on
which Wagner wrote Tristan,

199
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,050
it was at least involved
in part of Tristan.

200
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,290
Next time you are walking
past due over there,

201
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:54,600
you know the health center at 17,
he'll house happening.

202
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,930
There's a building there
rather foreboding looking.

203
00:15:56,931 --> 00:16:00,440
Building inside is a wonderful
collection of keyboard instruments.

204
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:03,590
So go in there sometimes and
look at the Bechstein piano.

205
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:07,360
This German Piano Bechstein
it Wagner worked used when,

206
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:11,780
when working on on Trista.
So we have the um,

207
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,400
uh, the opera and we're going to
start here with a little bit of the,

208
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:21,230
of the plot. It's a story of
this English night, Tristan.

209
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,940
And this Irish princess is older and it's
Trish Danze job to go over to Ireland

210
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:29,750
and sort of pick her up and deliver
back to Cornwall where she's supposed to

211
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:33,650
marry a king mark. But
on the old route, uh,

212
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,430
they inadvertently consume a love potion.

213
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,270
So she is passionately in
love with him and he with her.

214
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,570
So we're going to listen to a little
bit of the overture here. Now.

215
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,900
Wagner actually called it a prelude.
That doesn't matter. Opening,

216
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,050
opening music here to um,
to Tristan.

217
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,400
And I have two questions
for you as we listen.

218
00:16:55,401 --> 00:17:00,401
Hear what instruments are plain and what
musical process is Wagner using it at

219
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:03,290
this point. Okay, Linda.

220
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,393
Okay.

221
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,810
Stop it there. So what instruments were
playing here and that little dialog,

222
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:01,940
the dialog between
families of instruments,

223
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,780
strings and woodwinds. Okay.
Alternating back and forth.

224
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:09,970
The strings were at the lower,

225
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,710
then the woodwinds.

226
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,543
Good answer.

227
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,073
Then it

228
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,693
okay.

229
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,930
And so on. So what melodic
process were they using? Their

230
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,660
sequence sequence.
All right.

231
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,530
And then it sort of chugged
along until we got it.

232
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,453
What's this?

233
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,690
We talked about this before
in regard to Ricard Strauss

234
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,290
that sound
resolving to concert.

235
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,410
So it uses the sequence to work
up to a climax, hits a dissonance,

236
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,020
resulted into concert.

237
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,470
Let's listen to him a little bit further
along here in the prelude. Linda,

238
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:18,090
if you could move it up to seven 10

239
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:23,270
[inaudible] is way up here to see what
level gets higher and higher in the

240
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:33,894
violin.

241
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,930
And you heard the trumpets coming in.

242
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,793
Yeah.

243
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,460
With that chromatic figure, almost
kind of like a sneak rising through it.

244
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:15,060
So it's not only the
rising melodic sequence,

245
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,970
this is highly chromatic music and
that that also produces tension.

246
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,050
How do you make love in music?
Well,

247
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,490
we've got rising dynamic volume.
We've gotten rising sequence.

248
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:32,990
It works up to a climax where there
is dissonance and then release.

249
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,150
So if I'm using rather suggestive
language here, it's done intentionally.

250
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,860
Uh, this is the St Mary Poppins where the
sound of music or Snow White and seven

251
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:47,830
dwarves. This is the passionate
story of Tristan and Isolde, lust,

252
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,770
desire, carnal knowledge
that, that sort of thing.

253
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,640
And how does Wagner give you the sentence?
How does he communicate this? Well,

254
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:59,641
this idea of continually rising sequence
that then hits this climax with a

255
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:05,060
dissident, almost painful this and
it's, and then the resolution, uh,

256
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:10,450
musically to duplicating in an odd way,
life's processes, the climax of the opera,

257
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:11,550
the real climax.
However,

258
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,370
really doesn't come until about
three hours into it at the end.

259
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:20,970
Now we have Tristan
dying of a mortal wound,

260
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,630
uh, is older, is cradling him in her arms,

261
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:29,380
and she seems an Aria,
a, we'll call it an Aria.

262
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:32,770
Wagner gave it a different name,
the Lebus tote.

263
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,040
She's singing about her vision
of their life in the hereafter,

264
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:42,800
in the world beyond in
the celestial realm. Uh,

265
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:47,730
and so it's called a love
death. The Lebus tote here. Um,

266
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,330
and it's typical I suppose of the
conventions of the romantic period, right?

267
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:56,780
This is a 19th century.
This is Romance Tristan and adults.

268
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,590
So we're going to pick this up
about halfway through the, uh, uh,

269
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,180
Lebus toad of, of the
Zolder. Uh, and once again,

270
00:22:07,181 --> 00:22:11,500
we will hear these little snippets,
these motives.

271
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,080
Okay. I don't have absolute pitch. When
you're really annoyed with things in life,

272
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:27,760
you can sometimes at least make some fun,

273
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,840
enjoy it somehow by trying to figure
out what key it's in. Okay. So that was,

274
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:36,400
that was a pipe in f we were listening
to it rather unreserved pipe in ethics.

275
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,240
Okay.

276
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,540
So let's go back to the mid point of
the liebers toe here and we're going to

277
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:44,130
hear these little snippets.
This is not NSC and the consequent,

278
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:48,850
this is a motive being pushed higher
and higher each time to a climax.

279
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,713
Here we go.

280
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:09,300
[inaudible] [inaudible]

281
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,280
[inaudible] [inaudible]

282
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,880
Oh, is it? There it is. It's
glorious. It's Gloria, Sam.

283
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,910
And isn't it nice to have our audio
system working properly? Again,

284
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:20,770
this is really the first day that
has worked properly. Uh, so it's, it,

285
00:24:20,771 --> 00:24:22,540
it sounds wonderful.
It's glorious.

286
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:26,350
It's a glorious climax that Wagner has
been working for for three hours here.

287
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,430
And we've got that we've arrived at and
now he's going to turn everything around.

288
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,440
The entire sentiment is going to change
and I think we should be able to,

289
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:40,360
to enumerate here maybe as many as four
different ways in which Wagner does to

290
00:24:40,361 --> 00:24:43,750
earn our emotions 180
degrees at this point.

291
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:46,480
So we're going to go back and we're
going to listen to the climax again,

292
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:50,110
and then we're going to listen to how
the music changed. And I want you to,

293
00:24:50,111 --> 00:24:53,100
as you sit there to think about
what's he doing here? What,

294
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,220
what you're the composer,
what would,

295
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,180
how do you make something go from a,

296
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,250
a sort of cradle in your
arms to vision of, of,

297
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:07,090
of the world beyond. So think
about dynamics, think about Tiempo,

298
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:10,830
think about these sequences, consonance
and dissonance, et Cetera, et Cetera,

299
00:25:10,831 --> 00:25:12,070
et cetera. Okay, here we go.

300
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:25,410
[inaudible] [inaudible]

301
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,590
hmm. Well I hope you liked
that gorgeous stuff. Uh,

302
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,720
so get me started here. Get me started.

303
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:25,140
What did you hear there? How did he
sort of slow down entire training?

304
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:31,460
Yeah. Okay. The whole thing got
softer. So we're going to take the,

305
00:27:31,461 --> 00:27:34,440
the basics first and that would
be sort of number one on my list.

306
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:37,290
The whole thing got softer.
What else happened?

307
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,320
Okay. Not only soft, although the
voice ended up rather high water.

308
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:44,500
The last salads we've heard

309
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,270
also to ended low and we've talked
about high and low intention,

310
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,290
that sort of thing before softer,

311
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:57,400
maybe lower generally in terms of the
test that to test the Torah or the range.

312
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,620
What else? Yeah, Christina. Yeah,

313
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,380
the tempo got slower. Well, yeah,

314
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,980
there were some points that the tempo
got slower and we'll talk about that in

315
00:28:06,981 --> 00:28:11,330
just a minute if we hit
on anything else here. Um,

316
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:16,180
anything else? Instruments, uh,

317
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:20,590
well they weren't playing with loud.
They weren't quite as obvious.

318
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:22,480
I'm not sure that they
were fewer instruments.

319
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:24,220
My guess is if I were
to look at that school,

320
00:28:24,221 --> 00:28:27,040
that would be huge and everybody
would still be playing. It's just,

321
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:29,870
it sounded fewer because they
were playing more quietly.

322
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,810
What about, um, the Roger,

323
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,550
sorry.
Yeah,

324
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:44,050
he used to, he used the distance.
For example, we had that,

325
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,290
that sneak ideas like
snake in the garden of Eden

326
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,990
was riding around there,
but then

327
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,640
he took it up to or degrees and
folded it in the, to a concert.

328
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:04,090
So it was all very consonant at the end.
What about the sequence

329
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,970
rising? Rising, rising. But here
at the end it started. Yeah,

330
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,310
it's just repeating the same pictures
over and over and over again.

331
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,370
So he took that out of the equation too.
Each are backed out.

332
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:36,240
This idea of the sequence, it's
static at this point. We have Stacy's,

333
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,790
we have a rival stability.
What were,

334
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:43,690
what was the one thing we
haven't mentioned, uh, in
terms of the tonality here?

335
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:52,120
They're at the end. What is
that last step? Very strongly.

336
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:54,520
The,
the tonic.

337
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,890
That's the way it was.
One of the things was kind of cool here.

338
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,680
I'm trying to think of the exact,

339
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,440
that kind of sound.

340
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,650
Supposing I went,

341
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,080
does this have any resonance to you?

342
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,133
Uh,

343
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,230
where are you?
If you hear that sound?

344
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,663
Yeah.

345
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:37,260
Maybe he'll commencement where we sing
hymns or in a church or something like

346
00:30:37,261 --> 00:30:38,370
that.
What we would call that.

347
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,870
Aw.

348
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:47,600
What does that bring to the, it sort
of brings a divine benediction here.

349
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,960
Now is the 19th century.
Like there's more painful minor,

350
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:58,160
but if you feel you have a sense here
at the end that they're living a blessed

351
00:30:58,161 --> 00:30:59,550
that existence in heaven,

352
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:03,180
it may because Wagner has folded in
sort of subliminally you're below the

353
00:31:03,181 --> 00:31:05,700
surface, this, um, uh,

354
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:09,930
cadence that we've have deceptive cadences
and we have another kind of cadence

355
00:31:09,931 --> 00:31:13,440
here called an Amen cadence, um, that, uh,

356
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:17,820
brings an additional resident in
addition to symbolism to the conclusion.

357
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:23,790
So it's a wonderful piece of
music. Um, and uh, maybe we,
we, I think we have time.

358
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:27,330
Let's listen to just the last
few seconds of that again,

359
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:30,390
because it's sort of recaps some
of the points we've been making

360
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,160
back it up even a couple
of seconds before that.

361
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,343
Yeah,
that's good.

362
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,440
Here's the snake going away.
Here's the consonant.

363
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:14,680
Okay. So that's the leavers tote of
Ricard boggling questions about that.

364
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:18,920
Thoughts about that, comments
about that. All right, if not,

365
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,170
let's go on to talk about Mozart.
A little bit more about Mozart.

366
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,040
When here another Aria, uh, by Mozart.

367
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,770
And this one does something a
little bit different than, well,

368
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:30,890
it's a kind of combination of
what we've just studied here.

369
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,070
We've got a highly
structured Aria by Mozart,

370
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:39,100
yet at the same time we're going to see
an example of rising melodic sequence in

371
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:43,880
it. And we have a guest artist today,
Lauren Liberal. So Lauren, come on up.

372
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:44,840
Some of you know,
Lara,

373
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,100
she's in Davenport College and I've
known her for years now because she is a

374
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,120
music major and I've seen you're seeing
in lots of different productions of the

375
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:58,060
school of Music's Orpheus in the
underworld a year or so ago. Um,

376
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:03,550
so Laura and I know that you've sung
with the Los Angeles opera and I remember

377
00:33:04,671 --> 00:33:07,880
that you're saying with
David Stern in Brussels,

378
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:10,700
was it Brussels or Paris
or both? Oh, oh yeah,

379
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,160
she probably the shadow lay
in Paris. Yeah. Yeah. It's
a shadow. A theater there.

380
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:18,100
The big metro changing. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

381
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:22,610
so she used a very experienced singer
and a very, very good singer. So, but uh,

382
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,140
tell us, uh, Lauren, what do you want
to do with this? Here you are at Yale.

383
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:27,710
You could do,

384
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,460
you could become an opera singer or you
hit a good go to law school and worked

385
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:34,420
for Skadden, arps in New York or Los
Angeles or whatever you want to do. What?

386
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,080
Well,
what are you going to do with all this?

387
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:40,180
Um, I would like to pursue a
career in opera last school,

388
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:45,190
not the road from me, although I do
like to argue. I'm sorry parents.

389
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,010
So you're going to have the goal.
So this year that if you're a senior,

390
00:33:48,011 --> 00:33:51,790
are you going to take a year off in an
applied directly to a graduate schools in

391
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:53,650
voice? And where are you
going to apply if you to do,

392
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,700
actually I'm going to go back to
work with David Stern, um, oh,

393
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,470
in Paris for a year and a young
artist program that they have there.

394
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:07,390
You're in that already are.
Yeah, he um, kindly has asked me.

395
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:12,070
David stern was a Yale undergraduate.
He is the son. He was the nicest boy.

396
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:17,340
The son of whom?
Of whom stern does that ring a bell?

397
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,660
I used to extern to the world famous,

398
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:23,590
the Great British violinist of
the 20th century. So David was in,

399
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,010
was an undergraduate here,
graduated probably 15 or so years ago.

400
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:30,730
Went on to a career in music
as a conductor, mostly in
Europe, mostly in Europe.

401
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:34,490
I think. He told me that he
went to ta for this class.

402
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,433
He like,

403
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:40,450
he would come in from time to time
and we would do things in here as an

404
00:34:40,451 --> 00:34:43,840
undergraduate. He was not at
the haven. Well if there's any,

405
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:47,880
was conductor the YSL for a
couple of years too. Yeah. Um,

406
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:51,460
so he would come in from time to time
when we would do different things. So, um,

407
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,630
Laura's have as mentioned,
a very expensive experiencing are,

408
00:34:54,631 --> 00:34:58,270
and we're gonna do a little art ra here
out of Mozart's figure robbers opera,

409
00:34:58,271 --> 00:35:02,860
the marriage of Figaro 1786 called
void case a paytech. So Lauren,

410
00:35:02,861 --> 00:35:07,270
can you tell us something about this,
that this Aria, who's singing it?

411
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,750
This Aria is sung by kid
Rubino who is a young boy.

412
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:17,060
Actually though I'm clearly not a boy
wearing pants for the purpose. Um,

413
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,240
it's called a trouser
role for that reason. Um,

414
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,000
sung by a woman in the Sabra.
Um,

415
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,260
why did they do that? What?
[inaudible] weird opera.

416
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:29,360
People like transvestites
or something like this.

417
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:37,560
There are other roles like this is just
kind of a convention and in opera kind

418
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:38,250
of a convention.

419
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,660
Yeah, he's a young boy. Um, so
maybe they got the higher voice.

420
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:46,610
Yeah, that's right. He's an adolescent
14. And what's he experiencing

421
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:52,070
first? Love, basically our
first lust. Um, he's not true.

422
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:56,790
He's not sure. So, uh, he's
singing to the Countess, uh,

423
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:01,220
with whom he is in love and
with a little help from, um,

424
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,460
Susanna, Susanna. Yeah. Yeah.

425
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,260
So he's not,
he thinks he's in love with the counters,

426
00:36:06,261 --> 00:36:09,590
but maybe it Susan or maybe it's Barbara
arena or maybe it's a broomstick over

427
00:36:09,591 --> 00:36:14,060
there. It's hard to know exactly what
he's in love with it. Age At age 14.

428
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,900
Um,
and that's the confusion here.

429
00:36:17,901 --> 00:36:21,530
So there's a certain palpitation from
time to time in the singing. It's,

430
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:25,880
it's intentional here in a certain
sense of being flustered. Yeah. Almost.

431
00:36:25,881 --> 00:36:29,170
You're agitated, you're flustered, you're
uncertain what all these things are. Um,

432
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,950
we're going to have Lauren seeing
all of this for us. Um, eh,

433
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:38,990
but in order to have this be something
other than just a performance,

434
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:42,470
I'd like to work with through
different pedagogical issues here.

435
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,920
So let's talk about
that just for a second.

436
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:49,130
Now at the outset of this,
and you guys have your sheets out there,

437
00:36:49,131 --> 00:36:52,940
there was a sheet on this music stand
back there. Uh, you've got a sheet.

438
00:36:52,941 --> 00:36:57,010
So take a look at that
and uh,

439
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:00,400
we'll see.
What do you see Marcus?

440
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:04,120
Right down here in the front row. What
do you see on your sheet by way of music?

441
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,320
It's broken up into

442
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,160
two different parts.

443
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,190
Okay.
Three.

444
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,920
And they're labeled
antecedent and consequence.

445
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,450
So Mozart's starts out here with the
antecedent consequence phrase structure.

446
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,010
That was the antecedent.
Here it comes.

447
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:41,640
So antecedent consequence.
Then interestingly enough,

448
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:46,170
when the voice comes in, what does
he do? What did, what did he do?

449
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:49,350
Then you have to sing.
You just don't duplicate what I did.

450
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,990
He actually expands the face
structure, I guess. Yeah,

451
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,540
by adding more material right
in the middle, you know,
too. So we had an a and B,

452
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:02,010
but he, his mind is such, I
mean, I'd never be able to
figure that out. And he said,

453
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,581
well,
Hey,

454
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:06,240
I can open this whole thing up and put
in some additional lovely music and then

455
00:38:06,241 --> 00:38:11,160
close it back down with my consequent
phrase struck. Uh, so we have that.

456
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,380
Let's, let's listen to how that plays
out. So we'll just start with, uh,

457
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,010
with where you come in.
Lonely with Voi. Okay.

458
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:17,993
Hmm.

459
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,853
Rolling.

460
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,370
Okay. And then we go on with a series
of phrases. And as you listen to this,

461
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:52,450
you might count the number of bars and
phrases here, but generally speaking,

462
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:54,640
they're all four bars in length.

463
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:58,420
Mozart is one of the guys who sort of
puts this whole idea of structure with

464
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,430
melody on the Mat structure.

465
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,630
Symmetry are very important
in his compositions.

466
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:08,170
And as we proceed here,
the text gets more and more interesting.

467
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:12,370
We start talking about,
uh, feelings at line five.

468
00:39:12,371 --> 00:39:17,110
They are sent home. Do not fat though,
I feel. How would you train? Well,

469
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:17,630
I guess we have it.

470
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:22,560
Great. Thank you. I feel
as though in Italian. Yeah.

471
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,130
Emotion.
Yeah.

472
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:25,951
Uh,
and,

473
00:39:25,951 --> 00:39:30,880
and then sometimes he'd really happy and
then sometimes he's sort of despairing.

474
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,560
And what's kind of cool it when we
get over to this sparing idea here.

475
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,693
Yeah,

476
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,040
here we go again.

477
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:50,100
Then it's going to be burning like
a flame and then freezing to death.

478
00:39:50,151 --> 00:39:50,984
So we get these

479
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:57,550
weird harmony out here cause
he's freezing and thawing.

480
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,490
So let's hear just a little bit
maybe with, from there at center

481
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,800
dot.
Okay.

482
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,023
No.

483
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,853
Hello.

484
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,280
Okay, now we're going to go onto a little
bit later. Lovely, lovely. Love it.

485
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,690
And we're going to go into a little bit
later if you can follow on your text too.

486
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:55,200
So speed of a Jmo sends oval
there of how B to a tray,

487
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,600
most sensors up there and so on.

488
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:01,200
What does Mozart Joe here
in terms of structure,

489
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,540
a sequence. Um, I think uh,

490
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,290
he repeats the same series of notes,
um,

491
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:13,190
progressively higher sort of to
illustrate Carol Bruno's rising, uh,

492
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,310
an angst slash.
Emotion.

493
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:21,220
Good. So, um, so you pick it up your beef
lot there and I'll try to catch up. Yeah,

494
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,693
it's the spirit.

495
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,443
Hey

496
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,123
Mom.

497
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:54,100
So notice there, uh, how as we come
to the end of that, we work up there.

498
00:41:54,101 --> 00:41:59,080
We have the rises up through the melodic
sequence, rising melodic sequence.

499
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:03,280
We get Lauren hits that high note
up there and then comes off of it.

500
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:07,950
That's the climax, the peak of
the whole Aria. And then the base.

501
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,060
What's the base doing?

502
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,473
It's sort of

503
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:23,390
sneaking back down to the tonic. Okay. So,
and when we get back to the tonic, yes.

504
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,880
Comes in. We're going to pick
it up from there. And um,

505
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:33,380
Lauren, if you could, when we get,
we're going to sink through that.

506
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:35,850
We'll get over there to bog d.
Dot.

507
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:40,680
Just hold on core and we'll ask
them a question. What happened here?

508
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:44,850
What do we have here when we see
if you can hold on that quarter.

509
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,170
Some from the void?

510
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,433
Yeah.

511
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,463
Oh,

512
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,253
hello.

513
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,430
Hello.

514
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,080
Oh

515
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:22,910
Nice. Nice. So what did Mozart do there?

516
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,930
What was that perceptive kid
had a deceptive cadence. Good.

517
00:43:26,931 --> 00:43:31,490
And Marcus scores big today.
So we're sitting here on,

518
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,630
on this,

519
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:36,830
oh,

520
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:37,850
we want it to go,

521
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,480
but instead it goes,

522
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,530
and then we have our fly over.

523
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:53,523
Okay.

524
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,420
And that's the way it is. So you come
back to the tunnel. Okay. We've arrived.

525
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:06,890
We've landed.
All right.

526
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,850
I think we have time to do the whole
thing now from beginning to end,

527
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:13,760
and we'll get our pages and order.
And

528
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:21,430
so Lauren labelle singing void case of
payday from Mozart's marriage of Figaro.

529
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:40,063
Ooh.

530
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:45,843
How's that been?

531
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,373
Maybe.

532
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:05,163
Hello?

533
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,533
Oh Wow.

534
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,273
Hello.

535
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:40,990
Lovely, lovely, lovely.
Aren't we fortunate to have
such talented students here?

536
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:43,060
Yeah. Okay, well thank you all very much.

537
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,230
We'll play a little more Puccini on your
way out, and I hope you enjoy this day.

538
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,420
As beautiful as all this music has been.
