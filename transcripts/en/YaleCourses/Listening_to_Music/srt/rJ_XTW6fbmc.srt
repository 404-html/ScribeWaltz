1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,980
Now today we're going to be talking
about musical impressionism.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,960
Next time modernism, but today, musical
impressionism, impressionism, uh,

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:15,000
generally speaking is a period in the
history of music running from 1880 to

4
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:19,020
1920.
It's mostly a French phenomenon,

5
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:21,480
although it did expand as
we will see to England,

6
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:25,230
into Italy and to the United
States even to some degree.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,340
We have the American impressionist
school of art, for example. Uh,

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,460
let's turn to the board here and
visit some familiar names and faces.

9
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,870
You know, of the painters,
Manet, Monet, Renoir, Alfred, cc,

10
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,820
Camille Pizarro, and the American.
Interestingly enough, American woman,

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,380
Mary Cosat,

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,430
anytime on art museum needs to raise cash.

13
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:55,431
What sort of exhibition do they put on a
blockbuster exhibition of impressionist

14
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:58,260
painting?
That's what brings everybody in.

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,490
It is the locust somehow of
what art is supposed to be.

16
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:06,390
Everybody loves these
impressionist exhibitions,
whether it's Boston, New York,

17
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:10,140
Chicago, wherever it might
be. So we have those artists.

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,840
We also have the poet's though,
interestingly enough,

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,240
they're not called so
much impression as poets.

20
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,950
They're called the symbolist poets.

21
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:19,710
And I'm sure in literature
classes and in French classes,

22
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:24,320
you have studied some of them. Uh,
Charlotte [inaudible] poll of Ireland,

23
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,380
Arturo Humble and, uh, Stefan malar May.

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,540
Turning now to the composers.

25
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:33,810
The most important of these
really is Claude Debussy.

26
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:38,190
He sort of started this
school of French composition,

27
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:42,480
the impressionist style.
Uh, we list others up there.

28
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,520
Maurice Ravel,
we've bumped into Balero of ravel.

29
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,790
Gabrielle for Ray wrote some
beautiful impressions. Music.

30
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,440
You may have heard of parts of the foray,

31
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,550
requiem from time to time or to Reno
RSPB and Italian suggesting that there's

32
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:03,951
also got to Italy and the American Charles
Griffis who died of the influenza in

33
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:05,491
New York City,

34
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:10,491
but wrote some impressionist
piano in orchestral music.

35
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,180
Uh, in terms of the works
of these individuals.

36
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,330
We've listed more over here
for Deb UC than anyone else.

37
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,830
Uh, Clair de Lune that we're going to be
talking about today. That's important.

38
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,240
A prelude to the afternoon of a fawn
will be a hearing, some of that.

39
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:35,241
And you have your listening exercise
40 on the prelude to the afternoon of a

40
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:39,330
fawn. Uh, other orchestral pieces,

41
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,440
a nocturne sort of night mood pieces,
law mayor,

42
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:48,330
a big orchestral
composition, a Emr, more uh,

43
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:48,960
uh,

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,960
orchestral works and then preludes for
piano and will be a foregrounding goes

45
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:56,370
preludes for piano.

46
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,240
I'm here today and a couple of
pieces we list on the board,

47
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,150
the own dean from guests Barden re uh,

48
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:08,590
that will be performed for us later in
the hour today and the Bolero that we

49
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:12,980
have mentioned before. So
those are the players. Uh,

50
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,780
let's take a look now at,
at what this music sounds like.

51
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,810
I'm going to start with playing some
of this piece that you all know.

52
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:25,230
I'm sure you've heard this
before, Claire de Lune, 1890.

53
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,210
We'll pick it up from
there and just a moment,

54
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,150
but obviously we've talked
a little about this before,

55
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,300
this general relaxation caused by the
falling down motive only to rise up at

56
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,143
this point,

57
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,690
but also of interest here is the absence
of any kind of clear cut and meter.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,740
That's I think the big ticket item here.

59
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:32,180
You'd be hard pressed to tap your foot
to this, to conduct this in any way.

60
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,800
So that takes us through, Oh, the
first to 1215 bars of this piece.

61
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:38,180
Now a different kind of music.

62
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,890
Just pause on this for a moment.

63
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:57,840
I'll be emphasizing the phenomenon
of parallel motion today.

64
00:04:57,841 --> 00:04:59,910
Parallelism today.
And here's a moment,

65
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,780
all the voices,
they probably have six different notes

66
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,750
in that cord,
but the next one,

67
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,120
all six are going in the same direction
rather than having going in the opposite

68
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:19,960
direction. We'll continue to
elaborate on that as we proceed.

69
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,040
Okay.
Now another idea comes in here.

70
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,070
Lovely,
really nice.

71
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:01,400
Could Be Chopin, right? That
kind of rich sale almost guitar,

72
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,260
like a company underneath it.
But it's something really neat happens

73
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,173
here,

74
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,520
this cord.
And then we have this

75
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,660
kind of a surprising or
shocking unexpected core.

76
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,810
So that's something else we get here
when this impression, that style,

77
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,360
unexpected cords, new
chords, uh, we might have

78
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,850
normally then we've good go

79
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,950
got a Beethoven type cell,
but getting

80
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,650
going to not courts a
fourth or fifth away,

81
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,900
but courts just a third away.

82
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,643
Yeah.

83
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,600
Well that's another
interesting moment we've had,

84
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,060
we've got this sound here to begin with.

85
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:45,040
Well, that's kind of, and
then the next chord is

86
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:53,340
we haven't had those cords before. We've
had major triads, we've had minor triads,

87
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,900
we've had diminished triads,

88
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,400
and now we got the kind of flip
side of the diminished triad,

89
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,030
the augmented triad.
This is the fourth of our triage

90
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,113
major,

91
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,550
a major third on the bottom and
minor third on top minor changes,

92
00:08:09,551 --> 00:08:12,970
those around minor third on
the bottom of major on top,

93
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,040
major minor.

94
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,780
And we could have when he got the sharp
biting cord called the diminished,

95
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:24,550
if we have just two minor third, just
in most narrow of the, of the triad.

96
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,210
But supposing we had

97
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,910
two major thirds in this aggregate.

98
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,040
Yeah, that kind of sound well, it's a
little bit weird. So we get once again,

99
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:39,540
a new cord here with the impressionists,
the augmented triad,

100
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,710
and they liked to kind of pile them up

101
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,330
in this fashion.

102
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,540
Different sounding kind of
a strange sense. All right,

103
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:57,541
well that's a little bit of Clair de Lune
of Claude Debussy and that introduces

104
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:00,840
us to the impressionist style.

105
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,030
We're going to move on now
to first the first, uh,

106
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,780
orchestral piece of WC.

107
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,880
And that's the prelude to the
afternoon of a fawn that's, uh,

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,490
listed on the board there in 1884,
uh,

109
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,210
WC lamented that he had never
created a masterpiece. Well,

110
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:21,930
he sort of did with this piece. It's a
really a wonderful, wonderful composition.

111
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:24,830
Goes about 10 minutes and
you've got the full, uh,

112
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,670
composition there on
your CD. Number five, uh,

113
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,020
what can we say about it? Well, first of
all, prelude to the afternoon of a fawn.

114
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,910
It's point of inspiration was a poem
by Stephane Mahler. May Malheur,

115
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:43,680
may was a, uh, an aesthetic mentor
of WC. They were close friends.

116
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:48,000
Once a week they would meet and
talk about aesthetic issues, uh,

117
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:52,140
in Paris on the blue bar
Montparnasse area. Uh,

118
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:57,141
so he Mahler may co had written a
poem called the afternoon of a fawn.

119
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,880
Now, this fallen here is not faw
n the little baby deer type form,

120
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:07,650
but FAU in sort of Randy Sater,
a half man,

121
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:12,651
half beast who spends a his afternoon in
pursuit of sexual gratification in the

122
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:18,650
heat of the, of the Mid Day
Sun. So it's a bit more, uh, uh,

123
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:23,610
sexually supercharged. Then
the story of Bambi. Uh,

124
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,580
let's go on and think about, uh, the
type of music that we're about to here,

125
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,930
uh, here. Uh,

126
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,150
it's a different kind of music and maybe
the best thing to do is just jump into

127
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:38,220
it.
For us,

128
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,140
it's difficult to appreciate how
strange this must have sounded.

129
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,390
We're kind of used to this sound we've
got and maybe you've heard augmented

130
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,090
triads and there are a lot of
major seventh chords in Debussy.

131
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,410
Sounds a bit like a jazz chord.
Yeah.

132
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:57,090
Because jazz performers like that sound
that they heard it in an impressionist

133
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,040
and, and they, they, they, they,
uh, um, uh, drew it into their,

134
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,130
their music.
So there are strange cords here,

135
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:08,430
but there's also a strange
orchestration. And once again, it's,

136
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,050
we should remember how unusual this
must have sounded at the time it was

137
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:13,740
created.

138
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,920
So let's listen to a little bit of the
prelude to the afternoon before and

139
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,340
picking it up about,
it's a internal reform.

140
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:24,240
We're picking it up and return to a see
if you can tell me what the meter is

141
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:25,074
here.

142
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,250
Okay, let's just pause it there for a
moment. Anybody know what the meter is?

143
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,260
No,
I don't either.

144
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,400
I'd have to look at the score and I
never look at the score for this course.

145
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,080
It seems like cheating. I shouldn't
have any more advantage than you do,

146
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,390
so it's a little hard to know what it,
what it is there.

147
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,830
I'd really have to go get the music and
find out what it is there a you heard

148
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:17,380
kind of little harp Glissando
is in the background.

149
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:20,430
We'll be talking more about that.
The harp playing away.

150
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,090
There are page shows up periodically.
Dtt, Ttt, TTT. Did EMT team,

151
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:29,990
just little dabs of color underneath
by way of a supporting a compliment.

152
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,890
Sean, let's listen to a
little bit more. Uh, here.

153
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:36,040
Focus on the flute line
that's got the melody,

154
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,220
but it's a kind of different melody
than the melodies that we have been

155
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:40,054
listening to

156
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,230
passed it to the oboe.

157
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,750
Okay. Pausing it there. So that melody,

158
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,230
it was a kind of like, uh, uh,

159
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,460
your form in a way. It's
a, it's a very beautiful,

160
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,100
but it's kind of difficult to sing.
It's chromatic.

161
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:35,380
It doesn't have any
regular structure to it.

162
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,360
And this is typical of the
impressionist approach to melody.

163
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,560
Well, as I say, this was
somewhat shocking at the time.

164
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,090
This is Debbie [inaudible] response
to a poem and you have the poem there.

165
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,270
It's given to you on the sheet for today.
Everybody got the sheet?

166
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,140
We're not going to read it
because we don't have time for it.

167
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,000
It's a good example.
However,

168
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:02,740
it's a wonderful example of this symbolist
poetry where the meaning comes not

169
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:07,270
from any kind of logical,
uh, uh, semantic,

170
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,920
no syntactical presentation of ideas,

171
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,250
one word following the
next logical fashion,

172
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:20,050
but just sort of placing keywords at
interesting moments that stimulate our

173
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:24,820
thinking, have these words have
resonance in and of themselves.

174
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,590
Uh, and I think that in some ways gets
to the essence of this symbolist poetry.

175
00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:33,010
So you can take a look at
that on your own there. Uh,

176
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,130
so Deb UC was not trying to
write program music here.

177
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:40,490
He was just trying to use this as a
point of point of inspiration. Um,

178
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,440
and here's what he said at the time
about his approach to this piece.

179
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,980
The piece is really a sequence of mood
paintings throughout which the desires

180
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:55,291
and dreams of the foreign move
in the heat of the afternoon.

181
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,810
So Miller may then went to the first
concert of this, of this piece,

182
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:04,460
and here's what he said,
intern about Debussy's music quote.

183
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,130
I never expected anything like it.

184
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:12,440
The music prolongs the emotion of
my poem and paints it scenery more

185
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:16,340
passionately than could
colors, paints. It paints it.

186
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:18,560
So music as painting.
Well,

187
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,440
with this idea of music as painting,

188
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:25,880
because these two artistic disciplines
cannot be separated really from one

189
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:26,510
another.

190
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,890
Let's turn to our first slide for
today and we'll see how this works.

191
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,383
Okay.

192
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,460
What's this?
Anybody know this?

193
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,593
Yeah.

194
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,940
Kind of a classic of impressionist
painting like Grand [inaudible],

195
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,570
the frog pond, uh, painted by Monet.

196
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,030
I don't know the date,
probably 1874 75,

197
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:55,390
I would guess.
Um,

198
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:00,170
and we get kind of this general impression
of it if we look however at the brush

199
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:03,930
work of it. And let's go to
that. It kind of close up.

200
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,950
We,
we see here we are,

201
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:13,660
that it's really made up of a series of
individual gestures. Here's a mark there,

202
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,130
mark there. And so, but when we, let's
go to the next slide, stand back.

203
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:22,360
We do get this sort of shimmering
impression and there'll be a lot of that.

204
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:26,310
The same kind of effect worked out
in music. Yes, you can have a cord,

205
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,240
but that cord could be
played as an Arpeggio and you
could pedal with it and you

206
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:35,170
could play it very rapidly and you
wouldn't notice the individual notes.

207
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:40,090
You would kind of get the effect of
the impression of this general wash of

208
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:40,924
sound.

209
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,520
So that in some ways is a similarity
here between these two artistic

210
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:50,170
disciplines. Uh, let's go on to the
next or maybe that makes that point.

211
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,060
Oh No, this is fine. We're going
to go onto a sailboat here now. Um,

212
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,220
and we need mentioned
where this comes from,

213
00:16:57,221 --> 00:17:01,690
but this is a picture of
sailboats sort of Luffing, uh,

214
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:06,340
more or less listlessly at,
at anchor here at a harbor,

215
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:08,650
probably out near [inaudible] to you,

216
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,250
a few miles to the west of Paris.
Uh,

217
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,970
and with this as something of a visual,
the setup.

218
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:20,230
Let's turn to the next piece by Deb UC.

219
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,660
It's one that you have on your cds.

220
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,780
It's called a wall or sales from these
preludes for piano of 1910 and I'm going

221
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:36,520
to start just by playing and then we'll
talk about what it is that I'm playing.

222
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,693
Right?

223
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,190
Okay.
Stop there.

224
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,940
All of that music up to that point is
made up out of a new kind of scale scale

225
00:18:27,131 --> 00:18:29,800
we haven't talked about before,
but now's the time.

226
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,070
It's called a whole tone scale.
Remember when we,

227
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,313
our off

228
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,521
we start,

229
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:41,521
may take a major scale in there are active
divided into seven different pitches,

230
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,330
five whole steps and half steps.
Uh,

231
00:18:46,331 --> 00:18:50,560
but supposing we, we traded in those
two half steps for one whole step.

232
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,400
So instead of

233
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,390
go ahead

234
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,680
see to see you in that fashion, we would
be going, no, I got to do a whole step.

235
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,760
So that's a whole tone scale.

236
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,910
All wholetones within the
octave for total of six of them.

237
00:19:09,911 --> 00:19:14,380
They're just converting to halftones into
one whole time. So all of this business

238
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,670
and so I'm just running up and
down a whole tone scale. All right.

239
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,770
Then at this point where we stopped.

240
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,913
Yeah.

241
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:46,540
Nice. There. Uh, you're, you're listening
to the whole tone scale up above,

242
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,410
but underneath we're getting

243
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,130
rocking and anchor.
What is this in music?

244
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:00,100
Let's repeat something over and
over again. Hey Jay. Ostinato.

245
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:01,000
Thank you very much.

246
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:05,560
So we have Austin autos coming back into
music here in the impressionist period.

247
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,660
Uh,
they were there in Baroque music.

248
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:11,080
They kind of went out of fashion in the
classical period and in the romantic

249
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:14,260
period, romantic is too
expansive for Austin autos,

250
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:16,480
but they come back in here
and impressionist period.

251
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,970
And they're really important
in the modernist period.

252
00:20:18,971 --> 00:20:22,660
So it's a harbinger of things to come
in the modernist period. All right,

253
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,580
now let's go on just a little bit farther.

254
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,120
Well, you can hear the Austin auto
up above and that's a good idea.

255
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,053
Samples,

256
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,670
parallel motion,

257
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,280
all the cords going up and
going down at the same time.

258
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,290
Right.

259
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,690
Stop there. What's that? Well,
it's a class cause exactly.

260
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:13,643
Hold on.

261
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,210
I've a Glissando right?
Is that a lot in television stuff?

262
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:19,560
What's behind curtain number six?

263
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:20,983
Three,

264
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,340
tell us van or whatever.
Um,

265
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:30,030
so it simply playing a Arpeggio
and Arpeggio and very rapid,

266
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,550
very rapid family. Oh,
you could have fashion.

267
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,693
Hmm.

268
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,420
It'd be another sort of Glissando just
playing every white note or, yeah,

269
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:44,520
three black note. Okay. Up on
the keyboard. So I had this book.

270
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,460
All right.

271
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,720
Now let's talk about the scale we have
here because he's actually changed scales.

272
00:22:05,721 --> 00:22:08,730
We did have whole tone,
but now we get

273
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,510
a pentatonic scale.
Just using five notes.

274
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,700
We've bumped into the pentatonic scale
before anybody remember when way back

275
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,180
early on Roger?

276
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,710
I didn't hear that a
little bit loud. Uh, yes.

277
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:42,340
To some extent. It was in that lecture
when we were talking about blues.

278
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,320
Blues tends to use more of a six node
scale. Um, but it was at that very point.

279
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:52,060
What kind of music was it? Emily?
Chinese music. Good for you.

280
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,110
Chinese music.

281
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:57,550
We had the moon reflected in the distant
pool and it was played by an r who,

282
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,770
well here we have another five
note scale. Uh, did they evolve?

283
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,360
Homesteads and minor thirds.

284
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:13,370
Simplest way to think of it as just the
black notes of the keyboard and that's

285
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:14,320
kind of what he's using.

286
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,333
Oh.

287
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,390
Now one other interesting thing
going on and that is the combination

288
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:30,270
of which is what he's doing here of
parallel motion and the pentatonic scale

289
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,673
because,

290
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,193
hmm.

291
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,560
Does that conjure up any, the Chris is
smiling down here. Why are you smiling,

292
00:23:41,561 --> 00:23:45,770
Chris? What does that remind you of what?

293
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,510
All right, the Far East indeed, but
when I was a kid growing up, if I heard

294
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,230
I would be watching Indians coming over
the horizon and the west and the good

295
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:03,400
guys are, the bad guys are chasing
her. It was a sign of the Indians.

296
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:07,060
What this was,
what this became in terms of film.

297
00:24:07,061 --> 00:24:11,110
Music was a kind of racial
stereotyping we had.

298
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:16,140
US and US went along in major and minor
scales and we had these other people

299
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,650
generally moved in parallel motion
and used a lot of pentatonic sounds.

300
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,310
So the people in Hollywood were,

301
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,220
we're painting here ethnically
with a very kind of blunt brush.

302
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,290
It was us in Hollywood in major and
minor and functional harmonies and it was

303
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:36,220
them who went around in pentatonic
scales. Um, and in parallel motion.

304
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:38,500
It's a very interesting
kind of moment there in the,

305
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:43,000
the history of American
musical culture in a way.

306
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,600
Uh, so in any event that's, that's
what we have in this particular piece.

307
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:50,680
WC is using this here and I'll come back
to this a little bit later on because

308
00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:55,330
WC was very much influenced and we
can document where and why very much

309
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,250
influenced by the orient by the east.

310
00:24:57,251 --> 00:25:02,020
He was hearing these eastern
sounds in Paris beginning in 1889.

311
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,760
All right,
well then this thing goes

312
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:19,280
because back to our whole
scale, a whole tone scale. Then

313
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,000
he instructs the pit,

314
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,390
the pianist there just to leave the
foot on that sustaining pedal there.

315
00:25:34,391 --> 00:25:36,460
That right most pedal,
the sustaining pedal.

316
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,020
So we get again this wash of sale.

317
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:46,720
Okay. Now, one other point about pedals.
While I've got the uh, well I have,

318
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:50,540
I met the keyboard here at my heavens.
Look what time it is already. Um,

319
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:55,870
and that is the following. Uh, we've
talked about the right most pedal

320
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:03,160
gives us this kind of wash down.
What's it called once again?

321
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:04,920
Okay.

322
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,430
What's the right most pedal
called on the piano. Yeah,

323
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,240
we to hear it over here.
Who's got it?

324
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,850
Christian. Okay. Who said that? Please.

325
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,710
Okay, thank you. This is the sustaining
pedal, right? It gives us the wash of Sam.

326
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,600
What's the left most pedal do?

327
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,243
Okay.

328
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,210
Okay.

329
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,350
Um,
Frederick,

330
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,010
that's right.
Moves the whole keyboard over.

331
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:40,220
So those hammers are only striking
two strings rather than striking three

332
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:44,820
strings. It makes it a little softer.
A The middle most pedal, however, uh,

333
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:48,300
is a very interesting one. Uh, it
doesn't get used nearly as much.

334
00:26:48,301 --> 00:26:51,540
And I was thinking this
morning was looking at my
office on my Steinway upright

335
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,760
and there is no middle pedal.
Uh,

336
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:56,790
and that's because it doesn't get used
very much, but when it does get used,

337
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,360
it's used for, um, sort of special effect.

338
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,000
Let me show you a good example in
another prelude of Debussy. Um,

339
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:09,450
and this is a bit Oh,
hokey I suppose,

340
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:13,700
but it's called the luck,
had a drought or glue t the Gulf,

341
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,510
there's soaking cathedral. Um, and of
course, Monet painted of the Cathedral,

342
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:23,570
uh, over and over again, all sorts of
different views of this [inaudible] role,

343
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,490
uh, in different kinds of
lights, which gets Ebro was it

344
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,913
okay?

345
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,190
[inaudible]

346
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,200
okay.

347
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,010
No. Any art and the folk say
or show Jacob what, which,

348
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,340
which cathedral is it that won't
show the next slide, please?

349
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:45,990
Well, we can't, we won't tell them. It's
an impression of the Cathedral of wall,

350
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,400
which is about a hundred miles
or so up the up river, uh,

351
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,440
no downriver toward the mouth
of the sin. So you go, uh,

352
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:58,920
the sin toward Har Flair and you
come to war and he painted this.

353
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,220
And Debbie see also,
uh,

354
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,680
constructed a musical equivalent
of it that goes this way.

355
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,550
Notice all the parallel motion here.

356
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,930
All right,
so then the sun comes up on the Cathedral.

357
00:28:28,931 --> 00:28:32,020
Let's see if we can get the sun to come
up here a little bit on our cathedral.

358
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,790
There we go. A little bit Sunnier. Uh,

359
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:39,820
and we get this kind of music and we'll
get to our, um, middle pedal here.

360
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,190
Well now Debbie, she was going to
show you what the bells sounded like,

361
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,060
all the cathedral,

362
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,740
but as is the case with most of
these French cathedral bells,

363
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:04,690
there is one bell. It's called the
board Dole, this huge, big low bell.

364
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:05,111
Uh,

365
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:09,790
and he's trying to give us the impression
of the Bordeaux here and he instructs

366
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:14,320
that we should use the sustain at
the, excuse me, the Sostenuto pedal.

367
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:18,850
This is a bit counterintuitive because
we have the sustaining pedal to the,

368
00:29:18,851 --> 00:29:23,140
right now we've got this thing called
the Sostenuto pedal. It also sustains,

369
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:25,920
but it sustains in a different way.
It allows you to hit a note,

370
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,520
hold that note,
and then you can play other stuff.

371
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,310
And it was clear that other
stuff with your sustaining pedal,

372
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:39,230
while that note is still sounding down
there and he uses it here to get the

373
00:29:39,231 --> 00:29:40,550
effect of this large bill,

374
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,000
she does,
her bells sounded

375
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,300
and then a fade out at that point.

376
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,640
Okay.
Um,

377
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:32,410
so that takes us to the end
of this particular of prelude.

378
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,830
Now have a lot of other things I'd
like to say about impressionist music.

379
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,940
Very interesting stuff. I think I'm
going to cut to the chase however,

380
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:41,830
with just showing you a few slides,

381
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:46,210
because we have a guest that we want to
talk with a and she is here and we want

382
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,910
to move on to that,
um,

383
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,070
in the textbook and you can read about
this and the impression has chapter in a

384
00:30:51,071 --> 00:30:54,040
textbook.
Let's go on Jacob to the next slide.

385
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,910
And the point here is the,
uh,

386
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,570
association of Color. And, uh, Linda,

387
00:31:01,571 --> 00:31:06,430
if you would cue the Tarkovsky,
which, uh, should be,

388
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:11,680
uh, track I guess 15 is it? What
is the checkoffs skews ready?

389
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:12,783
Cool.
Um,

390
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:18,060
so we're going to make a point here and
that is that musicians in this western

391
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:21,580
tradition of Bach,
Beethoven and Mozart and so on,

392
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,480
always tie line to color in a section.
One day,

393
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:28,840
I think it was Roger.
Where's my,

394
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:32,020
Roger asked me.
There he is back there.

395
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,230
How do we know it's a melody?
Well,

396
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:39,100
one reason we know in all this complex
of music, it's something is a melody,

397
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:44,050
is that in orchestrated pieces, when
it's melody time, the composure,

398
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:47,950
we'll bring in a new instrument.
It's like, it's like telling you,

399
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:52,690
holding up a sign again, hey, here's
the melody. Instruments are quiet.

400
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,700
Then they come into play the melody.

401
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:59,530
So let's listen to a famous passage of
Chekhov ski here out of Romeo and Juliet,

402
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,370
where he work up nicely in the strings.
When we get to melody.

403
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:07,330
Time incomes, the flute playing
the melody and a French Horn,

404
00:32:07,331 --> 00:32:09,340
no enters to play in the company.
Mint with it,

405
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,380
melody time.

406
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,210
All right, so let's, let's stop with
that. Now that's one, that's one approach.

407
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:46,460
But Debbie, she starts doing
something a little bit different.

408
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,530
He's going to start working just with
color, just with color a little bit if,

409
00:32:50,531 --> 00:32:53,280
if we can get to it of an
orchestral piece, but what,

410
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:58,040
but WC where he's using a new instrument.
It's the human voice. What's the,

411
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,320
what's the uh,
instrument singing here?

412
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,430
Okay, we'll stop. Time is
short, uh, not singing much of
anything. Just thinking, oh,

413
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,170
it's just what he wants.
There is the warm sound,

414
00:33:37,171 --> 00:33:41,270
the stable warm sound of
the human voice and uh,

415
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,630
as Thomas Mann mindset and uh, he just
brings that in a little dab of color.

416
00:33:45,631 --> 00:33:46,770
They're a little dab of color there.

417
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,040
What's interesting him is
not wine but just color.

418
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:52,710
He's going to pulling
color away from line.

419
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,090
And that begins to happen here
in the painting of the period,

420
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:02,300
the begin to intensify color
and a separate color from line.

421
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:06,630
Here we have Matisse 1909,

422
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,930
the dancers,
this is version one of this.

423
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:12,870
You may not know that he actually
painted this particular scene twice.

424
00:34:12,871 --> 00:34:16,200
Version one notice.
Just the kind of flesh tone colors.

425
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:19,830
Notice the position of the knees.
Now we're going to go to version two,

426
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:23,040
two years later,
much more intense.

427
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,590
The position of the legs and the,
um,

428
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:33,060
a hamstring tear is much more angular
and we have a much more visceral response

429
00:34:33,061 --> 00:34:36,330
to this because of the addition
of the red color to it.

430
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:40,710
And red becomes a very important color
with the painters of this period,

431
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:45,920
and they begin to take this color and
just play with the color itself outside of

432
00:34:47,101 --> 00:34:51,270
line, which is what WC is doing. So
let's go onto the next slide here.

433
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:55,680
Here is Matisse's red studio,
for example,

434
00:34:55,681 --> 00:35:00,150
where the color red begins to overrun
everything. Or in musical terms,

435
00:35:00,151 --> 00:35:04,110
let's go to Duffy's red violin here where,

436
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:09,260
where the red varnish quality of the
violin is spilling out outside of the line

437
00:35:09,511 --> 00:35:14,280
or normal confines of the instrument.
So that's an interesting point, I think,

438
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:19,170
to watch these two arts work in tandem
at this particular moment in history.

439
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:24,180
All right, I'm going to
stop here and introduce our
guests. Uh, Naomi. Woo. Naomi,

440
00:35:24,181 --> 00:35:28,660
come on up. I've never met Naomi, right?

441
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,850
But it's nice to see you. Thank
you for joining us today. Um,

442
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,410
so you're a pianist here
at Yale. Um, and talk,

443
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,630
how are we doing out there? I'm told
that when we have guests that, uh,

444
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:46,160
sometimes we don't foreground the guests
enough. We don't, he can you see a c?

445
00:35:46,161 --> 00:35:50,340
I'm okay. Okay. June. Great. So, um,

446
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,130
here's what you owe me and we're
going to turn the lights back on.

447
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:56,730
So tell us about yourself nice
and loud if you would please.

448
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,230
Are you a music major?

449
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:01,850
Um, I'm not sure yet. I'm a
freshman. You're a freshman.

450
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,600
Probably won't be a music major,

451
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,840
but I am looking to go to Grad
school and music probably.

452
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:13,280
Interesting. So why did you, why didn't
you go to Julliard then or you Smith?

453
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:17,820
I, I actually decided to come here because
I wanted to do a liberal arts degree.

454
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,910
Still pursuing,

455
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:24,030
I thought really seriously about going
to Juilliard and then realize that I

456
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:26,460
didn't want to be sort of at
a vocational school right now,

457
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:30,920
going to be so focused right now and I
find you should get a broader education.

458
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:36,020
That's a smart move. I did it the
wrong way. I went to, I went to, um,

459
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:40,380
and it was a red or wrenching experience
to go to the Eastman School of music

460
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:43,230
first and then go to Harvard after that.
That,

461
00:36:43,231 --> 00:36:46,740
that because you really felt
like a dummy. Uh, at least I did.

462
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:50,460
And then rightfully so. So you're doing
it the correct way. I think generally,

463
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:53,940
whatever your trajectory is in
terms of your particular profession,

464
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:58,950
get your broad and liberal arts background
first and then focus more and more,

465
00:36:59,090 --> 00:36:59,310
uh,

466
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:04,200
more intensely on your specialty and then
sub specialty in on it on it will go.

467
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:08,430
So here you are taking piano lessons.
With whom do you study?

468
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,750
Um, could we gang at the, he teaches,

469
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,960
uh, so, so he is a faculty member of
the School of music across the street.

470
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:21,610
And our most talented undergraduates go
over there to get their lessons and they

471
00:37:21,611 --> 00:37:25,690
do their practicing. How many
hours a day do you get to practice?

472
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,530
I tried to practice two hours a day,
but I usually can't do it everyday.

473
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,720
It's probably five days a week.

474
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,470
Okay, well then, yeah, that's hard.

475
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,050
That was the thing was so weird about
these conservatories. These kit,

476
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:40,410
we go down and you go in these practice
rooms and six hours later they come out.

477
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:40,831
I mean,

478
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:43,830
they spend their entire time and there
was like learning to be a great plumber

479
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:48,750
or something like that. It's, it's
not a very broadening experience. Um,

480
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:51,300
okay.
So you're practicing two hours a day.

481
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,310
Does that annoy the people all around you?

482
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,250
Well, they're, they're great
practice rooms. I'm in the
basement of Sprague hall.

483
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,360
Okay. Uh, but how, I thought that was
just for, uh, the school of music students

484
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:08,210
for the, for the Undergrad students who
are, who are studying at the school of,

485
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,470
okay.
Give us Keith.

486
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,890
I see. So you're kind
of a special group. If,

487
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,530
if Daniel decides he wants to practice
over there, they're not Gullah.

488
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,110
Daniel have a key to the key to
this, the treasury. Uh, okay.

489
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,320
But we are a red course. Cross street.
What are we building over there?

490
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,340
I knew music department buildings are
gonna have a lot more practice, uh,

491
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:32,090
facilities in the basement
of that, principally for
undergraduates. All right. So,

492
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:36,130
uh, this is something that
always interests me. We have
a time to talk about it.

493
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:40,420
Um, how good is your, you know, these
kids that are good at this music business,

494
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:42,330
they're good for a reason.
Um,

495
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:46,990
it's because they have some talent and
oftentimes this is orally perceived

496
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:51,190
talent. So how good an ear do you have?
I'm not going to quiz you on this.

497
00:38:51,191 --> 00:38:53,980
I like to quiz people on this,
but tell me about this.

498
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:54,731
No,
I mean,

499
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:58,000
I haven't really good ear and I don't
know how much of that is innate or whether

500
00:38:58,001 --> 00:39:00,970
it's because I've been listening
to music since I was a kid.

501
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:01,940
My parents were always playing.

502
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:06,950
Were they musicians, not musicians at
all? What do they do? My mom's a doctor.

503
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:11,050
My Dad's an economist. Okay. So they're
in the quantitative reasoning in,

504
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:15,550
in some kind of some kind of way. And
this is not incidental folks. Yeah.

505
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,160
And I'm actually considering
majoring in math actually.

506
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,210
Oh yeah. I knew that it was coming.
So you may not have absolute pitch.

507
00:39:23,211 --> 00:39:25,860
You probably don't have
absolute pitch, right? No.

508
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,730
But you probably have a very
good sense of relative pitch.

509
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,970
What would have happened if you
started out well, what was piano?

510
00:39:31,971 --> 00:39:36,550
Your first instrument? It was, it was
supposing you had started out on at it.

511
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,680
And what, how old were you
when you started? Five. Okay.

512
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:44,250
So you were a late starter by,
uh, uh, sometimes you know, um,

513
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,040
Ken show who is in here.
What did he say?

514
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:49,910
He was three when he started
with the violet. How'd you
start it with the violin?

515
00:39:49,911 --> 00:39:51,320
Do you think you would
have absolute pitch?

516
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,160
You know, definitely. I think
I would have, I, I, I do play
violin. I play on the why.

517
00:39:55,161 --> 00:39:55,994
So

518
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,340
wait a minute. You play
violin also? Really? Yeah.

519
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:05,170
You're playing the Yso uh,
you know, that's really hard
to get in the YSL folks.

520
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:08,030
That's a very competitive,
oh, okay. So when,

521
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,570
how old were you when you took a flight?
Yeah,

522
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:14,610
hi. When I was 10, and I, my sense of
pitch didn't develop for the violence.

523
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,060
Okay. So what did you learn
from that? What do we,

524
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,110
what do we conclude from that experience?
If you wanted to develop?

525
00:40:21,111 --> 00:40:21,831
Absolute pitch.

526
00:40:21,831 --> 00:40:24,560
What would have been the sequence in
which you would have been exposed to these

527
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:27,260
instruments?
Violin first,

528
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:31,860
because it forces you to think
about pitch constantly, like the um,

529
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,810
uh, eastern languages are, so
many of them are tonal languages.

530
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:40,610
You have to think about this issue of
pitch early on and statistically you,

531
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,640
somebody did a study of, of uh, uh,

532
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:49,641
violinists of Asian nationality or
descent at the Eastman School of music and

533
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:55,820
shopping like 64% of
them had absolute pitch.

534
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,730
Uh,
and it's a combination I think,

535
00:40:58,731 --> 00:41:02,480
of working with a string instrument and
working with a tonal language and in

536
00:41:02,481 --> 00:41:06,740
many cases. So it's a very interesting,
interesting phenomenon. And it, sure. It,

537
00:41:06,741 --> 00:41:06,981
sure.

538
00:41:06,981 --> 00:41:09,950
It's very helpful when you go to play
these instruments because you don't have,

539
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,540
you know,
if you can stream the music,

540
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:14,780
you're not going to have memory lapses
and things like that. So now we have,

541
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:18,180
we have a piece and we're going
to have you, you play, uh,

542
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,840
this piece on Dean for beginning to end.

543
00:41:20,841 --> 00:41:23,660
It's based on another poem we've
given you the poem for today,

544
00:41:23,661 --> 00:41:27,050
but it's not really relevant.
Uh, or that relevant.

545
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,090
What's this poll about Naomi? Have you
ever looked at the Pomona? So what's,

546
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,560
what's it,
what's it do for us?

547
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,760
The poems about a water man and she's
trying to seduce this mortal man and um,

548
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,890
she sings and she asks him to sort of
come into life with her and be the king of

549
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,850
the, the, the lake with her.
Um, and he, in the end he says,

550
00:41:48,851 --> 00:41:50,980
no, I can't. I love a mortal woman.

551
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,080
And she begins to cry a little bit and
then she just laughs it off and basically

552
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,640
says, well, I didn't want to do, anyway,

553
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,080
that's sort of the story that's going
on and it's like very well refracted

554
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:03,663
reflected.

555
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:08,330
Um, so, so when you played this
year, do you think it per tape,

556
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:12,110
because we do have the text or do you
think of particular moments in the poem?

557
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,610
Oh, really? Most of them. You
want to put a play one in Georgia?

558
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,470
Yeah. Well the water is, is
happens throughout the whole piece.

559
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,310
There's constant running
notes and the whole thing.

560
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,760
Okay.
Interestingly enough,

561
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,500
would that cord is an augmented
triad? I had, I cheated. Okay.

562
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:33,670
Are you supposed to know a
recognize an augmented triad? No,

563
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,740
I did go get the score
in this cause I don't,

564
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,300
I didn't know this piece
particularly well. Um, uh, so no,

565
00:42:40,301 --> 00:42:43,480
you're not supposed to recognize a whole
tone scale from a pentatonic scale.

566
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,240
Maybe recognize it's something different,
but it is interesting to note,

567
00:42:46,241 --> 00:42:49,900
it starts right off the bat with
an augmented triad. So that's the,

568
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,040
that's the water that

569
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,700
um,
and then you're the end.

570
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,790
Well and then it sort of gets really
tumultuous when she's getting really

571
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:57,560
passionate.

572
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,170
Okay. You want me to play? I'll play
a little of that. That'd be great.

573
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:19,240
That's sort of what she's getting really
passionate and really pleading with him

574
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,720
to come.
Hello.

575
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,180
Um,
does that sound easy or hard to play?

576
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,250
There's a reason she's playing
this and I am not. Um, yeah,

577
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:31,910
cause that's how I took the easy stuff.
Big Chords, you know, not that. No.

578
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,160
You should look at the score.
Uh,

579
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:38,270
and the other interesting thing is that
the hamp is the core positionings change

580
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,260
each time they go up an octave.
And that's really hard. Uh,

581
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:45,440
rather than repetition of
an arpeggio up an octave,

582
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,720
repeated same hand position up an octave.

583
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:52,610
The particular hand positions are
changing as you go up. Octave, octave,

584
00:43:52,611 --> 00:43:56,120
two octave. Um, anything else?
I at the very beginning of this,

585
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:58,370
I did notice if you could
play the left hand part,

586
00:43:58,371 --> 00:44:00,690
just so we can hear this
melody at the beginning.

587
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:11,770
Okay. So that we have the outlines of,
of a pentatonic scale at work here.

588
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:14,600
And you're going to hear that at the
beginning and then you'll hear at,

589
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,311
at the end.

590
00:44:15,311 --> 00:44:19,780
So the general form here as is often
true with these impressionist composers,

591
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:24,700
is just turn reform a, be a
with the, the second and final,

592
00:44:24,701 --> 00:44:28,690
a slightly modified. So we're going to
hear this now from beginning to end.

593
00:44:28,691 --> 00:44:32,190
They owe me woo playing own dean by Ravel.

594
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:34,883
Okay.

595
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,133
Oh,

596
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,473
okay.

597
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,970
Yeah.
Hello?

598
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,053
No.

599
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:07,923
Okay.

600
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,620
[inaudible]

601
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:42,583
hmm.

602
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:49,643
Oh,

603
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:05,123
okay.

604
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,240
[inaudible]

605
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:44,910
[inaudible]

606
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,013
has

607
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:59,320
on Dean flies off. Oh, you will
fly off now to your next class.

608
00:51:59,321 --> 00:52:00,190
Thanks very much.
