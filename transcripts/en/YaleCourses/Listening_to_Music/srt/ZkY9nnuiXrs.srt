1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,120
Today we begin a slightly different
portion of our course. Uh,

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,150
we'll be talking about the periods in
the history of music beginning with the

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:14,671
Middle Ages,

4
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:18,990
and I've pit put the names of those
periods that we will be covering in our

5
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:22,470
course up here on the board. Obviously,
medieval renaissance, baroque,

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,370
classical romantic,
impressionist modernist.

7
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:31,370
So we could even add to that postmodernist
now and probably throw into that a

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,320
popular music in a general way.

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,960
We're going to begin here
with Gregorian chant,

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,390
talking about the traditional
music of the Roman Catholic Church.

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,080
We will not be promoting in here the
values of the Roman Catholic church

12
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:48,481
anymore.

13
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:52,680
We then we promoted the values of the
Jewish religion when we listened to

14
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:54,900
Klezmer music or,
uh,

15
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:58,560
the Islamic religion when
we listened to the autumn.

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,660
Or we will be promoting,

17
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,470
we will not in fact be promoting the
Lutheran tradition when we deal with Bach

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,480
next time. Uh, this ain't religion
in this course. This is art.

19
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,610
So with that,
understood.

20
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,180
Let's begin with an
introduction to medieval music.

21
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,760
Starting with Gregorian chant.

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,640
What is Gregorian chant?

23
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,140
Gregorian chant is the
monophonic one line music.

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,100
Oops, I think I need to turn
something on here. Excuse me.

25
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,800
Monophonic one line,

26
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:36,801
the music of the Roman Catholic church
as it existed from the time of the

27
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:42,900
earliest church fathers up until
the time of the Council of Trent,

28
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,540
the Council of Trent,
as you may know from your history courses,

29
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,290
was a conclave held in the
northern Italian town of Trento,

30
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Italy from 1545 to 1563 at which time
they tried to combat the effects of the

31
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,880
Protestant reformation,

32
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,900
instituting reforms within the church,

33
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,950
purifying the existing Church of Rome,

34
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:10,620
cleaning up the Catholic Church.
In effect,

35
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,880
among the things that got purified
where the art and the music,

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,620
no more nudity was allowed in art,
in any nudity that was already there.

37
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,360
And religious art was painted over.

38
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,760
Any sort of secular tunes
were taken out of the church.

39
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,590
Snappy rhythms in church
music, uh, work proscribed.

40
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,570
What music was sung henceforth
would be dictated by Rome.

41
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,940
No more new chant was composed.

42
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,390
So the composition of chant then begin
all the way back slightly as shortly

43
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:50,520
after the, the death of Christ and
continued into the 16th century.

44
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,620
What we call Gregorian chant,
really rent.

45
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:56,730
It went on for a period
of 1500 years from this.

46
00:02:56,731 --> 00:03:01,731
It is obvious then that although it takes
its name from Pope Gregory the first,

47
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:05,680
and you have his dates on the
board over there. Gregory,

48
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:10,681
the Great Gregorian chant had almost
nothing to do with Gregory Gregory was a

49
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:16,870
church administrator, a writer of
sermons, and an important theologian,

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,200
but it's only an historical accident
that he is associated with this vast

51
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:28,210
repertoire of Chin. Gregory had an
influential biographer, John the Deacon,

52
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,890
who ascribed perhaps more to Gregory than
he actually accomplished and generally

53
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:34,300
speaking in the Middle Ages,

54
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:38,800
there was this tendency to ascribe to
a single or a couple of male authority

55
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,920
figures a lot more than they actually did.

56
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,380
The point here is the Gregorian chant
was being composed 500 years before

57
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,030
Gregory set foot on this earth
and nearly a thousand years after.

58
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,100
What's the purpose of Gregorian
chant? What did it do? Well,
it did two things. One,

59
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:59,230
it communicated the message of the church.

60
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,890
It allowed for the transmission
of the word of God as they,

61
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,980
the faithful understood the word and
understood God and it transmitted the

62
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:09,814
theology.

63
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,820
The message of the church chant
then was a medium for the broadcast,

64
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,760
literally the broadcast of the word in a
resonant acoustical environment such as

65
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:25,150
a stone or Stucco church,
one can project,

66
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:30,151
one can impel attacks better if you sing
it rather than just simply to claim it

67
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:33,430
as usual.
I could say for example,

68
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,290
now let us read the Epistle of the
blessing apostle Paul to the Romans,

69
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,780
but the techs projects better
if I sing it. Lexi OIP sterling,

70
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,110
how the odd Roma Aha,
no walls

71
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,620
in that fashion, it goes out better
and it can reverberate better.

72
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,520
Chant used for direct reading directly
communicating the tax was generally sill

73
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:01,280
abic chant.
In syllabic chant,

74
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,430
each syllable has just one
note and in syllabic chant,

75
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:09,740
the musical range tends
to be rather narrow.

76
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,280
The second purpose of chant chant also
allowed for a period of reflection upon

77
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,670
the subject of the preceding reading.

78
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,970
A sermon or a passage of scripture
would be followed by a reflective chant.

79
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,890
Time for contemplation.

80
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,370
This music for reflection upon a
preceding religious theme was generally

81
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,420
melodramatic. Now, umbrellas,

82
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,450
Madec chant is one in which there are
many notes for just one syllable of texts.

83
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,450
And in millipedes,
medic chant,

84
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,370
the range tends to be a lot broader.
It's more virtuosic.

85
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,110
So simple chanting for readings.
That's syllabic Chad,

86
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,700
more complex chant for moments
of personal and reflection.

87
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,620
That's Mila's Madec Chin.
Let's take an example here.

88
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:07,310
I have my venerable
libor usual us up here,

89
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:10,690
and I'm going to sing the Luhya
for Easter Sunday. Listen,

90
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,020
I'm going to try to sing it, and it's
an example of a melodramatic chin.

91
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:20,630
And you'll notice one syllable here,
uh Oh,

92
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,680
um,
is conveyed by probably 30 notes.

93
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,890
Ooh,

94
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:29,843
Ooh,

95
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,380
yeah.

96
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,380
Aw Huh.

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,970
Aw,

98
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,540
oh, oh, oh,

99
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,450
oh.

100
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,450
So that's eight mellows,
medic chin.

101
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,570
A moment of joyful celebration associated
with the resurrection of Christ.

102
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,740
So that's what chance did.
And that's what it does today.

103
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,060
It just firstly a medium for
the projection of sacred texts.

104
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,913
And secondly,

105
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,080
a vehicle for spiritual contemplation
where it was chance some,

106
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,430
well,
early on chat with some,

107
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:21,070
and not so much in what we
would call public churches,

108
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:25,420
but more in sequestered
usually rural monasteries,

109
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,690
religious communities
segregated by gender.

110
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,200
What specifically we would
call monasteries for men
and convince or nunneries

111
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,210
for women.
Remember,

112
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:41,650
hamlet enjoining Ofelia
get thee to a nunnery.

113
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,580
The dominant monastic order for both male
and female in the Middle Ages was the

114
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:52,930
Benedictine order founded by
benedict of [inaudible] near Rome,

115
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,990
about five 30 common era dates and names
spelled out on the board from benedict.

116
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:04,470
The church received a code of conduct
prescribing how monks and nuns should live

117
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,440
the ideal spiritual life
while on this earth.

118
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,080
Here is that book I want to purchase.

119
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:13,450
Visit the monastery of
Saint John in Collegeville,

120
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:17,440
Minnesota about 60 miles
west of Minneapolis.

121
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,710
So this is the rule of Saint Benedict.

122
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:26,010
It told the clergy how to spend the day
it applied equally to male and female

123
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,790
communities.

124
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,300
The day was divided in two periods
of work and two periods of worship.

125
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,290
Pray, singing, chanting,
reading scripture.

126
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,620
They worked so as to feed themselves and
they prayed so as to save their souls.

127
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,350
They were not so much interested
in good works for the community.

128
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,240
They sort of withdrawn from the community,
but in personal salvation,

129
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,770
saving their own souls,
perhaps the souls of as well,

130
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,570
the periods during which they worship,
we're called the canonical hours.

131
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,870
The word Canon in Latin literally means
rule a canon is a musical composition

132
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:09,630
that follows a strict rule.

133
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,980
One voice has got to follow another
exactly in terms of rhythm and pitch from

134
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,500
beginning,
beginning to end.

135
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,500
But here we have something
a little bit different.

136
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,230
Canonical hours following the rule.

137
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:25,110
The Canon of Saint Benedict,

138
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:30,710
the hours usually involve praying and
reading scripture and in singing and they

139
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:36,561
started early in the morning about four
o'clock in most houses at a canonical

140
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,760
hour called matins.

141
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,850
Next they would go on to celebrate louds
about daybreak and so on around the

142
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,560
hours ending with
vespers and compliant on,

143
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,650
I might ask you here, we actually have
this service in the Yale community,

144
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:57,300
broadly speaking, it's not particularly,
uh, religiously oriented at all.

145
00:09:57,301 --> 00:10:00,090
Have any of you gone to
the compliance service, uh,

146
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:03,960
at Christ church across from
the old bookstore? As I say,

147
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:08,910
it's not particularly a denominational
in any way. It's mostly in the dark.

148
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:12,840
It's very reflective. Yes. Michael has,
I see some other people have as well.

149
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,020
You might check that out Sunday
at 10 o'clock in the evening.

150
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:19,440
It's just a lovely time for
peace and quiet reflection.

151
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,430
You can think about any god that tuition
there I think about and perhaps work

152
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:28,431
through any personal issues that you might
want to want to engage as to the mass

153
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:30,001
of the day.

154
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:33,780
We usually think of this as the principle
service that strictly speaking was not

155
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:37,110
a canonical hour. It was
a special service. Uh,

156
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:40,350
that happened usually
at around nine o'clock,

157
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,080
celebrated at the high
altar of the church.

158
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,590
So that's what the clergy did in the
Middle Ages by way of worship gathering at

159
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:53,970
these prescribed times
to pray and to sing.

160
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,260
And that's what the clergy still doesn't
bend a dictate Benedictine houses

161
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,820
around the world.

162
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,290
The most authentic of these benedictine
houses is the one that you see on the

163
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,190
screen here.

164
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:09,990
At so limb about 150 miles
south of Paris some years back.

165
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:13,910
I had the pleasure of living
there for a 10 days, uh,

166
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,870
to study Gregorian chant. When you
arrive, the Abbott comes out to greet you.

167
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:23,871
He's attended on either side
by two acolytes and you go
through a ceremony of in

168
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:26,640
which he washes your hand.

169
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,940
This washing of the
hands was a traditional,

170
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,830
still is a traditional gesture by the
Benedictines of hospitality and to some

171
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:36,360
extent of humility,

172
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,820
you the visitor are assigned to a sale.
Let's have the next slide,

173
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:45,210
Jacob, please. There we go. Okay. And
all this signal, those. All right,

174
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:48,680
so there we are with the next
slot. You are assigned a room. Oh,

175
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,970
let's go back to this. A,
you're assigned a room in.

176
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,530
This building has been worked over,
but that's where actually I stayed in the,

177
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,980
in that building. In that room, you
have a light bulb, you have a desk,

178
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:04,210
you have a bed, some fruit, you
have no radio, you have no clock,

179
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:07,090
no television,
and certainly no cell phone.

180
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,790
How then do you get up to
attend the canonical hours?

181
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,650
Because in order to be in this monastery,

182
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:18,010
you are required to attend
all of these canonical hours.

183
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,510
What is it that wakes you up
then, would you imagine? Hmm.

184
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,540
Bells. Nice and loud please. Okay.
Thank you. Michael Bell's. Okay.

185
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,550
The ringing of the bells,

186
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:35,170
they begin to regulate your
existence for each of the signal.

187
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,030
Each of these canonical hours.

188
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,380
Indeed we get our word clock
from the medieval French word,

189
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:45,160
close bell and our word,

190
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:50,280
the very word our comes from the
Latin aura to pray or Rasia prayer.

191
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,970
So we have the sense of
praying at regular times,

192
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:02,380
regular intervals around the day at Solum.

193
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,470
The Bells call you to the church
to hear these canonical hours.

194
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,980
They call you to the refectory to
consume your meals and I submit that you

195
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:20,800
really haven't dined in this world to
you sit down and break dark brown bread

196
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,160
with 80 hooded Benedictine
speaking in Latin.

197
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,220
If when they are not speaking,

198
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:32,221
they are tapping particular signals on
the table and suddenly everybody will

199
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:32,931
rise.

200
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:37,931
Sevenly everybody will bow and visitor
is sort of left perplexed as to what is

201
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:41,830
transpiring. But that's,
that's what goes on.

202
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,930
As I have said, this rule of Saint
Benedict formulated in the sixth century,

203
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,760
prescribed this cycle of canonical hours.
As the Middle Ages proceeded,

204
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,790
the cycle of ours was adopted
at Cathedral Churches,

205
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:02,430
even though the strict rule for communal
living was not the daily timetable of

206
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,480
worship was kept.

207
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,250
But the idea of eating and
sleeping together was abandoned.

208
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:14,080
Cathedrals were much more urban in
their location. They were not withdrawn.

209
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,310
They were in cities.

210
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:20,260
The clergy administered to the spiritual
and social needs of the community.

211
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:24,320
The clergy was celibate de jure,
if not de facto.

212
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,350
They lived in private homes,
not in a communal dormitory,

213
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,760
in houses that were situated
all around the Cathedral.

214
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,960
Let's take a look at a typical
medieval cathedral. And for this,

215
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:42,250
I'm going to choose Chartron.
Now. Um, it's not typical.

216
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,970
It's the most beautiful.
If you have one cathedral to go to.

217
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:47,320
I strong and I think I'd been,

218
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:50,890
to all I know that I'd been to all
the big ones and in France, uh,

219
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,170
go to sharp for, for several
reasons. First of all,

220
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,230
it has the most up pristinely preserved
town around the back of the church.

221
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,081
As you can see,

222
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:07,040
the medieval city from the 12th and 13th
centuries is pretty much still there.

223
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:12,190
It has the widest knave of any
of these gothic cathedrals.

224
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:17,090
If you look carefully on the floor,
you see a medieval labyrinth there. Uh,

225
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:22,010
so it has the best
preserved of any of these,

226
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,770
uh, uh, cathedral floors.

227
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,940
It has the best preserved stain glass,
which is,

228
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,930
which is famous a world a wide.
Uh,

229
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:37,850
and it has, uh, the original
crypt in this building,

230
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:42,520
which extends all the way
back in to the, uh, uh,

231
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,560
eighth century indeed was part of a
preceding church that was built in the

232
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,600
course of the eighth
through the 11th centuries.

233
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,690
And we're going to see
now what the cathedral,

234
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:58,691
the Romanesque cathedral and shark looked
like before it was built into the one

235
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:02,210
that we know and see today.
This is Roman, Nashville.

236
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:07,140
What we saw before was gothic.
So here we see here we see, um,

237
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,850
a group of clerics centering around
Bishop full bear twos there to the right.

238
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,890
This illumination dates from
right around the year 10 20.

239
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,520
We'll return to full bear tooths and
here one of his chance at the end of our

240
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,390
hour.
But for the moment,

241
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:30,350
let's pass on to the
women on the left there.

242
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,670
Notice that they are out to the side.
They've been segregated. Indeed,

243
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:37,220
they are physically marginalized.

244
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Women were to be silent in the church
according to the scriptural dictum of

245
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:46,490
Saint Paul.
Molliere Takei apt in a crazier,

246
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,620
but as we have seen,

247
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,450
there was ample opportunity for spiritual
contemplation and creativity for women,

248
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,330
specifically in the convents.

249
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,720
One spiritual leader within the community
of Benedictine convents was Hildegard

250
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,650
of Bingen.
Hildegard lived in the 12th century.

251
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,850
She came from the area of being in on
the West Bank of the Rhine River in

252
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:14,540
Germany.
She grew up in a Benedictine convent.

253
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,650
Here is the ruins of
that Benedictine convent.

254
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:23,150
And then she went on ultimately to
found her own convent. And this is the,

255
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,290
these are the ruins or the 17th
century drawing of that convent,

256
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,620
which is now also, uh, in ruins.

257
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,300
Hildegard was a polymath.
She could do many things.

258
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,250
She wrote on Church administration, on
botany, on pharmacology, on medicine,

259
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,780
and on music. Indeed, because
of this diversity, we can,

260
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:49,810
I think fairly say that the
first renaissance man in
actuality was a medieval

261
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,730
woman.
Hildegard of Bingen,

262
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,160
popes and bishops sought her advice
in part because she was a visionary.

263
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,340
She had visions associated with Dick
Christian story to go guard also wrote

264
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,190
Gregorian chance.
So let's look at some slides of Hildegard.

265
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:13,170
She was famous in her day here we have
a manuscript put together in northern

266
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:17,460
Italy about 20 years after her death
with the representation of Hildegard up

267
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,950
there on the top left.

268
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,920
Next slide takes us to a blow up of this.

269
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,980
And we see the representation of
Hildegard having a Celeste deal vision.

270
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,080
That's why the wavy lines
going up from her head.

271
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,240
She's receiving the Holy Spirit.
She is copying down. Know what she,

272
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,530
uh, what she perceives.

273
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,330
Not on a notebook computer,

274
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:47,250
but on a wax tablet with a large stylists
in her right hand. Her assistant,

275
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,550
the one male allowed in this
community for the sacraments.

276
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:55,551
Her assistant Volmer peaks in
astonished at what he is seeing.

277
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,310
A another illustration of the same sort,

278
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:01,920
the phantasmagorical
trinity here with God,

279
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:06,921
the Father Christ the warrior slaying the
devil that is now trampled on his feet

280
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:08,514
down below.

281
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:13,350
Hildegard is seeing all this as we
see from this illumination here.

282
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,160
And a blow up of that again
shows us the wavy lines,

283
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:21,600
the descent of the Holy Spirit,
the writing on the wax tablet this time,

284
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:22,470
her assistant,

285
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:27,150
her favorite assistant
Ricarda Ricardo looks in.

286
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,860
Um, again, on this
particular particular scene,

287
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,460
Hildegard's music is distinctive and the
texts that she created for this music

288
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:43,110
are even more remarkable,
more than any religious poet that I know.

289
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:44,880
And I have studied this to some degree,

290
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,800
religious poet of the
Middle Ages that I know, uh,

291
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,740
her tax of the most startling,
her imagery, the most vivid,

292
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,380
most graphic,
indeed the most beautiful.

293
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:59,790
She talks of a saint in terms
of the sweat of his goodness,

294
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:04,791
shining like a bomb on his forehead of
the odor of the sanctity of the Virgin

295
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,080
Mary being as sweet as the
scent of honeysuckle and Lilac.

296
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,770
Hildegard sees the blood of
Christ streaming in the heavens,

297
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,210
in her own musical creations.

298
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,920
With regard to them,
she styles herself simply a breadth,

299
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,790
a feather on the breadth of God,
a feather on the breadth of God.

300
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,290
What an interesting metaphor,

301
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,520
but very appropriate for this
very modest individual she was,

302
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:37,260
but a feather on the breadth of God with
regard to her own personal creations,

303
00:20:37,261 --> 00:20:40,890
carrying out,
going wherever God would send her.

304
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,590
Now you have on your
cd's four hour course.

305
00:20:43,591 --> 00:20:48,591
It's actually CD one track to
Hildegard's Oh greenest branch.

306
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,960
And when you listen to this,

307
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:54,020
it's actually the basis of a listening
exercise that we will get to. Um,

308
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,030
when you listen to this,

309
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:58,420
you might be interested to know that
this was recorded right in the base of

310
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:01,810
harkness tower over there was
recorded in Brandford Chapel.

311
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:07,030
And although when you read the liner
notes and we'll say the Hildegard singers,

312
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,230
the Hildegard singers were simply
some female graduate students,

313
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,500
ladies that were here interested
in singing early music that uh,

314
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,820
for that particular recording became what
I labeled them, the Hildegard singers.

315
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,690
So that recording was done
over at brand for chapel.

316
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:27,691
But let's listen to another one from a
group of four women from New York City.

317
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:31,780
They're called anonymous for they
put out wonderful recordings. Um,

318
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,610
and it's a good example of melodramatic
chant again by Hildegard of Bingen.

319
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,220
Now you have the text
up on the board here.

320
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:43,060
I don't know if we can read it then I'll
read it off to oh, Rubar Sung greenies.

321
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,360
Oh,
redness of blood qui are key day shell.

322
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:50,890
So ilow flew week seats that
flowed down from heaven. Quote,

323
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:52,900
DVT toss,
Tate Tate Jeep,

324
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,070
which divinity touched two flows,

325
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,730
asked view or the flower quote,
humans they to to [inaudible],

326
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,940
which the wintry breadth of the serpent
serpent another words the devil knew

327
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:10,960
qualm lacy will never wound.
So that's the uh,

328
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:14,620
tax. Now let's listen to the
music of Hildegard of Bingen.

329
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:57,650
Lovely. So what can we say about Chin
by way of conclusion? First of all,

330
00:23:57,651 --> 00:23:58,940
of course it is monophonic.

331
00:23:58,941 --> 00:24:03,680
We hear only one line monophonic
texture chances monophonic changes also

332
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,250
unaccompanied as you heard,
chant has no meter,

333
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,430
no rhythm to it,
no regular rhythm,

334
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,060
at least it seems to
flow as Hildegard says,

335
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,000
like a feather on the breath of God.

336
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,720
Now chant is enjoying something
of a rebirth at the moment.

337
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:25,721
Something of a resurgence of interest
ever since the appearance in 19 six,

338
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,240
1996 of this CD simply called Chan.

339
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,930
It went platinum in its first year,
selling over a million copies,

340
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:38,030
outselling the Beatles,
even for a time,

341
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,120
and it was succeeded by other chance.

342
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:44,480
CD's all produced appropriately
enough by angel records.

343
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:49,010
We had chant to chant three beyond chant,

344
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:54,530
son of chant. Uh, there
were Hildegard knockoffs.

345
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,060
We had,
uh,

346
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:04,390
Matt about monks mad about monks and if
we had the original chance CD issued by

347
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:11,810
the Benedictine monks of centered Domingo,
Spain.

348
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,200
So of course we have a knock off now by
the Benz Adriene monks of Santa Monica,

349
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,430
California.
Oh,

350
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:24,883
okay.

351
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,190
Let's go on to the next slide which should
be blank and I don't know what I did

352
00:25:30,621 --> 00:25:33,290
with it but just last
month off here it is.

353
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:37,220
I don't have a good picture but just
last month I went on CNN online.

354
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:41,930
You know you can see the headlines there.
There was a headline move over Madonna,

355
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,260
I think this was the other
Madonna move over Madonna,

356
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:50,560
a CD of the and chance by a group of
Cistercian nuns is a surprise crossover

357
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,860
best seller reaching the pop charts and
you can actually buy this as I did on

358
00:25:57,351 --> 00:26:00,530
Amazon or wherever you want to to buy it.

359
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,560
Why all this interest in Chin because
it has much in common with so called New

360
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,550
Age music chant is non confrontational,
non assertive.

361
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,700
It is somewhat laid back if you will,

362
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:18,790
as the mind and the spirit are allowed
to contemplate to form a divine

363
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,020
communion. Perhaps chant is the very
opposite of the music of Beethoven.

364
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:28,280
Beethoven tries to convince you to feel
a particular way about every moment,

365
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:30,650
every measure in his music.

366
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:35,450
It is very much rhetorical music chant.
On the other hand,

367
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,930
you can take on your own terms.

368
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,220
It is non authoritarian,
it is non assertive,

369
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,830
non aggressive,
it floats unfettered.

370
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,600
And many of these same characteristics
are found in new age music,

371
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,560
hence the newfound
popularity of medieval chat.

372
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:01,430
Now let's turn our attention away from
Chin away from monophonic music too early

373
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,730
polyphony multi voice music,

374
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,840
music of the Church of the Middle Ages,
but polyphonic music,

375
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,150
early polyphonic music for the church
was called origanum called organism.

376
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,250
It was first created in the great
urban gothic cathedrals of friends,

377
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:24,690
most particularly at [inaudible] of Paris.
So let's visit here.

378
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,530
Our well known not for dom, with the West
facade and in some of the famous, uh,

379
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:34,170
latterly edit flying buttresses
around to the south side there,

380
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:35,760
the south east side.

381
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:41,210
It is likely not coincidental that the
high walls of this new gothic style

382
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,630
were being created.

383
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:50,631
These courses of stone laid one on top
of the other at precisely the same time,

384
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,780
around 1200.

385
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:58,680
That verticality was
being introduced to music.

386
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,980
What I mean is that all cathedral organum
was built upward above a preexisting

387
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:07,530
chin,
bubba preexisting Gregorian chant.

388
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,390
The composer took the chant and placed
it in the bottom voice and then added

389
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:16,800
other voices up on top of it to
form counterpoint against it.

390
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:21,330
It was the job of the tender to take the
chance and to hold it out in long notes.

391
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,190
That's why the tenor is
called what it is or rigidly.

392
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:31,080
It comes from the word Latin
10 EO. I hold or 10 year, uh,

393
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,943
in,
um,

394
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,870
in modern fringe to hold the infinitive
there so that we have this idea of one

395
00:28:36,871 --> 00:28:39,480
voice, the chant holding out
to the long notes underneath.

396
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,240
It was kind of the basis of,
of the music.

397
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:46,200
And then up above the composer
would create new polyphony.

398
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,970
What you see on the screen is an
example of this medieval organism.

399
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,570
You can see we have four
lines, uh, in each, uh,

400
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,270
brace in effect.
The one with V has just one pitch.

401
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,950
You could see the big illumination,
Their v and then the pitch f out, uh,

402
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,060
to the right of it.

403
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:13,630
And it just sits there
because it just holds out the,

404
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:17,550
as the music goes on for many, many,
many, many, many, many seconds.

405
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:21,300
And finally go Danay holds that out.

406
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,020
Then finally down at
the bottom rule wound,

407
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,730
as all of this other
polyphony goes on up above.

408
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,840
Let's listen to an example of
some of this medieval sound

409
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
[inaudible]

410
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,720
and we'll stop it there.
So it's very different,

411
00:30:49,721 --> 00:30:52,750
but it's very complex at the same time.
Again,

412
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:56,290
good example of medieval
organ of Medieval polyphonic.

413
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,180
But let's turn our attention now away
from the music of the Middle Ages in Paris

414
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:06,330
to the renaissance and Rome and
specifically to the Sistine Chapel.

415
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,700
This Sistine Chapel was the most famous
of all churches in the late 15th and

416
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:16,930
early 16th centuries.
The core of the renaissance.

417
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,010
Why? Because it was the
private chapel of the pope,

418
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,530
not Saint Peter's.
Interestingly enough,

419
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:28,510
this is a shot of modern day Saint
Peter's. Let's go. There we go. Uh,

420
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,720
but this was during the renaissance,

421
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:35,170
only beginning to be constructed
following design of who?

422
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:40,270
Of, hmm. Um, which famous painter?

423
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:45,370
Michael Angelo. Yeah. Michael Angelo. I
was involved in the design of Saint Peter.

424
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,180
Um,
but this was not in existence at the time.

425
00:31:49,181 --> 00:31:51,940
Were under a discussing here.
A big,

426
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:54,280
as an impressive as it may be.

427
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,580
So where the pope was actually worship
being for the most part in this period

428
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,840
was not in Saint Peter's,

429
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:03,990
but next door in effect over in
this building in the Sistine Chapel.

430
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,490
And here of course,
because it was his own place of worship,

431
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:13,270
he could come in the very best,
the best materials of the best artists,

432
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:18,420
the best musicians construction on the
Sistine Chapel began in 1477 during the

433
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:25,000
reign of Pope Sixth, this the
fourth, hence the name sticks,

434
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,930
Sistine Chapel.
It's 60th 16 officially.

435
00:32:28,931 --> 00:32:31,480
You get the etymological connection there.

436
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,800
It's 132 feet long and 45 feet.

437
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,290
Why the ceiling?

438
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,950
The famous sealing Michelangelo
is 70 feet off the floor.

439
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:47,420
Michelangelo painted, as you
know, scenes from the Bible,

440
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,890
both creation and the expulsion.

441
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,290
He also painted scenes,
uh,

442
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,160
of the civil profits as a

443
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:03,050
written about by Virgil in the Aeneid.

444
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:07,610
The side walls are covered
with frescoes of Bata Chally,

445
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,310
Para Gino and Rafael here,

446
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,720
one by Rafael at the east end
where the high altar was situated.

447
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:22,420
There is the famous last judgment scene
by Michelangelo himself painted somewhat

448
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:25,100
later in the 1530s,

449
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,130
just as the pope hired the best painters.

450
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,710
So he engaged the finest musicians.

451
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,350
The incomparable is just scan they prey,

452
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:38,410
which will be the focus of your listening
exercise 16 and Giovanni pair Luigi.

453
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:44,090
Dot. Palestrina. You've probably
heard the name Palestrina,

454
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,360
a prototypical renaissance composer.

455
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:52,640
They composed and they sang
both chant and polyphony.

456
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,670
They were members of the papal chapel.

457
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:00,620
So a chapel in this period and
even today can mean two things.

458
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:04,880
One, the physical building.
Let's have another slide.

459
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:06,230
The physical building.

460
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:10,880
So that's one kind of chapel
and to the musical ensemble,

461
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,330
the choir that performs in this building

462
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:20,540
and the actual paypal chapel.
As you can see here,

463
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:23,270
there is a logia that sticks out.

464
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:27,980
And this is where the singers such as just
scan the prey and, uh, Giovanni panel,

465
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,410
VG.
Dot.

466
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:33,350
Palestrina would stand when
they sang before the pope.

467
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,030
Now,
because this paypal chapel here saying,

468
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:42,830
without any accompaniment, without any
accompaniment of instruments whatsoever,

469
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:47,060
even the Oregon, that style of
singing came to be called acappella.

470
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,190
Literally Acappella CISTINA.

471
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,130
So unaccompanied singing means without
instruments. If you are in an Octopal,

472
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,120
a singing group here at Yale,

473
00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:01,390
you are a descendant of this tradition
of singing without instruments in the

474
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:05,240
Sistine chapel.
That's what acappella means in the chapel,

475
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:09,530
but literally in this pope
six stasis chapel here,

476
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:12,050
singing without instruments.
In this case,

477
00:35:12,051 --> 00:35:17,051
the paypal chapel performed in the
paypal chapel standing in as mentioned,

478
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:21,080
the Logia that you see there on the
lower right side of your screen.

479
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,010
Who were the members of the Papal Chapel?
Well,

480
00:35:25,011 --> 00:35:27,170
they were all male clerics.

481
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,080
We've said that chance
was segregated by gender.

482
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,280
There were also all female
ensembles in this period,

483
00:35:34,281 --> 00:35:38,580
but they were in convents, but in
monasteries, cathedrals in here,

484
00:35:38,581 --> 00:35:42,000
in the paypal chapel.
Then as today,

485
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,800
the ensembles were all male,
but if they were all male,

486
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:51,830
who then saying the soprano when polyphony
was performed well at various times,

487
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:56,490
this was done in one of three ways.

488
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,460
Males could sing in head voice,

489
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:05,190
which is called falsetto.
Any of the gentlemen here
ever tried to sing falsetto?

490
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,000
Oh,

491
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,100
oh,
oh,

492
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,303
Ooh,

493
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,050
oh, oh, oh.

494
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,570
Sounds pretty awful, right? Okay.
But if I practice that it ain't bad,

495
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,370
I never practice it.
Um,

496
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,730
but if I practice that you can practice
that just like you can any other voice,

497
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:30,450
uh,

498
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,870
and it begins to sound better and better
and it can function as a soprano line.

499
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:38,790
So that was, that was option one.
Option two was to have choir boys,

500
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,400
choir boys seeing this up upper part.

501
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:43,980
And as this illustration shows a,

502
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:48,480
this in many ways was a
popular medium of performance,

503
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:52,490
the old men and the young choir boys.
Uh,

504
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:56,940
but a third possibility that came to be
used in the Sistine Chapel during the

505
00:36:56,941 --> 00:37:01,140
16th century West to assign the
soprano line to a cash strato,

506
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:06,890
a male who had shown a promising singing
voice as a boy and had therefore been

507
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:14,090
subjected to the process of castration
to maintain this high voice.

508
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:21,240
Now there was some economic advantage to
the Castro because one can strato could

509
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:25,380
make as much noise as three
fall status or for choir boys,

510
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,490
the Castro had a high voice,
but a very big body.

511
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,290
Now.

512
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,850
It has always seemed profoundly ironic
to me that the one institution most

513
00:37:35,851 --> 00:37:40,851
fervently in favor of castration of boys
to produce this high powerful voice was

514
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:46,440
the papacy. But that is an
historical fact. Indeed.

515
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:51,441
The pope's continued to engage and support
Castrati into the early 20th century.

516
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:58,670
We in fact have a recording made in
1905 of the last Castrato to sing in the

517
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:05,220
paypal chapel. Allesandro Moreso
[inaudible]. His name is on the board.

518
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:09,270
I will now play a CD of this voice.

519
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,890
It will sound very
unpleasant for two reasons.

520
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:18,950
One the recording was made in 1905 so
it's very old and it has all the surface

521
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:25,240
noise that those old recordings have.
And to Maresca,

522
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,180
he himself was very old.

523
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:31,620
He was about 70 when this recording
was made and who has a good voice,

524
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,700
male or female,

525
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:37,730
who has a good voice when they are seven
so it doesn't present the cast rato at

526
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:38,914
its best,

527
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:44,010
but at least it will give you an
idea of the sound of this lost voice.

528
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,690
So we're going to listen
to a bit of Castrato.

529
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:51,280
Alexandra Marecki singing the Bach Guna.
No Ave Maria.

530
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,620
Okay, let's turn from that very old
recording to a modern recording. Now.

531
00:39:58,621 --> 00:40:03,130
It's a recording of a piece by
Palestrina written around 1594,

532
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:07,730
the Sistine chapel here.
Um, it is a song too.

533
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:12,590
It's from a mass and for the parts
of the mass, uh, the curator,

534
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:16,150
the glory, et Cetera. See
page 83 of your textbook.

535
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:21,660
So it's a song of the mass and just
as we have the Hebrew Prophet Isaiah,

536
00:40:22,151 --> 00:40:26,350
and when I think we can bring that up
now with the next slide on the ceiling of

537
00:40:26,351 --> 00:40:30,140
the Sistine Chapel painted
by Michelangelo Post. Uh,

538
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:35,190
so we had the voice of Isaiah in this
mass and in this music for it is from

539
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:39,930
Isaiah that the text song to
song to song was dominus Deus,

540
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,800
Deus Saba, out comes holy,
holy, Holy Lord, God Almighty.

541
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:50,220
Now this piece by Palestrina, uh, and I
hope you've everybody got the sheet there.

542
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,910
We've got the sheet of music.
You can,

543
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:56,800
there's enough light I think generally to
see, uh, what, uh, what you have there.

544
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,700
Uh,
it is written in for voice polyphony,

545
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:07,020
but the aesthetic impact of this polyphony
is pretty much the same as that of

546
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:11,380
Chan.
Instead of one line of chant,

547
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:15,100
now we have four independent lines.
So we have polyphony.

548
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,380
Palestrina has taken a piece
of chant slightly indeed.

549
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:23,260
What it was was an old hymn
monophonic him. Should I be animated?

550
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:28,380
The line through the addition of simple
rhythmic values and placed it in four

551
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:34,381
voices so as to amplify the sense for
could do more to amplify the sense of the

552
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,280
of the chant.
Indeed,

553
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:41,960
this song Tucs has this same
relaxed nonaggressive unassertive.

554
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:47,090
You have very beautiful style of chant
itself even though there are now four

555
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:52,740
individual parts instead of one,
we've got polyphony instead of monopoly.

556
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,380
So you've got the music there.

557
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:59,620
Palestrina is overlaying sewing together
here for short chant like phrases and

558
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:05,660
I've numbered them on this
sheet one through four.

559
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:10,990
Each of these phrases comes
in in turn in each voice,

560
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,780
each voice imitating the preceding voice.

561
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,180
So we've got imitative counterpoint.

562
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,010
These passages of counterpoint
are called points of imitation,

563
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,000
points of imitation. This is what we
get a lot of in renaissance music.

564
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,080
So we have four points of
imitation in point of fact.

565
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:34,880
It's so they sort of look like for
very short expositions in a few,

566
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:40,330
but in this sunk twos in this
imitative saunters of Palestrina, uh,

567
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:45,230
each exposition, each of these four little
exposition has its own, the subject,

568
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:49,520
its own theme here rather than
one dominating the whole few.

569
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:53,920
Okay. So here are the EOM
saw and this is number one.

570
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:59,320
Hahahaha.

571
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,890
And then number point number two begins.
No me,

572
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,800
Saba,

573
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,750
uh,
number three across the page any soon.

574
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,890
[inaudible] uh,

575
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:20,080
and then finally [inaudible]

576
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:24,490
uh,
uh,

577
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,530
see in that fashion show is
we listened to this recording.

578
00:43:29,531 --> 00:43:32,260
Now I have a question for you here.

579
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,260
Who is singing the soprano part?

580
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:39,760
Are these women the singing this or these
choirboys saying this are these false

581
00:43:39,761 --> 00:43:43,480
set of sending this or these
castrati singing this? Let's listen.

582
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:31,703
Oh,

583
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:53,710
imitative style relaxed in terms of it's
expressive content is very much the,

584
00:45:55,490 --> 00:46:00,490
the essence of the acapella
style of renaissance vocal music.

585
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:05,480
Uh, and who was singing the soprano
part there of our four options.

586
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:09,080
Any thoughts about that?
Elizabeth?

587
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:12,920
I can fall setters. Yeah,
there was a full meal,

588
00:46:12,921 --> 00:46:15,050
false Satish voicing not women,

589
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,200
not choir boys and of course Castrati
or no are no longer an option.

590
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:22,010
So it was false set.

591
00:46:22,011 --> 00:46:26,930
Is there now like to end with one
final final thing and that is um,

592
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:30,590
uh, enjoying myself today,
indulging myself, dressing up,

593
00:46:30,591 --> 00:46:33,300
getting ready for Halloween. Um, but the,

594
00:46:33,301 --> 00:46:38,301
the point of this in a way is to try
to give you a sense of what this music,

595
00:46:39,021 --> 00:46:42,770
and it's a very esoteric kind of
music is about, but it really,

596
00:46:42,771 --> 00:46:45,380
to do it in the classroom,
we would have to take this whole class,

597
00:46:45,381 --> 00:46:46,910
we'd have to go to the cathedral,
the shark,

598
00:46:46,911 --> 00:46:50,270
and we have to sit there and we'd have
to be in front of a statue and look at

599
00:46:50,271 --> 00:46:53,030
the beauty of that statute. We have to
look at the architecture all around us.

600
00:46:53,031 --> 00:46:55,850
We have to look at the beautiful
copes on the back of the clergy.

601
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,480
We would have to see the
beautiful stain glass.

602
00:46:59,481 --> 00:47:03,680
We would have to smell the incense that
is light. And I thought about doing that,

603
00:47:03,681 --> 00:47:06,950
but the fire marshal would
probably shut this down. Uh,

604
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,690
what we can try to do here,

605
00:47:08,691 --> 00:47:11,660
I think I have about a minute left here
to go back to the cathedral of sharks.

606
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:15,530
So let's, we have a slide here.
Uh, it's a slide once again,

607
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,690
of bishop full bear tattoos.
Uh,

608
00:47:17,691 --> 00:47:21,170
he is the composer of the music
that you are about to hear, uh,

609
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,890
and again is sung by a
female group. However, um,

610
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,920
and as this music plays,
just sit back and relax.

611
00:47:27,921 --> 00:47:31,900
Pretend you are having a transcendental
experience yourself. Sit back, relax,

612
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:36,740
and look at some of this
glorious is stain glass. Um,

613
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:40,090
an architecture that has
been in this cathedral, uh,

614
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,480
since the late 12th century.

615
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,313
Sure.

616
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:58,103
Okay.

617
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,800
Ooh,

618
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:27,163
Ooh.

619
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:13,140
Oh,

620
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:16,590
Ooh.

621
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:22,700
So that's all for today. [inaudible]
him. Parksville beat him.

622
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:25,500
Good God.
Seal Nisa asked,

623
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:29,180
I'll turn on the light so
we don't kill ourselves.

624
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:36,090
Ooh.
