1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,490
All right. Good morning. Let us begin.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,520
Today we're going to move away from the
first dimension of music that we've been

3
00:00:09,521 --> 00:00:09,911
looking at,

4
00:00:09,911 --> 00:00:14,800
which is duration or time and begin to
work with the second which is pitch and

5
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:18,820
melody. And here's an uh, uh,
an initial question for you.

6
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:23,560
Think of the texture of music and think
of this, these strands of high and low.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,720
Where does melody sit in the texture?
Is it high,

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,920
middle, or low? Where is it you
think about it conceptually,

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,500
I'm trying to figure out,
well, I got this board up here,

10
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:39,880
this tapestry or whatever. Where's my
melody going to be in the texture? High,

11
00:00:39,881 --> 00:00:44,350
middle or low? Michael? Yeah, usually hot.

12
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,970
Now here's an interesting question
for you. Why is it usually hot?

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,760
There's an acoustical reason for this.

14
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,540
Why does the melody show up in
the high range? I beg your pardon.

15
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,610
It's easier to hear in a high range.

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,110
Why is it easier to hear in a high range?
What about the acoustics here?

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,360
Once again,
laws of acoustics.

18
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,430
Why is it easier to hear in a high
range? I could play for you. For example,

19
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,420
a little bit of Mozart with
something like this. Yeah.

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,210
You like that

21
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,470
sounds better up there. It doesn't.
Why is that the case? Yeah,

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,070
that's it. Exactly. In a melody, we tend
to have a lot of rhythmic activity there.

23
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:48,370
It's got to have activity to
play itself out as melody melody,

24
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,440
but because the way a
sound waves operated,

25
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,770
we have these low sound waves taking
a very long time to clear everything,

26
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,060
very long time to clear.

27
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,390
The higher frequencies take a lot shorter
time to clear their short sound waves.

28
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,690
They clear very quickly
so we can hear a melody,

29
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:15,930
we can hear a melody more clearly in this
higher register and therefore there is

30
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:19,720
always the tendency to have
the base plate sort of walls,

31
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:24,520
low notes because those sounds take a
long time to clear and melodies play

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,640
faster rhythms because those sounds clear
quickly and we can hear and enjoy the

33
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:32,610
melody. All right. That's just a,

34
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,510
an opening thought about why melody
show up in the top part of the texture.

35
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,120
Let's talk about melody here
and let's talk about pitch.

36
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,360
We said before that in western music
we have musical notation and musical

37
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:52,000
notation has relied on more in western
music and any other musical civilization

38
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,160
around the world.
And in the west,

39
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:59,161
this whole idea of pitch notation goes
back to the ninth century when the monks

40
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:05,350
and nuns in Benedictine abbeys in
Switzerland and France and Germany,

41
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,450
northern Italy started doing this.

42
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:14,050
They started marking on parchment or
slate the general course of a military.

43
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,140
Eventually what they did
was to separate these

44
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,070
lines into more discreet places,

45
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,510
are more discreet pitches.

46
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,780
Then around 1000 in northern Italy and
enterprising fellow named Guido hereto

47
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,950
came along and said, well,
you know what? I can,

48
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,190
I can get this to show us how far up we
are supposed to go by placing it on some

49
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:45,130
kind of grid here. And this is
this, this, uh, as I say before,

50
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,460
at the beginning of the first
graph in the history of the West,

51
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,460
this grid of horizontal lines.

52
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,830
And we will know that if
we're going from here to here,

53
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:58,390
it's got to be exactly this
frequency or at least this space.

54
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,040
So initially they came up with four
lines and eventually five and even six,

55
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,220
and then they went back to
five by the 15th century.

56
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,780
What they also did around the
year 1000 was to identify,

57
00:04:10,781 --> 00:04:15,460
to label these, uh, particular, uh, spots,

58
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:20,200
spaces in line. So they began to
call this a and this B and this, c,

59
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,280
d and e, this, f this, g.

60
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,080
When they got up here,

61
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,410
they stop.
Why did they stop?

62
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,840
Why didn't they keep right on going
with g h? I, j. K. L. M. N. O. P.

63
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:37,810
Why don't we sing m's and o's and peas

64
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,030
today?
Why did they stop?

65
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,503
Any ideas?

66
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,663
Yeah,

67
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,870
no, they had this thing, they hit this
thing called the octave. Then of course,

68
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:53,870
there's this at and another acoustical
phenomena here we've talked about before.

69
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,860
What's your relationship within an octave?
The string is vibrating higher.

70
00:04:57,861 --> 00:05:00,000
One is exactly twice
with the lower on the,

71
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,380
so they heard this and they heard
this is essentially all one sound.

72
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,720
So if it's a duplication of sale,
let's duplicate the letters.

73
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,670
But you can't look at manuscripts of
the early 11th century and see it was

74
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,040
people singing peas and L's and
ooze and ends and things like that.

75
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,190
So they became to uniformly adopted
system of what's called octave duplication

76
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,830
and every musical
culture around the world.

77
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:27,410
I've talked with ethnomusicologists
about this particular point.

78
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,150
Every musical culture around the
world, Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian,

79
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,100
Indian, African, whatever,

80
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,170
they all use this phenomenon of Optus
duplication in their music, octave,

81
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:40,640
duplication in the music.

82
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,850
But how they divide up this sonic
space within the active can vary rather

83
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:46,911
considerably.

84
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:51,650
Some Arabic music seems to have as many
as 14 gradations within the opposite.

85
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:56,480
Now we're going to listen to a piece
of music here from the tradition of

86
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:01,280
classical India and I thought we
might have a sitar player in here.

87
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,050
Somebody I got wind of the fact,

88
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:06,050
we might have the classical
Indian musician in our class,

89
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:09,710
somebody that has studied the Sitar and
might be able to come in and play one

90
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:11,270
for us, but we don't, we don't have that.

91
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:15,080
So we're going to use a something
on our CD's by the world.

92
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:19,070
Famous sitarist Ravi Shankar.
Okay. You've probably heard of him.

93
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,060
He's actually quite old though.
It must be surely isn't as eighties.

94
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,450
He was very famous when I was in graduate
school. Tons and tons of years ago. So,

95
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,510
but he is the venerable sitar player.

96
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:34,610
And here is the pattern of the Raga,
we'll call it a scale.

97
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:37,490
It's not really a skill but a
but a raga that he is using.

98
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:39,470
It's got only six notes within the office

99
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,890
and the sick notes are

100
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,140
that particular pattern.

101
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,570
It doesn't sound like any skill
you we've ever heard of it.

102
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,580
So let's listen to Ravi Shankar play a
bit of a Raga using a six node scale.

103
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,243
Okay?

104
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,643
Okay.

105
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:35,470
So that gives you a flavor of that and
you have that of course on your CD number

106
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:39,910
six 15. Uh, so that's um, that's a,

107
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:44,000
a bit of Sitar music. Now we're going
to play another six nodes scale.

108
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:45,050
Let's go onto that one.

109
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:50,051
Linda gets set and this of
course is sung by Norah Jones.

110
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:54,980
And as you know from reading the textbook,
why do I mention Norah Jones?

111
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:59,870
Or why do we play Norah Jones right
after Ravi Shankar? It's his daughter.

112
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,610
No,
an interesting world.

113
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,230
Every Saturday morning and
I'm going through stop and
shoppers and there is Nora

114
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,350
Jones and the background playing and I'm
going down the pasta aisle or whatever

115
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:14,270
and I have the daughter of Ravi Shankar
over my, over my shoulder. What a world.

116
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:15,100
Huh?
Uh,

117
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:20,040
so we're going to listen to just a
couple of seconds here of a blues tune by

118
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,370
some by Norah Jones.

119
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,880
Okay. So we'll just cut. But
what she's working losses people,

120
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,200
we're not going to listen to the
whole thing is this idea of a book.

121
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,230
Yeah.
No.

122
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,870
How's that up? Right? One,
two, three, four, five, six.

123
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,160
With this one, sometimes major in,
sometimes minor, we'll come back to it.

124
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,590
So that's another six notes scale,
but a different sort of pattern.

125
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,600
A different kinds of pattern
is a blues scale pattern.

126
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,850
Just kind of between the major
and minor that we'll, we'll,

127
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:30,970
we'll talk about a little bit later.

128
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,820
So two different forms of a six node
pattern. Let's go to a five no pattern.

129
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,810
If you've ever visited parts of Indonesia,
which I have not.

130
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:43,430
And if you've ever visited parts
of China, which I have not, um,

131
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,740
I am told that you will
hear this kind of music.

132
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,750
It's played by a traditional Chinese
instrument called the are who this I have

133
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:55,930
seen around the world many times and
heard it's a two string instrument to

134
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,030
produce a particularly beautiful,
vibrant tone.

135
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,490
So we're going to listen
to an r who playing.

136
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,790
I think this is track if
you want to pursue it,

137
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,680
it's track a six CD track 16.
Um,

138
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,720
let's listen to an r who play a melody
by a traditional Chinese composer.

139
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,300
We call him an English Abi and you can
read about him there in your textbook.

140
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,210
Okay,
so let's pick that up.

141
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,490
Five notes within the octave just there.

142
00:11:09,491 --> 00:11:12,690
So it's a pen and what we call a
pentatonic scale pentatonic scale.

143
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,040
And that's using a lot of, of Far Eastern
cultures, the pentatonic scale to five,

144
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,660
five note scale. Yeah. Okay. So we have
this whole idea of octave duplication,

145
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,970
uh, sometimes six months,
sometimes five notes.

146
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:29,260
We in the West have settled on a seven
note scale. Why did that happen? Well,

147
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:30,440
we have this idea of the seven oaks

148
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,580
major seven no,
the

149
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,450
notes, well, if the answer that we have
to go back to ancient Greek music theory,

150
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:41,870
and you read about this as really, really
turgid stuff, but believe it or not,

151
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,250
I teach a course on this at the graduate
level. We have to read the quarter.

152
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:48,980
Linda has to take this kind of stuff from
reading era stocks and this and things

153
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:53,210
like this. So what, what we were
dealing here with is a situation.

154
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,160
The ancient Greeks were very much into
mathematics as a way of explaining the

155
00:11:57,161 --> 00:12:00,760
world and explaining music in particular
and they thought these ratios were

156
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,800
primary.
So they had the ratio of two to one,

157
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:04,420
which gave them the
octave and three to two,

158
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:07,450
which gave them the fifth and four
to three, which gave them the fourth.

159
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,510
They also, because the system worked
out better for their purposes,

160
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:14,050
then jumped to nine to eight,
which gave them the whole time.

161
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,950
So they started out there and let's
say they were working down here,

162
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:21,520
they filled in the octave up above and
then they filled in the fifth and then

163
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:24,490
they filled in the fourth and then they
came down a whole step and then they

164
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:28,030
went up a fourth from that whole
step and an upper forth from that.

165
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,540
And they were filling in in this
fashion interestingly enough.

166
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:36,040
And you ever wonder this I,
there's sometimes if somebody
wandered by keyboards,

167
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,740
that's odd. What's the great
oddity about the keyboard?

168
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,160
Which strange about this keyboard?

169
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,870
It's very a symmetrical right? Uh, Marcus.

170
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,130
Yeah, it's missing. It's missing
some, some notes in here.

171
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:53,290
This is missing something in
here and there's missing there.

172
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,920
Well what these are where the cracks
after the Greeks laid out their fists and

173
00:12:56,921 --> 00:13:00,850
force and whole steps,
they had these little leftovers.

174
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:02,310
They called them lemurs are,

175
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,140
they had these little leftovers in there
and that's why we end up with these

176
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:06,960
small distances between BNC.

177
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:12,080
Yeah. Hot, hot, hot.
That's a big step out. Hum.

178
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,970
Badadada that's

179
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,600
a small step there.
So the scale is actually not equal.

180
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:21,350
A to B is one distance, which
is a large one. And BDC is,

181
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,580
is only half that distance.

182
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:26,300
And that's because of the way the Greeks
laid this thing out with their two to

183
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:30,440
one ratio, street to ratios and
so on. But in any event we in,

184
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:33,950
we ended up with this. Now the Greeks,
so had a whole series of patterns.

185
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:35,680
They called them mixed
of Lydian and hypo mix,

186
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,170
the Lydian and Phrygian and hypo
fridges and stuff like this.

187
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,200
A lot of different patterns.
But in the course of history,

188
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,940
we settled beginning in the 16th and
17th century down into two just two

189
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:51,770
patterns than what we call the
major pattern and the minor pattern.

190
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,810
So let's talk about that just for
a moment. Uh, and before we do it,

191
00:13:56,811 --> 00:14:00,560
I should add one of the things. How then
do we get these other notes up here?

192
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,160
We get these other notes up here.
Well, well we now call the black notes,

193
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,610
although historically
keyboards could be either way.

194
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,170
You could have these added notes,
a black oral, uh, or white,

195
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:13,650
and then these underneath would be buying.

196
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,180
So we filled these out sort
of in the 14th century.

197
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:18,680
All of this got filled in.

198
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,870
These between BNC and enf didn't get
filled in because they were already just

199
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:26,740
the smallest amount that they wanted
to deal with. Just half steps.

200
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,030
So we end up here within an octave.

201
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,420
We end up with 12 equal pitches,

202
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:37,450
but we still use this term a seven note
scale because we have seven notes within

203
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:42,440
the scale of the major scale and seven
notes within the scale of the minor scale.

204
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,360
All right,

205
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,650
so let's talk about major and minor now
and we've put those patterns up here.

206
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:52,640
This is given for you in your
textbook is something of a review.

207
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,550
Let's start with a major scale on a c.

208
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,460
So here is the symbol for c and the staff.

209
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,570
Here is where c would be
located on the keyboard.

210
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:06,830
We're going to start here and we had this
pattern of the major that goes whole,

211
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:09,680
whole half, whole, whole, whole half step.

212
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,790
So we start on c and then
we go up to d a whole step.

213
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,800
I'm going to write that in here.
That's good.

214
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,630
Now we go d to e and
that's another whole step.

215
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:23,990
Now I have a half step. I got to go
up just a half step there and money,

216
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,900
but it's just f is just a half step away,
so that's good.

217
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,500
I don't need to do anything more
than that. Now I'm on f here. Oil,

218
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:33,020
I need a whole step. There's
my one, I need a whole step.

219
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:38,021
I got to go up to g and then another
whole step up to a and then another whole

220
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:39,530
step up to be.

221
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:44,240
And the last one in the major
pattern is a half step from B to c.

222
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,090
Ah,
there we are and that's good.

223
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,960
So we've got our major scale. Let's
talk a little bit about the minor scale.

224
00:15:54,961 --> 00:15:58,470
Now it's got it. It's got a different
pattern, got a different pattern.

225
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,950
They liked melodies to go this way.
They're like melodies to go this way.

226
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,220
Let's start on the same pitch.
See,

227
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,340
let's go up a whole step.
What's a whole step above c?

228
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,300
Just d now we need according to our
pattern to go up just a half step.

229
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,890
What's a half step above d?
Well then we have to think about,

230
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:24,270
we've got to get into these black notes,
which can be called sharps or flats.

231
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,500
They're called sharps.
If they're up above the note in question,

232
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:33,540
this would be some kind
of d sharp. They're called
flats if they're down below.

233
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,740
So flats or below, uh, the
sharps take you up a half step.

234
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:42,900
So we went to see two D, we need this
pitch here. What are we going to call it

235
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,220
or are we going to call it d sharp?

236
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,280
Well we should call it e flat.

237
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,470
We should call it e flat
and put it up on the Elan.

238
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,680
Cause it was kind of a rule here that you
have to use up each letter name intern

239
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:03,670
each letter name. In turn we can't
go. C, d, d sharp, f we got to go CD,

240
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:08,020
some kind of e f so you gotta go
up the alphabet here. All right,

241
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:09,220
so there we are.

242
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,870
But is this from d to e a half step?

243
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,620
We need a half step here.
What we've written is a whole step.

244
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,880
So we've got to indicate that this is
just a half step away in that fashion.

245
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:25,420
D to e flat.
Now what do we do above the flat?

246
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,570
Well, the whole step here
where there's one half,

247
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:33,571
there's another hand would take us to
f whole step above f would take us to,

248
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:37,060
Gee, what am I going to
write here from, Gee,

249
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:41,120
I need a half step here is ah,

250
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,010
it doesn't matter. Here's the pattern
up here. We'll focus on this one.

251
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:49,800
I need a half step above g. What's
a half step above g? E flat.

252
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,360
Okay.
I need a whole step above a flat,

253
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,293
right?

254
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,200
Hmm. Nice and loud please.
Edward B flat. Okay.

255
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,600
And then at the end of the process,

256
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:08,070
I have another whole step from B flat back
to seat. And that gives me back to my,

257
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,390
to my active in that fashion.
Okay.

258
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,500
Well I think that's a
straightforward enough if,

259
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,120
if you're unsure about that checkout, of
course, chapter three in the textbook, uh,

260
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,100
where these issues, uh,
issues are addressed.

261
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,900
Okay. We've been talking about scales,
these idea of major and minor scales,

262
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:40,160
and we said there's seven notes
in each of these two scales,

263
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,050
12 pitches altogether within the office.
But within the scale,

264
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:48,680
all notes are not the same. There's
one note as the primary note, right?

265
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,640
What's the primary node call? They'll
note around which all of the others,

266
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,620
all the others gravitate tonic. No. Okay.

267
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,980
Uh, then there's one other
that we have to know about.

268
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:05,200
It's called the leading tone
and what it does is pull in the,

269
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,570
to the tonic.
Let's say we're in the key of c here.

270
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:13,070
The leading tone is always the seventh
degree. It's always a half step,

271
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,660
or it's a half snap. Seventh degree
right below, right below the tonic.

272
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,240
We might throw it away, man. I thought the
tonic was down here. We've got one, two,

273
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:22,490
three, four, five, six, seven and eight.

274
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,880
Eight is a duplication of
one eat in one or the tonic.

275
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,760
So seven poles up in two,

276
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,520
eight it pulls up into
two eight the tonic.

277
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,603
Hmm.

278
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:48,760
That's the leading toe.
Where's it want to go?

279
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,030
You can hear it pulling in their
opera. Singers love this. They,

280
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,870
they love to kind of luxuriate and the
opportunity to show off their voice on

281
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:05,710
leading tones, build up expectation.
Make you wait even more for that topic.

282
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:08,020
Let's listen to Luciano Pavarotti.

283
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:13,260
Pavarotti seeing a leading tone and it
was by coincidence happens to be the one

284
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:16,810
year anniversary of the Pavarotti,
his death this week.

285
00:20:16,811 --> 00:20:19,180
So here's Luciano Pavarotti,
singing, leading tone.

286
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,800
The tempo here is very slow and
he slows it down even more than,

287
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:23,950
and he just sits out there,

288
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:26,890
this huge wonderful voice that
he had on the leading tone.

289
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,360
And you can hear him sort of slightly,
didn't go,

290
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,090
gone. You could hear him slide
that leading towed into the,

291
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,740
into the, um, into the
tonic in that case. Okay.

292
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:01,080
So we've got across the idea of,
uh,

293
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,000
of tonics and leading tones.
So we do tonics.

294
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:07,000
Do we know the time it is?

295
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,710
Sing it. Um, so given the setup,

296
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,570
you kind of feel that what your Michigan
or what this home home pitch is the

297
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,870
pitch to which to which
you are Greg gravitating

298
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,100
most of our popular music folk tall or
songs or things like that are written in

299
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:32,920
Dupo meter and in a major key.

300
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,410
Occasionally you get things written
in triple meter and in a minor key,

301
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,210
minor key.
Yeah.

302
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,163
Uh,

303
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,610
that's Gershwin,
Porgy and bess in minor folks home.

304
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,160
Well, civil war, civil war
zone and so on. It goes.

305
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,150
Occasionally you do run into pop pieces,
folk songs in minor,

306
00:22:27,151 --> 00:22:30,630
but most of them are in major,
probably about 80% in major.

307
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,470
Same thing in the classical
realm. Linda, what would you say?

308
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,590
What percentage of classical
pieces are written in minor keys?

309
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,080
Okay,

310
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,620
well, well give us a number. Take

311
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:50,950
only five. Classical. Huh? Maybe
a little more than that, but,

312
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,520
but, but not, not all that minute.
Here's what I don't know. We should,

313
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:57,370
we should do a survey sometime. Go to
go through the literature, see what,

314
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,200
but most of, for the most part, it shows
minor. A major occasionally is chosen.

315
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:06,250
Here's a good example of a minor from
the second movement of Beethoven's Third

316
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,084
Symphony.

317
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,893
Hmm.

318
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,193
No,

319
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,160
but for Mozart,
major

320
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,420
difference between major and minor.

321
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,700
So when you used to making
associations with major and
minor, major, happy, bright,

322
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,640
optimistic day, like today, minor, somber.

323
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:12,240
Uh, why is that the case? Is there
anything in the physics of this music? No,

324
00:24:12,241 --> 00:24:12,781
not really.

325
00:24:12,781 --> 00:24:16,170
There's nothing in the loss of physical
acoustics here that caused that to be

326
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:17,760
the case.
If you look back over it,

327
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,780
there was no prejudice major or minor
in western music up in about the 16th

328
00:24:21,781 --> 00:24:22,141
century.

329
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:25,110
And then people started writing these
things called madrigals that were tied to

330
00:24:25,111 --> 00:24:29,130
texts and they got in this habit of
every time they had a bright happy texts,

331
00:24:29,131 --> 00:24:33,840
they'd set this in one kind of,
uh, of mode or, or key major,

332
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,650
a major mode. And every time it had
a sad, when they'd set it in minor,

333
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,130
we got used to hearing it that way.

334
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,790
So it's kind of cool every time it'll
shoe wants to write about the Mary Farmer.

335
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,600
Sometimes she'll buy,
let's right a funeral march.

336
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:57,270
And there's a tendency also minor, low,
major high trying to say, so we get,

337
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,200
we get used to this and this point that
it is culture rather than acoustics was

338
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,480
brought home to me once in a discussion
with a student here at Yale who said to

339
00:25:04,481 --> 00:25:06,640
me, yeah, but over there
at the [inaudible] center,

340
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:11,730
we Jews have lots of happy melodies and
they are all in minor what you would

341
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,130
call minor. That's what I
thought about that. Yeah,

342
00:25:15,131 --> 00:25:16,330
that's probably true even though,

343
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,353
hmm.

344
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,390
It's that the Israeli national anthem.
I think so.

345
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,250
Is that right? What, is
that what yes or no? Okay.

346
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,150
But it may be how many national anthems
around the world do we have in minor

347
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:39,020
keys? And what does this say about the
tradition of Jewish music? He, is it,

348
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,470
is it really western or is
it eastern European or Asian?

349
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:47,480
Even with some Asian influences.
Ah, interesting. Interesting issues,

350
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:51,260
uh, issues that can be brought
home. This kind of ambiguity.

351
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:56,000
Sometimes you encounter in Klezmer
music, any, but what's Klezmer music,

352
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,110
sort of Jewish,
traditional Jewish folk music.

353
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:02,360
A lot of the coming out of eastern Europe.

354
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:07,361
So we're going to listen to a kind of
souped up or rocked up a version of some

355
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:12,731
klezmer music here and what they have
a strong bass electric bass underneath.

356
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,630
And we're going to listen

357
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,553
to

358
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,050
a minor melody with the
leading tone thrown in.

359
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,990
It gives it this kind of exotic field

360
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,590
and then it will switch
major.

361
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:29,690
So let's listen to this
bit of Klezmer music.

362
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:32,180
Go back and forth between minor and major

363
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:37,730
[inaudible].

364
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,273
Okay.

365
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,570
Okay, so that's the intro. Now we're
going to go onto the shift. Uh,

366
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,830
two major here,
another little clip.

367
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,960
So there is in major,
let's listen a little bit more.

368
00:27:16,961 --> 00:27:20,390
It's going to go back to minor and then
I think shifts back to major will be a

369
00:27:20,391 --> 00:27:23,980
boon to hear. You're the shift turned
down just a little bit. Linda, please.

370
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:32,560
Major, minor. Raise your left
hand if you think it's minor.

371
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:39,920
What about this major? My right
hand, if it's major, this is major.

372
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,810
It's a little bit of a, of this
ambiguity in between major and minor.

373
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,330
Any piece of traditional Jewish music.
Oh,

374
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,850
let's see.
We've talked about.

375
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,370
Let's talk about hearing. Tell me
how we hear these melodies. Um,

376
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,340
when the reason that we hear these
is this as distinctly different,

377
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:13,760
I think happens rather
early on in the scale.

378
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,430
Let's think about this for a minute.
We've got this scale up. Can we?

379
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,550
Yeah. Um, if you go to this scale

380
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:28,080
that sound dark, I don't know, 500 years
ago, that wouldn't have sounded dark.

381
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,990
Now that sounds dark to us,
Ahmed,

382
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,040
Yamaha, Yamaha, Tom,

383
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,840
but that darkness occurs very early
in the scale. As you can see there.

384
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:39,810
It's the third note we'll be talking
about the fact that this is an interval of

385
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:40,860
the third spans,

386
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:44,940
three letter names a little bit later
on so that minor third can show up very

387
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:49,770
early in the scale that that's a critical
moment in any scale determining how

388
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:53,370
we're going to feel about it
and we can just play with that.

389
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,780
That particular interval to change
entirely the way we feel about particular

390
00:28:57,781 --> 00:29:01,550
melodies here is I'm a Christian song.
I guess it's

391
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,510
joy to the world.
The Lord has come.

392
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,750
Don't we send you the Christmas Kale or
something is seen as a Christmas Carol.

393
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,080
Not much joy there. Oh, you
like that one. How about you?

394
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,470
Or my favorite is

395
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,700
no,
you can turn this whole thing.

396
00:29:40,701 --> 00:29:43,780
You said Jewish bar Mitzvah or
something like that. And you were,

397
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,620
you were singing with the Coen brothers
down to somewhere in an appellation.

398
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,920
What was that wonderful movie though?

399
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,990
But it had the Coen brothers and all
the great American folk music in it.

400
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,420
You are my sunshine. Oh,
brother. Where art thou?

401
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:59,350
Wasn't that what it was called
brother? Where art thou? Yeah. So, uh,

402
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,810
just that little was a switch to
turn off a switch there. You can,

403
00:30:02,811 --> 00:30:07,000
you can do some great, great things
with changing, changing the mode.

404
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,210
So we've got scales that
are in the major mode.

405
00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:14,830
We've got scales in the minor mode.
We also have scales in the chromatic mode,

406
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,060
and that's when we don't have just
seven pitches within this scale.

407
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,510
We're going to use all of the pitches,
all 12 here,

408
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:26,590
chroma from the is the Greek
word for color. So this is a,

409
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:31,100
a more colorful scale. Um, uh,

410
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,960
what is it?
Well,

411
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:37,250
that's a chromatic scale.

412
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,480
We had an example of that the other
day working with the Mozart. Uh,

413
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:46,510
where was that in the requiem. Oh, food.

414
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,070
Yeah. Remember we had, he
was coming up a minor stuff,

415
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,953
gale

416
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,540
and then he at the top

417
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,403
love it,

418
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,260
switched over into a chromatic scale.
Here's the story.

419
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,590
Minor
chromatic,

420
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:19,600
um, what does, what does this do to us?

421
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:20,800
Why did he do that?
Well,

422
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,880
it chromaticism adds tension to music and
especially chromaticism that's pulling

423
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:29,000
up scales and go up ed tension
music goes up generally.

424
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,620
But if you can double that,
combine that with chromatic music,

425
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,060
then you got a sort of super windy of
tension and that's what he's doing.

426
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:41,740
They're trying to build tension as,
as the just rise from the graves at the,

427
00:31:41,741 --> 00:31:44,170
at that party.
At that particular point,

428
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:49,330
the entire compositions are rarely
written in the chromatic scale.

429
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:50,460
Yeah.
It's,

430
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,460
it's kind of a color that you throw in
from time to time for a special effect.

431
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,500
So we've got the major minor scales,
we've got the chromatic scales.

432
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,800
We also have what we
call conjunct melodies.

433
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,873
Hmm.

434
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:09,010
Melodies or just kind of running up and
down the scale, a neighboring tones. Um,

435
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:21,500
those are two Christmas carols that
are very conjunct in, in nature.

436
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,270
A good example we used a moment
ago of a disjunct melody. Yes.

437
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,893
Hmm.

438
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,550
Can we all sing that?
Here we go, ready sing,

439
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,940
take me how to the ball game,

440
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,890
take me out to the park,
et,

441
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:44,090
etc. It's amazing that that melody has
become as popular as it has given the

442
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:47,780
fact that it's really hard to sing.
It's a very disjunct melody.

443
00:32:47,781 --> 00:32:52,190
It's got all these odd leaps at Bop,
bop, bop, boop beep. So I was like, sure.

444
00:32:52,191 --> 00:32:56,720
And Berg almost, it's sort of off the
map here in terms of this junk mis,

445
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,140
but nonetheless we have been
able to absorb all of that.

446
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:05,141
So melodies can be conjunct or this joke
and possibly the most conjunct of all

447
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:07,041
melodies.

448
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:11,270
And the history of music was the melody
that we looked at very briefly in the

449
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:15,440
first gathering and that is
Beethoven's famous Ode to Joy.

450
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,140
Now would the van Beethoven
was in his fifties,

451
00:33:18,141 --> 00:33:22,790
when he was working on his last symphony,
would prove to be as last symphony,

452
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:24,470
his ninth symphony.
Uh,

453
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:28,700
and he'd been tinkering with
this particular melody all
the way back to probably

454
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:33,470
1803. So it's about 20 years
or so. Ninth Symphony is 18,

455
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:38,120
23, 24 as early as 1823.
We know he's working right?

456
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,310
Trying to get this to work just right.
And eventually over this 20 year period,

457
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,760
he did get it to work just right.
Let me swing this board around.

458
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,730
Here's the famous melody.
I put it in the key, uh,

459
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,710
what's called the Bass clef here.
And it's in a major key. Uh,

460
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,510
we don't need to know what
the particular notes are,

461
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,780
but let's look at this just
for a moment because it's,

462
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:10,770
it works well as a prototype of melody.

463
00:34:10,771 --> 00:34:14,520
It does something that a lot
of melodies do. First of all,

464
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:19,260
as you can see by the trajectory here,
it's very conjunct,

465
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,770
right? It's all a
neighboring notes here. Uh,

466
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,460
if you look at the German and the text,
it has to do with xy.

467
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:29,310
UHMM shroom and nearly Yonin the
millions be embraced. And this I believe,

468
00:34:29,311 --> 00:34:32,670
is that sort of national anthem
for the United Nations. So this,

469
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:37,050
this has to be something that we can all
see. And if you have conjunct motion,

470
00:34:37,051 --> 00:34:41,250
that makes it easier.
It's also very symmetrical.

471
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,630
As you can see,

472
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:47,310
it's nothing but a pattern of four bars
plus four bars plus four bars plus four

473
00:34:47,311 --> 00:34:49,410
bucks.
And as we said before,

474
00:34:49,411 --> 00:34:54,120
music has a syntax so that these
phrases have to be in a price range in a

475
00:34:54,121 --> 00:34:58,370
particular way. That makes sense. So we
start out here with an opening phrase.

476
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,740
No, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

477
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,270
Is that the tonic dot.
Yeah.

478
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,650
MMM.

479
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:13,170
Gained by seeing the tonic. Yeah. Yeah.

480
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,540
The tonic is actually over here.
It's a little bit lower than that.

481
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,660
That was a really hard question and that
is amazing that anybody got it. Good.

482
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:25,300
Phew. So what happens here
is this opening phrase it,

483
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:29,790
we'll call a musicians like to label stuff
just with alphabetical labels to keep

484
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:32,640
it simple.
We'll call this phrase a,

485
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,870
it sort of opens things up and we
refer to this as the antecedent frig.

486
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,330
The next phrase be

487
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,270
a lot od Dadadadadada

488
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,320
very similar dot.
Yeah.

489
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,830
Aw.

490
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,600
But here it takes the a deviation.

491
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,560
Dot Hot

492
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,670
and gets it back.
Gets us back to the tonic.

493
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:53,380
Now we could walk out the door at
that point, right. Dot. Um, we've,

494
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,310
we're feeling totally stable there.

495
00:35:55,311 --> 00:35:57,770
We've got an altogether for
the rest of the day. However,

496
00:35:57,771 --> 00:36:01,970
it'd be a pretty short melody. So what
he then does is write an extension.

497
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,090
We'll call this c

498
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,780
yacht hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

499
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:12,540
Um, ah, very interesting.
Put an asterix by this.

500
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,860
Beethoven in a way saved this melody.
He rescued this melody,

501
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,750
which was in danger of becoming
excessively s four square by doing,

502
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:23,110
what if I had been writing it?

503
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,400
Todd Todd, Todd, Todd, Todd. Ah,

504
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,390
Dadada.

505
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,930
What did Beethoven do here?
We talked about it last time.

506
00:36:31,931 --> 00:36:35,010
ARRHYTHMIC device syncopation.

507
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,180
He brings his opening note that f
sharp in a beat early. This should,

508
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:41,710
you would think would be a half note.

509
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,740
And this would start on
the down beat over here,

510
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:48,400
but he brings in effect the sounds
of the downbeat in a beat early.

511
00:36:48,401 --> 00:36:51,520
It gives it a little bit of pep
there at that particular point.

512
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:55,290
And then what is this here long

513
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,940
you thought? Hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot tar. Tar Pop.

514
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:03,160
Well of course it's a replication of B.

515
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,440
We've got to end on the tonic.

516
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:10,450
All pieces of classical or pop one
way or the other and on the tonic.

517
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,420
Okay,
so lets us,

518
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,390
let's have us now for Moto over this.

519
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,500
Let's all sing this.
I think we don't have to read the note.

520
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,390
You don't have to sing any text. We're
just going to sing la all conduct in four.

521
00:37:25,391 --> 00:37:26,240
So sit back.

522
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,990
Well my mama ma ha ha ha ha ha ha.

523
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,580
I believe vocally prepared
here. Here. Here we go.

524
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,900
I'll give you one, two. Ready Sing,

525
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:42,870
la La la La Louder loud.

526
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,880
Her La La la La la La la La la La la La
la La la La la La la La la La la La la

527
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,060
La la La la La la La la La la.
La,

528
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,670
la, la, la, la, la, la.

529
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:20,930
We'll

530
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,800
put a big retard on it. Yeah. So
we wanted to bang that syncopation.

531
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:27,510
And then of course there's no sound on
the downbeat over here to make the sake

532
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:32,390
of patient shake a patient work. So
that's the melody. It seem very simple.

533
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,910
It took Beethoven a long time to sort of
iron all this out and make this perfect

534
00:38:36,911 --> 00:38:41,410
melody, the prototypical melody in
a way. And then, uh, in the, uh,

535
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,880
early 18,
20.

536
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:46,090
So you decided to incorporate this as
the main theme of the last movement,

537
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:48,130
the finale of his last symphony.

538
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:51,700
So this is some of the last music that
Beethoven wrote in the setting that we're

539
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:54,490
about to listen to. So let's
listen. We're not going to,

540
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,030
I think Linda has it said here.

541
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:01,810
We're going to hear the beginning of this
and he prejudice it presents this as a

542
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:06,100
series of eight or variation. So here
is the first presentation of our melody.

543
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,460
Nice and loud.
That's okay.

544
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:43,710
And then he repeats C and B.

545
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,443
Okay.

546
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,240
Okay. Now let's pause.
Let's pause it right there.

547
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,050
Now we're going to go onto the second
presentation of the team and I have three

548
00:40:01,051 --> 00:40:02,640
questions for you as we do.

549
00:40:02,641 --> 00:40:07,050
So where has the theme of
the Melody Gone here? Uh,

550
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:10,380
well it's a, is this a motive
or a theme, by the way?

551
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,810
See, it's not a motive is way too,
or was a good example of a theme.

552
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,990
It's way too long for a motive.
Motive would only go about four or five,

553
00:40:18,991 --> 00:40:21,780
six months. So we had this
beautiful theme here. Um,

554
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,390
and as we listened to
this next presentation,

555
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,800
where has the theme or Melody Golan,
what instruments are playing at now?

556
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,590
Uh,
what is the texture?

557
00:40:31,591 --> 00:40:36,000
Like how many lines can
you hear in this texture?

558
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,740
How many strands of music do you
hear? Can you pick up? And thirdly,

559
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,690
what is this texture call?

560
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:47,340
Last time we said we had three kinds of
texture and music, which are monophonic.

561
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:52,170
Homophonic can polyphonic which, uh,
is this particular texture. Okay,

562
00:40:52,171 --> 00:40:53,004
here we go.

563
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,783
That's,

564
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,440
we should have an a
previous, yeah, it should be,

565
00:41:06,441 --> 00:41:10,840
but that's the next variation. I
confused. I confused Linda there.

566
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,273
Here.

567
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:46,260
Great.

568
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:51,060
Let's just pause it there. So
what do you think, how many lines?

569
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,970
First of all, where's the
melody gone? The scene.

570
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,750
Okay.

571
00:41:55,750 --> 00:42:00,750
It's gone up a little bit and it's
being played by what instruments? Yeah.

572
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:05,160
Strings, violins, violins. But not the
top. Not The top part of the violence.

573
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,010
Family kind of second violin,
middle range of the strings here.

574
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:13,840
How many parts do you hear in the, how
many separate musical lines there? Marcus?

575
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:18,040
Three. Tell us about those three.
We've just talked about one of them,

576
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:22,120
the melody and the violins up above.
Can you tell us about some of the others?

577
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,493
Oh,

578
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,580
okay. They're doing like a counterpoint,
right? They're doing it. Yeah.

579
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:35,270
Okay. This is, uh, it's too easy.
I'm sorry I had to go for that. Um,

580
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,410
uh, it, uh, there they are
playing a contrapuntal wall.
But you're absolutely right.

581
00:42:40,411 --> 00:42:44,520
That's the key point. And that then
answers mark list. What's the texture?

582
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,790
If you got to cut Marcus please.
Yeah.

583
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,750
Polyphonic so this is polyphony here.
What was the third voice?

584
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,690
If we had melody up above
and kind of a counterpoint,

585
00:42:54,691 --> 00:42:57,500
if Marcus says there in the middle,
what was the,

586
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:01,940
we had one other part and what was that?
Well,

587
00:43:01,941 --> 00:43:04,760
let's listen to a little more. We've
identified the melody. Let's just,

588
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,300
can we just continue from
where we are? Okay. Maybe,

589
00:43:08,301 --> 00:43:13,010
maybe you jumped ahead as I, as I told
you to do. Yeah. No, it's mine, don't you?

590
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,320
It's my fault,
not yours.

591
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,440
So we're going to back it up
into that previous variation.

592
00:43:18,441 --> 00:43:22,580
Let's just see if we can pick up
what the missing third part here.

593
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,640
It's a bassoon playing the contrapuntal.

594
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,713
We'll

595
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:49,973
just pause it there.

596
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,730
So what is the third part there?
The base?

597
00:43:54,731 --> 00:43:57,670
Yeah. Usually in Mel you're going to have
a melody. You're going to have a base.

598
00:43:57,671 --> 00:43:58,780
So the base is doing stuff.

599
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:01,443
Hmm.

600
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,840
Underneath here. Um, so there,

601
00:44:15,841 --> 00:44:19,040
there's the melody up above this
bassoon playing the counterpoint,

602
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:19,741
kind of in the middle.

603
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:22,460
And then the bass player needs
notes quietly underneath it.

604
00:44:22,461 --> 00:44:27,300
There's a little bit hard to hear. A
little. I think we have time. Let's go.

605
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:29,730
Let's just continue right
from there a little bit more.

606
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,430
Can you hear the base now?

607
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,360
There's the bassoon counterpoint

608
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,840
and
let's listen to just a little bit.

609
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,650
I'm gonna pause it there.
Now let's listen to must be what?

610
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:14,640
The third presentation here of the
theme. Where's the theme now? Now,

611
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:17,070
how many parts are there in the texture?

612
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,530
Pause it right there. What about that?
What's a little bit hard to tell exactly?

613
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:58,950
Isn't it hard to tell?
What could you say for sure about it?

614
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:04,460
You've got a melody and where's
it going now? Well, it's going up.

615
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:07,490
It's all now in the first violins.
What else is in there?

616
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:08,780
Okay.

617
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,380
A base. Yeah, we've got a
base and now we, what else?

618
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,580
Some other stuff in the middle.
And that's,

619
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,780
that may be about as much as we can
do with that. I mean really, uh,

620
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:23,000
myself included. I could sort of
sit there and try to track lines,

621
00:46:23,001 --> 00:46:26,840
but I'd have to repeat it. So I think
if we said, oh, we got, we got melody,

622
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:30,110
we've got theme, we got base, we've got
a bunch of other stuff in the middle.

623
00:46:30,111 --> 00:46:31,130
That's just fine and dandy.

624
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,940
But the idea that did it all kind of
independent points out, once again,

625
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,160
that they are playing polyphonic texture.

626
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:41,430
Let's listen to the end of the polyphonic
texture then Beethoven and we'll,

627
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,020
we'll stop with this. It's Beethoven was
like a military general. Interesting.

628
00:46:45,021 --> 00:46:46,040
The way he operated.

629
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,730
It's setting up these battles and indeed
he wrote something called the battle

630
00:46:49,731 --> 00:46:50,420
symphony.

631
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:53,720
And you can just see him how he's kind
of marshaling particular forces to do

632
00:46:53,721 --> 00:46:57,110
particular things at particular time.
So we kind of held back here,

633
00:46:57,111 --> 00:46:58,160
the heavy artillery,

634
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,400
the heavy artillery in the orchestra is
what the brass and sometimes percussion.

635
00:47:03,591 --> 00:47:06,350
So it's the brass he's going
to bring in at this point.

636
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,640
So we'll listen to the end of the
third presentation of this with the

637
00:47:10,641 --> 00:47:15,320
contrapuntal idea, dominated
by strings, melody, base,

638
00:47:15,321 --> 00:47:16,310
other stuff in the middle.

639
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:21,050
And then he will bring in the brass for
the final statement of this. And, uh,

640
00:47:21,051 --> 00:47:22,310
I think our time is about up.

641
00:47:22,311 --> 00:47:25,820
So we'll listen to this and you
can kind of go out as we hear the,

642
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:27,440
the fourth statement

643
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:33,020
[inaudible].
