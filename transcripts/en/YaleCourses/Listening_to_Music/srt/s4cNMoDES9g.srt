1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,370
Okay, let me just check the volume
sounds okay. Let's get started this week.

2
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:09,330
We're going to continue our discussion
of musical form and we're going to fold

3
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:13,020
that discussion inside
of the preparation for,

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,150
there's a concert which is
when Saturday and it is where

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,880
Battell chapel should be on the
sheet there and it's at 8:00 PM.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,350
And we're going to have the Saybrook
orchestra perform for us today.

7
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:32,380
We're going to talk about a theme and
variations and one of the pieces that's on

8
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:33,250
that concert.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,400
And then on Thursday we're going to have
the conductor and several of the solo

10
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:40,420
was come in and talk to us about the
difficulties of this particular con

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,560
concerting sort of get us alerted to the
sort of thing that we should be on the

12
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:49,390
lookout for as reviewers.
We will be continuing with this of course,

13
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,670
uh, in sections of this week and
when you come to lecture next time,

14
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:56,590
we will give you what I call a prep sheet.

15
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:00,880
Let's start with the guide to all three
pieces that are going to be performed.

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,590
And then when you go to
section, you will get, um, a,

17
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:10,120
a sheet and having to do
with how you write a review.

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,970
It's a whole list of sort of do's
and don'ts and writing and review.

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,420
Those of you that are are,
are in the Monday section.

20
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,110
We will work this out in advance.
We'll talk about that on Thursday,

21
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:23,610
but you may be encouraged to
come to an earlier section a,

22
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,730
and if that doesn't work out,

23
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:29,350
we're going to reform those
Monday sections in a way
that will work for you as

24
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:33,700
well. I know there are a
couple of students also, they
can't be here this weekend.

25
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:38,070
It's inevitable that that's the case.
Uh, there will be a makeup concert,

26
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:40,450
a scheduled at a later date.
So don't worry about this,

27
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,560
but do keep coming because the principles
involved in writing a review for this

28
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:48,520
particular concert or identical to
whatever concert, uh, uh, you attend.

29
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,340
Any questions about that
before we get started?

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,540
Yeah.

31
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,170
Okay. If not, let's go ahead and with
a concert program. It's kind of fun.

32
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,700
I started with this way early, the
last, uh, August arranging this.

33
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,630
What I wanted to do was
get a concert coming, uh,

34
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,880
in the middle of the term because I
think you're ready now to go at this a

35
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,930
serious material concert in the middle
of the term performed by an undergraduate

36
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:19,700
orchestra on in which the program
would be sort of user friendly.

37
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:21,830
It would be the kinds of things
that we had been working with.

38
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:24,540
So I contacted a couple of ensembles,
uh,

39
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,670
and the Saybrook group a one
had the best program and to uh,

40
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,950
seem to be quite responsive
in getting back to me,

41
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:34,340
but some of the things that we might
do and indeed one of the pieces,

42
00:02:34,341 --> 00:02:35,660
the Brahms that we're going to talk about,

43
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,860
I suggested that they do because I
needed for teaching purposes in here,

44
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:44,300
I needed a good theme and variation piece.
Uh, and I've got one in the Beethoven,

45
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,140
but, uh, it's not quite as clear
cut as this particular one.

46
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,490
So as you can see,
we have three pieces on this concert.

47
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:55,610
I hope you all have the sheet
there. They should be listed, uh,

48
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:59,150
the overture to the marriage
of Figaro by Mozart.

49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,650
This is an overture and
opening to his opera.

50
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:07,300
The marriage of Figaro and good
news here is that this spring,

51
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,210
the Eo Opera Company and
undergraduate opera company,

52
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,990
we'll be performing the marriage of
Figaro and his apps is an absolutely

53
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:18,340
delightful opera. I mean, it's to die
for, not only is it lots of fun and funny,

54
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,850
but it happens to be in terms
of the craftsmanship involved,

55
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:23,590
arguably the greatest opera ever written.

56
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:27,100
So we're fortunate to have it here
and you'll get a preview of this, uh,

57
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:29,470
this Saturday with the
overture that we will here.

58
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,270
Then we will go onto a piece
by Johann is Brahms. Uh,

59
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,280
anybody know anything about Brahms?
Um,

60
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,300
they're interesting characters
in the history of music. Wagner,

61
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,660
he might've been an sob, but
nonetheless, he was interesting.

62
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:49,450
Mozart is endlessly fascinating. Bach is
interesting in its own way. Beethoven, uh,

63
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,300
uh, sort of the prototypical
romantic genius. Very interesting.

64
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,440
I can't say that Brahms is a person's
personal life was all that interesting.

65
00:03:57,441 --> 00:04:00,560
So maybe we'll just forget about it. We'll
just say that it was born in Homburg,

66
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,200
Germany and he died in Vienna and I,
I may have put his dates on,

67
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,660
on your sheet there.
Uh,

68
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,960
but he is of course one of the three B's,

69
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,460
uh, who are the other two in
the history of music. Of course.

70
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:17,930
Okay.

71
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,240
And Beethoven, I once ask
in a quiz in here, uh,

72
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:25,170
who are the three bs of music
and a student answered Bach,

73
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,990
Beethoven and Heiden. I was very
depressed for the rest of the day, but,

74
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,380
but Brahms indeed is the third be
here. Uh, so we don't want to forget,

75
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,760
get about him. He's a very
serious composer. He takes
everything very seriously.

76
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,610
I think I put on your sheet there.
Did I or did I not?

77
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,290
The kinds of things that he wrote.
Yes,

78
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:47,580
I did a four symphonies to piano
concertos, a violin concerto,

79
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,790
many overtures,
many songs,

80
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,950
much great chamber music. If you're a
violinist and you'll get rather advanced,

81
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:59,220
you can play the beautiful,
beautiful Brahms Violin Sonatas.

82
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,350
If you're a cellist and you
get reasonably advanced,

83
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:04,590
you can play the beautiful cello Sonata.

84
00:05:04,591 --> 00:05:07,140
So he wrote a lot of really
great chamber music. Oddly,

85
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:11,220
he wrote no program music and we'll talk
about that a little bit later on what

86
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:16,280
programs is and he wrote no opera.
Well, so we'll a little bit different.

87
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,670
It very much sort of heavy duty,
instrumental, instrumental music. Well,

88
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:25,290
let's talk about this. Uh, composition.
It will not open the piece.

89
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,510
It will be the second on the concert.

90
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:30,420
It won't open the concert
would be the second piece. Um,

91
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,200
a set of variations on a
theme by Josef Haydn. Well,

92
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,130
the theme probably isn't really by
Josef Haydn, but when bronze got it,

93
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,570
everybody thought it was by Josef Haydn
is probably just a religious folk song

94
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:45,980
in honor of Saint Anthony, but
that's neither here nor there. Uh,

95
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,870
the shape of this, a
song or theme that, uh,

96
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,540
a bronze is working with here is
one that we're very familiar with.

97
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,850
Now instead of putting a, B, c,

98
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,180
B, I could have done that up here. I'm
going to flesh this out a little bit.

99
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:06,560
What goal is going to call this antecedent
consequence extension consequent,

100
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,270
but it's the same. It's the same form
that we saw in the Beethoven's Ode to Joy.

101
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,030
So it's a familiar organization for a,
uh,

102
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,510
a musical theme, sort of, uh,
opening, closing, extension,

103
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:25,040
and then closing again.
And in this particular set of variations,

104
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:28,940
Brahms, we'll do this,
which of course is our what?

105
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:30,080
Sign again?

106
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,040
Yeah,

107
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,820
repeat science. So he's going to repeat
each of these two sections. Actually,

108
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:38,600
Beethoven did that to some
extent that he owed your joy too.

109
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,100
So he's got this very straightforward
theme with that particular form.

110
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,920
Let's listen to the theme and
we'll try to pick up where the, uh,

111
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,110
antecedent concludes and where
the consequent begins. Oh,

112
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,740
and before that we could, we could plug
in another information. What's the meter?

113
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:56,990
Ask yourself as you listen.
What's the meter of this?

114
00:06:56,991 --> 00:07:00,680
What's the mode major or minor?
What is the base doing?

115
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:03,680
What string technique is
the base employee in here?

116
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,260
Okay, that's the consequence. Now he's
going to repeat it. Let's go back.

117
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:34,620
We'll just move. We'll, I'm sorry. We'll
just continue on wherever you are. Linda.

118
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:38,910
Doesn't really matter. Are we continuing?
Okay, let's just continue on. Repeat.

119
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,650
Here's the antecedent.

120
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,540
Here's the consequence.

121
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,643
Yeah,

122
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,303
yeah.

123
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,160
Extension,
rising melodic sequence.

124
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,680
No, he's going to bring it back
down. Descending melodic sequence

125
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,160
and the consequences.

126
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,103
Yeah,

127
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,100
pause it there. Um, at this point,

128
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,550
what he does is take that bomb,

129
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,820
that tonic pitch and extended for a long
period of time. It's down in the base,

130
00:08:39,821 --> 00:08:41,070
it's being held it,

131
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,150
this is a device that derives from
Oregon technique where organist,

132
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,720
we just put his foot or her foot on a
particular key and just hold it for a long

133
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:51,280
time.
So we call it pedal point.

134
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,920
So what Brahms is doing here is sort of
extending this tonic harmony by means of

135
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:57,840
a pedal point.
So let's listen to this.

136
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,370
Ah,

137
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,300
and now we've got to repeat,
I believe.

138
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,390
So we're back to the extension

139
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,610
going up the sequence.
Now back down.

140
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,870
Here's the
panel.

141
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,560
Okay, so go ahead to the next
spot. So that's the theme. It's,

142
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,650
it's rather straight forward and
really quite and quite lovely. Uh,

143
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,880
the solo instrument there of course,
wasn't oboe solo oboe there.

144
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,100
So now we're going to go one.

145
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:14,530
We're not going to go to all
these variations on your sheet.

146
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,270
What about these timings here? Can you
come in with a stop clock and, and have,

147
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,740
have your or watcher?
It's set in a way that it,

148
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,760
two minutes and 19 seconds.
You expect the first variation to come in.

149
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,850
Is that going to work,
Oscar? Why won't that work?

150
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,150
A conductor might interpret
things his or her own way.

151
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:43,600
We're gonna have both a male and female
conductor a on Saturday night. Uh,

152
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,870
so yeah, exactly. Um,

153
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,900
because different conductors
have different ideas about tempo.

154
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:53,280
Brahms would right allegro essay
or something like that rather fast.

155
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:57,260
But how fast is rather fast?
So they're not precise indication.

156
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,310
So these times are approximate here,
but I'll give,

157
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:00,930
give you a sense of when
things might happen.

158
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,920
So we're going to go on now
to variation five, I believe,

159
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,420
which is at eight minutes and 36
seconds or an approximation there.

160
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:13,290
Up and here we're going to give you
maybe the most difficult of all the

161
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:17,850
variations for the orchestra to play.
It's very disjunct rhythmically.

162
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,490
They're not altogether.
It's very contrapuntal.

163
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,380
Counterpoint is always harder to play
in an orchestra than homophonic because

164
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:28,830
every we've got all these things
that have to be coordinated. Um,

165
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:30,780
so let's listen to this.
If things,

166
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,070
if things seem muddled and unclear
in a performance of this piece,

167
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,280
my guess is it's,
it may well happen here,

168
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:42,000
but let's listen just to do a little bit
to show you how difficult and how far

169
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,640
away from the theme Brahms can go.

170
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,980
So we'll stop it there. So it's hard for
me even to get in terms of the rhythm,

171
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:24,250
there'd be absolutely sure where the
beat is because there's so much think of

172
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:26,770
patient.
I think that's a very fast one.

173
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,210
Two with the triple subdivision
under underneath. Uh, but again,

174
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:34,540
the point there may be, Gee,
I didn't remember hearing God,

175
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,770
where'd that thing go as hard to here?
Well,

176
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:43,771
he was varying it so much that he's
pretty much totally disguise the theme at

177
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:45,520
that point.
Uh,

178
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,560
let's go on now to listen to
a little bit of variation.

179
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,720
Seven, uh, uh, at 1103 or thereabouts. Uh,

180
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:59,830
this is my favorite variation,
but let's listen to a bit of it.

181
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:00,910
And see if you like it too.

182
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,610
There's the a section

183
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,850
come see

184
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,343
back to

185
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,850
now, what am I doing up
here? What is this? Well,

186
00:13:49,851 --> 00:13:53,330
what I'm trying to do is indicate
what we call a compound meter.

187
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:55,850
It's one of these with,
you basically have a two,

188
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,680
but you have a triple subdivision and
conductors. If if that two is slow enough,

189
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:05,300
might go one, two, three,
four, five, six one, two,

190
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,120
three, four, five, six. So
it'd be interesting to see,

191
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:11,620
maybe we should ask the
conductor, uh, on Thursday how,

192
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:15,740
how he or she I f I forget who's
conducting exactly which pieces here,

193
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,380
how he or she is going to conduct,

194
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:20,990
I was going to do yard duty,

195
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:25,400
Dee Dee Dee a very slow to like that
or are we going to really show the

196
00:14:25,401 --> 00:14:28,030
subdivision?
If he's showing this subdivisions,

197
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,270
that's probably a suggestion that maybe
he doesn't or she doesn't have quite as

198
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:37,271
much confidence in the orchestra and wants
to really show that beat very clearly

199
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,640
rather than with a working with a very
experienced group where you're just kind

200
00:14:40,641 --> 00:14:44,120
of give the large patterns and there'll
be able to put it all together.

201
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,650
Now as we continue with this,

202
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:50,300
let's move up to a to
18 or 1218 please Linda.

203
00:14:50,301 --> 00:14:51,650
We are now at this spot.

204
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:55,760
We're going to have the extension and
it's kind of fun to watch what Brahms is

205
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:56,331
doing here.

206
00:14:56,331 --> 00:15:01,331
Brahms is obsessed with rhythm and it
drives you nuts when you're a performer of

207
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:05,810
this stuff. One, he's obsessed
with variation and two,
he's obsessed with rhythm.

208
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,080
He will change things even when
he doesn't need to change things.

209
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:09,950
And I remember a company,

210
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:14,951
my last child in the Brahms cellos Sonata
and I would have to continually change

211
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:18,410
hand positions for no good reason,

212
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:23,060
which is kind of arbitrary that he wanted
maybe just a slightly different sale,

213
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,070
whereas the sound before the Beethoven
would have been satisfied with in Mojo it

214
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:30,290
would have been satisfied with,
uh, wouldn't suffice for him.

215
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,960
So he's obsessed with variation.
He is obsessed with rhythm and it,

216
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:38,600
and as we listen to this passage, we will
see the basic one, two, three, four, five,

217
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:43,310
six, one, two, three, four, five, six
and then suddenly he will change it.

218
00:15:43,311 --> 00:15:48,110
One, two, three, four, five,
six, one, two, three, four,

219
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,810
five, six, one, two,
three, four, five, six, uh,

220
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,110
emphasizing this way that in
music has called Hemiola, uh,

221
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,070
is probably some kind of Greek root
they're having to do with twos and threes.

222
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:04,700
I'm not really sure.
Uh, but as you can see,

223
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:09,701
we've got what we had was in
effect two units of three.

224
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:15,140
Now we've got three units of too.
I remember Leonard Bernstein.

225
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:19,290
I don't know whether it's west side
story or not yet. The t, t, t, t, t, t.

226
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:24,140
T. T. T. T. T. T. T. T. What is that
from? Is it from west side story?

227
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:26,990
Okay. Uh, so that's a good
example of Hemiola too.

228
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:29,860
I think it's called America
or something like that. Uh,

229
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,770
so that's what Hemiola is when you're
rolling in one of these and you suddenly

230
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:36,410
shift to the other back
and back and forth.

231
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:39,050
So let's listen to a love this lovely six,

232
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,510
become three groups of two,

233
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,590
one
by one,

234
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,130
five, six. Let's do that again.

235
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:11,100
Let's do that again. It took me a
while to find the, the six beat there.

236
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,860
So go back and a little before.

237
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,420
So here's e

238
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,103
bye.

239
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,950
And then he goes back.

240
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:56,660
Okay, well that's just the, um, a
little rhythmic Philip there, uh,

241
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,110
with Brahms. But it's the kind of
thing that keeps interest in his music.

242
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,260
Now we're going to go on
to the last variation a,

243
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,650
and it's an interesting one because
it's got two things going on here.

244
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:10,940
He's got a theme and then he's got
what we call an Ostinato. And music.

245
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:15,140
Anybody remember? I think we bumped into
this term before what an Austin auto is.

246
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,560
What does an Ostinato do,
Roger?

247
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,380
Good. That's it. Exactly. Uh, from
the Italian Austin Ra obstinate.

248
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,260
And it just repeats the same phrase
over and over and over again.

249
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,560
So what he's got here repeating oddly,
is in the base.

250
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,020
There's this tonic

251
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,310
escapes from repeating over
and over and over, uh, uh,

252
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,320
above which we have a very
distant variation of the theme.

253
00:18:58,321 --> 00:18:59,970
Doesn't sound like the theme very much.

254
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,440
So let's listen to the Austin Natto
and this highly varied theme up above.

255
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,760
Can you hear the bass

256
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,350
notice salsa? Yuck. Dee Dee Dee tee tee.

257
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:49,330
What's he throwing in
against his basic beat? Yeah.

258
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,440
Tha Tha tha tha tha.
Tha. Tha. Tha. Tha. Tha

259
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,730
what? What's that? We've talked about it
before. We're beat. We're coming on here.

260
00:19:55,731 --> 00:20:00,731
Ball ball one to one
and two and one and two.

261
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,170
And Yachty. T. T. T. T. T.
T. T. T. T. T. What's that?

262
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,650
Triplets. Okay, so we
talked about that before.

263
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,270
So here he's making this more complicated
rhythmically by not only using Hemi

264
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,270
Olin syncopation, but also threes
against two simultaneously.

265
00:20:17,271 --> 00:20:20,030
He's throwing in some triplets
in the melody up above. Okay,

266
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:23,840
let's continue to just a bit more.
Oh, right, right there is fine. Yeah.

267
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:51,370
[inaudible]

268
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,621
so at this point you say,

269
00:20:56,621 --> 00:21:01,060
what the heck happened to
my seat dod on Bom Bom Bom?

270
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,040
I don't remember that at all.

271
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,730
If so we've sort of lost track of that
as this astronaut or base keeps growing

272
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,630
in weight underneath. But gradually, uh,

273
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:12,120
what he does is take that Ostinato and
move it up into the upper part of the

274
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:17,121
register of the orchestra and then
gradually tr make this transform back into

275
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:21,060
the theme, sort of magically
transform itself back into the theme.

276
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,600
So let's go on now to 1755
and then we'll pick it,

277
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,980
pick it up there if that's okay.

278
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:36,770
Sounds very confused. But if you listen
to the upper register, you can hear the

279
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:49,150
[inaudible] [inaudible]

280
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,950
the theme is coming back
and the upper woodwind.

281
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,430
Okay, so now you think the pieces, yeah,

282
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,770
over
slow into tempo.

283
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:44,830
Way Down sell diminishes.

284
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,730
Could end it right here.

285
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,230
And that last little bit at the end of
course is called the Coda. Right. Okay.

286
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,220
So he once again with theme
and variations, if you
don't give the audience,

287
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:13,830
Dakota,
they're expecting next variation to begin.

288
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,920
So you got throw in that Cota so
that uh, everybody knows, hey,

289
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:20,430
that really was the end. No
fooling, uh, questions about that.

290
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,750
So that's Brahms' variations on the
theme of Haydn. It's, I can't say it's a,

291
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,130
it's a very, it's a beautiful piece,
but it's a very serious piece,

292
00:23:29,131 --> 00:23:31,740
but it's a good piece for you.
This is very serious group this year.

293
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:34,980
I'm impressed with the seriousness with
which you show up here and as you take

294
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,360
this, uh, I gather,

295
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,660
I sometimes I see that you're actually
much more interested in the classical

296
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,500
stuff that we're doing then in the pop
stuff, which is not always the case, uh,

297
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:48,140
over the years working with
undergraduates. Okay. A question. Yes.

298
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:52,750
Uh, Daniel, yes.

299
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:56,920
W however disguise it is,
how the question is,

300
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:01,810
is the framework of the theme
always this ace c business,

301
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,000
no matter how far he goes,

302
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:08,400
melodically from the original pattern
and how complex in terms of counterpoint

303
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,560
and rhythmic permutations he becomes,

304
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:16,680
it still is dropped within this same
framework of the a c e c although it

305
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:20,920
admittedly it's pretty difficult
to hear sometimes. Yeah. David,

306
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,600
Michael, sorry. Uh, that, that I,

307
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:30,220
that is just with this piece here.
Uh, you can work with other composers.

308
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:34,480
Paganini is variations on a
theme of Rockmont and offer
example where the length

309
00:24:34,481 --> 00:24:37,360
of the variations will become
very different and it'd be,

310
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:42,880
that won't be sort as bad as I like to
say box car, like as this arrangement.

311
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,170
This is still boxcar.

312
00:24:44,171 --> 00:24:49,171
Like even though it's very diversified
in terms of what's put in and on those

313
00:24:49,811 --> 00:24:53,920
box cars. Two good
questions there. Thanks.

314
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,340
All right, uh, having finished
theme and variations for the moment,

315
00:24:57,341 --> 00:24:59,710
let's go on to talk about Rondo.

316
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,240
R o n d o a Rondo. Is
that really true? Well,

317
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:08,200
it goes by a couple of different
names. Uh, uh, English,

318
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:13,000
call it Rondo form, the Germans
call it Rondo form and Mozart wrote,

319
00:25:13,001 --> 00:25:15,640
and I've looked at a lot of his
autographs wanting to write Rondo.

320
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:18,210
He spelled it r, O, n, d o c news.

321
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,030
Ela All falls on the,
uh,

322
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,170
Hondo say honed. Oh, miss
here. But if you go to Italy,

323
00:25:26,171 --> 00:25:30,460
they would call it a doornail law.
Lochia Jamari toenail.

324
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:35,470
I love these, these, these, uh, latinate
languages are so wonderful, aren't they?

325
00:25:35,471 --> 00:25:40,180
The way they play with the vowels.
Tonello so it's the same idea,

326
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,260
a Rondo, a home though and elite
Tonello. It's the same principle.

327
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:48,160
And oddly the principal develops right
out of the thing that we were talking

328
00:25:48,161 --> 00:25:49,450
about.
Uh,

329
00:25:49,451 --> 00:25:54,451
and that Frederick introduced this to
the idea of verse and chorus because

330
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:58,690
what's involved here is
really one musical concept,

331
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:02,920
one big theme coming back
again and again and again. Uh,

332
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:07,060
and this goes all the way back to the
Middle Ages where they would have soloist

333
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,210
singing new versus,
and then everybody would sing the chorus.

334
00:26:10,211 --> 00:26:13,900
And the thing that we all remember is
the chorus. That's the big ticket item.

335
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:15,340
That's the thing that everybody is doing.

336
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,790
So that's the thing that keeps coming
back again and again and again.

337
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,780
So this in an odd way I think is the
easiest of these forms to remember.

338
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:27,300
If you hear some music where you get
music and then something else and then hit

339
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,080
in the face with that same music again,

340
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,680
then something else and you get hit in
the face of that same music again and

341
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:34,600
then something else.
And then the same music again.

342
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,420
That's probably Rondo form and you can,

343
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,190
you can give it these different names
in different languages, but the,

344
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:42,520
the idea is the same.
And as I suggest,

345
00:26:42,521 --> 00:26:47,070
it's primordial I think on your sheet
to show you how primordial it is.

346
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:50,760
I even gave you the text of a Rondo by
Gilead and [inaudible] it goes all the

347
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:54,570
way back into the 15th century. We
don't have to go back that far. Uh,

348
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:58,160
and you can see, we'll end up today
with a Rondo by Stinger. So, uh,

349
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:03,030
this has been around for a long time.
This particular particular form. Um,

350
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:08,180
let's have an introduction to it by
listening to a reasonably well known piece

351
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:09,840
by Joel Joseph,

352
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,250
who was a composer in residence
at the court of King Louis,

353
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:19,251
the 15th at Versailles and in Paris in
the early years of the 18th century.

354
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,880
You probably know this music because
for years it was the background theme or

355
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:28,170
the introductory material for
masterpiece theater on public television.

356
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,730
So let's listen to a big,
uh, a bit of this. And, uh,

357
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,760
let me take this material off and we'll
chart here and I'll ask you what the

358
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:39,240
meter of this is,

359
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,950
but the meter and how many
measures of our refrain,

360
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,830
our main theme,
what we'll call it a here,

361
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,920
how many measures we have in our theme.

362
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,950
Let's stop it there. So what'd you think
about that? What's the meter? Well,

363
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,470
I would try to give that away.
Sometimes you listen to music,

364
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:28,330
you can't stop yourself.
It's like the end of doctor Strangelove.

365
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,700
You ever see that movie
get back? Um, so, uh,

366
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,550
yeah, it's a piece in
Dupal meter. How many,

367
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:39,450
how many measures did we
have in our theme? How many
measures did we count there?

368
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,470
Well, listen to, let's listen to it again.

369
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,750
Right back to the beginning,
I guess Linda.

370
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:00,360
Okay.

371
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,700
So what do you think? Eight. Alright,

372
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:07,620
let's put eight up here and let's
listen again now. Just continue please.

373
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,820
Oh, we stopped it there. We had
how many there? Eight again.

374
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,450
So everything is always four's and
eight's and music. No, not exactly.

375
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:29,700
If you start with counting
measures there in the Brahms,

376
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:33,870
his theme sometimes has five
measures in those sections,

377
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:38,430
but this one happens to be a different
and more common. Uh, eight plus eight.

378
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,290
And actually in reality here,

379
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:43,510
this is just slightly different than
the first day of the ending of it is

380
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:45,940
slightly different from the first day.
So there we are.

381
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:49,750
We've got our refrain or a theme in place.
Our big a idea.

382
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,320
Now let's go on to the next material.

383
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:13,000
Stop it there. How many bars did we
have there? Well, eight again. Okay,

384
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,200
so we could call the Di, di, di, di,
di, di, di, di, di, di, di, Di team.

385
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,460
Different sort of rhythm there.

386
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:22,450
We could call this a bi idea or we
could even call it an x does something

387
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:26,800
different, something different. And
that lasted for eight bars that get up.

388
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:28,930
Just a couple of Linda
if you would please.

389
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:32,260
So we can get back into that be
and then we'll go on to the next a.

390
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,320
So here we are with our B.

391
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:10,220
Stop it there. So what happened to
our a this time? How long was it?

392
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,730
Who still eat?
Did we get it again though?

393
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:14,940
Okay.

394
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,560
Yeah, we've got just one. That statement
of it. Why didn't we get it again?

395
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,500
Well maybe he didn't need
to give it to us again.

396
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,340
Ever watched television commercial when
they first come on and then what happens

397
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,140
to these commercials a
couple of months later?

398
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,220
What do they do if gain?

399
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,990
Yeah, they shortened them. They'll
run a 60 minute version of it.

400
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:37,540
Then is then a third show, 60 minutes,
that'd be interminable. A 62nd version.

401
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:41,080
Then the 32nd version, you
psychologically, sublingually, you'll,

402
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,720
you're filling in the missing information.

403
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,150
So keep an eye on for that kind of thing
and go, posers do that too. They know.

404
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,400
Well we've heard there's a fair amount of,
well we'll,

405
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:53,740
we'll give the psychological
a force of the whole thing,

406
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,330
but really just give it to
them in half. Okay. So, uh,

407
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,880
wherever we are there, it uh, but,

408
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:02,470
but yeah,

409
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:06,280
so back in around 45 or
so if you can get there.

410
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,150
Okay.
Here we got a count now.

411
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,110
So let's pause there. How long was
that section? 20. Yeah, 20 bars.

412
00:32:52,111 --> 00:32:56,250
There's a long run of other material
and then as you can hear here,

413
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,730
our ACM is coming back.
Let's see if we get it repeated.

414
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:34,280
Was there a Cota there? No. Um, uh,

415
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,470
how did he,

416
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,860
how did this particular
group of performers make the
piece sounds as if it were

417
00:33:38,861 --> 00:33:39,694
ending

418
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,410
dead. Daniel. Oh, Angela is it? Yeah,

419
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:51,000
he retarded. Dee Dee Dee Dee t
Todd. Tom Slowed it way down.

420
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:51,600
So if you don't want,

421
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,140
that's another way of getting a sense
of in here rather than throwing one,

422
00:33:55,141 --> 00:33:59,820
some extra bricks to say the thing
has concluded harmonically. All right,

423
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:03,510
so that's one. Rondo, let's go
into a more sophisticated Rondo.

424
00:34:03,511 --> 00:34:06,960
We're going to go onto
one by Vivaldi here. Now,

425
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:11,250
this is in the Greek Tonello form, as
you'll see when you read the textbook. Um,

426
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,870
but the principle is the same.

427
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,770
We have a theme that keeps coming
back again and again and again.

428
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,570
And you all know this theme.

429
00:34:18,571 --> 00:34:23,400
You've probably heard it at Starbucks
or Oban Pan Eight zillion times, right?

430
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,630
Anybody sing it?

431
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:28,830
Anybody remember what the Vivaldi
spring concerto sounds like?

432
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:34,650
Okay, Angela is on the roll this morning.
So nice and loud. Don't be shy there.

433
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:38,993
Yeah.

434
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,330
Good. Okay. Dot, dot, dot,
dot, dot, dot. Tom Potter up.

435
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,790
Pop Art.

436
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,510
Then we have a second idea.

437
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,201
So here,

438
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:58,610
it's kind of our main theme here is
really kind of two ideas a and B.

439
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:03,110
But we're going to just for the sake of
argument here, just call this big a here.

440
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,790
Okay? So that, that, that's the theme.
So let's listen to a bit of this. Um,

441
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:08,631
well,
no,

442
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:12,690
we don't even have to listen
to this because Angela has
given us the return. Lol.

443
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,130
So let's go on to the first x here.

444
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:21,131
We've got something else coming in and
it's Vivaldi's attempt to write birds

445
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:26,120
chirping away on a beautiful
spring morning. So let's
listen to the birds here.

446
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,020
After the birds Chirp, we get our a
coming back. So let's listen to our a,

447
00:35:38,021 --> 00:35:39,150
come back here.

448
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,223
Okay.

449
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:51,340
So now we're taking a walk through a
beautiful forest in the spring day and we

450
00:35:51,341 --> 00:35:56,341
see a babbling brook and the
brook is foaming surging away.

451
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,000
So that's what we've got here.

452
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,410
Was that, that we just
heard bom, bom, Bom, bom.

453
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,950
Was that something else or was
that our rich horn elbow? Jerry.

454
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:29,560
Nice and loud. Okay. Uh, that was my
next question. You've jumped to it.

455
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:32,980
So it was the return Anello
and my next question is,

456
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:37,540
but what was different about
that Writ Ornella? Well,

457
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,710
the first time we had
it from bom, Bom, Bom,

458
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:46,570
Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, it's a lower key.

459
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:50,410
So we've had a modulation.
This is actually down on the dominant.

460
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,680
We don't need to know that. We don't need
to know whether it's tonic or dominant,

461
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,860
but I think it would be good. We, we
heard that as just a little bit different.

462
00:36:56,861 --> 00:37:01,030
Its lower, maybe a little darker
than the brighter sound up above.

463
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,580
So we had that and now
let's see what happens.

464
00:37:03,581 --> 00:37:06,100
It doesn't have a storm come up and
sort of threatened this here in the

465
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:06,970
beautiful forest.

466
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,003
Okay.

467
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,800
Lots of Tremolo.
Lots of agitation.

468
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:33,630
Yeah.

469
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,463
What happen?

470
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:46,640
All right, we'll stop there. Yeah. Yes.
That was our red tornado coming back.

471
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,510
Our theme coming back. But
how is it different? Okay.

472
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:54,760
Yeah it was in mine are young
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

473
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,200
So it had changed key again,
we don't need to know what key it went to.

474
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:03,500
If you were a betting man in Las
Vegas or betting woman in Las Vegas,

475
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:04,700
what would you say?
It went to?

476
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:09,310
The relative minor because
about half of the time, uh,

477
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,050
that's what they do.
And indeed in this,

478
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,080
this particular case it went just three
half steps down to the relative minor.

479
00:38:15,081 --> 00:38:18,970
But hearing that it went to the minor is
all we're after here. So this was in a,

480
00:38:18,971 --> 00:38:21,890
in a minor key here. And then
on it goes, we need in play,

481
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,210
play this out to the end.

482
00:38:23,211 --> 00:38:28,211
It gives you a sense of how rare Tornillo
form can inform this particular Rondo.

483
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:33,530
Let's turn to another one
by Mozart here. Uh, yeah,

484
00:38:33,531 --> 00:38:35,800
I think we've got time for that.
Um,

485
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,500
take this off.

486
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:45,050
So it's a horn concerto by
Mozart written in the 1870s. Uh,

487
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,860
and we're just going to start it out
here and we're going to hear the first

488
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:53,720
theme. But Papa, Papa, Papa,
Papa, Papa, Papa is the basis
of listening. Exercise 26,

489
00:38:53,721 --> 00:38:56,420
which we'll get to uh,
in a week or so.

490
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:57,883
Yeah.

491
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,520
[inaudible]

492
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:16,100
okay, let's stop there. Why is
this an easy theme to remember?

493
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,300
Because it's full of

494
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,080
[inaudible].

495
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,320
It's a lot of notes,
right on the same pitch.

496
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,440
Bob Bomb and it's actually
starts to dominate.

497
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,160
[inaudible]

498
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,470
sort of goes along like that.

499
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:35,640
So we can keep a mental graph of
this with our exes now in a second.

500
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:38,280
And then the orchestra
repeated it then in a second.

501
00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:41,820
The B theme is going to come in and
it's going to be very different. Yeah.

502
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:47,390
Pompom y'all pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,

503
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:48,880
Palm.
What's that?

504
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,770
Arpeggio? Okay, so instead
of using repeated pitches,

505
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,920
we mark the B section of this by
the use of lots of leaps here.

506
00:39:58,951 --> 00:40:02,310
So we're going to have lots of space
between our exit, a bomb bomb bomb.

507
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,490
And then it's going to have a
couple of different motives in here.

508
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,560
But they're all very skippy. They're
all very disjunct. And it's these,

509
00:40:09,561 --> 00:40:14,010
this junk leaps that mark the B section.
So let's just continue.

510
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,693
Okay,

511
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,123
jumps.

512
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:56,060
Now listen to the base here.
Who'd at another pedal point,

513
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,130
I'm sitting on the dominant.

514
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:08,630
What's this?
This is our theme a coming back.

515
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,783
Perfect.

516
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,910
Okay,
we're going to stop it here.

517
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:22,210
So here we are at this
particular particular juncture.

518
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:26,770
Notice each time the French horn plays
the theme than the orchestra repeats it.

519
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,890
Now as we go into this section,
we'll get a new theme.

520
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:34,850
It's c a and it will be marked
an interesting development.

521
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,293
Okay?

522
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,040
What's happened to the mode?

523
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,830
So what happened?
Did the piece there

524
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:00,220
change to minor change to mitre?
So we're, we're moving fast here,

525
00:42:00,221 --> 00:42:03,140
we're doing all this and just one hearing.
So there we are.

526
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:06,850
Our C section is marked by minor,
so let's continue

527
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,630
rising sequence here.
Melodic seat

528
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,173
now falling

529
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,500
well,
I'll step lower

530
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,570
and lower yet again

531
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:32,970
and then a sneaks in

532
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:49,940
and here come our jumps.
So we're back to be

533
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,333
okay.

534
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:19,763
Okay.

535
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,860
Ooh,
let me just step out of cadence.

536
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:32,750
Pause it right there. Seeing the
next pitch, well not only bomb,

537
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:36,020
but that somebody starts saying by Tata,
Tata, you know what's happening next?

538
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:40,570
You said you have this big long dominant
pause [inaudible] and off it goes.

539
00:43:40,571 --> 00:43:41,600
You'll play that Linda please.

540
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,513
Perfect.

541
00:43:59,020 --> 00:43:59,520
Yeah.

542
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,060
Now this week we've had our a
in the orchestral repeat of it,

543
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,910
but we haven't heard this kind of stuff
before. What would you imagine is going,

544
00:44:05,911 --> 00:44:10,260
what is this? We're listening to new
CODA. I'm moving things along here.

545
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:14,820
So we have a Coda and noticed it.
Dawn, I forget the particular key.

546
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,120
Mozart is working through the Duke
of Earl harmony at once again in this

547
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:26,990
particular particular section.
So let's listen to a bit of that.

548
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,650
And this is just filler arpeggio addict.

549
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:49,850
So that's our Coda again,
to show us that the pieces an end,

550
00:44:49,851 --> 00:44:51,620
you can end your Rondo
and a couple of ways.

551
00:44:51,621 --> 00:44:56,270
But the point here is notice the
form that has been created by Mozart.

552
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:00,740
And again, it is timeless. I think
we have time now to show a slide.

553
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:04,640
Uh,
and Jason isn't here today.

554
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:06,930
I wanted him to do this.
Uh,

555
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:11,980
I think I can turn this on myself though
and we're going to listen to Linda

556
00:45:12,441 --> 00:45:15,440
start playing. Yeah, Dustin please.

557
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,410
So let's stop that just

558
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:38,800
for a moment. Uh, what do I
have up here on the board?

559
00:45:38,801 --> 00:45:43,300
Anybody ever seen this before? Anybody
been there? Where would you imagine it is

560
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:48,230
in French at the Chateau de Shawn Bull,
c.

561
00:45:48,231 --> 00:45:50,300
H. A. M. B. O. R. D. A.

562
00:45:50,301 --> 00:45:55,301
I took this leaning out of a bus and you
can see over the left we have one idea,

563
00:45:56,550 --> 00:46:00,620
the a idea contrasting idea
returned to the, a idea,

564
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:05,570
a largely contrasting idea here in the
middle, returned to your central concept,

565
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,620
uh, uh, a contrast here that
matches this contrast over there.

566
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:12,320
And then the central idea at the end.

567
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:17,270
It's exactly in one of these
palindromic a, B, a, c,

568
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:21,050
a, B, a form, the same thing that you
get here in the Mozart Horn Concerto.

569
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:25,540
And the same thing that staying in
the police ship program in to their

570
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:28,760
particular Rondo. Uh, you've
got the sheets on this.

571
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:32,540
Maybe I'll turn the lights back on
cause we don't need to see that anymore.

572
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:40,520
Did you like that? You want that back
on? Yes. Okay. Yeah, it's pretty,

573
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:44,300
I like it too. Okay. Um, and we
can, we can see well enough up here.

574
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:48,740
So let's listen to, I'll just tell
you, we've got this initial idea,

575
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,773
uh,

576
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,310
where is,
what key is e and h?

577
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:56,243
MMM.

578
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,100
Again, in the one six, four,
five, one Duke of Earl stuff.

579
00:47:03,101 --> 00:47:04,180
But interestingly enough here,

580
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,890
half the time he doesn't come back

581
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,350
a deceptive cadence.

582
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,320
So he alternates here between authentic
cadences and deceptive cadence.

583
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:29,190
So we'll listen to a little bit of it.
If we run out of time, then we'll stop.

584
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:30,383
Okay.

585
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,960
Six, three, four step.

586
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,380
There's the six,

587
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:52,780
six,
four,

588
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:58,390
five.
Can we got to stop it here

589
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,430
or the copyright? People
will be all over us. Uh,

590
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,480
then it goes onto the beach
section. Oh, can't you see?

591
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,140
And for that we have the different chord

592
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:15,940
belong to me, my, her
mother heartbreak. Okay.

593
00:48:15,941 --> 00:48:17,260
We can continue to play now.

594
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,560
All right,
let's move it up to the next

595
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,720
stay.
I want to get to see,

596
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:35,590
hey, what? Go straight to see. This is
pretty cool. What he does here. He's in,

597
00:48:35,591 --> 00:48:37,420
in this particular key,

598
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,220
and he gives us this sound,

599
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:47,140
kind of a shocking chord change
right in the middle of the piece.

600
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:50,260
It's kind of a foot,
we would call a flat seventh degree.

601
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:53,530
Let's see if we can hear this
total shock and then we'll stop.

602
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:16,993
Yup.

603
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:24,100
Premier on out. You give blood
in the one, six, four, five,

604
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:29,180
one mentally in this section B section.

605
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:35,710
So that's it. I think we're
at a time and I thank you for

606
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:38,190
one third.
