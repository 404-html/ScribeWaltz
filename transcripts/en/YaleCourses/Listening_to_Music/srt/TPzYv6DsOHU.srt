1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,860
All right.
Let us begin please.

2
00:00:02,861 --> 00:00:07,120
We're going to get started to
stay on track for this morning.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,110
Don't forget, of course, that we have
this exciting event next Tuesday,

4
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:16,090
which is our second test. Uh,
there will be, yeah, I know.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,910
Yeah. Curb your enthusiasm. Uh,

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,090
there will be a review section for that.
Indeed,

7
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:24,700
three of them next Monday
night as we did last time,

8
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:29,020
there'll be in room two oh seven
of WL h again this Monday seven,

9
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:34,021
eight and nine respectively
and yours truly will be there.

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,110
Uh, we'll also have Monday afternoon
if you want the individual help,

11
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:41,380
you can come to my office and one of
the TA's will be covering a run of about

12
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:45,340
four or five hours there Monday afternoon,
probably starting around one o'clock.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,440
And of course I'll be sending you a prep
sheet on this so that you will know how

14
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:54,310
to prepare for this test just as
we prepared for the last test.

15
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,080
If the test itself will be very
similar to the first test, except we,

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,410
when we get to the the listening pieces,

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,150
then we will not be so much concentrating
on individual isolated aspects of

18
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:11,590
melody, rhythm and harmony.
But these broader questions
of form, what is the form?

19
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,450
Where are we in the form? That's, that's
the essence of the assignment there.

20
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,310
Uh, we're working here with
form and it's very important.

21
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,840
It brings,
I think,

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,650
my guess is in all of the listening that
you've been doing pop music, classical,

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,910
whatever it is, how many, when you
were listening ever thought about form?

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,250
Do you ever think about even if you, okay,
one person I see ray raise their hand,

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,990
Robert or two maybe and maybe, and maybe
Roger raises his hand, but not too,

26
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,720
too enthusiastically. Uh, yeah.

27
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:46,690
It's a kind of thing that you could do
a lot of playing, listening to music.

28
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,060
You could, you could take, uh,

29
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,870
as my 17 year old may be 17 year old,
maybe 12,

30
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:55,930
13 years of cello.
And I could ask him what form do we have,

31
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:57,040
where are we in the form?

32
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,370
And he wouldn't really know because he
hasn't been exposed to that sort of thing.

33
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,960
Well, it does help us. It's a
whole dimension of listening
that we can plug into,

34
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:10,030
whether it's pop music and you're dealing
with verse and chorus and bridge or

35
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:14,710
even as we'll see today Ostinato and
in pop music we're in classical music.

36
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,530
You plug in the for now,

37
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,550
what are the six forms that we
are going to be plugging in here?

38
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,433
Hm.

39
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,870
Somebody run this through our checklist,
Roger and get us started please.

40
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,230
Oh yeah, you can say one and then,
then you pass the baton. Okay,

41
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:36,820
so not a leg or the most difficult.

42
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:40,930
The biggest one we spent the most
time with that. What else, Chris?

43
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,310
Phew. We spent a lot of time with that.
Fairly difficult. Daniel Rondo. Uh,

44
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,540
a little bit easier in a sense
that you've got this one theme,

45
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,940
that kind of bludgeon Jude.
If you get a theme,

46
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:54,910
then you get something else and that
theme comes back and then probably

47
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:55,840
something else yet again.

48
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,190
Then the theme comes back
and then something goes again
again and then and so on.

49
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:02,980
So you get the object and
then a lot of contrast,

50
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:07,900
but the object keeps coming back.
What else have we mentioned?

51
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,450
Uh, Chelsea. I'm sorry.
Turn. Reform. Yeah,

52
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:17,890
that may be, that may be the easier it's
going to have to just the a B a idea.

53
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:23,160
Uh, and we're missing one I
think. Yeah. Theme and variations.

54
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,090
Your name please. I'm sorry,
Kristen. Okay. Thanks very much,

55
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:32,920
Kristen. Um, so, uh, theme and
variations is, is the last one.

56
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,280
When you go to a concert, sometimes
you can pick up the program. Uh,

57
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:41,281
and here is a cover for a program that's
going to serve as the makeup for our,

58
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,220
uh,
the makeup concert for our class.

59
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,310
It's next Saturday,

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,770
a week from Saturday.

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,640
Jonathan Edwards Orchestra is going to
be performing at Battelle and there'll be

62
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:58,900
doing the Beethoven Eight symphony,
the Beethoven Eighth Symphony.

63
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,920
And when you go there,
uh,

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,550
you're going to have four movements
and that Beethoven Eight symphony,

65
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:08,140
what's a good guess as to what form the
first movement is going to be in to,

66
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:11,540
not all I got. Okay, so not
allegro second movement. Wow.

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,330
It could be in a number
of different forms.

68
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,840
What's a good guest for what the full
form of the third movement will be?

69
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,590
Ternary form. It's going to be some
kind of menu at or perhaps scared.

70
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:25,600
So I think in this case scare Cho,
trio scared.

71
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:29,890
So that idea ternary form usually is the
third movement of these four movements,

72
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:31,660
symphony.
And then the last movement,

73
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,230
well we'll have to sort of come to terms
with that figure that one out on the

74
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:39,310
fly and that's what we'll be
doing on our, our uh, um, uh,

75
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,740
a test on Tuesday. Although it will
be a slow sort of lento fly there,

76
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:47,920
we'll be going through,
it's much more slowly than just one pass.

77
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,420
So sometimes when listening you've got
to hear the music and make some kind of

78
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:57,400
educated a determination as to what the
form is. And then you kind of, as I say,

79
00:04:57,401 --> 00:05:02,260
drop this template of that particular
form down in your mind and then filtered

80
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,990
the music thereafter through that model.

81
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,020
Be it the model of Sonata Allegro or
the model of few or the model of Rondo.

82
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,470
You kind of hear the piece
in that form, uh, thereafter.

83
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:20,650
Questions about that?
All right. If not, let's,

84
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,420
let's proceed with one,
the final, uh, form today,

85
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:29,020
which is Ostinato. That's our sixth
form. We haven't been introduced to that.

86
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:31,540
We're going to do Austin Natto.
But before we get to that,

87
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,310
I want to recap one thing having to
do with a theme and variation for,

88
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:39,580
because it allows us to bring in some
of the other things that we had been

89
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:43,120
talking about. So it's a good
culminating listening experience.

90
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,680
And that is the finale of
Beethoven's Eroica symphony.

91
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,220
Anybody know why,
why it's called the Eroica symphony?

92
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,220
Who's the hero that's referenced
there? Caroline Napoleon, right?

93
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,590
So Beethoven was working on the symphony.
Napoleon was a hero.

94
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,150
Then he gets word from Paris.
Napoleon has had himself crown emperor,

95
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,600
he thinks, oh my God. Napoleon is just
a tyrant, like all the rest of them.

96
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,560
So he's furious and he scratches
out on his score. And I,

97
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,770
when you get to the Beethoven
chapter of Your Textbook, look there,

98
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:18,860
there's a photograph of the
cover of the Eroica symphony,

99
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,740
and you can see the big hole where
Beethoven with his knife, uh,

100
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,800
scratched out Napoleon's name.

101
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,820
And then later on he goes on to simply
identify that and symphony for a hero

102
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,940
symphony for a hero,
the Eroica symphony.

103
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,120
So that's what we mean
by that particular term.

104
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,430
The hero originally was to be Napoleon.

105
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,640
So when we finished this x exercise,
when you finish this course,

106
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,060
you will have actually been exposed to
a number of Beethoven symphonies were

107
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:47,550
talking about number three here.
We opened with number five, uh,

108
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,570
on the concert a week from Saturday.
You have Beethoven Eight,

109
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,100
and those of you that went
to the preceding country or
not barred from attending

110
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,280
the one on the 1st of November,
you too can get in the door there.

111
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,520
So you might want to go to that,
uh,

112
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,600
seven 30 in Battell chapel November
1st and the concert the other night,

113
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,260
we had Beethoven six.

114
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:10,280
So you will have been exposed to for
Beethoven symphonies here in this course.

115
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:13,040
And that that's pretty good for
beginning course. Great. All right,

116
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:17,660
so let's talk about the finale here and
it's based on, and it's kind of fun.

117
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,540
It's actually more complex than
we would ever do on a test,

118
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:25,160
but it's fun to work through it. It's
based on two themes based on two themes.

119
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:29,270
So this is a set of variations using
two themes. Beethoven liked to do this.

120
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:32,640
He did this actually,
he did this in the slow movement of,

121
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,593
yeah.

122
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,050
What's that? What's symphony is
that? Anybody remember? Yeah,

123
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:43,860
I was the Beethoven six that we had at
the concert the other night with the

124
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:44,910
woodwinds and all that.

125
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,703
Aw.

126
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:48,743
And so on.

127
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,293
Okay.

128
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:57,590
That was the second thing. It
was kind of the, the second, uh,

129
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,390
the be idea if you will, of
the, of the, um, uh, two teams.

130
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:05,600
So they're in the slow movement
of Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.

131
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,890
We had a double variation in what we
mean by double variation is simply that

132
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:14,870
there are two themes in play. So
here we have the two themes. One,

133
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,510
the way he's constructed
here is in the trouble.

134
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,670
Yattaw hot, hot, hot, uh, um, pop,

135
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,690
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop upon Pla.

136
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,250
That's the number one.
Here's steam number two,

137
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,690
bom, Bom, Bom, Bom,

138
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:36,630
Palm,
Palm,

139
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,520
pop, pop, pop.

140
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,913
Yeah,

141
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,073
bum.

142
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,530
So those are the two teams.
So let's listen to some of this.

143
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,710
It's going to start out with just
a little bit of a curtain raiser.

144
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,090
So I have a curtain raiser,
then one of the themes will come in.

145
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,890
Which one does Beethoven start with?

146
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,430
Up goes the curtain.

147
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,473
Repeat.

148
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,580
Continue.

149
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,220
Yeah.
Yep.

150
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,140
Okay.
Then stop it there.

151
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,210
So which team did he choose to work with
here at the outset? Anybody Know Daniel?

152
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,730
Yeah, the base. The pink. And how was
it being played? Was it was my pitch.

153
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,260
Cuddle Bom, Bom, Bom, bom.
So was the BC. All right.

154
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,960
So that's in instance, we'll
save, call that variation one.

155
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:05,790
Let's go on with variation two here.

156
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,620
Which team does he choose
to use at this point?

157
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,953
Repeat

158
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,670
and repeat.

159
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,780
Okay. So which team is he
using? Their one or two? Yeah.

160
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:52,250
If Kenny says two and it was
still the base theme, um,

161
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,290
and it was a little bit harder to hear
this time because it was being covered up

162
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,290
above by some counterpoints.
So we've got the theme,

163
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,700
we've got counterpoint against it.
Let's go on to variation number three.

164
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:03,720
We'll see what happens.

165
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,880
Which one here

166
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,843
going on

167
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,073
and repeat.

168
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,543
Okay,

169
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,110
so which name is type one or to sell to,

170
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,590
but he's moved it up
into the first violin,

171
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,620
moved it up higher and he's got more
sort of fast running counterpoint

172
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,960
counterpoint against it.
Let's go on to the next.

173
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,970
We got to get number one at some point,

174
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,793
right?

175
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,610
[inaudible]

176
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,700
let's stop it there. Let's go back to
that particular variation if you will.

177
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:32,730
Please. I think it's at one 54. Uh,

178
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,600
what was the solo instrument there
and how did he orchestrate this? Well,

179
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:40,230
the first statement of this first theme,
he assigned it to a solo instrument.

180
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,560
Then in the repeat, he had
the strings, take it over.

181
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,480
Then that solo instrument came back and
then on the repeat the strings took it

182
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:51,840
over again. So it's an interesting
use of orchestration here.

183
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:56,100
Let's listen to this variation again and
what is the solo instrument up on top?

184
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:10,010
[inaudible].

185
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,900
Okay, let's pause it there
just for a second. So what's
the Solo Instrument? Oh, Bo,

186
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,010
yes, there's an opo penetrating upon
hiring question out there, Roger.

187
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,020
Um, yeah, I wouldn't want to
to take that too far though.

188
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:43,760
This is sort of an isolated event here
where you do have a call and response and

189
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:46,130
it does happen just in this one variation,

190
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,860
but it's going to be limited
to this one variation.

191
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,070
Whereas Ian Bessie Smith Blues tune,

192
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,360
you would have that call and response
idea carried on throughout the entire

193
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:58,160
composition.
It's a good point though.

194
00:13:58,161 --> 00:14:00,970
I hadn't thought I hadn't thought of
it in those terms, but that's exactly,

195
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:05,971
you got a call by the elbow
and then repeat of that
idea maybe elaborated by the

196
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,480
strings.
So here we are up here,

197
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:13,481
the Solo Obo and then we are going to
have the response now by the string.

198
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:15,380
So let's listen to that.

199
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,840
[inaudible] we're gonna

200
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,180
pause it here just for a second.

201
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,930
There was something interesting happens
when we were dealing with Sonata Allegro

202
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:37,320
form. We said that there were
four functional types and this,

203
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:40,530
it really isn't just limited
to a sonata allegro form.

204
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:44,010
There are functional types in all
kinds of music. When you go to a movie,

205
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:45,960
a cinema of film for example,

206
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,670
oftentimes at the end of the scene they
will have a fadeout and listened to the

207
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:54,590
fadeout. There's kind of transition
music in film music a lot of times.

208
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,370
Then maybe we get a new
faith, a new scene, and it's
very prominently displayed.

209
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:02,360
Well maybe we get Sigmadek and music
at that particular point. So the,

210
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,610
this idea of theme and transition,

211
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,720
even development can occur in all
different kinds of music and all different

212
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:12,860
kinds of context. But just to review
that idea, we have thematic music,

213
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:17,690
we have transitional music,
we have developmental music.

214
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,530
Uh, and again, it doesn't have to
be limited to Sonata Allegro form.

215
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,600
We saw developmental music in a
section of a f of the few called what?

216
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,170
Anybody remember what we
called that section of the,

217
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,130
of the few that was so developmental
Thaddeus, the episodes. So there we,

218
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:39,131
in the episode of the Fugue we have
developmental activity and we get ending

219
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,320
credential stuff virtually
in every kind of music.

220
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:44,210
So it's not limited just
to Sinatra labor force,

221
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,400
but question here is what does Beethoven
writing at this particular structure?

222
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,030
A particular point here we
are in theme and variations,

223
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:58,150
but I think we're referencing one of the
four functional types of music in this

224
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:02,030
next set section.
So what functional type is it?

225
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,233
Okay.

226
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,710
Okay, so what was it that we just
heard? What would you guess Daniel?

227
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,790
A transition. Yeah, he's just taking
it very simply from point a to point B,

228
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,900
d d little e t t t t t
t t t t t t t t t t pop,

229
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,610
pop, pop, pop. And maybe just
a little bit idea of a cadence.

230
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:33,140
Transitions you lead in with a couple of
final sounding courts there at the end.

231
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:38,150
So that's a transition and we've
moved and we've moved from from here,

232
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,960
a major key. What would you
imagine we're going to move to?

233
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,580
Okay,

234
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,630
a minor key and it's probably again,
although we, we don't hear it,

235
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,370
I don't hear it.
We don't hear it.

236
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,970
It's probably gonna be the relative
minor it because it's just simpler

237
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:57,950
structurally to operate that way. So let's
listen now to the next variation here,

238
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,570
but something very interesting happens.
He's referencing another four.

239
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:07,430
He's incorporating another form
in the composition as a variation.

240
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:09,440
So what is the other form now?

241
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,230
Stop it right there. So what
form is he referencing? Uh,

242
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,880
Michael? Yes. Got It right
today. Okay. A few. Yeah.

243
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,660
And we just,
one hearing was little,

244
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,090
it'd be hard to really know what
voice voices we're bringing it in.

245
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:57,240
But I'll just tell you generally what he
was doing there was starting up on the

246
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:58,074
top.

247
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,560
Okay.
And then,

248
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,110
and gradually coming down down in
terms of range, it was soprano, alto,

249
00:18:15,111 --> 00:18:19,220
tenor, and then bass. And the
bass did something interesting,

250
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,710
which sort of reinforces a
point we had the other day,

251
00:18:21,711 --> 00:18:25,160
the fugue subject that he's working with,
which by the way,

252
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,780
so he's kind of a varying that melody,
number one

253
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,550
kind of varying that nobody. Uh,
but when it gets to the base,

254
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:41,810
it does something interesting.

255
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,413
Hmm.

256
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,870
Why is that interesting?
Huh?

257
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,553
What,
what,

258
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,270
what process do we have at work there
that we talked about last time with regard

259
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:02,730
to few? Anybody remember?
Remember that, uh,

260
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:07,731
Daniel Inversion and I don't think I
made that point clearly enough the other

261
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,560
day,
but anytime you have,

262
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,130
oh,
you could have

263
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,240
going up the minor third and then down
the second you could go down a minor

264
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:22,620
third and then up a second.

265
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:27,000
So you're just turning the intervals and
it kind of a mirror image there. So, uh,

266
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:30,450
hear Beethoven uses a
little bit of of inversion.

267
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,360
So in the middle of this
demon variation movement,

268
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:37,740
he inserts a few and a few
be inserted inside the,

269
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,990
another form is called a few Gato fugato.

270
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,360
So here as the fourth,
I think fifth variation,

271
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:49,140
fifth variation of this last movement,
he inserts a few Gatto.

272
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:54,141
Let's skip if you would please then to
all the way up to about eight zero zero.

273
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:59,430
We're going to, I'll listen
to one, the final variation
here. And we, at this point,

274
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:03,000
we want to concentrate on the duration
of the melody. We were starting out,

275
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,610
yacht party.

276
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,910
Tell Tom Bom bom

277
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,600
one, two, one, two in that fashion,
which Beethoven doing here,

278
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,840
how much there? Yeah,
it's a long way to go.

279
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,083
Uh,

280
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,350
pause second.

281
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,920
So what's done here too is melody
to the duration within his melody.

282
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,140
It's now,
can you express it if we were calling it

283
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,940
bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom,

284
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,430
and then we go Paul,
Paul,

285
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,980
Paul,

286
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,030
what's he doing? Well, come on.

287
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,850
I just hear a little small
little words. Okay. Somebody,

288
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,340
let's choose somebody who's pretty
confident in that person will yell it out.

289
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,100
Marcos, I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.

290
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:27,030
That's the psychological effect
of Ritardando slowing it down,

291
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,590
giving you a sense you're getting
to the end. But once again,

292
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:32,080
technically that's not
exactly what he's doing.

293
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:36,710
He's giving that effect by doing
something that is corridor,

294
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:41,890
right? He's changing the note values.
He's simply doubling the note values.

295
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:44,320
And when we do that in music,
we call that augmentation.

296
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,510
Sometimes when we get
to Hector barely owes,

297
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,140
we'll see diminution to give a
sense of urgency to the music.

298
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:52,960
You can chop them all in half.
Well here he's getting toward the end.

299
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:57,640
He wants his grand broad effect.
He's brought in the brasses it showtime.

300
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:03,010
Uh, so what does he do? He doubles all
of the note values in theme number one.

301
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:04,120
So let's continue please.

302
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,260
Okay. And then he sort of fades out
and adds a little Coda at that point.

303
00:22:39,261 --> 00:22:42,370
But that's the way we
end the third sentence,

304
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,200
the Eroica symphony of Beethoven.

305
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,930
So it's an interesting piece because
it's got a full Gato in there.

306
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:51,680
It's got sections, it sound like
transition out of Sonata Allegro form.

307
00:22:51,681 --> 00:22:54,230
And he's working with two themes.

308
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,550
Questions about that before we move on?
All right,

309
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:02,570
so let's put that behind us now and
go on to talk about Ostinato form.

310
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,580
Once again, we've been through this
many times, but what is an Ostinato?

311
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,180
Yeah, okay. I know it's embarrassing.

312
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,090
It's something that happens
again and again and again.

313
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,650
This is sort of obsessive compulsive
disorder applied to music. Okay.

314
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,470
Obsessive compulsive disorder
applied to music. The,

315
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,480
the most famous example
of this is probably the,

316
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,333
okay.

317
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,640
The,
the Balero of Maurice Ravel.

318
00:23:35,641 --> 00:23:40,170
So we put that up on the board
here as our first Ostinato piece.

319
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,730
1928 piece in the 20th
century. Uh, it's, uh,

320
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,780
Ostinato in every way in the sense that
the melody keeps repeating over and over

321
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:53,750
again for 14 minutes. The, the rhythm

322
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,313
God,

323
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,280
God that keeps going for 14 minutes and
change it depending upon the tempo of

324
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:06,770
the conductor.
And when we did this,

325
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:08,980
remember you guys were
providing the beige harm,

326
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,870
bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom,

327
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,450
bom, Bom, bom.

328
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,590
That's all you do for 14
minutes and 30 seconds.

329
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,260
So every aspect of that melody,

330
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:26,730
rhythm and harmony is controlled
by this Ostinato procedure.

331
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,120
Uh, and in this example, as
mentioned from the 20th century,

332
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:34,730
but the heyday of Ostinato
form, uh, well really in,

333
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:37,500
in two,
in two periods in the history of music,

334
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:42,840
one in the Baroque period
and two right now, right now.

335
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,990
Because when you start
listening to your pop music,

336
00:24:45,991 --> 00:24:47,850
go out there and listen to those base and,

337
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,300
and start charting those bases
and see how repetitious they are.

338
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,770
When Frederick Evans brought in that
piece of insync or whenever it was that he

339
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:58,890
brought in and I started
listening to that answer, my God,

340
00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:02,160
he's got a descending Tetra cord
base Ostinato embedded in that,

341
00:25:02,161 --> 00:25:04,560
and I'm sure Frederick didn't
sit there scratching. Oh yes,

342
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:08,100
there's my descending Tetra
court, chromatic descending
Tetra cord base there,

343
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:11,790
but it's in there. It's embedded
in so much of this popular music,

344
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:14,130
and that's kind of what we're
going to track here a little bit,

345
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,840
but we're going to start with the Baroque.
So we could start with WHO's,

346
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,560
who's the best or the, yeah, we could
even say the best composer of the Baroque.

347
00:25:22,561 --> 00:25:24,380
Well,
Jay Ashbach js box.

348
00:25:24,381 --> 00:25:28,950
So let's start with an Oregon piece of
box and will listen to an Austin auto

349
00:25:28,951 --> 00:25:32,790
base. Generally speaking, in
music, when you get an Ostinato,

350
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,480
it's applied to the base.
It sets up a repeating harmony.

351
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,480
So that's what we got here.
So here's a Pasa, Kalia,

352
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,280
just a little bit of it by Bach,

353
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,673
uh,

354
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,440
[inaudible]

355
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,200
and you can see what he's doing
once he gets his base in there.

356
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:31,480
And it's a typical eight bar pattern.

357
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,280
It's odd how many of these Austin
that'll basis are in eight bar unit.

358
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:38,260
So it's an eight bar
pattern here with Bob.

359
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:43,530
Then all he does is keep throwing
over top of that rhythmic patterns and

360
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:48,380
slightly different melodic patterns
as well. But that base yacht,

361
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:52,660
he taught home,
partied hard on body

362
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,260
poem,

363
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,820
keeps churning away over and
over underneath in that piece.

364
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:01,500
For what instrument?
By Bach.

365
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,540
Okay.

366
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,950
Oregon. Big powerful pipe organ. That
wonderful, wonderful sale. All right,

367
00:27:06,951 --> 00:27:10,770
so that's an, that's an
introduction to the Baso Ostinato,

368
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,560
the Ostinato Bass by Bob.

369
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:17,360
Let's turn to some music now of Henry
personal and we personal wasn't English

370
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:21,920
composer working in London at
the end of the 17th century.

371
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,540
He was employed by,

372
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,770
must have been James the second and then
I think William and Mary for a little

373
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:32,150
bit. Uh, so he wrote for the courts
and he also wrote for the theater.

374
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:36,020
And in one instance, it turned out
to be his most famous composition.

375
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:41,021
He wrote an opera for an all girls
boarding school in the London suburb of

376
00:27:41,751 --> 00:27:45,950
Chelsea, I guess is now part of downtown
London. There's a famous soccer team,

377
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,210
Chelsea something, I don't
know, you see him on TV. Um, uh,

378
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,920
so there's Henry personal audit,

379
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,760
this all girl boarding school
and annually they put on a drama.

380
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,300
So it was kind of like the senior class
play in all of the roles were sung by

381
00:27:59,301 --> 00:27:59,990
women,

382
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:04,990
except in this case one role was
sung by a male and that was the,

383
00:28:05,721 --> 00:28:07,180
the role of Aeneas.

384
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:12,000
So we've got the famous
story of Dido and a niece a,

385
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,480
you've probably read it
in literature classes.

386
00:28:14,481 --> 00:28:19,400
You've probably read parts of it
in Latin. Um, it's from book for,

387
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,990
and it used to be in a really
good secondary type education.

388
00:28:23,991 --> 00:28:27,290
When you're doing Latin, you've had
maybe six or seven years of Latin,

389
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:30,600
you would read the, uh,

390
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,000
Virgil's Aeneid in the original Latin.
Anybody do that in your,

391
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,780
wow,
holy Schmoley math.

392
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,990
Latin is making a serious comeback
here because it's not easy.

393
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,120
It's not easy stuff. Uh, it's,

394
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,620
it's traditional classical Latin where
the syntax is radically different than

395
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,390
the medieval Latin or any kind of
modern, um, modern language. Okay, well,

396
00:28:53,391 --> 00:28:56,210
good for you guys. So, uh,
uh, you, you know the story.

397
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:59,060
Somebody tell me the story
then. Michael, what's the story?

398
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,420
Okay, so I need us has to
leave for another country.

399
00:29:13,421 --> 00:29:15,970
It happens to be what
country? Yeah, he's got it.

400
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:19,240
He's got to follow his destiny and go
off and found the city of Rome. Uh,

401
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:24,010
and in the vernacular having
ditched Dido back in Carthage,

402
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,170
uh, she's not happy about
this. Uh, she dies, uh, uh,

403
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,380
depending upon the theatrical version or
the original sheet there stabs herself,

404
00:29:32,381 --> 00:29:37,360
falls on the burning funeral pyre or dies
of a broken heart. But this is opera.

405
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,240
So you know that at the end of
it, the Sopranos got a die, right?

406
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:44,820
This is the way opera die
operas in Di did. So, uh,

407
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,880
in what you could do a Violetta and
Traviata, you could do Tosca and Tosca.

408
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:50,000
We've even seen here,

409
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:54,130
the leap is toe at the
end of Wagner's Tristan.

410
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,780
He's older, dies after singing.
The lead is tote, expires there.

411
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,970
So it's a convention of opera.

412
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,330
And in this particular
opera we have a famous Aria,

413
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:06,670
it's called Dido's lament,

414
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,840
where she is lamenting the fact that
she has been abandoned by a Nia.

415
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,370
And it's interesting because it's built
on an Austin auto baseline and it's

416
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:19,720
built on an Ostinato bass line that
descends. And this is important

417
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,240
because it became a convention for Lemon.

418
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,720
So this is the baseline
for Dido's lament here.

419
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:33,973
Yours,

420
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,500
tea, tea, tea,

421
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,220
God,
hard ball,

422
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:45,450
Yardi, Todd, Todd,

423
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,620
ah, top, Ooh.

424
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:53,890
And it just keeps me recycling over and
over and over again. That's the Ostinato.

425
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:59,170
Uh, and then up above it we have the
limitation. When I am lead in Earth, me,

426
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:03,460
my wrongs create no trouble in my
breasts. Remember me, remember me,

427
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:08,380
but I'll forget my feet. So
that's what she's singing. Uh,

428
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:11,530
so let's listen to a bit a bit of this.
And before we do that,

429
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:14,920
we have the term on the board up there,
ground base,

430
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:19,510
all that is is the English term for Austin
auto based ground base Ostinato bass

431
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,440
the same thing. But it gives us a
sense at least at the base grounds,

432
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:27,760
it kind of holds together. It's the
foundation for the entire composition.

433
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:32,050
Uh, so let's listen. We'll start with
the ground base. Nice and loud here,

434
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:34,300
Linda please.
And then the singer will come in.

435
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,293
Uh

436
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,280
Aw.

437
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,380
Hey,
let's stop it there.

438
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,790
So that's how this plays out and that
base keeps cycling through the duration of

439
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:24,050
this particular Aria.

440
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:28,580
Listening to this recording gives us the
opportunity to think about approaches

441
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:29,121
to music.

442
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:33,320
This is a piece written at the end of the
17th century and actually with in this

443
00:32:33,321 --> 00:32:34,340
particular recording,

444
00:32:34,341 --> 00:32:39,020
they're playing this and singing in a
way that would be rather similar to the,

445
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,180
they would've done it in the 17th century.

446
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:45,590
They have reproductions of 17th century
instruments and the singer here is

447
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:50,270
trying to create a particular
approach vocally to the music.

448
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,480
So as we listen to this
recording one more time,

449
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:58,620
we're going to hear just a little bit more
of it and then we're going to, um, uh,

450
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,210
ask you to compare this
recording to another recording.

451
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,770
This would be the kind of thing
that a reviewer would do. So, um,

452
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,650
let's listen to a bit more
of, of this, uh, recording a,

453
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:11,150
we'll call it and then we'll move on.

454
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,790
Right.

455
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:48,120
Pause it there.
Now we're going to go onto recording be,

456
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:52,790
so what's the difference here in
approach terms of orchestra, everything.

457
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,280
Vote voice in.
Uh,

458
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:58,380
how does recording be
differ from recording a

459
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,780
Oh,

460
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,733
oh,

461
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,910
so we'll, maybe we'll pause it
there. What's your reaction to that?

462
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:06,800
How do those two differ

463
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,780
hands please,
Caroline.

464
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:18,100
Okay. First Singer had a much
more youthful approach, uh,

465
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:22,460
and you could see that as an attempt
to maybe a duplicate the performance

466
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:26,900
context of the original
performance in high school,

467
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,470
a girls' school there in
late 17th century London. Um,

468
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:36,590
more specifically, what about the
quality of that voice? Any thoughts?

469
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,050
Uh, Roger. Okay.

470
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,240
Now should we have the two recordings?

471
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,810
Which of the two had more
of a Bronto one or two,

472
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:52,850
two had a lot more of a broader.
So that's,

473
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:55,370
that's really the big difference here.

474
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,520
That one was a very well focused voice
with very little vibrato and maybe that's

475
00:36:01,011 --> 00:36:03,500
what gave it this youthful appeal appeal.

476
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:06,660
It's almost like the voice of a choir
boy or choir girl for Heaven Sake.

477
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:09,350
So I'm of a pre adolescent child,

478
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,440
but intending to make
it very pure and very,

479
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:16,610
very clean and very well focused.
The second recording,

480
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:21,920
uh, what that might be a recording that
you would expect to hear performance you

481
00:36:21,921 --> 00:36:26,180
would expect to hear where
maybe in a modern opera,

482
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,500
a seat. Oh, a theater or an opera hall.

483
00:36:30,501 --> 00:36:35,501
A hall designed for opera where we've
got this huge expanse that we have to

484
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:40,180
fill. What about the orchestra? Um,

485
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,093
Frederick

486
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,753
repetition,

487
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,740
you mean higher in terms of pitch?
Frederick,

488
00:36:58,741 --> 00:37:02,970
you have a very good year actually that's
true. I don't want to get into this,

489
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:03,940
but uh,

490
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,310
the first recording is pitched in
f sharp in the old baroque tuning.

491
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:12,180
They're trying to really be so
authentic pitch in the Baroque era,

492
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,270
which was actually lower than it is today.

493
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:18,030
We know that because their tuning
forks that survived in that period,

494
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:22,140
they got labeled on it a, you play that
a, and it turns out to be our g sharp.

495
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,870
So Aficionados of this
particular repertoire,

496
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,360
when they go to perform baroque music,

497
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:29,550
they're gonna use reproductions
of authentic instruments.

498
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:32,340
They're going to use non-VA Brado singing
and they're going to use the lower

499
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:35,130
pitch.
I didn't plan on getting into that,

500
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:38,430
but since you picked up on it a good
for you. Now we don't have to hear that.

501
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,420
And to be honest with you,

502
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,800
the only reason I remembered that was
I went to duplicate it before coming in

503
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:46,020
here today. I went to duplicate
those pitches on the piano,

504
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:48,900
so I'd be up to speed with
this and I realized, Jesus,

505
00:37:48,901 --> 00:37:52,470
I'd have to do this in f sharp and
that's going to require some quick

506
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:56,640
transposition up here because I can do
it quickly. And Gee, we only two flats,

507
00:37:56,641 --> 00:38:00,150
but f sharp. Well, I'm in sharp side. Got
there and I have to figure all this out.

508
00:38:00,151 --> 00:38:03,420
So, um, but that is going on there.
That's an interesting development.

509
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,450
Anything else?
What about the tempo of the two?

510
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:12,770
Size of the orchestra always
determines to some degree the tempo.

511
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:17,250
I'm Oscar. Yeah. The,

512
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:19,110
the second recording was much slower.

513
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:23,460
You S I was intentionally trying to beat
it up here and it was a very labored

514
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,181
beat pattern.

515
00:38:24,181 --> 00:38:29,181
It was much slower because they had many
more instruments or a lot more people

516
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:32,610
playing axiomatic.
The more people you have,

517
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:36,190
the longer it takes for sound to clear,
the slower your tempo we'll go.

518
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,420
Unless you have a maniacally tutorial
type of conductor that will really push

519
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:44,200
you. So it, it leads
to the more people, uh,

520
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,880
the slower the tempo is going to go.

521
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:51,010
So what we have here is a reproduction
of a attempt to reproduce authentic 17th

522
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:54,640
century performance as opposed to
a modern performance, big sale,

523
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,900
metropolitan opera type
of setup. All right, uh,

524
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,380
let's move on here.
One of the interesting aspect of this,

525
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:05,080
I discovered this raw
driving down Whitney Avenue.

526
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:07,210
This is true driving down Whitney Avenue.
One day,

527
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:12,330
I must've been fishing for 91.5 and my
FM dial and suddenly had a seizure or

528
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:17,350
something and it didn't quite make it.
And I was listening to Elton John. Okay.

529
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,320
Listening to Elton John and
uh, what did I hear? But the,

530
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:26,740
the, the craziest thing, what I
heard was this text. It's sad.

531
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,650
It's sad. It's a sad, sad situation.

532
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,920
And then I heard [inaudible]
totty the hardy poem.

533
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,370
I said, Whoa, wait a minute there.
That's the personal baseline.

534
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,260
That's the personal baseline.

535
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:49,390
Elton John has stolen the person
baseline arrest that man, no,

536
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,760
we don't do this because as we say,
these baselines are in the common domain.

537
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:58,180
As we have said before, you can't sue
anybody for the theft of a baseline.

538
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:03,670
And indeed it was all over the place
in the Baroque. This is a type of,

539
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:08,010
it became a kind of musical icon.
Anytime that audience would here,

540
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:20,040
they would think death or bad news.
Uh,

541
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:24,010
and actually we still do today. It doesn't
hit the road jack based on that same,

542
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,350
same kind of Austin Austin that obey.
Uh,

543
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:31,330
but in the baroque you could go back to
month severities, lament, Adela, nene far,

544
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:35,380
you could go to box
[inaudible] Zagon to whine.

545
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:39,640
Kvetch uh, you could go to the
crucifix. So the Bach B minor mass,

546
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:44,550
what could be more painful or a
dispiriting than a crucifixion? Uh,

547
00:40:44,551 --> 00:40:49,240
so this was a Monica, it was a kind of
a kind of emblem of lemon [inaudible],

548
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:53,440
whether it's in person, whether it's in
Bach or whether it's in, in Elton John.

549
00:40:53,441 --> 00:40:56,620
So when Elton John was to
take this and he used it,

550
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:59,740
not the beginning of this
piece, sorry, is the sad,

551
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,550
or sorry is the hardest word to say.
He didn't use it at the beginning.

552
00:41:03,551 --> 00:41:08,290
He used it in the chorus. So here we
are in the chorus of Elton John's.

553
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:11,890
Uh, I think it's, sorry is the saddest
thing to say or something like that.

554
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,283
It is,

555
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,470
it's sad.

556
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,393
It's

557
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,720
always seems to mean Bob seems to be,

558
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,320
and then he goes on with the next verse.
Okay.

559
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:58,030
So that's just one example of a use of
that particular Austin. It would be,

560
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,430
we actually call that a limit base.
And any Mozart even did it.

561
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:05,470
And he wrote a Violin Sonata
on the occasion of his
mother's death and e minor.

562
00:42:05,471 --> 00:42:07,870
And he has that thing just
going down the descending.

563
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:12,330
Basically it's this descending tetra
cord here that gets filled in chromatic

564
00:42:12,331 --> 00:42:15,610
like all right,
so we've got that as an Austin auto base.

565
00:42:15,611 --> 00:42:19,000
What's the most famous
Ostinato Bass of all time?

566
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:23,440
Baroque or modern pocket bell base.
Okay.

567
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:26,020
And we've got this thing
called the pocket Bell Canada.

568
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,900
Do you have the Xerox for today?

569
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:34,120
What's the pocket bell cannon?
Well we've worked a little bit with this,

570
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:39,121
I think it was listening exercise eat I
believe early on in the course where we

571
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:41,910
were trying to uh,

572
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:47,130
have you focused on changing harmonies
and these harmonies are just generated by

573
00:42:47,681 --> 00:42:51,850
this repeating baseline. Um, there's a,

574
00:42:51,851 --> 00:42:56,851
there's an irony with the pocket bell
cannon and that is that you never hear the

575
00:42:56,981 --> 00:43:01,330
cannon in the pocket bell cannon.
Why is that the case?

576
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:06,250
It's because if you look,
he's got these three concentric lines,

577
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:10,660
the three staves up above,
all in the same register.

578
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:15,160
And when people record this, they
always do it with the same instrument,

579
00:43:15,161 --> 00:43:16,390
usually just with the violin.

580
00:43:16,391 --> 00:43:21,340
So we had the violins up above three
violins all playing in the same register.

581
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,210
You can't pick out the can and it just
sounds like this unfolding jumble.

582
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:30,040
It's very beautiful jumble. But it,
it, it's in distinctive in that sense.

583
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,770
Maybe if they work a straight at oboe,
flute and clarinet,

584
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,380
maybe we could hear the cannon better.
What we hear,

585
00:43:35,381 --> 00:43:40,381
of course grinding away
underneath is the Ostinato Bass.

586
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:45,500
So let's listen to just a bit of this.
Um,

587
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,580
and I was struck the other day when I
went back and listen to this recording on

588
00:43:48,581 --> 00:43:51,970
your cds,
they have put in this w uh,

589
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,210
something that's actually pocket bell
didn't, right when this starts out,

590
00:43:55,211 --> 00:43:56,044
they just start with the,

591
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,650
what's that?

592
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:13,950
It's a descending major scale.
So they've just say, all right,

593
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:17,040
here's your basic tonality,
here's your total grid or whatever.

594
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:20,400
So let's listen to the bass start out.
Then we'll have this descending scale.

595
00:44:20,401 --> 00:44:21,480
The pocket bell didn't,
right.

596
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,870
And then his cannon will start and
you can see how this works here.

597
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:29,010
I've indicated a gets repeated
as B comes in and, and so on.

598
00:44:29,011 --> 00:44:30,810
It's pretty straight forward.
How the Canon,

599
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,360
okay,
here comes the scale now

600
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,870
and now the canon stars a one

601
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,590
second voice comes in.

602
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,260
First voice goes on to
present something new.

603
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,900
[inaudible]

604
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,830
sit here that we're going to pause
it here. It goes about four minutes.

605
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:02,670
It's very beautiful. It's lovely.
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely. Um,

606
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:08,070
but you know this base,
right? Right. Okay.

607
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,340
So there's our D let's all
sing it together. Ready? Sing.

608
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:18,140
Uh, uh, uh,

609
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:24,090
uh, uh, uh, uh,

610
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,200
uh, uh, uh,

611
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:31,380
uh,
uh,

612
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,630
okay. So once you get that
in your ear, you have a sense

613
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,290
it's really in there.
And did,

614
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:41,390
you may have heard that
many different times before.

615
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:45,290
Now lots of people made use of the
pocket belt cannon. And I know of,

616
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,910
of at least three and maybe four that
I've put up on the board up there.

617
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:51,770
And you may know of more,

618
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,920
Marcos sent me a you
tube clip of a comedian.

619
00:46:57,771 --> 00:47:00,530
Maybe you guys have seen this.
Where's the comedian's name?

620
00:47:00,531 --> 00:47:05,030
He was making sort of so sick of the
pocket bell cannon because every PC picks

621
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:07,340
up has got the baseline of
the pocket bell cannon in it.

622
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,610
W what comedian was that? It doesn't
matter. It doesn't matter. Okay. Um,

623
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:16,040
so those are my four.
Anybody else know where else they show up?

624
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:21,500
All right, well let's review, but
keeping the key. Oh, Thaddeus good.

625
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:28,240
Brittany Spears has the pocket bell
cannon. What a time to be alive. Wow.

626
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,270
All right. That is, go get that for me.
I need this one because this is gold.

627
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:39,310
Um, thank you very much. But so, but check
it. For example, one of the students,

628
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,640
Daniel in here, uh, it sent me, um, uh,

629
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,620
gave me and we talked about
it. Um, uh, let's go to that
one. Let's go to that one.

630
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:51,550
Uh, um, the itch, it would
be CD four, track two,

631
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:55,420
at about zero 20. Uh, he said, uh,

632
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:58,900
this may be a knockoff of
the pocket bell cannon.

633
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:01,300
It's called the Taco bell cannon.

634
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:06,900
So let's see if the Taco bell cannon is
in fact embedded in the Taco bell cannon

635
00:48:09,101 --> 00:48:09,934
here.

636
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,400
The taco bell base.

637
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:49,613
Okay.

638
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:05,580
The pattern you were singing yes or no?
I mean, think yes. Raise your right hand.

639
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,560
Let me think. No, raise your left hand,

640
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,433
Huh?

641
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,500
Nope. It ain't the pocket bell.
Canada. Is it an Austin auto base? Yes,

642
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:19,360
it's an Austin auto base. Um, so,
uh, we could keep playing with that.

643
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:23,560
I could play you coolio blues
traveler, vitamin C, just for a laugh.

644
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:28,190
Let's do vitamin C, which is
CD a two track one. You've, uh,

645
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:33,100
uh, and I'm sorry about this, but
it's, it's too good to pass up. Okay.

646
00:49:33,101 --> 00:49:34,360
So out you go.
Thanks for your [inaudible].

647
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:35,283
Okay.

648
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,990
Appropriately enough. It's
in the key of c Vitamin C, c

649
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:02,210
25.
