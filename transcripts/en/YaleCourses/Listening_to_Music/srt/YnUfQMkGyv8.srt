1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,040
Let us begin please.
Today you should be a fun day for us.

2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:07,150
We've got some visitors. It's always, uh,

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,880
this particular exercise is one of the
ones that I enjoy most in this course

4
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:16,710
because we get to talk with
real performers and find
out what's in their head

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,230
when they perform a concert for us.

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,540
So our aim today is to continue
along this path to make you,

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,890
in this case,

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,890
educated critics so that you can go to
a concert of classical music and you'll

9
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:35,460
be able to engage it in
a productive sort of way,

10
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:39,360
in an educated way. Now there are
lots of things we could think about,

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,390
terms of do's and don'ts when we
evaluate material musically in a critical

12
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:45,330
fashion.

13
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,510
And we're going to be going through
some of those in section starting this

14
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:48,901
evenings.

15
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:52,530
And we'll have a big long list of this
is what you put in and review and it's

16
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:56,730
probably not so good to put this in
a review. But generally speaking,

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,360
when you go to a concert
and you review it,

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,290
whether you do it just for yourself or
whether you review it and then write down

19
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:08,340
your thoughts and publish them as a
published review, you do the following.

20
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,370
You're essentially
reviewing the performance.

21
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,510
How well did the performance go?
How did the,

22
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,280
how did the players do?

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,620
You're not engaging,
uh, who the composer is.

24
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,700
You're not engaging.
When the piece was written,

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,400
the history of the piece,
the historical context,

26
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,680
you're not engaging even oddly
the meaning of the piece,

27
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:38,370
the meaning of the piece.
Now on our concert for Saturday night,

28
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,960
we have three pieces, one by Mozart,
one by Brahms and one by Beethoven.

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,030
What's the meaning of the
Mozart? The opening piece? Well,

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,650
the meaning there is
its function in a sense.

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,560
It's in trying to get the concert going.

32
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,050
Originally of course he was
trying to get the opera going.

33
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,210
Oddly if the music they're in the overture
has nothing to do specifically with

34
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:02,790
the music and the opera.
There's no music in the opera.

35
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,380
That's also used in the overture,

36
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,790
but it does have a lot
to do psychologically
because it's a very intense

37
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:12,360
compressed overture.
And the opera itself,

38
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:15,240
if you begin to study that in the
way he's linking scenes, in a way,

39
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,550
he's moving his harmonic
progressions along.

40
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,320
It's also a very compressed
intense opera. So, uh,

41
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,010
some of the psychological state of the
opera is encapsulated in that opening

42
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,060
overture, but that overture can open
other things as well. So they're,

43
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:35,061
the meaning of the Mozart in essence is
the function of the piece to get people

44
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:38,340
in, to get them quiet,
to get them focused,

45
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,520
and to give them a heads up in a
way as to the psychological, uh,

46
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,350
import of the opera.
That's to follow.

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,920
Now we have also the Beethoven,
the pastoral symphony of Beethoven.

48
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,520
What do you suppose the meaning of
that is a pretty straight forward.

49
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,130
Anybody want to take a crack at it?

50
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,770
Anybody know anything about the
pastoral symphony of Beethoven?

51
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,110
What would you guess? What's it sound
like? It sounded like a train, right?

52
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:09,670
Does this sound like midtown
Manhattan? Elizabeth? Yeah,

53
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:12,790
the countryside. The kind of
leisurely embrace of the countryside,

54
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,830
maybe a walk through woods on a beautiful
spring day, that kind of thing. Uh,

55
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,600
and each of the moments movements plays
this out in a different way or sort of

56
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:23,440
an introduction than an introduction
to the birds of the forest.

57
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:25,320
And the second movement,
uh,

58
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,160
pads and romp in the third movement of
storm gathers in the fourth movement that

59
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:33,460
we have an extra movement in this
particular symphony because we've got

60
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:37,810
Beethoven writing a bit of pictorial music
here in the form of a fourth movement

61
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:42,210
that's a storm and then a
hymn of thanksgiving. Um,

62
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:47,460
that plays out in basically a Rondo
variation form there at the end.

63
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:52,330
So that's the meaning of that and
how an individual might embrace the

64
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:56,170
countryside. A, what's
the meaning of the Brahms?

65
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,460
What's the meeting of the Bronx?

66
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,810
While we've got these variations
and they're simply sonic patterns,

67
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:06,520
sonic patterns, uh, and we
have patterns, I suppose,

68
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:07,470
in lots of different arts.

69
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,010
Think of abstract patterns and De
Kooning paintings or Jackson Pollock.

70
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:14,680
We have a beautiful Jackson Pollock
over in the Yale Art Gallery.

71
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:17,380
Well that's just sort of abstraction,
visual abstraction as well.

72
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:19,900
You can have sonic abstractions as well.

73
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,920
I was talking with our conductor
that we'll introduce in a moment, uh,

74
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:24,790
yesterday about this.

75
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:28,990
What's the meaning of the Brahms or he
got to this in a different sort of way.

76
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:31,810
And maybe I will let the cat
out of the bag with that.

77
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,990
But it seems to me that what we've got
here is an individual or an experience in

78
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:43,720
which we are staying. We have the same
frame of reference, that same context,

79
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,890
in other words,
the theme,

80
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,430
but we're going to engage it in
six or seven really different ways.

81
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,260
And think of all the times in your life,
or you may go into the same context. Uh,

82
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:57,100
you may go into your dorm room and you've
had a terrible day and you're furious

83
00:04:57,101 --> 00:05:02,020
and you're storming around, or you've
had a very pleasant day, or as it's been,

84
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,620
uh, a rather revenue neutral day
in terms of your emotional content.

85
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:09,760
So maybe it's not particularly,
uh, moving one way or the other.

86
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,850
You can have the same item that you engage
intellectually or psychologically in

87
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:16,960
radically different ways.

88
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,050
So this is the same item played out in
rather radically different ways musically

89
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,950
in this theme and variation set.
And we'll say more about that later,

90
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,030
but generally,

91
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,510
oddly you don't write about these kinds
of things when you write a review.

92
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,740
What you're writing about again
is how well they played the piece.

93
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,770
Only if they play it in a way that seems
to subvert the meaning as you perceive

94
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:42,280
it.

95
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,280
The meaning of the piece is does the
performance a really impact on the meaning

96
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:51,370
of the piece? Then you might say, well,

97
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:56,670
this performance was not
successful because as I say
it countermanded or what is

98
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:01,960
the meaning of this particular
piece as you, the listener, um,

99
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,490
perceive that to be oddly also, you
don't talk about the form in the pieces.

100
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,710
We've,
we've been spending all this time on form.

101
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:13,820
Form is a way of getting in there so we
can follow along intelligently what's

102
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:15,860
happening in these compositions.

103
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,040
But we don't write a review in set in
which we say the orchestra started out and

104
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,580
we engaged the first theme and then we
had a fine transition that went to the

105
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:29,300
second theme.
And I really liked that closing theme.

106
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,340
It had a lot of harmonic bang to it.

107
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,600
We don't want to sort
of be led by the nose,

108
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,870
if you will,
through the form of the piece.

109
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,620
But we'll be saying a lot more
about this in section. And as I say,

110
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:47,450
we'll have another yet another
sheet, uh, to, to hand to you.

111
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,670
It helps when you go to a concert to know
a little something about the composer.

112
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,920
Right.
What do you know about Beethoven?

113
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,810
What do you think of when
you think of Beethoven?

114
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes, the pinnacle of
all music. Okay, good.

115
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,280
That's a, that's an interesting
way of putting it. And actually,

116
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:10,550
even if you look at the textbook that
you're using there, you've got this,

117
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,700
you've got an entire long chapter
devoted just to Beethoven there and,

118
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:19,820
but when people write history books,
Beethoven is kind of the Lynch Pin.

119
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,030
You work up to Beethoven in the
new work away from Beethoven.

120
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,620
So Beethoven for the
19th century was, um, uh,

121
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,230
was an icon. It was, um, the,

122
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:33,620
the pinnacle of what the artist
was supposed to be light.

123
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,210
But it's not just the musical artists.
Beethoven represented more than that.

124
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,680
Uh, was he a neat and tidy guy?
Was he sort of uptight guy?

125
00:07:42,681 --> 00:07:46,760
Did he wear a neck tie and look, look,
sort of a constrained in the, uh,

126
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,750
appropriate system of the day? I'm
the ultimate corporate guy, right?

127
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:55,550
Was Beethoven the ultimate corporate
guy? No. What did he look like?

128
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,940
He looked like the prototype of the
genius and on the basis of how Beethoven

129
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:03,860
looked and how Beethoven acted,

130
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,980
people then began to build this concept
of the genius in the 19th century.

131
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:13,970
Beethoven was the building block for
this whole idea about what a genius was,

132
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:18,600
how he was supposed to behave, how
he was not necessarily, um, uh,

133
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,120
to be held to the same standards as
the rest of humanity in terms of his

134
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:27,380
behavior to other people.
If you had unnecessary to be
dishonest, be dishonest. He,

135
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,380
Beethoven wasn't a serve as dishonest
as sometimes with regard Wagner was,

136
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,470
but it was excused
because he was a genius.

137
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,280
Well this sort of idea begins with
Beethoven here in the 19th century.

138
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,180
What did Beethoven, right, well,
as you can see on your sheet there,

139
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:42,470
but you pick up your sheet.

140
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,580
I think I've got a find it useful
to do this from time to time.

141
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:52,190
Just sort of the basic Beethoven if
you will. Um, and a list of things.

142
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:56,520
If you want to buy particular pieces
or you want to explore particular

143
00:08:56,521 --> 00:09:00,500
repertoire of Beethoven, well you
can do it in this fashion. So, um,

144
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,800
there is,
uh,

145
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:06,120
what we need to know about Beethoven
on that particular sheet bronze.

146
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:08,640
We talked about, we talked
about his pieces. Mozart,

147
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,320
we will be talking a lot more
about, um, as time goes on,

148
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,880
now we have,
let's turn to our big sheet here.

149
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,310
What are you going to do with
this big sheet, isn't it?

150
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,630
You can do a couple of
things with that big sheet.

151
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,800
An energetic student

152
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,780
might want to go out and
go to iTunes and do what

153
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,160
and before the concert. Yeah. Download by.

154
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:43,540
Get the pieces ahead of time. Um,
for 99 cents, except with the,

155
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,360
with the Beethoven.
Why would the Beethoven cost more?

156
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,070
Bye.

157
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,090
Yeah. You got to pay for each of the
movement as the way they sell their stuff.

158
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,170
Stuff too. And once again, they'll call
them soul, right? Each is Ebay. Pardon?

159
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,650
And you can go to the music library
because Linda has been kind enough to put

160
00:10:00,651 --> 00:10:04,100
all of these on reserve for all
these pieces on reserve for us also.

161
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,060
So you have this big sheet and uh,
you can take this,

162
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:12,800
you can engage this material
ahead of time with the pieces.

163
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,190
We don't have any of these
pieces on our cds there.

164
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,550
Thousands of zillions of
classical pieces of music.

165
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:20,930
We can't put them all on our cds.

166
00:10:20,931 --> 00:10:23,420
We have Beethoven's all of Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony, for example,

167
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,710
but we don't have the sixth symphony.

168
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,890
But you can get it there
on iTunes if you want to.

169
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,540
And then you can follow along and ask
yourself these questions as you're

170
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:36,170
listening to a recording before
the contract. That would be,

171
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,770
that would be a really, um, uh, uh,

172
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,040
serious type of preparation for this,
uh,

173
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:46,730
feeling that you could simply
bring this to the concert.

174
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,930
Simply bring this to the
concert and then, um, uh, uh,

175
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,950
follow along of discretely as the concert
is going on and ask yourself these

176
00:10:57,051 --> 00:10:58,400
questions and maybe write on it.

177
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,590
Probably be good if we didn't
have a hundred people going

178
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,540
like this during the middle of the concert
and we get on the change of peace or

179
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,090
some change of movement.
So try to keep the,

180
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,090
I've seen also students sit there with
computers sort of taking notes during it.

181
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,570
That's, that's a bit over
the top it seems. It seems to
me. So it'd be really neat.

182
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,580
Uh,
somehow what I do actually,

183
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:22,670
what do I do when this is going on because
I have to read these reviews, right?

184
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,820
I got to read them, so I got to know
and the TA's have to know what happened.

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,350
What I do is I take my program and I
do have a pencil there and they take my

186
00:11:30,351 --> 00:11:35,210
program and I'll write little notes on
my program so that I can remember what

187
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:38,720
the orchestra did at a particular spot.
And generally speaking,

188
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:42,890
the sooner you write your review
after a performance, uh, the better.

189
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,503
Um,

190
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,200
so do you have questions about that
and we'll be talking more a lot about,

191
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,370
about that intersection, uh,
starting this evening. Yes. Dan,

192
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,590
how long did it reviews be? 500
words. Two pages. Very good question.

193
00:12:01,591 --> 00:12:04,710
We're going to hold you to, that holds
you to that. So they're not long,

194
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,030
but it forces you to think about what's
important and what's not important when

195
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:09,864
you write.

196
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,750
Uh,
Roger,

197
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,620
um, I, I basically you're writing
about how well they perform. Um,

198
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,541
at the end of it,

199
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:32,200
you could throw in a sentence or
two to the effect that they met your

200
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:37,201
expectations as to the meaning of this
composition as the composer intended it

201
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:39,610
or they did not,

202
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,030
but I would not spend a lot of
time engaging in the review. Uh,

203
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,760
the meaning of the piece.

204
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,733
No.

205
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,111
So we'll, we'll, we'll,

206
00:12:48,111 --> 00:12:52,580
you've got the five pieces here and
we'll be going over some more of them in

207
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:56,930
section and getting you up to speed
in terms of, of the repertoire as,

208
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,460
as time goes on. Any other questions
before we introduce our first guest?

209
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,903
Yes.

210
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,540
That's to be encouraged.
In other words,

211
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,700
if you hear this opening overture going
to Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,

212
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,380
Dah. That, that the data that

213
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,130
that's way too slow. I'm not feeling
it compressed. I'm feeling excited.

214
00:13:28,131 --> 00:13:30,140
I'm not feeling energized by that tempo.

215
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,830
So you should say there then I
think the tempo was too slow.

216
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,853
Yeah,

217
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,070
it didn't,
if the music didn't have energy,

218
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,720
it didn't excite the listener because
the initial tempo was too slow.

219
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,480
Anything else? Well, if not,

220
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:49,480
let's go on to introduce our
first guest then Bradley Nailer.

221
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,780
Here's Bradley's name up there.
Bradley is the Prince of Kimono friendly.

222
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,620
Bradley is the principal
conductor for tomorrow night,

223
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:59,260
and we will be listening
to the Saybrook orchestra.

224
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,890
And the rest of our discussion today is,
uh,

225
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,990
basically between you and Bradley
with me feeding Bradley questions.

226
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200
I'm trying to think about the kinds
of things that you might want to ask,

227
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,860
but don't hesitate to jump right in
and raise your hand and ask Bradley a

228
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:19,780
question at any point. So, Bradley, you're
a student at the school of music, right?

229
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,230
Uh, so tell us about your musical
training. How'd you get started here?

230
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,540
I sang in choirs,
gosh,

231
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,970
it was probably eight when
I started singing in choirs,

232
00:14:29,971 --> 00:14:32,370
but it wasn't until middle school
that I started getting serious.

233
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,170
My middle school music teacher said,
Hey Brad,

234
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:37,460
why don't you try out for this region and
choir thing? And then I go, okay, I'll,

235
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,343
I'll submit a tape.

236
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,900
And I got there and here
I was in this room of 25,

237
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,410
15 year old tenors and they were all
seeing the same notes at the same time.

238
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:47,850
And I thought, well,
that's just a miracle.

239
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,740
And so I felt that that point
I'd really found what I to do.

240
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,840
Um,
went to high school,

241
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:58,010
went to Undergrad where I majored in
music just down the road in Providence.

242
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,640
And I got a master's degree in choral
conducting at Indiana university out in

243
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:02,510
the cornfields.

244
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,220
And now I'm back in New England getting
an m and a master of musical arts and

245
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:10,660
choral conducting at the Institute
of Sacred Music. So the your,

246
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,480
for your preparation for this is a
little bit unusual for most conductors

247
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,680
because I think,
uh,

248
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,420
rarely are only exceptionally,

249
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:24,590
do you have people beginning in music
through vocal music, they'd come around.

250
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,500
Now you're,
you're leading an orchestra here,

251
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,320
so doesn't that put you at
something of a disadvantage?

252
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:34,520
I would think to be an
orchestral conducted be really
good to have started with

253
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:37,010
the violin or maybe the French horn.

254
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:40,370
So you're listening to intonation
issues and things like that.

255
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,830
I would agree with that. Um, I can't, well
with the exception of maybe Robert Shaw,

256
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,060
I can't think of a single
big name conductor who
started as a choral conductor

257
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:52,280
and now is in charge of a,
a major symphony orchestra.

258
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,760
The vast majority of them are either
string players, keyboard players,

259
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:58,470
a few wind or brass players
here and there. But, um,

260
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,420
I've done a few things to
try and supplement that
perceived lack of knowledge.

261
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,610
Um,
when I was an Undergrad,

262
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:09,230
I took an orchestration class to try
and get a sense of what the capabilities

263
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:12,500
and limitations of all the instruments
were. A couple of summers ago,

264
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:15,860
I spent a month at Bard
College in New York at a,

265
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:18,800
an instrumental conducting workshop
where I worked with various conductors.

266
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:23,640
So I've tried to supplement that
a, that initial coral leaning. Um,

267
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,490
but what about piano now?
I mean,

268
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,960
I'm always surprised how good
pianists these conductors are.

269
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:35,420
So you must have had to practice
piano, don't take piano, piano.

270
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,190
Um,
I wouldn't say extensively,

271
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:41,360
but consistently throughout
my young career. Um,

272
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,890
because you have to, in
order to, to engage the music
and we'll talk about this,

273
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,440
you have to be able to do,
what was the score?

274
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,570
I think you have to be able to play
or realize the full score, right?

275
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:57,170
So it might be the kind of thing we
would put a score with maybe 20 lines up

276
00:16:57,171 --> 00:16:59,480
there on the,
on the keyboard here.

277
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,540
And Bradley would be able
to read through this.

278
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,580
And Digest all these 20 lines at once.

279
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:06,950
You pick doesn't sound
all that difficult except,

280
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,640
except a lot of these lines
are not actually written.

281
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,760
The notes that are written there are
not the ones you play because they're

282
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:18,170
transposing instruments such as the beef,
flat clarinet in the beef flat trumpet.

283
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,650
So it's really complicated.
In fact,

284
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,600
Ooh, Ooh, that hurts. That would
be like reading a text, uh,

285
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,460
in four languages at once.
You know,

286
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:34,760
one word is in Cyrillic alphabet
and next the Latin alphabet.

287
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:35,960
Next Hebrew alphabet.

288
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:39,380
So your mind has got very quickly
to change all this really hard.

289
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:42,410
It takes years and years and years and
years of preparation. Well, what do you,

290
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:45,290
what's your goal here?
What do you want to do with this?

291
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:49,980
Where do you want to be 15 years
from now? Oh, well, I don't

292
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,050
know if there's a white
picket fence, but, um,

293
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,070
I would like to be teaching at
a university directing choruses,

294
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,440
working on choral orchestral works,

295
00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:01,560
like maybe Haydn's creation or something
like that at a great piece from the

296
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:06,300
same period as Beethoven's symphony. So,
uh, working at a, at a university, right.

297
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,550
College level as well as maybe a
professional chorus or orchestra. Okay.

298
00:18:10,551 --> 00:18:13,130
Now here's a question for it might
seem like a route one, but I,

299
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:16,760
I get to my class, I get to
be ruined if I want to. Um,

300
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,540
what makes you think you can do this
better than anybody else who says that

301
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,240
you'll get to be the boss here?
The leader here?

302
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,900
A isn't that a bit of Hubris on,

303
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,680
on your part? I think that any conductor
has a bit of Hubris in him or her.

304
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:31,883
Um,

305
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,920
I guess the short answer to that is
that whenever I sit in a rehearsal,

306
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,400
I'm using my ears. Whenever I sit in
and rehearsal and I'm not conducting,

307
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:43,100
I'm using my ears to try and
evaluate what's coming back.

308
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,740
And I always find myself
forming an opinion. You know,

309
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:47,390
this could be loud or
this could be softer.

310
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:49,640
I want to hear that more than I
want to hear this other thing.

311
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,580
So the only place you can achieve that
goal is if you're in front of the house.

312
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,100
Yeah. Oddly, that's what
they will be doing though.
When they go to this country,

313
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,760
you guys will be listening and say, gee,
why didn't I love that flute line there?

314
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,760
Uh, why wasn't that Flute Line
Louder? So he's kind of a critic,

315
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:10,410
but he wants to apply his critical
facility here to interpretation.

316
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:14,270
So that's it. To impose his
concept of the music, um,

317
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:18,000
on others for the benefit of others.
I said,

318
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,610
well, what do they have to have
to conduct? What's it take to be?

319
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,680
What's it take to be a good conductor?
You think?

320
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:29,980
Just just that you've got a good
insights into the music. Um,

321
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,150
well I have, I think just a
good insights into the music.

322
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,560
Music is youtube readily,
but,

323
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,370
but I don't think I would be any good
as a conductor and I kind of know why.

324
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,390
So what do you have to do? What do you
have to have to be a good conductor?

325
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,890
I think it's a varied skillset,
I think,

326
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,760
and don't tell my colleagues I'm
saying this, but I think at its basis,

327
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,450
the conductor is really just a
glorified traffic cop in certain ways.

328
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,090
Trying to make Sur that
there are no accidents.

329
00:19:58,091 --> 00:20:01,150
You don't want the logos to crash into
the bassoon. So nobody wants that.

330
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,170
You have to make sure that
people yield when they need to.

331
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:09,360
If you need to hear the viola line,
you've got to have the violence yield. Um,

332
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,670
and you just have to make sure that
everyone gets to their locations without

333
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,840
incident and a,
and as fluid.

334
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,890
Yeah. Okay, good. Now here's a, here's a,

335
00:20:18,891 --> 00:20:22,620
another component of this though I've
heard of people and talk about in terms of

336
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:27,560
books, I have absolute rhythmic, um,
sort of an absolute sense of rhythm.

337
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,380
I can tell what a particular pulse is.

338
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,470
I can identify that for
you and I can keep that.

339
00:20:33,471 --> 00:20:34,790
And that's why I'm interested in,

340
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:38,150
in becoming conductor or
let's say you're conducting,

341
00:20:38,151 --> 00:20:40,940
and this is where I would always go.
What I have done some conducting,

342
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,480
used to conduct the collegium here at Uw.

343
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,650
But where I got in trouble was when
something was out of tune, I could, hey,

344
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:48,250
that doesn't

345
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,090
sound good,

346
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,100
but I couldn't tell them why or
what to do to make it sound right.

347
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,560
My ear wasn't good enough. So, uh,

348
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:02,330
how good an ear do you have to
be to be a conductor? How good,

349
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,090
how good do you have to have an ear,
not just for pitch,

350
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,450
particularly with an orchestra,
but also for timber. Ah,

351
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,860
which is the property that distinguishes
maybe an oboe sound from a clarinet

352
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:17,020
sound. Of course, if
you're playing a piano,

353
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,483
then

354
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,490
you can't change the Tambour
of a single piano note.

355
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,430
But if you're playing it on a clarinet,

356
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:27,770
it's going to sound very different
than if you played on the trumpet.

357
00:21:27,771 --> 00:21:29,630
So you have to be able to balance tambors.

358
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,990
And I think before the downbeat
of the first rehearsal,

359
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:37,880
a conductor really has to have the sound
of the piece in his or her ear. So, so,

360
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,210
so I know what needs to be pulled out.
You know,

361
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:44,600
maybe the third clarinet is a little
bit sharp. So I say third clarinet,

362
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:46,730
your B flat makes sure
it doesn't sit too high.

363
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,030
So I think you have to have the piece
in your, in your head. There's a,

364
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,080
an old conductors mantra always had the
score in your head and not your head and,

365
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,450
well, okay, there are all kinds of
things I get asked you about their, uh,

366
00:21:58,451 --> 00:21:59,710
what are you going to do in New York?

367
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,770
You're the principal conducted and you're
doing two of the three pieces you're

368
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:07,750
doing the first half you're doing the
Mozart and the Brahms and then, uh,

369
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,480
Lauren Quigley will come out.
She couldn't be with us today,

370
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:13,000
but Lauren quickly we'll come
out and lead the debate over.

371
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,780
Are you going to try to conduct
any of this without a score?

372
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,050
And what advantages and disadvantages?

373
00:22:19,051 --> 00:22:22,820
Sometimes you go to concerts and
a reviewer might notice that. Um,

374
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,530
generally speaking, if you see a
conductor conducting without of score,

375
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:29,050
what does that indicate?
Well,

376
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:31,870
I think it's always impressive to the
ensemble when a conductor's able to

377
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:34,570
conduct without a score. Uh,
last year Helmut [inaudible],

378
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:36,130
who's a famous German conductor,

379
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,730
came and worked with some of the
ensembles and didn't Mendelssohn's Elijah,

380
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:43,060
which is a huge romantic oratorio
about two and a half hours long.

381
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,520
The dress rehearsal,
he came to the dress rehearsal,

382
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:49,570
put a score down on a music
stand, conducted for three
hours, never opened it.

383
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,990
We were like, wow, this
guy knows the score.

384
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:58,110
So my task is to try to get four and a
half minutes of Mozart into my head so I

385
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:03,640
don't have to open that score. We'll see
tomorrow if I'm able to do it. Um, yeah.

386
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:04,840
So that's sort of talent.

387
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:09,160
And so that's a kind of combination of a
photographic memory and a phono graphic

388
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:11,380
memory that you've got to,
you've got locked in there,

389
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:13,660
you can hear something just
once and it's locked in there.

390
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:18,100
That's the kind of thing Mozart could do
and we'll talk more about that later on.

391
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,950
Um,
and so your,

392
00:23:19,951 --> 00:23:24,820
your orchestra will respect you more
if you've got this all memorized. Uh,

393
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,060
what does it, what does it sort of
free you up to do that? Obviously,

394
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:30,250
if you've got,
if you're conducting without a score,

395
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,000
I think, I think at its, at its essence,

396
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,660
conducting is communicating to the people
in front of you and anything that you

397
00:23:37,661 --> 00:23:39,310
can get out of the way,
uh,

398
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,270
between you and the people who are
playing the music is, is an advantage.

399
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:44,980
So I think getting the
music stand out of the,

400
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,980
you're getting the score of the way.

401
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,620
Making sure that they're all times you
can actually see the people who are

402
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:52,550
making this music. I think anything you
can do to do that is an advantage. Yeah.

403
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,820
Great.
Um,

404
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,840
I want to go back to this question
though of ear because I think it's so

405
00:23:56,841 --> 00:24:00,800
critical. You were talking about the third
clarinet. Don't play too sharp. Well,

406
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:05,580
once again, I'd be sitting there
it who's playing what it's wrong.

407
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,100
Wondering. All right. Is it the oboes
maybe said the clarinet being sharp,

408
00:24:10,101 --> 00:24:13,950
the oboes flat. All I hear is a
problem. I don't know what, where,

409
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:16,640
what are the problem is. So, um, uh,

410
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,820
but so you would have to have
a pretty keen sense of pit.

411
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,690
Do you have what we call absolute pitch?
I don't have absolute pitch.

412
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:27,670
I had a pretty creative
relative. Okay. So, um,

413
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,050
I always enjoy playing
this particular game with,

414
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,030
with musicians and people generally where
we do an ear training drill and I need

415
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:40,190
somebody, uh, is it Michael?

416
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,090
I just need somebody to come up and
play the piano. And just for your bank,

417
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,980
some notes on a panel run.
Who, who uh, Daniel, you know,

418
00:24:46,981 --> 00:24:50,150
do you know your way around a keyboard?
You're, you're a guitar player. Sure.

419
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,460
Anybody play,
uh,

420
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:59,360
a gentlemen here? Come on
up. Yeah. Okay. Come on up.

421
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,800
And you know what? Yeah, so we're
going to be over here, um, uh, and um,

422
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,430
Adam come play this game also.
Linda,

423
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,180
you want to play this down?
You go in terms of of pitch.

424
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,950
You're name is Robert.
Yeah. Um, so, um, uh,

425
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,180
and, and Jacob, come on,
come on out here also, um,

426
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:24,750
play it started around Middle C and
we'll see if anybody can identify any.

427
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,090
Linda,
you don't want to play.

428
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,920
I'd like to have some ladies up here to
Santana when you come on up and play the

429
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:32,570
name,
that pitch game,

430
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,260
and we'll talk about absolute pitch and
we'll talk about relative pitch. So,

431
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,820
so play a note and we'll see how we do.

432
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:47,120
Oh, it's up to you. A note
that's a little lower.

433
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,873
Okay.

434
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,670
Does anyone think they
know what the note is? But,

435
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,980
but don't have anybody up here
think they know what it is,

436
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,590
I would guess, but, right.

437
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,350
Um, Bradley, you think
you know what it is? Yeah,

438
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:11,820
but I had two guesses in whichever
one I say is going to be wrong.

439
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:16,290
I think it's either g or a g sharp.
Uh, what, what do you guys think?

440
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:22,050
Okay. Okay. Um, notice
how cagey I am here.

441
00:26:22,051 --> 00:26:26,610
I haven't committed. Um, yeah.
Uh, but, but just at the outset,

442
00:26:26,611 --> 00:26:31,260
he played at initial pitch and then what
did he do? He dropped it down an optic.

443
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:35,460
Okay. So we think that that's, uh, that's
probably isn't a flat or a g sharp,

444
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,650
is that correct? Yep. Okay.

445
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,710
Now knowing that play another pitch.

446
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,010
Hmm. Go ahead, rob.

447
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,370
Anybody know what that is?

448
00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:00,250
Uh, so then the question is, why is
this guy teaching this course? Right?

449
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:03,810
Why is he in this profession
to begin with? Because,

450
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,290
because he's wrestled with this
issues and all his life is it, why me?

451
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,630
Why can't I do this?
And tried to figure it out.

452
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,450
Tried to try to use other
tricks too to get around this,

453
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:16,590
to overcome this handicap and
to hang around with musicians,

454
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:19,080
sort of explain things that they do,

455
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:23,940
that they take in sort of quickly and
intuitively that and sort of break them

456
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:26,640
down and explain what it is that
they're doing. So at this point,

457
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:29,640
Bradley seems not to be having
a trouble with that pitch.

458
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,560
I don't know what it is to be that.
I could, I could g no. All right.

459
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,360
All right. Uh, so I'm out, down, down.
I go. Um, but what was that pitch?

460
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:43,500
C sharp. Okay. Um, uh, all right,

461
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:46,760
so let's say now knowing that
that's a c sharp, let's see how far.

462
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,050
Let's go and we'll go a little
faster here. So we don't really,

463
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:50,020
we don't take up too much time.

464
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:51,763
Another person

465
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:58,340
who knows that Bradley Jacob,

466
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,240
we should have them write it on the board,

467
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,940
who doesn't know what it is.
Santana.

468
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,230
Anybody know who, what do you think it is?
What do you think it is? I'll go with t.

469
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,930
So I, but what, what, what
was it? Was it, did you, okay.

470
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:26,860
So it seems to me that actually Bradley
seems to be winning here. He's tea.

471
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:31,770
This is interesting. Uh, so maybe there
is a reason that he's the conductor here.

472
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:36,180
The rest of I'm out the rest of this or
are there kind of negotiating with each

473
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:40,380
other and maybe pegging off
of what Bradley was saying
there. So we'll stop this,

474
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,320
but, okay. Thanks guys.

475
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:50,510
Whenever I do here think,
well,

476
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:52,620
what song does that start?

477
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:58,030
Or is there a a quarter snorting
it? Which I'm committed. I know,

478
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,320
for instance, so do you mind if
I just, sure. Thanks very much.

479
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,470
So for instance,
that first note is a g sharp.

480
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:12,210
So I know that the first, uh, the
first Aria in Handel's Messiah

481
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,090
starts with a really prominent g
sharp and the melody. Yana kind of,

482
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,270
I kind of know how that sounds. So
that's how I figured that was a g sharp.

483
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,740
That's the second note he played was a
c sharp or d flat and there's this great

484
00:29:27,741 --> 00:29:28,580
for aps,

485
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,060
this great d flat.
So I kind of find a piece that I,

486
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,860
that I can latch onto
that's very interesting.

487
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:42,370
In all the years I've been
doing that, I, I haven't heard

488
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,770
that particular explanation for it.
You know,

489
00:29:44,771 --> 00:29:48,280
most people that have absolute pitch boom,
they hear it instantaneously.

490
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,160
There's someone in this room
also was absolute pitch,

491
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:55,000
but I don't want to go go into instances
of absolute pitch or about one in

492
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,380
10,000, one in 10,000 sort
of instantaneous recognition.

493
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,420
He's getting that,
but in a different way.

494
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:06,421
He must have some kind of absolute wreck
recollection of particular pieces that

495
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,170
are intentionally, um, impressed
on his oral memory somehow.

496
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,850
And he then plays off of those that,
that's an interesting way of doing it.

497
00:30:15,851 --> 00:30:19,240
But as I say, it's not something I've
encountered before. Ah, okay. Well,

498
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,710
so that's kind of important though.

499
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:23,110
You've got to have a good ear like that
to be able to tell these people your

500
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:23,681
sharp or flat.

501
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:27,850
Now let's say you're in the middle
of things and something goes wrong.

502
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:29,920
You Ha you have a sense that you're,

503
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,850
you know that your clarinet is a little
bit flat. W what do you, what do,

504
00:30:33,851 --> 00:30:37,870
you can't just hold up a sign or
an arrow going like this, can you,

505
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:39,070
or maybe maybe you can.

506
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:43,320
How do you get it in real time as the
pieces that you're conducting and the

507
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:44,500
pieces unfolding.

508
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,890
How do you get somebody to correct
something in terms of intonation?

509
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,580
I think that there's a difference
between what you're doing,

510
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:53,160
a rehearsal in what you're doing, a
performance and rehearsal. You'd say,

511
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:54,950
hold up the grants,

512
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,520
pause and saint clarinet three fix that
in a performance you hope that you have

513
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,290
inculcated in your performers a sense of,

514
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:05,550
of pitch and a sense of
what their function is.

515
00:31:05,551 --> 00:31:10,050
An accord so that if something's going
wrong, you just look at them and say, yes,

516
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:14,610
you know you're wrong. Fix it cause you
can't stop. You know the traffic cop.

517
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:17,790
If you don't look at the Subaru over here,
he's going to crash into a tree.

518
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:20,970
So you have to take care of everybody.
But the guy who's running the stop sign,

519
00:31:20,971 --> 00:31:22,440
you had to take care of that person first.

520
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,480
So, um, let me ask this.
Oftentimes you go to a concert,

521
00:31:27,481 --> 00:31:31,560
particularly, um, non professional
concerts at the end of a movement,

522
00:31:31,561 --> 00:31:35,550
they will stop and tune if
we hear in the Beethoven, uh,

523
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,540
the tuning between movements,
there's,

524
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:42,900
is that a sign that the intonation and
the previous movement wasn't all that it

525
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,734
might've been?

526
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,320
Hmm.
Um,

527
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:49,940
I think it's a bigger problem
with early instruments that are,

528
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,560
that are a little bit more temperamental.

529
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,130
But certainly if we stop in the middle
and you hear Gabriel Ellsworth give us a,

530
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,330
and we return, then yes. So

531
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,520
that, that would be a pig. No, I just had

532
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,293
no problem.

533
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,950
Okay. Um, uh,

534
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:18,980
so there are some things that you can
can do in real time and uh, things that,

535
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:23,180
uh, uh, that you just hope that
you prepared for pro properly,

536
00:32:23,181 --> 00:32:26,270
but keep an eye on that. Whether they,
whether they actually tuned between,

537
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:29,330
between movements though now I think we
have some other folks who are going to

538
00:32:29,331 --> 00:32:32,440
demonstrate some things here.
I think we have Katie, uh,

539
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:36,080
driving the v a viola player. The
principal. Okay. Katie, come on up.

540
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:40,250
And I don't know if Elana Kagan
is here or not. She here. Flutist.

541
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,920
Oh my mind.
Maybe she's sleeping in whole too bad.

542
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,930
I said I doubt it, but I don't think
so. I just don't know. I guess it,

543
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:55,310
I guess it's only, maybe, maybe it's
only five after. So we do have, let's,

544
00:32:55,311 --> 00:32:59,510
let's talk about the motor. We're
going, we've got this opening piece. Um,

545
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,190
uh, first of all, which piece of
the two frightens you the most?

546
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,640
You're the conductor. What
are you worried about? What,

547
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:10,880
what scares you when you
should step out there? Well,

548
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,080
what's easy about the Mozart?
Okay, no tempo changes. Fine.

549
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:18,080
So the whole piece is in this,
in the same tempo problem.

550
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,020
If you don't set the right tempo, you're
screwed for four and a half minutes.

551
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:25,130
When I do de de, De,
De, De, De, De, De, De,

552
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:29,210
I have to get that dead on so that the
whole ensemble knows exactly what the

553
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:33,320
tempo is. But okay, but look, let's say a
mess it up in the first couple of beats,

554
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:36,850
can't you correct it.
I think a,

555
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:40,310
a good critic as you will all be, would
say, well this is classical music,

556
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:43,910
mister nailer and there's nothing in the
score that says writ or a cello, Rondo.

557
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,890
So actually you should keep whatever tempo
is established at the beginning. Yeah.

558
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,030
So you're not tempted
to get out there and go

559
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,770
like that and know that, I'm always
impressed when conductors, they come out,

560
00:33:57,771 --> 00:34:01,400
they kind of look at the orchestra and
they go and they just start without much

561
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:05,300
in the way of preliminary beats. But
that's a, that's kind of risky isn't it?

562
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,820
But, uh, what am I conducting?
Teachers told me, you know,

563
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:13,520
there's no part in the score
that's labeled conductor,

564
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,490
so you shouldn't do anything other than
what's going to get the people in front

565
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:20,410
of you to play. So there's no point in
the beginning going one, two, three, four,

566
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,110
[inaudible] did an internet because then
you have a conductor solo for two bars

567
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:28,940
and it's not in the score. So,
um, so, uh, let's see. Katie,

568
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:32,360
come on up. And do we have a
stand for you? Did we not? Well,

569
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:37,160
I'm sure we got one inside here.
Similar. Linda maybe are, but no, no.

570
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,560
Um, well you brought one. Okay.

571
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,830
Get your standout because we've got
the beginning of the overture to, um,

572
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:49,570
uh, the marriage of Figaro here. Shall
we, should we play a CD of it or you have,

573
00:34:49,571 --> 00:34:52,940
maybe we could, let's talk about
Lindt. Well, I tell you what, well,

574
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:56,300
Katie's getting her stand.
I, let's talk about Linda.

575
00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:00,740
She's got a bassoon part here. What
happens at the beginning of this, uh,

576
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,140
Bradley in terms of,
of the texture.

577
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,970
Monophonic homophonic
polyphonic monophonic. Why?

578
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,690
Because all of the instrument,
there are many instruments playing,

579
00:35:11,691 --> 00:35:14,520
but they're all playing the same
line at the same time. Okay. So,

580
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,510
but isn't that a little bit awkward
because some of these instruments sort of

581
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:21,630
speak a lot faster than
other instruments? Uh, vast,

582
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:25,400
but what would the fast
speaking instruments, but
they could play very agilely.

583
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:28,760
What would they be? I think the violence
probably had the easiest time of this,

584
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,780
whereas the celli and the bassoon probably
have the toughest time of this cause

585
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:35,510
it takes lower instruments longer
for them to speak and make,

586
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,100
make their sounds so,
um,

587
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,620
the cellos and basses and the,

588
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:45,810
the low part of the woodwinds and might
have a difficult time here. So we, uh,

589
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:50,280
Linda has been good enough
to be a sacrificial lamb
for today and bring in her

590
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,600
bassoon. And she sent me an email
last night and say, oh, disaster,

591
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,670
I cracked my only good read and I'm
not gonna I'm not going to bring in,

592
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,990
I can't bring in my bassoon.
It just won't work. Does it?

593
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,040
Come on when I was really counting on
this. Please bring in your bassoon.

594
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,650
So here is,
here is uh,

595
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:11,840
Lynda with a broken reed and um,

596
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:17,840
hi, are you a lay in there? Okay, come
on up. Come on up. Great. But, so, um,

597
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:23,050
just come on up and take out your,
your flutes and we'll get out the,

598
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,960
the music here in just a second. So let's,
can we have the beginning of, of the, uh,

599
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:30,240
of the figure. Oh, do you want to
conduct this or, or no, heavens,

600
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:32,100
this is chamber music. I said, okay,

601
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,190
how about I give you a template
and then you guys go to town

602
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,830
and again, and again, I
think, I think Linda for,

603
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,000
for doing this because it's not,
it's not an ideal situation.

604
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,770
All right,
so here's the safe conservative tempo

605
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,770
about that editing, editing,
editing, not that bad.

606
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,800
One,
two,

607
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,223
the,

608
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:06,803
Huh,

609
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,143
cool.

610
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,500
Wonderful.

611
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,010
[inaudible]

612
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:26,890
great. The music one 12
orchestra. Um, now you said, well,

613
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:31,840
here's a conservative safe tempo,
but what,

614
00:37:31,841 --> 00:37:35,530
what, what happens if you don't
take a safe tempo? What, uh,

615
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:38,890
what kind of disasters might befall us?
Well,

616
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,890
I think in this case there
wouldn't be a disaster.

617
00:37:41,891 --> 00:37:46,510
It just wouldn't go as fast as I had set
up. So, uh, I have a recording of, um,

618
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,470
I think it's James Leviathan and the
metropolitan opera opera orchestra,

619
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,040
highest paid orchestra in the country.
And they take this at a blistering tempo.

620
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,993
Yeah,

621
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,820
really fast. Yeah. Let's
see how close we can get.

622
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,670
Uh,
how fast you can take something.

623
00:38:07,671 --> 00:38:12,620
Sometimes is conditioned by the
acoustical environment that you're in.

624
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:17,150
And maybe we'll come back to that about
the acoustics of Patel a little bit,

625
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:22,070
a little bit later on.
Um, now, uh, let's see.

626
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:26,660
Katie, you're a violist and
um, you're the principal.

627
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,310
Violist.
Then I wanted to ask you,

628
00:38:28,311 --> 00:38:32,870
your job is to kind of ride roughshod
over the rest of the violas here.

629
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:36,310
Um, and how do you do,
isn't it like hurting

630
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,260
rattlesnakes or something like that hat?

631
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,210
Supposing you want to get your section
to be really precise and really exact and

632
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:46,630
all those boats going up and down at the
same time. The articulation, exactly.

633
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:51,520
Exactly the way they should be. Uh,
how do you go? You lead by example,

634
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:55,720
but in the actual performance,
how do you keep your, your,

635
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:58,210
the rest of those deal with you?
The principle,

636
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:01,760
oh, well, you have to be very
confident about what your plan,

637
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,650
you can change your mind. So you need
to know what you need to come in,

638
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:07,750
what you knew,

639
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:12,380
which direction your go in and
show that when you're playing

640
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,650
just by being confident.

641
00:39:15,651 --> 00:39:19,250
And so then the rest of the people
who know that part's very well. Um,

642
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,550
but well can call you if they get
off and we'll have that little bit of

643
00:39:22,551 --> 00:39:23,520
assurance come in.

644
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,160
Great. How do we know that they
know their parts really well?

645
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:30,010
What would you imagine might be a tip off?
And you're,

646
00:39:30,011 --> 00:39:33,160
you're at a concert and you're watching,
you're looking what's going look,

647
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,520
what would it be a tip off to? Maybe
they don't know their parts really well.

648
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,060
They're sitting there with their nose
in the music rather than watching the

649
00:39:44,061 --> 00:39:48,200
conductor. The more the
orchestra is watching the
conductor for the cues and the

650
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:50,510
interpretation, the more that says, Hey,

651
00:39:50,511 --> 00:39:54,370
they've really got this almost committed
to memory. Uh, and they can get in.

652
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:58,580
They can get beyond the notes into
the question of interpretation there.

653
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,860
Another thing is just a
very basic thing is the,

654
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,570
Katie has mentioned here is watching,

655
00:40:02,571 --> 00:40:07,160
she wants to have very prominent bro
boasts strokes. I guess so that everybody,

656
00:40:07,161 --> 00:40:09,580
the whole section will
be in sync if you see,

657
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,930
see this kind of thing in
terms of the bowl movement,

658
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,590
maybe the articulation really isn't
altogether there. They should, all,

659
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,710
each of these sections should be going
there pretty much the same way it was

660
00:40:18,711 --> 00:40:19,790
that, right? Yeah.

661
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:23,880
And particularly with the
string instruments, there's
a different sound with the

662
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,190
okay.

663
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:29,270
Up Is it in term as opposed to a down bow.
So an oppose,

664
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,480
we'll start very small at down,
but you can start very

665
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:36,750
gruffly. So it does make a
difference. So, um, uh, uh, Katie,

666
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:41,340
let me ask you this. Generally speaking,
all don't have solos in the repertoire,

667
00:40:41,341 --> 00:40:44,700
so what's the hardest thing for
you to play there Saturday night?

668
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,230
What scares you?

669
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:51,560
Here's me. Wow. Like you
said, we don't have solos,

670
00:40:51,561 --> 00:40:56,561
but we are very important to me that we
of the upper and the lower strings and

671
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,600
other parts are together.
Um,

672
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,940
and I think other perceptions get used
to hearing us play certain parts and when

673
00:41:04,941 --> 00:41:05,774
we're not there.

674
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,313
Yeah.

675
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:11,110
That's not only true for
violist. Yeah, pretty much.

676
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,520
Yeah.
That's a good point.

677
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:16,270
You're kind of like the glue
and particularly I would
imagine rhythmically is

678
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:17,051
the,
if you,

679
00:41:17,051 --> 00:41:20,710
you might be setting really setting the
tempo when these other extreme high,

680
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:24,610
lower play them off of the rhythmic
tempo that you're setting, setting,

681
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:27,160
they're in the middle.
What's the most different?

682
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:31,420
Is there any moment that you sort of get
to soar with some music that you like

683
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:35,120
particularly what, what's your favorite
moment? Most beautiful moment for you?

684
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,850
Can you play a little that rolling.
Okay.

685
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:42,000
Um,
and the apartment or we have the melody.

686
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,533
Uh Huh.

687
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:47,983
Okay.

688
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,290
And that's kind of fun.

689
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:31,930
Yeah.

690
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:35,290
Well I guess it's like maybe the right
guard of the left guard on a football

691
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:36,550
team.
Nobody ever notices,

692
00:42:36,551 --> 00:42:41,350
but to actually crucial to the overall
running of this operation. Um, okay.

693
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,050
Now we have also with this,
uh, thank you Katie. Be also,

694
00:42:44,051 --> 00:42:49,051
we have with this the principal flutist
right to Elena Kagan and you've got some

695
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,580
heavy duty exposure,

696
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:56,410
particularly in the Beethoven
second movement with all
of those solos there. Uh,

697
00:42:56,411 --> 00:42:59,410
so here's a question for a Katie with,
excuse me,

698
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:03,430
Elena w with the Solos that you have
to play. Do you ever get nervous?

699
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:07,370
Of course, definitely. I mean,

700
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,840
when you really have a solo on your
fingers and you don't have to be nervous,

701
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:15,410
it makes it even more fun and you can
always play better when you're not so

702
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:19,100
focused on that. So I certainly
try to get beyond being nervous.

703
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,670
But then that's definitely there.
And the trickier it is,

704
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,230
the more nervous I get.

705
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,990
Well what happens to the
playing when you get nervous?

706
00:43:26,991 --> 00:43:30,880
How can we recognize that
you're nervous or you can't?

707
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:36,800
But I mean a lot of times messing
up is a sign of being nervous.

708
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:40,520
Is there a lot of players who will get
it right every time and rehearsal and

709
00:43:40,521 --> 00:43:41,900
then just the nerves of the concert?

710
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:45,850
Yeah, that was me. I always said I was
the world's greatest warm up pianist

711
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,980
and then you get to the moment you have
to play and nerves kick in the, you know,

712
00:43:50,981 --> 00:43:53,540
just his little fractions of
inches on these instruments.

713
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:56,230
The question of life and death.
So if your,

714
00:43:56,231 --> 00:43:58,930
if your head is it all quivering and
can imagine a little violin, they,

715
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:03,130
I did you get this huge vibrato or,
so where did this come from? Um, okay.

716
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:08,040
So let's, uh, let's, um, uh,
he or if we, if we may, Ilana,

717
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:12,940
some of the, um, the lovely,
lovely imitations of bird calls,

718
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:16,850
they're in the second movement
of the Beethoven. Um, what would,

719
00:44:16,851 --> 00:44:21,160
what would be good for you to, um, to
play, choose anything that you like?

720
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:26,670
So this is Beethoven second
movement theme and variations and,

721
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:31,743
okay.

722
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:38,030
Well there's, if there's one part at the
end that definitely sounds like, okay,

723
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:43,390
you have the interesting,
I guess a duet with declare an end that,

724
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,780
that sort of thing. Or is that
what you're talking about? The end.

725
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,640
There's a lot of intricacies
between the hope,

726
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:51,200
the wind instruments having conversations.
Um,

727
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,830
so I can play a couple of those parts.

728
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:29,523
Yeah.

729
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:34,860
You'll hear lots of cascading
other woodwinds they choose
me is really just said

730
00:45:34,861 --> 00:45:39,440
with the oboe and the Clearnet sort
of dialoguing against this, um,

731
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:43,500
intonation here.
Do you guys practice this individually?

732
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:47,220
Do you have what we would call sectionals
where you get together and work this

733
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:49,470
out or you only do this
with the full orchestra?

734
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:54,590
Well, we actually haven't had
analysis. That's certainly very common

735
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,040
to have sectionals to work it out.

736
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:03,080
But this semester we mostly just worked
on it on our own and as a full orchestra.

737
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:03,920
Uh Huh.

738
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,760
Um, one the one thing
instruments are out of tune.

739
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,010
Is it that the Bradley,
what do you think?

740
00:46:10,011 --> 00:46:12,470
Is it often the woodwinds
that get out of tune?

741
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:18,580
Um, I think that, uh, you know, I
don't want to lay blame or it's not do,

742
00:46:18,581 --> 00:46:22,540
but I think that sometimes it's easier
for instruments that you can press down

743
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:26,320
to key and no more or less the right
support, what note is going to come out.

744
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,140
But if you have a string
instrument with no frets,

745
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,890
like a guitar has frets on its fingerboard
but violence and all the string

746
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:37,120
family don't. So that's a little bit
more guesswork. So it's really difficult,

747
00:46:37,121 --> 00:46:41,260
especially in fast passage work like
Katie was playing earlier to get a uniform

748
00:46:41,261 --> 00:46:42,680
intonation across the section.

749
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:46,880
So we have really only about two more
minutes left and I'd like to make the

750
00:46:46,881 --> 00:46:47,714
following point.

751
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,540
One of the things you should be on the
look out for is balance over there and

752
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:54,110
what the French horns are doing because
this is a really exposed instrument and

753
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:57,290
they're probably going to be up there
on risers and that sound tends to Blair

754
00:46:57,291 --> 00:47:01,250
fourth and in Patel. So keep an eye out
for the French horns. They're really,

755
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,890
really be exposed.
Um,

756
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,000
I have one other line of development here,
but I want it before we go.

757
00:47:08,001 --> 00:47:11,840
Does anybody out there have a question
that you would like to ask Bradley or

758
00:47:11,841 --> 00:47:13,100
Katie or Allana?

759
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:14,520
Yeah.

760
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,810
All right, let me, uh, ask, asked them
this question. Where should we sit?

761
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:22,890
What are the acoustical
issues involved in Battelle?

762
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:26,610
Do we want to sit so we can see? And
that's not bad. You might say, Hey,

763
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:30,610
well I'll get way up in the front as
far as I can and watch this in this

764
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,050
intricate orchestra, this great grand
machine firing on all cylinders,

765
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:38,170
cylinders here, or do I want
to go all the way to the back?

766
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,310
And maybe just push away the
visual and just enjoy the sale.

767
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:44,020
Because oftentimes in concert halls,

768
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,960
the best sound is not a front
sailing sailing right over your head.

769
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:50,350
It's coalescing in the back of the hall.
So where should we sit?

770
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:53,320
Well,
my favorite place to sit in concerts,

771
00:47:53,321 --> 00:47:57,760
so somewhere where I can
see that interaction between
the different, I guess,

772
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:01,450
gears in the machine as well. Um, so, uh,

773
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,870
I would sit somewhere not
directly behind the conductor.

774
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,540
So somewhere where you can see the
players because they're the ones actually

775
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:09,180
making the music.
Yeah.

776
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,730
So if you want to go second balcony
all the way down as far as you can go,

777
00:48:12,731 --> 00:48:15,190
you can actually get up
in front of the conductor.

778
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,020
You can be almost being the
orchestra that way. Now,

779
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:21,340
what about the acoustic last issue
here? The Acoustics in Patel, are they,

780
00:48:21,341 --> 00:48:22,780
are they pretty good,
favorable?

781
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,220
Well,
it doesn't matter.

782
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,520
Do you have trouble hearing while they're
certainly different than the runway

783
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,910
practicing?
Um,

784
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,600
which is why we have a dress rehearsal
so that we can adjust our sound according

785
00:48:37,601 --> 00:48:40,600
to the acoustics of the room
that we're playing in. Um,

786
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:45,780
but I think, uh, Patel is a lot
more live, meaning that, um,

787
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:49,230
the sound sort of like live as long.

788
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:54,360
Yeah. It's resonance. It has a very long
reverberation cycle. How do we cut down?

789
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,160
How can you help the orchestra?

790
00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:00,570
What would you guess what would be the
best way you can help the orchestra to

791
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:04,590
bring clarity to their sale and
actually allow them to play faster,

792
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,900
get that tempo with the
Mozart to go faster.

793
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,240
If you've got a wall more
verberations cycle, little hall,

794
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:12,870
your tempo will go slower.
What can you do to help out here now?

795
00:49:12,871 --> 00:49:16,770
That 40 and thing, what
would you do? Wear a sweater.

796
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,880
Bring a teddy bear. Bring your friend,
bring your mother, grandmother.

797
00:49:20,881 --> 00:49:22,140
Bring as many people.

798
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:26,370
Get as many sound absorbing bodies
in there as you possibly can.

799
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:30,690
So we'll see you then Saturday night,
eight o'clock and thanks to our guests.

800
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:34,360
Okay.
