1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,120
Okay.
Good morning.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,390
Over the weekend you were
assigned material from
chapter one of the text and it

3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:14,001
dealt really with three famous
beginnings of pieces of classical music.

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,680
Somebody tell me at the outset,
what were those three famous pieces?

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,660
Young lady down here.
Okay.

6
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:28,420
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
What was the second one?

7
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,503
Uh,

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,880
yeah, I a piano concerto number one
of Tchaikovsky and the third one?

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,610
Yeah. This piece by Ricard Strauss
with this funny sounding German name,

10
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:44,940
we'll just call it Zuora through
struck this profit Zahra through steps.

11
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:49,941
Those were the three pieces and the
issues there had to do with musical genre

12
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:54,390
that we're going to talk a little
bit more about in a moment and the

13
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:56,700
instruments,
the instruments,

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,590
and you went ahead and worked
with listening exercises
nine through 11 to engage

15
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:06,000
the musical instruments, um, a
bit in those particular exercises.

16
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:09,030
And we have performers here today
that are going to, as you can see,

17
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,870
a demonstrate some of these
instruments instruments for us.

18
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,130
Let's make one point
very clear at the outset.

19
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,580
Oftentimes I get student papers that
refer to Beethoven's fifth song or

20
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:27,910
Tchaikovsky's First Piano Song.
Is that right? Now that's not,

21
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,840
that's not good at all. Uh,
are these songs well, what,

22
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,740
what do you have to have
to make something, a song,

23
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,310
lyrics.
You got to have a text.

24
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,240
So we don't have in
80% of classical music.

25
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,530
We don't have lyrics. We don't have a
tech. Well, yes with opera of course,

26
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:51,400
but the other 80% is
purely instrumental music.

27
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:55,420
It works its magic again,
through purely instrumental means.

28
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:58,720
So we can't really call those songs.
And this puzzle me,

29
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,670
one day I was sitting there at iTunes
and I wanted to buy an interior movement

30
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:06,390
of a Mozart serenade.
Ah,

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,400
so I was all set to purchase
this and it said by song,

32
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,310
boom,
that told me the answer.

33
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:20,311
That's where this terminology comes into
play because on iTunes we buy songs.

34
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,680
It could be purely instrumental,
but it's called by a soul.

35
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,730
But we don't want to use that sort
of parlance. We want to be more,

36
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,050
a bit more sophisticated than that,
if you will, and use other terms.

37
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,050
So we'll we'll talk generally
about Beethoven's composition
or Beethoven's piece

38
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,730
or Beethoven's work or his
masterwork or chef do for raw,

39
00:02:40,731 --> 00:02:42,850
however fancy you want to get with it.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We could also go on and be a little
more precise and say it belongs to a

41
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:52,390
particular genre.
We could use the name of the genre,

42
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,410
and I'll be talking a lot about the genre
in this course is your aura is simply

43
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,530
a fancy word for type or so what
genre of peace is this by Beethoven?

44
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:08,470
Well, it's a symphony.
Symphonies. Have four movements,

45
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,460
have four movements.
What's a movement? Well,

46
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:15,850
a movement is simply an
independent piece that works.

47
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,470
Oftentimes if they're multiple movements
in the symphony or concerto worked with

48
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:24,160
other movements, they are independent,
yet they are complimentary.

49
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,990
Think of,
for example,

50
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:29,680
a sculpture garden you might have
for independent sculptures in there,

51
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,810
but they relate one to another.

52
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,670
They make some sort of
special since one to another.

53
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,170
So symphonies have these four movements
and they usually operate in the

54
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:45,160
following way, a fast
opening movement, a slower,

55
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,170
more lyrical second movement.

56
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,700
Then a third movement that's derived from
the dance. And then a fourth movement,

57
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,740
fourth movement. That's sort of, again,
uptempo, fast in phatic conclusion.

58
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,100
Uh,
let's see how these play out.

59
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:04,690
Let's see how these play out by means
of a quick review of Beethoven's Fifth

60
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:06,790
Symphony. So all we're
going to do here, Linda,

61
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,280
is going to go from the beginning
of the track for the first movement,

62
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,400
the second movement and so on. And
uh, well let's just start here.

63
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,280
Let's just by way of,
of refreshing our memory,

64
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:20,230
the beginning of
Beethoven's fifth symphony.

65
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,533
Okay,

66
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,440
pause it there. And as we
said last time, it operates

67
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,970
in that fashion and that beginning
gives us a good opportunity to make a

68
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:54,400
distinction between two types of melody,

69
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:58,660
between this idea of a motive and a theme.

70
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,740
Both are sort of subsets of
melody. If you, uh, if you will,

71
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,650
uh,
as I say in the textbook there,

72
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,420
the beginning of the Beethoven fifth is
something like a musical punch in the

73
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:13,710
nose, right? Bought out at,
I'm sort of grabbing you
here, hitting you in the face,

74
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,900
whatever. Musically, it's
not a very long idea.

75
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,910
How many notes is in this opening
gambit here? How many pictures for Bop,

76
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:26,320
bop, Bop, bop, short, short,
short, long. Okay, so that's
a classic example of a motive.

77
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:29,350
A motive is just a little salad Europe,
out of which the composure,

78
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,630
we'll build other musical material.

79
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,910
Now let's contrast that with what happens
in the second movement of Beethoven's

80
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:41,110
Fifth Symphony where we
have a lyrical long flowing

81
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,610
theme.
Okay?

82
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,880
Okay, we'll stop there. All right, so
that went on. If we heard the whole thing,

83
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:09,020
it actually goes on for 32
notes as opposed to just for,

84
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,740
so motive versus longer themes,
themes,

85
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:17,300
10 maybe a little bit more lyrical.
Now let's go onto the third movement.

86
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:21,230
We said the third movement was danced
derived, but in this case with Beethoven,

87
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:24,570
it's a very strange dance.
If it is dance derive,

88
00:06:24,571 --> 00:06:27,590
it's just a little bit different
than most of these third movements,

89
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:32,480
but less listen to it anyway, because I'd
like you to, when the brass is, come in,

90
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:36,620
think about what you're hearing and think
about that. Visa VI the first movement.

91
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,240
So let's hear the third movement now.

92
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,713
Yeah.

93
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:14,690
[inaudible]

94
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,560
okay, so what happened there
when the brasses came in?

95
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,520
How did that relate to the first movement?
Yes.

96
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:27,200
For notes, something as simple
as that, that the t, t, t,
t, t, t, same rhythmic ideas.

97
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,280
So that's usually the motive there and
that's how these movements are tied

98
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:32,530
together a little bit.
Let's go on to the finale now.

99
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,360
And as we listened to the finale,

100
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:38,170
let's think about what we heard at the
very beginning and talked about last time

101
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,690
that the mood that the beginning of
the fifth symphony created for it.

102
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:47,860
We had these adjectives up, your
negative, anxious, unsettled.

103
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,430
Well how do we feel now
about the finale and why

104
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:56,670
[inaudible]

105
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,670
you just turn the volume down
a little bit as we go down. Uh,

106
00:08:27,671 --> 00:08:32,290
so why do we feel differently about that?
I think we do. What do we feel there?

107
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:36,340
Well, sort of upbeat, positive,
what's turned all of this around?

108
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,750
What specifically? Well with the first
movement, we said he's generally going

109
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,830
that kind of idea,
but now it's,

110
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,710
and we'll explore this when we get to
harmony, this idea of major and minors,

111
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:54,940
that's

112
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,430
a,
from the dark

113
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,030
minor to the brighter major.
We were going down in the first movement.

114
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:00,864
Now we will,

115
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,030
it's going up and instead of
having just the violins playing,

116
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,690
we have the trumpets,
the heroic trumpets.

117
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,050
So it sounds very triumphant,
very triumphant.

118
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:18,310
So in this 40 minute interval we've gone
sort of through an emotional musical

119
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,800
journey here from despair,
despondency,

120
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:25,270
uncertainty to whatever to personal trial
and in a way that mirrors some of the

121
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:29,860
things that were going on
in Beethoven's life. Okay.

122
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,560
Let's go on to talk
about the second piece.

123
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,140
We're finished with this idea of
the genre of the four movement.

124
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:39,520
The symphony go on to talk about the
piano concerto concertos are generally in

125
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:43,030
three movements.
So the concerto is another genre.

126
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,830
It's a genre in which a soloist will
confront the orchestra and there'll be a

127
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:49,000
kind of give and take,

128
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,900
a spirited give and take between the two.

129
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,500
So now we are going to listen to it.

130
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:59,260
The beginning of the first movement
of Jakafi Skis, a piano concerto.

131
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,200
You've worked with this already,
so you're a little bit familiar with it.

132
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,410
And at the outset here,
I have two questions for you.

133
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,280
Is the beginning here played,
uh,

134
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,120
played by the brasses are the strings,
in other words,

135
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,650
what are the woodwinds,

136
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:19,540
what family of instruments is playing
here and his Tchaikovsky using a motive?

137
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:23,500
Or is he using a theme at the
very beginning of this concerto?

138
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,733
Okay,

139
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,740
Linda,
just off a little bit.

140
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,700
[inaudible]

141
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,400
yeah, please. Let's do that again so we
can hear the, you're at the beginning.

142
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,160
So what about that theme or motive
at the beginning? Moda. All right,

143
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:07,900
so here it was, I think, how
many notes in our motive?

144
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,940
Same as in the Beethoven. What,
why isn't it the say? Well,

145
00:11:12,941 --> 00:11:17,000
we got a skippy Beethoven, uh, here,

146
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:19,460
which a Kowski is coming
down just straight down,

147
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,740
down a consecutive intervals
there for the most part.

148
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,920
And both of them are however minor

149
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,910
with the checkoff ski. They,
all the, the intervals of the,

150
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,590
the durations of the same. The Bop,
Bop beep up, up, up, up with the,

151
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,010
with the Beethoven tee, tee,
tee, tee, short, short, short,
long. So Schakowsky is keys.

152
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:46,340
Uh, a little bit more neutral
in terms of the rhythm. Okay.

153
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,720
So then we go on and the piano
enters. Oh, what is the panel doing?

154
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:53,200
So let's hear the piano come in
just a bit. Just play bit. Yeah.

155
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,443
More.

156
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,820
Okay, let's stop here. So
what's the piano up to? Well,

157
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,340
the piano is Jeff playing chords,

158
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,490
playing them in octave.
Six sessions.

159
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,040
And we'll talk about that
a little bit more too.

160
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,520
So why don't we have here
in this next section?

161
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,800
Do we have a theme or do we have a motive?

162
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,220
And which are the violins
play? Are they, uh,

163
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,960
do they have the theme or the motive
or does the piano have the theme or the

164
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:29,860
motive?
Let's listen.

165
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,870
Okay. So let's, let's stop it
there. Uh, so was what the,

166
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:14,730
what were the violins play theme or
motive? See, what was the piano doing?

167
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,830
Yeah,
just the same course.

168
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,550
Yadidi Bop,

169
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,700
bop, bop, bop,

170
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:35,210
bop, bop, bop, bop,

171
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,960
fashion.
I'm singing the melody.

172
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,740
They're playing a chordal
accompaniment against it. All right,

173
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,970
let's listen to the next
iteration of this team.

174
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:48,910
We've identified this as a theme.
Who's got the theme now?

175
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,750
Is it exactly the same and what are
the strings up to in terms of string

176
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:53,650
technique here?

177
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,230
Just pause it.
Sit

178
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,820
there. So, uh, who had
the theme cattle now,

179
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,280
but was it exactly the same?
Not really.

180
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:33,550
It's kind of noodling around
with a varying, a little bit.

181
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,080
What were the strings doing?

182
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,220
They were playing the accompaniment and
what string technique where they use it.

183
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,550
I think we mentioned that in the
first chapter of the book there. Yep.

184
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,700
You've got it nice and loud
please. Pitsa Kata. Good. Okay.

185
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,820
Pizzicato we could write that. We
write that as a term of, yeah. Okay.

186
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:53,010
We've got it up there. PITSA
Cup. That's a help. Um, so the,

187
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,980
in that particular case, we've
switched the roles around. Let's,

188
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:00,620
um,
let's go ahead and do two to 10.

189
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:03,470
We're going to move this along
just a little bit here. Uh,

190
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,210
as we come back into this,
I think we've got a situation where the,

191
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,160
the piano keeps playing the four note
modals and keep building it up for tension

192
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:16,910
and there's a cascade and then the theme
comes back. Let's see what happens here.

193
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,150
Just the motive. One,
two, three, four. Okay.

194
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,790
Okay.

195
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,600
All right. So that's an
introduction to a three movement.

196
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:59,160
Piano Concerto happens to be the first
of the three movements and it's pretty

197
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:02,040
spectacular music. I hope you
liked that music. It's one of the,

198
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,990
one of the great melodies of all time.
It's a, it's a wonderful example of the,

199
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,130
of a theme.

200
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,270
Having talked just a
little bit about genres,

201
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,870
we could conclude by saying there are
other kinds of genres in music. Of course,

202
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,490
we're a, we've been introduced
to this idea of the tone poem.

203
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:25,140
The Strauss Zahra through Straw is a
tone poem that's a kind of one movement

204
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,260
work in which the composure tries to
tell a story or play out in an historic

205
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:33,510
event or in the case of the Strauss,

206
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:37,560
I guess to give us the beginning of
the contents of a philosophical novel

207
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,020
through music.
So tone poems or one movement.

208
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,870
And we have got other kinds of
genres and music. We've got opera,

209
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:47,460
we've got cantatas, Sonatas,
ballets, things such as this.

210
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:49,140
And we'll get to each of those in turn.

211
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,050
So that's the end of
the discussion of genre.

212
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,550
Let's go on now to talk about instruments
and how instruments produce sound.

213
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,660
Eva Heater. Come on up. This is
my friend, longtime colleague,

214
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,290
Music Library and extraordinary and
professional French horn player,

215
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,730
eva heater who will demonstrate here.
Come on over here. Right in the center.

216
00:17:08,731 --> 00:17:13,040
Jeanne Kimble is in the basement
somewhere recording all of this. Oh yes.

217
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:17,400
Very excited to hear what a time
to be alive, Huh? Yeah. Um, so, uh,

218
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:22,470
Eva's going to just demonstrate
the physical process of
playing the French horn.

219
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:29,200
The Horn obviously is a brass instrument
and what makes the sound is a vibrating

220
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:31,510
column of air.
In this case,

221
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,130
the basic column or there is 12 and a
half feet long and there's something

222
00:17:36,131 --> 00:17:39,890
called partials or the harmonic
series that happens in,

223
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,660
in anything with a screening or whatever.
But on the horn,

224
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,710
it's very distinct and that's what makes
the different most let me demonstrate

225
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:48,910
to the harmonic series.

226
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:55,600
Uh, uh, uh,

227
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,570
no I didn't use no hands.

228
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,390
That was just the notes that are naturally
on the 12 and a half foot of length

229
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,920
of vibrating air. That's, those are the,

230
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,280
that's the harmonic series that's on that.

231
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,760
And what the balance do is they shorten
and lengthen that librarian column of

232
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,290
air. Very much like a cello street
on think of board. You know,

233
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,930
the cellist is always shortening
and lengthening the uh,

234
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,970
the strings on doing the same thing.

235
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,380
I'm just doing it with a series of
switches instead of a finger one,

236
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,280
which we obviously don't have. Um, okay.

237
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,450
That's fine. That's great.
That's, that's the principal.

238
00:18:46,451 --> 00:18:50,050
And when she says she overblowing what
that means is we'll keep emphasizing this

239
00:18:50,051 --> 00:18:52,000
point today that uh,

240
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:56,410
and these partials that wins a sound
is made. You have not just one sound,

241
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:01,530
but that tube is dividing it up into
sections and all kinds of little sections

242
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,140
of that one. The tube are sounding
not just the biggest sound,

243
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,570
but the partials or the overtones,

244
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,640
the heart of the sea intervals
in the harmonic series. So,
uh, it's a whole series.

245
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,740
When we listened to a single tone,
it's a whole series.

246
00:19:14,741 --> 00:19:18,640
And what ava was doing there is
playing out the notes in that series

247
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,340
successively. We'll keep
banging on that. Now,

248
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,350
if you would have a play
just the beginning of the
Zuora through stroke where

249
00:19:26,351 --> 00:19:28,660
the trumpet part, can you
do that? Oh Man. What is it?

250
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,320
Well, whatever key you're in, what,
what a key are you in? What can,

251
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,670
would you like me to be in?
Well, could you, could we do see?

252
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,930
Oh,

253
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,873
okay.

254
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:58,860
Uh,
uh

255
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,153
hmm.

256
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,500
Okay.

257
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,370
That's nice that, that's
an, that's another note.

258
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,580
Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay.

259
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,450
Ava has another, yeah, another

260
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,700
gig out in Guilford said this morning.

261
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:34,020
So she's going to to run off and I'm
going to show you maybe if we can get our

262
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:37,000
slides up, is this overtone
series stuff. Okay. Okay.

263
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:41,700
It's a mathematical thing too,
which I hope I've got it on the slides.

264
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,030
Gentlemen, can you, I'm going
to hit what I was told to do.

265
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,740
Function F eight.
Is that right?

266
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,230
Yeah.

267
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,450
Ha. All right. Something came up and
then disappeared. All right, so come,

268
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:58,680
may I have a technical person
please bring press it one more time.

269
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,553
Uh,
eight.

270
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,500
Okay, so we don't have we done. All
right, so let's, I tell you what,

271
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,560
we're going to just leave this
up and I will bag the other slot.

272
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,320
I have slides with all
this information on it,

273
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:19,060
but we can't seem to bring these up. Uh,
what we've got here is the following,

274
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:24,061
this idea of partials and ava was
talking about with ratios two to one,

275
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:28,540
three to, to four to three, five
to four, six to five and so on.

276
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,960
And the point here is that the way
we differentiate between instruments,

277
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,600
anybody tell me this?
Why are you telling me this?

278
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:40,630
It's always better when students answer.
Why does a trumpet,

279
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:42,910
if I ask a trumpet to play this Pete p

280
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,830
a trumpet played it,
then I ask an oboe to play it.

281
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,220
The sound would be very different.
Why is that the case?

282
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,010
Gentlemen here,
different overtones,

283
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,370
well actually they all have
the same overtones in a way,

284
00:21:59,371 --> 00:22:03,630
the same frequencies with sound,
but you've got it a 99% of it.

285
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,860
It's which partials are
particularly prominent,

286
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:11,700
have extra punch or extra
volume to it. Is it the, the,

287
00:22:11,701 --> 00:22:16,650
the oboe may have the seventh partial,
very strong and the third partial,

288
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:19,680
very strong. Whereas the trumpet, I'm
just making all of this up. Of course,

289
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,250
the trumpet may have the second partial
on the fourth partial and the six

290
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:25,110
partial,
so it's,

291
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,640
which of these partials are sounding
within each of these instruments and the

292
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,950
physical properties of each of
these instruments are different.

293
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,940
It's the particular blend.
Here's a really dumb analogy.

294
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,180
Any Scotch drinkers in here? No, of course
not. You're way too young to do that,

295
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:42,300
but think about a blended scotch. You
know, you'll get a little of this little,

296
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:46,440
this little of this and it makes up about
whatever it is that you end up with a

297
00:22:46,441 --> 00:22:48,990
particular recipe for that liquid.
Well,

298
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:53,991
we have a particular recipe
for instrumental Tambre
or instrumental color and

299
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,900
it's the intensity of the overtones
with or partials within each particular

300
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:02,940
instrument that creates that.
Okay.

301
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,800
Now we're going to go on and talk about
a woodwind instrument here. So Linda,

302
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:11,550
come on up. Linda is is a best
soonest. Uh, she's also a,

303
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:15,030
this is Linda Paul who will be our,
one of our principal tas here.

304
00:23:15,031 --> 00:23:17,850
She is a phd candidate in
the Department of music.

305
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:21,000
Just passed your qualifying
exam with flying colors.

306
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:24,150
So here she is to demonstrate
the bassoon for us.

307
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,030
Lowest member of the woodwind family.

308
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,080
All right,
so you have,

309
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,870
you read in the book that the
decision is a double reed instrument.

310
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,320
And so just to show you what that
looks like, you've probably seen it,

311
00:23:36,321 --> 00:23:40,610
but if you haven't, two pieces
of wood vibrate together.
When I blow through them,

312
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,980
always a

313
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,990
check it up before I play in her notes.

314
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,360
And as you will probably suspect
by the link to the bassoon,

315
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,070
it can play very loaded.

316
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,690
And if I put a little rag in the top,

317
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:04,690
I can get it even a little bit lower
than that. You didn't bring one,

318
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:10,030
but actually amazingly, it's
a very versatile and can
also play very high notes.

319
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,150
As you can see,
there are a lot of keys on it.

320
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,870
There are nine keys for
my left thumb alone,

321
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,890
so I'm kind of switching between these
on the back here and many others.

322
00:24:20,891 --> 00:24:24,340
And because of that I can do very
high and I'll just demonstrate that.

323
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,113
Okay,

324
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,740
so that's just to give you a sense
of the range because of this sort of

325
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,860
particular character of the city sound,

326
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:53,370
it's often used to play sort of funny
little low note characters in the

327
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:54,570
orchestra.
For example,

328
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:57,760
if you're familiar with Peter and the
wolf and be different instruments play

329
00:24:57,761 --> 00:25:00,750
different characters.
The bassoon is the grandfather?

330
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,430
Nope.
Nope.

331
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,033
Cool.

332
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,810
Okay, great. Thanks

333
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,280
that. That's really fun.
Now Jacob Adams is going,

334
00:25:30,281 --> 00:25:34,650
is a professional a violist here in new
haven? What's the name of your core tet?

335
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,860
Jacob does VINCA string quartet,
so keep an eye out for them.

336
00:25:38,861 --> 00:25:43,260
They're based here in new haven. She'll
come on out, Jacob and um, uh, let,

337
00:25:43,261 --> 00:25:45,160
oh he is a violist,
not a violinist,

338
00:25:45,161 --> 00:25:47,410
but the principle here
is pretty much the same.

339
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:49,330
So tell us about the
construction of the instrument.

340
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:49,811
Okay.

341
00:25:49,811 --> 00:25:53,860
So obviously we've now seen a little
bit of the brass family and the woodwind

342
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:57,620
family and the other principal.
A section of the orchestra would,

343
00:25:57,621 --> 00:26:01,890
Bob is to be the string family. Um, the
viola is very similar to the violence,

344
00:26:01,891 --> 00:26:04,890
so anything I say about the viola
applies to the violin as well.

345
00:26:04,891 --> 00:26:08,580
And of course you all are probably
familiar with violence and the size of the

346
00:26:08,581 --> 00:26:12,960
violas are a little bit bigger. This
particular one's about 16 inches long, um,

347
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,250
building so I can show it better,
uh,

348
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,140
violins or maybe go up about 12 inches.

349
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:22,260
They have a slightly smaller body to them.
Um,

350
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:27,210
but violence of els have the same
general construction. Um, we,

351
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,740
we, uh, all the sounds are
produced by the strings, uh,

352
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,750
on the instrument and how the bone
is pulled across the instruments.

353
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,900
The Bose made out of typically horse
hair from tales of courses. Um,

354
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,750
the strings are now metallic,
but 16th,

355
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,650
18th century, they would have
been made out of cat gut. Um,

356
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:48,630
that was much more common
and still some people,

357
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,310
okay. So I'm sorry we were, I got lots
of things going on here. There's money,

358
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,990
so just play, um, uh, scale, uh, quickly.

359
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:59,140
And then the Vibrato Pitsa
Kado and Tremolo for it.

360
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,630
So again, this is on a viola, so does
a deeper darker tamber than a violin.

361
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:04,560
But here's the scale.

362
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,760
Oh, you did something
there at the end. Do,

363
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,560
do you have too much coffee this morning
and started shaking with it? Yeah.

364
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,120
So tell us about what you
were doing there at the end.

365
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,870
So there are all sorts of different little
technique things you can do to create

366
00:27:21,871 --> 00:27:25,290
different colors and sounds on,
on all string instruments.

367
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,010
So this applies to any of them.
Uh,

368
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:30,510
one of them is the technique you
something to do with my left hand where I

369
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:34,320
wiggled it a little bit. It's called the
Bravo. You hear the human voices as well.

370
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,930
You can do it on other instruments but,
and then a string instrument.

371
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:38,040
It's the difference.

372
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:41,370
I'll play a melody without Sobrato
and with the grotto so you can see the

373
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:42,204
difference.

374
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,780
Uh,

375
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,700
uh,

376
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,920
so that's what the ads are Prato
not that interesting in my opinion.

377
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,090
So with the Bronto,

378
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,010
mm.

379
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,890
And you can vary the width and the speed
and the length, there's a lot of fair.

380
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,240
Okay.
Then just quickly play a pitch for sure.

381
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,590
Okay. And then finally, Tremolo.

382
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,383
Yes.

383
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:34,943
Yes.

384
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:39,560
A little excitement or a little filler
to the music sometimes. All right. Great.

385
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,300
Thank you,
Jacob.

386
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,133
Very much

387
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,500
so. I Dunno if I get, whether
technically this will work or not.

388
00:28:49,501 --> 00:28:52,500
I've tried all morning to get this
to work. I have it up on my screen,

389
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,390
but I don't see it up on the screen there.
Can I have a tech assistant to do?

390
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,640
All right. We'll go back
here to try this. It began,

391
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:03,750
nothing happened.

392
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,033
Yeah.

393
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,330
Well that's why I asked
somebody to stand up here. Yeah.

394
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:14,110
It doesn't do me much good
to have somebody in the
back going like this. Okay.

395
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,730
What I would like, one I wanted
to show you was a clip. Uh,

396
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:23,680
that actually one my daughter brought to
my attention. Um, just this past weekend,

397
00:29:23,681 --> 00:29:28,300
she was watching television. America
has talent. Anybody watched this?

398
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,330
Americans talent? And she
said, Dad, you've got to watch.

399
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,740
This is the most amazing thing.

400
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:37,480
They've got these two guys on here
called nothing but strings. So I did,

401
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,990
I went to, she did, she
sent me the link to Youtube.

402
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,680
I'll let see if we can get this to go.
I don't know.

403
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,813
Send me fine

404
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,810
to do something.
I love with the person that,

405
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,670
uh,

406
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,120
so obviously the violin is not just this
stodgy old thing from the renaissance.

407
00:30:41,121 --> 00:30:45,320
It has some legs today, uh,
used in folk music used in,

408
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,290
sometimes you see it in, in
Nashville, playing with country music,

409
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:52,610
that kind of thing. Uh, is this a travesty
to use a violin with, with hip hop here?

410
00:30:52,611 --> 00:30:55,340
I guess this is hip hop. Of
course not. This is wonderful.

411
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:59,210
This is the best thing that has happened
to the violin in the last hundred years.

412
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,760
There will be millions of
kids out there now to, Gee,

413
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,880
I'd like to learn to play the violin too.
So this is wonderful.

414
00:31:04,881 --> 00:31:08,840
This sort of cross, uh,
semination of, of genres here,

415
00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:10,810
bringing this particular instrument,

416
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:14,870
the traditional classical violin
into the popular realm. All right,

417
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,990
so let's put that aside. We've talked a
little bit about sound production here.

418
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,870
I've got two pieces I'm
going to work with here. Uh,

419
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:23,390
for the end of our session,

420
00:31:23,391 --> 00:31:27,440
we have 15 minutes left and
here are these two pieces.

421
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:32,330
The first you can see on the board up
there is by another Russian composer Modez

422
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,213
resort ski.

423
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:38,290
It's called Polish ox card from
his work pictures at an exhibition.

424
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,440
What happened was he had a friend, the
friend died, the friend was an artist.

425
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:46,310
A friend left these pictures
as an homage to the painter.

426
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:49,640
Mazurski sat down and
tried to come up with,

427
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:54,620
create a musical response to each of
these paintings that were on display.

428
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,450
Now this is a piece that's always
interested me because the painting is very

429
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:00,284
pedestrian.

430
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:05,350
It's of an old Polish ox cart sitting
on some godforsaken road in rural Russia

431
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:10,790
somewhere.
So how do you make that work as music?

432
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,880
How do you turn that
visual image in to music?

433
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,460
How do you turn that into a
sort of live sonic escape?

434
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,830
And I should say at the outset,
I'm going to prejudice,

435
00:32:21,831 --> 00:32:23,180
you're listening here just a little bit.

436
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:28,330
I hear this as me being in the
center and this oxcart starting.

437
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,940
Could you start either side? It doesn't
matter. Everybody moves left to right.

438
00:32:31,941 --> 00:32:35,060
So I'm going to hear this moving left
to right. It comes in front of me,

439
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,940
almost raw rolls over top of me,

440
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:42,380
runs me and then disappears to my right.

441
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,930
So as we listen to this,

442
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,080
you think about what are the techniques
by which resort ski creates this musical

443
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:55,720
action scene. You should be able to come
up with two pretty good ideas here too.

444
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,500
Pretty good answers.
All right, here we go.

445
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,093
Nice and loud.

446
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,430
The instrument is playing.
That is playing

447
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:26,580
is a low tuba, Tuba, low brass instrument.

448
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:30,360
It doesn't sound much like a Tuba cause
it's actually playing in the higher

449
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:34,530
register of the instrument,
but it is a tube.

450
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:58,310
Now, this strange, turn it
up just a little bit. Streams
come in with a counter ID,

451
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,230
complimentary ideas.

452
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,440
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

453
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:02,290
okay.
Give me one pretty straight forward way.

454
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:04,450
This happened.
What did he do there?

455
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:11,210
Yes. A young lady out here please. Okay.

456
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:15,820
Crescendo from beginning to end.
Yeah,

457
00:36:15,821 --> 00:36:17,440
so like a giant wedge.

458
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:21,070
So that's why the cart
seems to be in front of you.

459
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:25,450
And so we're talking about musical
volume here. It started very quietly.

460
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:30,870
It built up to this huge center in which
we had the bass drum pounding away.

461
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:34,780
They're in a snare drum coming in to
give the effect of the entire earth is

462
00:36:34,781 --> 00:36:37,330
rattling at that particular
particular point.

463
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,970
And then as it passed by you,

464
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:45,330
the thunder pass by you and off you
went into the distance quietly into the

465
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:50,410
distance and it was, we'll
come back to that. But uh, uh,

466
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,550
how did that happen?
We'll listen to the end of that.

467
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:57,551
And just one moment is kind
of a disintegration of the
sound at the end of this

468
00:36:57,991 --> 00:37:01,570
disintegration of the sound at the end.
So let's pick it up.

469
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,110
So that's one big, one big
way. This happened. One,

470
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,400
that's probably the big ticket item here.
There's another way, a more subtle way.

471
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,140
Any thoughts about that?

472
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,533
Yes,

473
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,680
yes. The instrumentation that,
can you elaborate on that?

474
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,693
Great.

475
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:35,030
Right. So there's a kind of wedge shape
with regard to the instruments too.

476
00:37:35,031 --> 00:37:39,260
He starts with the lowest instruments,
the lowest instruments, uh,

477
00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:40,570
and then uh,

478
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,720
goes to the high instruments and then
back to low instruments at the end.

479
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,460
Let's just review, well, no, we won't
review this. Let's not review that.

480
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,380
Okay.
We don't have time to review that,

481
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:56,500
but let's go on to say the following that
what moves Mussorgsky knew there was a

482
00:37:56,511 --> 00:38:01,511
very basic principle of acoustics
and what is that principle?

483
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:06,470
Yeah, I beg your pardon.
Well, to some extent,

484
00:38:06,471 --> 00:38:08,720
I'm going to give an
example example of that,

485
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:11,650
of the train kind of going by you and
the sound hitting off in the other,

486
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,780
other direction to yes, to some
extent it is that, yes. Um, uh,

487
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:21,910
but what I was thinking about here is
this idea that the lowest sounds create or

488
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:28,130
the longest sound waves
and they last the longest,

489
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,780
lowest sounds create the largest
sound waves and they last the longest.

490
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:37,540
The lowest sounds lasts the longest.
Why might this be the case? Are here,

491
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:42,910
uh, uh, not having too much
confidence in our slides this morning.

492
00:38:42,911 --> 00:38:46,840
I went ahead and put this one up on
the board here. Here is one pitch.

493
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:51,190
Here is a picture of a string, an octave
higher, so you can see it this way.

494
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,000
As you probably know,
if you take a long string and pluck it,

495
00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:00,150
it's going to take that long string along
time to pass that sort of cycle if you

496
00:39:00,491 --> 00:39:04,270
will. Just one pass through that
cycle, the string, half the length.

497
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:09,100
We'll pass through that cycle two times
so that you can kind of graph these up

498
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:11,920
here as one long,

499
00:39:11,921 --> 00:39:16,921
low sound or one faster
vibrating sound an octave higher.

500
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,670
So again,

501
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
low sounds or low
frequencies travel farther.

502
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,440
Now you've experienced
this in your own life.

503
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,380
You're standing on a street corner
here in new haven in the distance.

504
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,560
What do you hear an automobile approaching
with a souped up audio system in it

505
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:39,750
and what sound do you hear
at the very first room room,

506
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:45,970
room room, that kind of thing. There
may be too junior to Du, Du, Du, Du, Du,

507
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,400
Du, Du, Du, Du, Du.

508
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,550
And then maybe some kind of melody will
come in and then it'll all come together

509
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:54,340
right in front of you and it kind
of disappear in the distance.

510
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:57,310
You're at a football game,
you've probably experienced this too.

511
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,530
The band is marching on the field.

512
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:04,531
Suddenly they do the doppler effect where
they turn their backs to you in a way

513
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,590
and they're playing away from you
and you hear very little sound.

514
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:13,240
What instrumental sound do you hear?
Boom,

515
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,920
boom, boom. The bass drum and the Tuba,

516
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,310
or in the marching band
would be a sousaphone.

517
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:20,050
They would call it the bass drum and Tuba.

518
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,310
So Mazurski knew this kind of thing and
because he's a professional musician and

519
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:29,110
was playing off of it to create this
rather unusual and remarkable, uh,

520
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,980
musical soundscape here. Okay,
I have five minutes left.

521
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:37,240
I'd like to do one last piece.
It's another piece by Ricard Strauss.

522
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,820
It kind of brings us to
the end of Ricard Strauss,

523
00:40:39,821 --> 00:40:43,720
our discussion of Ricard's Josh, we'll
say goodbye to him here in our course,

524
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:49,690
it's called death and transfiguration,
death and transfiguration.

525
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,150
And I hear this as a companion piece.

526
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:55,660
It kind of pendant to
the Zuora through stroke.

527
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:01,170
One sort of opens up the beginning of
life here and the other closes it down,

528
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:05,590
uh,
through a referencing of death.

529
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:10,650
There's a interesting anecdote about
Strauss and that is that on his deathbed,

530
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,920
he said to his daughter,
Alice, he said, Alice,

531
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,420
it's the funniest thing.

532
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:22,530
Dying is exactly as I composed
it in death and transfiguration.

533
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,590
What an odd thing to say,
but in any event,

534
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,500
here's how this works.

535
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:32,260
We've been talking about this overtone
series with Zahra through Straw,

536
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,950
Ava Palade overtone series. He's basically
working up to the upper partials.

537
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,400
Now.
He's going to work down the partials.

538
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:44,330
You're going to close it back down here
with death and he's going to close it

539
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:48,800
back down using a process that
we frequently encounter in music,

540
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:53,720
and that is this idea of dissonance
resolving two consonants.

541
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:58,370
Here's a dissonance.
Here's a consonant.

542
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,870
They're precise technical reasons
why these are the way they are,

543
00:42:04,871 --> 00:42:08,950
but let me try to, to cut to the
chase here with dissonant intervals,

544
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,160
they tend to be frequencies that are
sounding right next to each other,

545
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:15,340
very close by frequencies.
They sound dissonant.

546
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,130
If you allow a little bit of spacing,

547
00:42:18,131 --> 00:42:22,210
a little more space between
your frequencies, they're
a little bit farther apart,

548
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:27,160
then you can move from closeness to
spacing and you get the consonants.

549
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,330
Generally speaking,

550
00:42:28,331 --> 00:42:33,331
dissonant intervals have ratios such as
nine to eight for the whole step or 17

551
00:42:33,431 --> 00:42:35,140
to 16 for the half step.

552
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:40,260
They're irrational numbers
and these irrational numbers
like to move to rational

553
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:41,980
numbers.

554
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,310
They like to move to consonants as they
like to move to intervals that are based

555
00:42:45,311 --> 00:42:48,430
on things such as two to one and
three to two or maybe four to three.

556
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:49,860
So that's the,

557
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:54,160
the the principle of this idea of
dissonance resolving two consonants.

558
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:57,820
So we're going to listen
now to the end of Strauss's.

559
00:42:57,821 --> 00:43:02,821
Death and transfiguration did the death
year and again we've got the idea of the

560
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:05,110
octave,

561
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,860
then the fifth and the fourth week
working up farther and farther in these

562
00:43:08,861 --> 00:43:13,861
partials and we've got some of these
notes right next to each other and they

563
00:43:14,201 --> 00:43:16,530
want to move to the stable notes.

564
00:43:16,531 --> 00:43:20,440
So we're going to be hearing a lot of
a note right above the tonic wanting to

565
00:43:20,441 --> 00:43:22,900
pull down to that tonic note.

566
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,540
We're going to hear a lot of
unknowns right above the dominant,

567
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:30,610
wanting to pull down to the dominant.
So let's listen to this.

568
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:32,990
We have about three minutes, I think. Um,

569
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,170
we'll hear it and I'll comment a bit as we

570
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,083
go.

571
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:55,180
[inaudible] [inaudible]

572
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,610
yeah, just working with the
four note and motive here.

573
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:56,930
Whoa, strange little dissonant chord.
They're resolving the consonants

574
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:57,103
here.
It's

575
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,460
just the basic primordial note upon
which all these other tones are built.

576
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:29,210
Okay. So that's Ricard
Strauss as approach to death,

577
00:46:29,211 --> 00:46:31,430
not particularly relevant
to you young people,

578
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,120
but for older gentlemen such
as Professor Kagan and myself,

579
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:39,590
we're getting close to
that right. Dot. So, uh,

580
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,860
thank you all for staying with us this
morning and hope you will enjoy that
