1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.740
Okay.

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.740
Now we didn't have sections this week in case you didn't notice and therefore

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.650
you didn't have an opportunity to discuss the problem set during section.

4
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:12.390
So I thought I would say a few words about it.

5
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:15.090
Now here is the problem set.

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.490
A,

7
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.910
you probably can't read it at this a typeface,

8
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.860
but that's okay.

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.461
Uh,

10
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:22.240
so let's see.

11
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.530
Uh,

12
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.911
problems.

13
00:00:22.911 --> 00:00:25.080
Zero is just a stupid way of making you,

14
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:25.380
uh,

15
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.213
read the,

16
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.300
read the policies.

17
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.250
Nevermind that problem.

18
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:30.690
Set One problem.

19
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:33.840
One here our exercises in one digit,

20
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.950
uh,

21
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.020
in one digit scientific notation.

22
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.880
I don't have rules for this.

23
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.320
As I mentioned last time,

24
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:41.820
the only rule is common sense.

25
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.720
Uh,

26
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.280
I think,

27
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.710
uh,

28
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.410
there might be some difficulty with the last one.

29
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.130
You,

30
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.450
this business of taking,

31
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.200
taking things to the one third power is important because you keep ending up

32
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:55.680
with a cubed equals something and you have to figure out what to do about that.

33
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.870
So let me not to this particular problem.

34
00:00:57.871 --> 00:00:59.340
Let me do a different one for you.

35
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.580
So supposing you had six times 10 to the four to the one third power,

36
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.810
and you might be tempted to say,

37
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:07.021
well,

38
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:07.321
okay,

39
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:08.550
that's six to the one,

40
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:11.310
third times 10 to the four thirds,

41
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.280
and that leads you to a bad place because,

42
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.530
uh,

43
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.880
uh,

44
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.460
10 to the four thirds is not the notation we want.

45
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:19.200
We want this to be an integer up there.

46
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.511
Uh,

47
00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:22.800
what does it mean to be a one with four thirds of a zero after it?

48
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.371
Uh,

49
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:24.540
and so you don't like that.

50
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:25.120
So,

51
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.290
uh,

52
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.570
the way to deal with this is to regroup.

53
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.040
This is 60 times 10 to the three to the one third power.

54
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.750
That's 62.

55
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:37.530
The one third times 10 to the one what?

56
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:38.610
60 to the one third,

57
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:39.260
well,

58
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.780
a four times four times four as it happens is 64.

59
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.270
And that's,

60
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.580
that's close enough for me.

61
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.773
Uh,

62
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.620
so,

63
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.370
uh,

64
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.370
so this is four times 10 to the one.

65
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.300
So that's just an example of how these kinds of things where you take things to

66
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:55.320
fractional powers,

67
00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:56.610
either the square root,

68
00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:58.280
which is to the one half or,

69
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.000
or the cube root to the one third.

70
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.230
All right,

71
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.590
uh,

72
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.640
the next problem,

73
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.870
uh,

74
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.703
let's see,

75
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.060
Neptune's moon Neary it has an orbital period of almost exactly one earth year.

76
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:10.890
If the massive net Pune is something or other,

77
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:12.420
what's it semi major access.

78
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.500
So you have p and m and you're asked for a,

79
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.010
uh,

80
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.370
that's a completely straightforward plug and chug problem because there's an

81
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:22.170
equation that relates to these three things.

82
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.570
And only tricky thing about this is,

83
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.100
uh,

84
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.420
that you have to make sure the units come out right?

85
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.531
All right?

86
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:31.920
The next one looks similar in form,

87
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.810
but it isn't considered a sunlight star orbited by planet planet with a period

88
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:37.471
of eight years.

89
00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:42.010
So we have p the separation of the planet and the Star appears to be 20 arc

90
00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:42.381
seconds.

91
00:02:42.381 --> 00:02:44.040
So we have an angle that's alpha.

92
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.930
How far away is the star?

93
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:47.700
And you want to know d okay.

94
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:49.890
There is no equation that contains all,

95
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.240
all three of those things.

96
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:52.500
And so this is,

97
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.030
although it looks similar in form,

98
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:56.310
is actually a substantially more difficult problem,

99
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.773
uh,

100
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.100
going on problem for,

101
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.473
<v 1>uh,</v>

102
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.560
okay,

103
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.011
the important,

104
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:03.401
in fact,

105
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:04.450
there is such a star,

106
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:04.661
blah,

107
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:05.050
blah.

108
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.020
Does this fact make any difference in the foregoing calculation?

109
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.883
Explain.

110
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.070
The important thing to note about this is that I'm not asking you to do a

111
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:12.904
calculation.

112
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.950
This is not a calculation problem.

113
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:19.090
This is a comment you're supposed to say something about how the calculation

114
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:21.070
would go if you were to do it,

115
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:23.350
but you don't have to actually calculate anything there.

116
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.640
And then finally,

117
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:25.690
this last problem,

118
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:28.090
this is the sort of essay question here.

119
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.253
Uh,

120
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.030
the point here as I've,

121
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:32.620
as I've written down on the,

122
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:33.140
uh,

123
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.220
uh,

124
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.210
there's about Pluto,

125
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.661
uh,

126
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:38.410
the point here as I've written down on the actual paper itself,

127
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.000
there's no right answer to this.

128
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.570
Uh,

129
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.400
this is a thought question.

130
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.450
Uh,

131
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.840
there are some people I know from the course evaluations who get disturbed by

132
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:49.870
this because they have the feeling that science ought to have right answers.

133
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.100
That is after all the point.

134
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.120
Uh,

135
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.660
and,

136
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.961
uh,

137
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:57.040
and I keep asking these sort of touchy feely humanities kinds of questions,

138
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.790
uh,

139
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.623
revel in it,

140
00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.560
a go with it.

141
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.520
Uh,

142
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.030
and,

143
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.211
uh,

144
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:05.230
what we're looking for here is the same thing as your English teacher would be

145
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:05.891
looking for,

146
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:06.420
right.

147
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.950
Uh,

148
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:07.783
um,

149
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.570
although perhaps less emphasis on writing style,

150
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:11.170
but you know,

151
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.770
just,

152
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.100
uh,

153
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.240
have some thoughts,

154
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.320
do some reading,

155
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.560
understand something and say something intelligent and defendant.

156
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.520
Okay.

157
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.970
Uh,

158
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.170
and uh,

159
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.270
a paragraph or two,

160
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.631
you know,

161
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:23.351
two sentences,

162
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:24.340
probably too little.

163
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.761
A,

164
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:26.530
if it's more than two pages,

165
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.480
double spaced or one page,

166
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:29.171
single space,

167
00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:32.140
I'm going to get really irritated because I have to read these things.

168
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.620
Uh,

169
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.760
and they're 80 of them.

170
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.511
Uh,

171
00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:35.261
and so,

172
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:35.441
uh,

173
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:36.070
don't go,

174
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.903
don't go nuts.

175
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.860
Uh,

176
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.231
again,

177
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:39.370
just be saying about it,

178
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.910
uh,

179
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.310
and say something and say something intelligent.

180
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:43.120
That's a,

181
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.110
that's all we ask.

182
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.800
Uh,

183
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.970
questions about the problem set or about procedural aspects of the course at

184
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:49.804
this stage?

185
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.033
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

186
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.310
<v 1>If you do have some at some point,</v>

187
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.180
uh,

188
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.721
send them,

189
00:04:56.721 --> 00:04:58.520
send them to us on the classic server.

190
00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.240
Yeah.

191
00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.630
Oh,

192
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.463
go ahead.

193
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.380
<v 2>What would you say is too short?</v>

194
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.301
<v 1>Oh,</v>

195
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:04.751
the answer.

196
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:05.230
Well,

197
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.550
a sentence is too short.

198
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.610
Two sentences probably too short.

199
00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:10.360
Unless they're pretty severe sentences.

200
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.553
Uh,

201
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.690
I mean it's got to be a paragraph,

202
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:14.524
you know,

203
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.750
otherwise you haven't really cleared your throat.

204
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.410
Uh,

205
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.750
but I don't want to say anything too precise about that.

206
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:21.550
If you've got a really keen sentence,

207
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:21.791
you know,

208
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:22.840
that might do the job.

209
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.640
Uh,

210
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.340
again,

211
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.861
sanded,

212
00:05:24.861 --> 00:05:25.780
he ought to prevail.

213
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.793
Yes.

214
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.480
Uh,

215
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.570
we'll probably have one of that nature,

216
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:35.580
not necessarily of this kind about,

217
00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:35.761
you know,

218
00:05:35.761 --> 00:05:36.960
scientific controversies,

219
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:37.890
but about something.

220
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.270
Uh,

221
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.491
oh,

222
00:05:38.491 --> 00:05:42.720
and I should say the way the tests will work out is it's going to be probably

223
00:05:42.721 --> 00:05:46.050
slightly more than half calculation and slightly less than half.

224
00:05:46.051 --> 00:05:48.030
There won't be essays because they're PR.

225
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.910
You've probably isn't time to do that on a 50 minute tests,

226
00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:53.280
but there'll be less short answer questions and stuff like that.

227
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:54.120
Uh,

228
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.570
yeah.

229
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.871
Well,

230
00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:56.730
we'll have these kinds of discussion things.

231
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.010
They won't be

232
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.880
<v 0>the dominant part of the problems just as in this case,</v>

233
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:04.220
it's six points out of this adds up to 20 points.

234
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:04.621
This one,

235
00:06:04.621 --> 00:06:06.800
six other questions.

236
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.280
Okay.

237
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.820
As I say,

238
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.720
if you've got some,

239
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.123
let us know.

240
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.270
Okay.

241
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.050
So as I pointed out last time,

242
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.360
we're talking about exoplanets,

243
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:30.740
planets around other stars.

244
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:35.741
And the problem with the exoplanets is you can't see them direct like so you

245
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:37.814
can't

246
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.760
see the exoplanets

247
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.300
directly as blobs of light in the sky.

248
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.980
And so what do you do?

249
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.440
So I have to detect them,

250
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:52.700
obviously indirectly.

251
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.960
And here's a,

252
00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:57.200
we'd got to invoke another one of Newton's laws.

253
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.190
So the key law here is now Newton's third law.

254
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:03.000
Newton's second law is f equals m.

255
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.261
A.

256
00:07:03.261 --> 00:07:05.630
You may recall that explained to all the physics one 80,

257
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.440
uh,

258
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.120
Newton's third law is usually phrased in textbooks and stuff.

259
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.360
Has every action has an equal and opposite reaction?

260
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.333
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

261
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:25.980
<v 0>I hate this formulation,</v>

262
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.240
uh,

263
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.480
because it leads to really bad philosophy.

264
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:31.500
You know,

265
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.220
uh,

266
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.770
this is one of the whole problems with physics in general.

267
00:07:34.771 --> 00:07:37.620
There are these words that seem to mean something,

268
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:38.290
uh,

269
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.950
words like force words like potential.

270
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:41.491
Uh,

271
00:07:41.491 --> 00:07:44.250
and there these have technical meanings,

272
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:44.671
uh,

273
00:07:44.671 --> 00:07:49.110
in physics that are actually different from the intuitive meaning that you have

274
00:07:49.111 --> 00:07:51.450
in your head just from using them in everyday life.

275
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.740
And the big problem with introductory physics is getting people to use these

276
00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:59.730
words as if they mean the physics definition rather than as if they mean the

277
00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:00.570
everyday life,

278
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:01.320
uh,

279
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.100
uh,

280
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:02.821
definition.

281
00:08:02.821 --> 00:08:03.720
And this leads,

282
00:08:03.721 --> 00:08:04.554
as I say,

283
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:04.921
uh,

284
00:08:04.921 --> 00:08:07.740
in extreme cases to all sorts of bad philosophy.

285
00:08:07.741 --> 00:08:08.161
In fact,

286
00:08:08.161 --> 00:08:12.180
the two most misused physics words that I know of are first of all,

287
00:08:12.181 --> 00:08:13.110
relativity,

288
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:13.741
uh,

289
00:08:13.741 --> 00:08:16.680
and everything is relative said Einstein.

290
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:17.221
Well,

291
00:08:17.221 --> 00:08:17.611
no,

292
00:08:17.611 --> 00:08:19.620
actually he said nothing of the kind.

293
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:20.171
Uh,

294
00:08:20.171 --> 00:08:21.990
and the other one is uncertainty,

295
00:08:21.991 --> 00:08:24.270
which has to do with quantum mechanics and you know,

296
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.373
uh,

297
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.070
and these are technical terms,

298
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:29.470
uh,

299
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.271
in physics.

300
00:08:30.271 --> 00:08:33.940
And then they get sort of promoted to the state to,

301
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.033
uh,

302
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.920
use in philosophy as if they met what they mean in English.

303
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.300
So I don't like this because every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

304
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:42.840
Uh,

305
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.580
you can get into all sorts of bogus,

306
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:44.880
uh,

307
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.830
philosophy and I don't want to go there.

308
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:47.251
Uh,

309
00:08:47.251 --> 00:08:47.760
so,

310
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:47.931
uh,

311
00:08:47.931 --> 00:08:51.150
I would rather phrase this as conservation of momentum.

312
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.693
<v 3>Uh,</v>

313
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.960
<v 0>and,</v>

314
00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.230
uh,

315
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:57.831
momentum,

316
00:08:57.831 --> 00:08:58.361
as I say,

317
00:08:58.361 --> 00:08:59.540
as a technical term,

318
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.560
it means,

319
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.583
uh,

320
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.190
uh,

321
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.530
m mass times velocity.

322
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.653
It's all it means.

323
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.590
Uh,

324
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.610
and uh,

325
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:11.001
you know,

326
00:09:11.001 --> 00:09:15.050
the kind of use that it's put in electoral politics or other things has nothing

327
00:09:15.051 --> 00:09:16.580
to do with what's going on in physics.

328
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.060
Uh,

329
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.100
or I should say velocity,

330
00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:19.731
uh,

331
00:09:19.731 --> 00:09:21.060
one should be aware of is,

332
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:21.830
uh,

333
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:22.910
consists of two things.

334
00:09:22.911 --> 00:09:25.370
It's not just the speed that something has,

335
00:09:25.371 --> 00:09:26.780
but also its direction.

336
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:31.300
Uh,

337
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.640
and so direction council,

338
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.810
if you turn around and go at the same speed,

339
00:09:34.811 --> 00:09:35.050
you've,

340
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.250
you've reversed your,

341
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.671
uh,

342
00:09:36.671 --> 00:09:39.430
you now have negative velocity compared to where you start with,

343
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:40.000
uh,

344
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.833
this,

345
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:41.500
uh,

346
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.630
technically speaking makes this a vector quantity,

347
00:09:43.631 --> 00:09:44.051
but again,

348
00:09:44.051 --> 00:09:44.884
we won't go there.

349
00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:45.963
Um,

350
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.511
okay,

351
00:09:46.511 --> 00:09:50.020
so how does this work in the case of a planetary orbit?

352
00:09:50.021 --> 00:09:51.430
So here's a planet.

353
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.980
It's on one side of it starts going this way,

354
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:54.760
uh,

355
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.120
and it's got some momentum and then half an orbit later,

356
00:09:58.121 --> 00:10:00.070
it's over here going the other way.

357
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:04.450
Let's say it's orbiting some star in the middle and it's got more or less the

358
00:10:04.451 --> 00:10:05.111
same speed,

359
00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:06.670
but it's direction is reversed.

360
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.310
So over half an orbit,

361
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.630
uh,

362
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.050
so over one half orbit,

363
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.230
the momentum is reversed.

364
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.660
So it goes from being positive to negative or something like that.

365
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.800
Now Newton's third law says that momentum is conserved.

366
00:10:26.801 --> 00:10:29.950
It has to total momentum of the system has to remain the same.

367
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.440
So something else has to change.

368
00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:37.650
And here's the whole trek about finding exoplanets and that is that the star

369
00:10:38.321 --> 00:10:39.340
moves too.

370
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.270
So,

371
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:40.481
uh,

372
00:10:40.481 --> 00:10:40.811
when,

373
00:10:40.811 --> 00:10:43.060
when the planets over here at this blue Arrow,

374
00:10:43.061 --> 00:10:48.061
the star is here and it's also moving in the opposite direction,

375
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.240
uh,

376
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.010
and then half an orbit later,

377
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:53.620
the planet has come over to this side.

378
00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:57.340
The star has moved or moved in the opposite direction.

379
00:10:57.341 --> 00:10:58.630
It's now going this way.

380
00:10:59.200 --> 00:10:59.680
Uh,

381
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.000
and uh,

382
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.370
so the star moves too.

383
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.233
That's key.

384
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.740
How much does the star move?

385
00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:09.490
Well,

386
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:09.850
uh,

387
00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.260
the two Momenta,

388
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:11.710
uh,

389
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.900
have to be equal and opposite.

390
00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:18.580
This is what is equal and opposite about Newton's third law is that these things

391
00:11:18.581 --> 00:11:19.540
have to cancel out.

392
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.720
So what you find is that the mass of the planet times the velocity of the planet

393
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.710
is equal to the mass of the star times the velocity of the star.

394
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.120
Uh,

395
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.510
and because the mass of the star is so much bigger,

396
00:11:37.511 --> 00:11:39.490
so huge compared to the mass of the planet,

397
00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:41.560
it's philocity much B must be much,

398
00:11:41.561 --> 00:11:44.050
much smaller in order for these two things to be equal.

399
00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:45.603
Uh,

400
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:47.733
okay.

401
00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.573
Uh,

402
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.010
what,

403
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.180
what are they orbiting around then?

404
00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:53.800
If everything is,

405
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:54.461
is,

406
00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:54.970
uh,

407
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:55.900
moving together,

408
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:56.381
uh,

409
00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:57.214
their orbit,

410
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:02.050
they orbit around the center of mass,

411
00:12:02.051 --> 00:12:03.100
so called

412
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.823
this is just,

413
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.430
you know,

414
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.210
where the balance point of a seesaw would kind of be a,

415
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:11.890
and so here we have,

416
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:12.993
uh,

417
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.230
here's the center of mass.

418
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.981
Here's,

419
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:15.490
uh,

420
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.110
here's the star moving this way,

421
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:17.801
way over here,

422
00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:20.110
somewhere as a planet moving much faster.

423
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.333
Uh,

424
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.270
and let's define two quantities.

425
00:12:25.271 --> 00:12:28.990
This is the distance from the planet to the center of mass.

426
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:34.110
Here's the distance of the star to the planet of Mass Stars Moving At v Starr

427
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.460
Planet is moving at v Planet.

428
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:37.720
Uh,

429
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.440
and,

430
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:38.591
uh,

431
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.080
you can define a total philocity,

432
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.921
uh,

433
00:12:41.921 --> 00:12:44.530
which is equal to these two things added together.

434
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.360
And what does that mean?

435
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:49.540
That's the velocity where if you're on one of these objects,

436
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.060
the other appears to be moving relative to you.

437
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:54.820
So if I'm going this way and you're going that way,

438
00:12:54.821 --> 00:12:59.710
we have a relative velocity equal to the sum of our individual velocities.

439
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:04.030
And there's also a total distance which can be defined,

440
00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:06.280
which is by analogy,

441
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:06.671
the,

442
00:13:06.671 --> 00:13:11.470
some of the distance from the planet to the center of mass and the start of the

443
00:13:11.471 --> 00:13:12.130
center of mass.

444
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.160
And that's just the distance between these two objects.

445
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.350
The distance and the velocity in an elliptical orbit can change during the

446
00:13:20.351 --> 00:13:21.250
course of the orbit.

447
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.390
Uh,

448
00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.930
but for circular orbits or close to circular orbits,

449
00:13:25.931 --> 00:13:27.180
they remain about the same or,

450
00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:29.320
but you'll remember generally elliptical.

451
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.250
Uh,

452
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:30.840
and,

453
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.210
uh,

454
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:35.710
a way of saying this is that the maximum of the total different distance between

455
00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:37.990
these two is this quantity.

456
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.120
A Sami major access.

457
00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:43.900
Remember the semi major access is the long slice through the ellipse.

458
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.230
So when this is at a maximum,

459
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.860
that equals a,

460
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:53.470
the semi major access for our orbits that are nearly circular.

461
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.460
Uh,

462
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.260
you can sort of say in an offhand way,

463
00:13:56.261 --> 00:13:56.860
well,

464
00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.220
uh,

465
00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:57.670
this,

466
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.970
uh,

467
00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.530
Ditto doesn't change that much.

468
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:01.450
So it's the distance between the two objects.

469
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:03.131
All right?

470
00:14:03.131 --> 00:14:04.120
Now as I mentioned,

471
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.313
uh,

472
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:10.650
VP m p is equal to v Star m star.

473
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:15.070
It is also true the way you figure out where the center of mass is.

474
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:20.250
DP A M P is equal to d star m star.

475
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:28.230
And the whole point of this is that this is a large quantity compared to the

476
00:14:28.661 --> 00:14:29.620
mass of the planet.

477
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.480
And therefore these are small quantities compared to the,

478
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.010
to,

479
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:35.380
uh,

480
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.213
the distance.

481
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.040
The distance is in velocities,

482
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.370
uh,

483
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.390
taken by the planet

484
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.753
small.

485
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.230
But as it turns out,

486
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.510
a measurable in particular,

487
00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:47.530
the Velocity,

488
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:48.400
uh,

489
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.181
is the thing,

490
00:14:49.181 --> 00:14:52.850
the velocity of the star turns to be the thing that you can measure.

491
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.000
And so that's how you find,

492
00:14:59.140 --> 00:14:59.890
uh,

493
00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:02.050
determined that there's an exoplanet there.

494
00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:07.260
What you do is you look for the reflex motion of the star planets going around

495
00:15:07.271 --> 00:15:07.801
the stars.

496
00:15:07.801 --> 00:15:10.630
Stars going around the center of mass also.

497
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:11.141
Uh,

498
00:15:11.141 --> 00:15:15.580
and that is a motion that now these days can be observed.

499
00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:18.820
And you can see why this might have happened only very recently because that

500
00:15:18.821 --> 00:15:20.320
motion is really very small.

501
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.800
Let me give you some masses just to give you a sense of this.

502
00:15:23.801 --> 00:15:24.580
We've already,

503
00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.600
I've already written down that the sun's mass is about two times 10 to the 30

504
00:15:28.601 --> 00:15:29.434
kilograms.

505
00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:30.790
A just for reference,

506
00:15:30.791 --> 00:15:35.791
the Earth's mass is six times 10 to the 24 kilograms.

507
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.080
So down by almost a factor of a Michigan,

508
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.801
uh,

509
00:15:41.801 --> 00:15:42.634
and so,

510
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:43.061
uh,

511
00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:46.600
the sun moves much slower than the earth does due to their mutual gravity.

512
00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.240
Jupiter's the most massive of the planet.

513
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.790
Uh,

514
00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:50.981
uh,

515
00:15:50.981 --> 00:15:55.120
and it's at about two times 10 to the 27 kilograms,

516
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.150
so a thousand times smaller than the sun.

517
00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.590
And so of course the sun moves a thousand times less because if Jupiter than it

518
00:16:02.591 --> 00:16:03.520
does because of the earth.

519
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:04.151
Now of course,

520
00:16:04.151 --> 00:16:06.850
the sun actually responds to all of these planets.

521
00:16:06.851 --> 00:16:09.520
So it's actually executing some complicated motion,

522
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.970
which is the sub of the motions induced by all the planets.

523
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.073
But in fact,

524
00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:14.620
uh,

525
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.401
Jupiter is,

526
00:16:15.401 --> 00:16:15.790
is,

527
00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.370
is significantly more massive than the rest of the planet.

528
00:16:18.371 --> 00:16:19.180
So the,

529
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.850
by far the dominant motion that the sun goes through,

530
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:22.510
uh,

531
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.190
has to do with the orbit of Jupiter.

532
00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:26.110
And so the consequence of this,

533
00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:27.700
because the masters are so much smaller,

534
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:28.241
smaller,

535
00:16:28.241 --> 00:16:30.580
is that the velocity of the star is much,

536
00:16:30.581 --> 00:16:31.300
much less.

537
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.130
These two less than sign to me,

538
00:16:33.131 --> 00:16:33.521
it's much,

539
00:16:33.521 --> 00:16:36.130
much less than the velocity of the planet,

540
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:37.300
uh,

541
00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.540
but it can nevertheless be detected.

542
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.293
<v 3>Okay.</v>

543
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:47.913
Now

544
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.040
<v 0>what do we expect to see?</v>

545
00:16:50.041 --> 00:16:53.630
Supposing you can now go out and through means that we'll actually talk about it

546
00:16:53.631 --> 00:16:54.464
on Thursday,

547
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:54.770
uh,

548
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.640
actually measure the velocities,

549
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:57.140
uh,

550
00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.310
of starts in response to planet.

551
00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:00.660
What do you expect,

552
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.590
uh,

553
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:02.430
to see,

554
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:03.660
uh,

555
00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.530
in those,

556
00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.513
uh,

557
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.900
in other stars?

558
00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.920
And basically the answer to that is what you expect to see,

559
00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:11.640
uh,

560
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.400
depends on what your expectations for solar systems are.

561
00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.140
We've got one example,

562
00:17:16.141 --> 00:17:17.850
or at least 10 years ago,

563
00:17:17.851 --> 00:17:19.530
we had only one example.

564
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:20.410
And so,

565
00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:20.700
uh,

566
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:25.050
you have to take what you know about our own solar system and infer what other

567
00:17:25.051 --> 00:17:25.920
solar systems,

568
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:26.550
uh,

569
00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.630
might want to look like.

570
00:17:27.631 --> 00:17:28.530
And so at this point,

571
00:17:28.531 --> 00:17:31.860
I want to show you some things about our own solar system.

572
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:32.311
Uh,

573
00:17:32.311 --> 00:17:34.800
so a little slideshow of the solar system here.

574
00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:36.693
<v 3>All right.</v>

575
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.260
<v 0>Don't take notes.</v>

576
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:44.921
Uh,

577
00:17:44.921 --> 00:17:48.160
I'll tell you everything you need to know after we finished the pretty pictures.

578
00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.253
Um,

579
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:49.950
okay.

580
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:50.190
So

581
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.540
<v 1>starting from the inner,</v>

582
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.270
inner most part of the solar system,

583
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.680
this is the innermost planet.

584
00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:56.401
This is the planet.

585
00:17:56.401 --> 00:17:58.440
Mercury looks much like the moon.

586
00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.820
It's basically a rock,

587
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:00.630
uh,

588
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:01.770
with craters on it.

589
00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.130
Uh,

590
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:06.510
there was a time when we thought that it's spin period was exactly the same as

591
00:18:06.511 --> 00:18:07.560
it's orbital period.

592
00:18:07.561 --> 00:18:09.390
So it keeps one face to the sun.

593
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.550
There's all kinds of science fiction based on that.

594
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:13.050
That turned out not to be true.

595
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.980
Uh,

596
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:14.491
but,

597
00:18:14.491 --> 00:18:14.880
uh,

598
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.240
uh,

599
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.073
basically,

600
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.980
uh,

601
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.660
it's kind of a hot rock.

602
00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:20.490
That's all you need to know about mercury.

603
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:21.623
Uh,

604
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:22.530
let's see.

605
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:22.861
Oh,

606
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:27.270
here's a closeup of a little piece of mercury surface and you would have a tough

607
00:18:27.271 --> 00:18:31.860
time telling that this was a mercury rather than the moon or many other objects.

608
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.560
Uh,

609
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.320
rocky objects in the solar system.

610
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.480
Next one out is Venus.

611
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.230
Venus looks quite different because it's got a very thick atmosphere,

612
00:18:40.231 --> 00:18:42.150
very thick carbon dioxide atmosphere.

613
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.400
This is all clouds that you're looking at here.

614
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:45.001
Uh,

615
00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:45.840
and in fact,

616
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.250
the greenhouse effect,

617
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:50.370
which is supposed to be responsible perhaps for global warming,

618
00:18:50.371 --> 00:18:55.371
was first studied and identified on Venus because it appears to have run a muck

619
00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:56.011
on Venus.

620
00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:58.260
The surface of Venus is extremely hot,

621
00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:58.740
uh,

622
00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.690
and it's covered with these really thick clouds.

623
00:19:00.691 --> 00:19:04.770
So it was quite hard for a long time to get a handle on what was going on down

624
00:19:04.771 --> 00:19:05.610
on the surface.

625
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:06.090
Uh,

626
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:06.751
this has now,

627
00:19:06.751 --> 00:19:07.111
however,

628
00:19:07.111 --> 00:19:08.320
been accomplished a,

629
00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.580
they've put things into orbit that have radar and can,

630
00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:11.970
uh,

631
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:12.270
uh,

632
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:13.500
view the topography.

633
00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:14.760
Few that through the clouds,

634
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.060
they've also dropped things onto the surface of Venus.

635
00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:19.980
The problem is at 700 degrees in it,

636
00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:21.480
rain sulfur down there.

637
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.921
Uh,

638
00:19:21.921 --> 00:19:24.630
so it's an unpleasant environment for machinery.

639
00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:26.250
So things don't last very long,

640
00:19:26.251 --> 00:19:27.084
but nevertheless,

641
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:27.540
uh,

642
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.160
they've gotten it some information.

643
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:29.790
Uh,

644
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:31.920
here's a little Venus landscape.

645
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:33.120
It's RF entirely,

646
00:19:33.121 --> 00:19:34.260
artificially colored,

647
00:19:34.261 --> 00:19:34.750
right?

648
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:35.040
Uh,

649
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.540
but the topography,

650
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:36.960
uh,

651
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.330
comes from these radar mapping missions.

652
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:40.260
Uh,

653
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:40.830
and,

654
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:41.430
uh,

655
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.000
here is a map of the whole of Venus,

656
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:44.700
uh,

657
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.690
made by these,

658
00:19:45.691 --> 00:19:45.960
uh,

659
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.190
these orbiting missions.

660
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:47.821
Uh,

661
00:19:47.821 --> 00:19:49.620
and so Venus is important,

662
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:50.340
uh,

663
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.690
primarily for,

664
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.050
uh,

665
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:55.000
for its atmosphere and as a kind of warning for what my,

666
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:55.620
uh,

667
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.420
potentially one day happen here.

668
00:19:57.421 --> 00:19:58.260
If we're not careful,

669
00:19:58.860 --> 00:19:59.131
a,

670
00:19:59.131 --> 00:19:59.431
okay,

671
00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:01.200
this is the third rock from the sun.

672
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:02.010
Uh,

673
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:06.990
99% of all Gail courses deal with what's going on on this little piece of cosmic

674
00:20:06.991 --> 00:20:07.590
debris.

675
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.240
I'm not going to say any more about it,

676
00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:09.960
therefore,

677
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.351
oh,

678
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:11.310
except for one thing,

679
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.520
it comes with this companion object.

680
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:15.690
This is the moon.

681
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.590
The moon is a very special thing because relative to its planet,

682
00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.401
it's huge.

683
00:20:20.401 --> 00:20:22.920
This really shouldn't be thought of as a planet and a moon,

684
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.750
but rather as a double planet,

685
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:25.350
uh,

686
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.180
here they are to scale.

687
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:27.781
Uh,

688
00:20:27.781 --> 00:20:32.280
and that's much closer in s in size than any other moon planet system.

689
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:32.850
Uh,

690
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.150
around the major planets,

691
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.700
uh,

692
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:36.780
moving outward.

693
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.201
Uh,

694
00:20:37.201 --> 00:20:38.490
we come to Mars.

695
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:38.971
Uh,

696
00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:39.960
this is a,

697
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.230
uh,

698
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.980
this is about as good an image of Mars as you can get from the earth.

699
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.260
And you can see why people got excited about it.

700
00:20:46.261 --> 00:20:47.680
These blace here,

701
00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:52.150
turnout to change with time and in fact they change with the marsh and seasons.

702
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.750
So people got very excited.

703
00:20:53.751 --> 00:20:54.011
I thought,

704
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:54.581
oh my goodness,

705
00:20:54.581 --> 00:20:55.600
it's vegetation.

706
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:55.931
You know,

707
00:20:55.931 --> 00:20:56.764
the seasons come,

708
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:57.430
go.

709
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:58.000
Uh,

710
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.670
and there's an polar ice cap up there obviously.

711
00:21:00.671 --> 00:21:01.190
And,

712
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.930
uh,

713
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:02.860
a hundred years ago,

714
00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:03.560
people,

715
00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.393
uh,

716
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.290
somehow convinced themselves that there were canals and maybe cities and baby

717
00:21:08.291 --> 00:21:09.850
people all over this planet.

718
00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:10.210
Uh,

719
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:11.380
this turns out to be wrong.

720
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:12.460
It isn't vegetation.

721
00:21:12.461 --> 00:21:15.280
It's actually dust storms that changes what you see.

722
00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:16.570
And by now we have,

723
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:16.930
uh,

724
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:17.300
some,

725
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:17.370
uh,

726
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.910
much more close up views,

727
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:19.510
uh,

728
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:23.020
from things like the Viking missions and a number of more recent visions,

729
00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:23.800
missions.

730
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.510
And this is basically a,

731
00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:27.100
what the surface of Mars looks like.

732
00:21:27.101 --> 00:21:29.710
It has this slight reddish tint overall,

733
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.131
uh,

734
00:21:30.131 --> 00:21:31.270
and it's a bunch of rocks.

735
00:21:31.271 --> 00:21:32.104
It has,

736
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:32.411
uh,

737
00:21:32.411 --> 00:21:33.580
it has an atmosphere,

738
00:21:33.581 --> 00:21:36.040
although it's less thick than the earth's atmosphere.

739
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:36.670
Uh,

740
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.150
now one of the interesting things about Mars is you can see features that look

741
00:21:40.151 --> 00:21:40.984
like this.

742
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:41.650
Uh,

743
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:42.310
and uh,

744
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:46.260
this looks very much like river deltas.

745
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:46.511
You know,

746
00:21:46.511 --> 00:21:48.880
you see these little tributaries coming into a big river.

747
00:21:48.881 --> 00:21:50.170
This kind of looks like a,

748
00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:50.650
uh,

749
00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.390
Louisiana or something like that.

750
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:53.060
And so,

751
00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:53.710
yeah,

752
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:58.300
people are pretty much convinced that there was once running water on Mars a,

753
00:21:58.301 --> 00:22:03.220
and that's important because it is thought that the existence of life as we know

754
00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:03.640
it,

755
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:03.881
uh,

756
00:22:03.881 --> 00:22:04.420
is,

757
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.253
uh,

758
00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.600
is dependent on the existence of liquid water.

759
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.380
Uh,

760
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.190
for a long time people thought that there was no liquid water.

761
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:13.021
Now on Mars,

762
00:22:13.021 --> 00:22:17.470
it turns out that the particular temperature and atmospheric pressure that

763
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:18.700
exists on Mars,

764
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:19.300
uh,

765
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.760
means that water goes from the solid state,

766
00:22:21.761 --> 00:22:24.940
from ice and Sublime's directly into the,

767
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:26.363
uh,

768
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.610
into the gaseous state.

769
00:22:27.611 --> 00:22:29.500
Much like carbon dioxide does.

770
00:22:29.501 --> 00:22:30.310
Here you have.

771
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:34.580
That's why it's called dry ice because carbon dioxide when you freeze it and Wa

772
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.770
and then more met up again,

773
00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:37.030
turns directly into gas.

774
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.070
Water are supposed to do the same on Mars,

775
00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:40.870
but there was just a month ago,

776
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:41.170
uh,

777
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.250
this interesting,

778
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.113
uh,

779
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.200
picture publish.

780
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:48.610
This is from an orbiting satellite orbiting Mars that's been taking a lot of

781
00:22:48.611 --> 00:22:49.031
pictures.

782
00:22:49.031 --> 00:22:53.140
This is pictures of two identical parts of the Martian surface,

783
00:22:53.141 --> 00:22:54.490
one from 1999,

784
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.140
one from 2005.

785
00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.850
And the claim is that there's new stuff down here and that the way and the

786
00:23:00.851 --> 00:23:03.340
pattern of that new stuff and the way it must've come on.

787
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:03.760
Yes.

788
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.120
From stuff flowing down hill down the side of this crater.

789
00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:07.631
Uh,

790
00:23:07.631 --> 00:23:11.350
and so now people are thinking maybe there is something flowing around on Mars,

791
00:23:11.351 --> 00:23:12.800
although clearly not a,

792
00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:13.660
all that much of it.

793
00:23:13.661 --> 00:23:16.150
But that would be exciting if it was confirmed.

794
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:17.950
Okay.

795
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:22.950
Out Beyond Mars is the asteroid belt filled with rocky chunks of stuff that

796
00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:25.390
looked vaguely like this many,

797
00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:26.224
many of them.

798
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:28.480
There are asteroids all over the solar system.

799
00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:28.870
Uh,

800
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.780
most of them are between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter,

801
00:23:31.781 --> 00:23:33.580
but there are other families that are elsewhere.

802
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.350
Some of these other families,

803
00:23:35.351 --> 00:23:36.580
it has been suggested,

804
00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:37.120
uh,

805
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.140
come from,

806
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.650
uh,

807
00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:39.760
the asteroid belt,

808
00:23:39.761 --> 00:23:43.600
but they've had collisions or other catastrophes and have been a bumped into

809
00:23:43.601 --> 00:23:44.411
different orbits.

810
00:23:44.411 --> 00:23:49.340
But most of the asteroids in between a Mars and Jupiter now out beyond,

811
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:49.761
uh,

812
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:53.840
the asteroid belt are a number of other planets and much of what we know about

813
00:23:53.841 --> 00:23:57.170
these other planets come from a couple of satellites that look kind of like

814
00:23:57.171 --> 00:23:57.620
this.

815
00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:02.240
These are the voyager satellites that were launched in the 1970s and have been

816
00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:05.480
traveling through the outer solar system ever since.

817
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:05.781
Uh,

818
00:24:05.781 --> 00:24:07.680
this was a clever thing that they did a,

819
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:08.810
it turned out that,

820
00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:09.080
uh,

821
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.430
in the seventies and eighties,

822
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:11.540
the outer planets,

823
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:12.021
Jupiter,

824
00:24:12.021 --> 00:24:12.854
Saturn,

825
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.551
Uranus,

826
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:18.080
and Neptune were aligned in such a way that one satellite could catch them all

827
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.360
as they went past.

828
00:24:19.361 --> 00:24:23.450
And each time it goes past one of these things that uses the gravitational

829
00:24:23.451 --> 00:24:27.380
attraction of that planet to swing itself to the next one and then to the next

830
00:24:27.381 --> 00:24:27.591
one.

831
00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:28.580
And then to the next one.

832
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:29.470
And so,

833
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:29.810
uh,

834
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:34.670
these wonderful satellites for many years gave us a pictures of one planet after

835
00:24:34.671 --> 00:24:35.340
another,

836
00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:35.870
uh,

837
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:36.440
now,

838
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:36.950
uh,

839
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.930
which we now know quite a lot more about them.

840
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:39.764
We used to,

841
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.340
uh,

842
00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.960
so here's Jupiter.

843
00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.170
This is by far the most massive planet here.

844
00:24:45.171 --> 00:24:46.790
You've got the famous red spot.

845
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:51.020
All that you see here is atmosphere and it's got very elaborate weather,

846
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:51.951
uh,

847
00:24:51.951 --> 00:24:56.570
and the red spot and turns out to be a hurricane that has persisted for about

848
00:24:56.571 --> 00:24:57.890
350 years.

849
00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:58.520
Uh,

850
00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.860
to us it seems like a,

851
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.160
an almost permanent feature,

852
00:25:01.161 --> 00:25:02.720
although it's gotten fainter recently.

853
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:03.410
Um,

854
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:07.100
but it's sort of as if supposing you were a race of creatures,

855
00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:07.590
uh,

856
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:12.590
who's a lifetime was about half a day and you were observing the earth and you

857
00:25:12.861 --> 00:25:17.861
observe it for many lifetimes and you saw the same hurricane sitting down

858
00:25:17.991 --> 00:25:19.130
somewhere in the Caribbean,

859
00:25:19.131 --> 00:25:21.200
you would think that that little spot,

860
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:21.720
uh,

861
00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.180
was kind of a permanent feature.

862
00:25:23.181 --> 00:25:24.590
And that seems to be what this is.

863
00:25:24.591 --> 00:25:26.540
It's a sort of really long lasting hurricane.

864
00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.231
If you have a,

865
00:25:27.231 --> 00:25:27.920
if you have you,

866
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.480
they have time lapse movies of this,

867
00:25:29.481 --> 00:25:32.400
you can find them on the Internet where you can see that the,

868
00:25:32.401 --> 00:25:34.490
the wind is actually circulating there.

869
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:35.973
Uh,

870
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.700
Jupiter has moons.

871
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.750
Many of them,

872
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:39.830
these before,

873
00:25:39.831 --> 00:25:43.310
big ones you see here are the so called Galilean moons because they were

874
00:25:43.311 --> 00:25:44.600
discovered by Galileo.

875
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:45.080
Uh,

876
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.670
they've also included a little one there,

877
00:25:46.671 --> 00:25:48.680
many dozens of moons this size,

878
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:49.490
the moons.

879
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.130
Each of the moon's has its own peculiar characteristics.

880
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:53.990
I'm quite fond of this one.

881
00:25:53.991 --> 00:25:55.130
This is the innermost moon,

882
00:25:55.131 --> 00:25:56.090
it's called Io.

883
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:56.660
Uh,

884
00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.940
sometimes referred to as the Pepperoni pizza moon.

885
00:25:59.210 --> 00:25:59.571
Uh,

886
00:25:59.571 --> 00:26:03.890
and it's got the most elaborate volcanoes anywhere in the solar system.

887
00:26:03.891 --> 00:26:05.450
It spews up sulfur,

888
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:05.790
uh,

889
00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:06.710
all the time.

890
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:11.060
And then this software sort of melts and flows all over the surface and that's

891
00:26:11.061 --> 00:26:12.650
what gives it its particular color.

892
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.280
Each of the other moons has interesting characteristics of its own.

893
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.120
Uh,

894
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.210
here's an interesting thing that the voyager satellites discovered.

895
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.080
Uh,

896
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:21.470
uh,

897
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.990
they discovered that Jupiter has rings.

898
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.580
Uh,

899
00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.990
it was not thought that Jupiter had rings from the Earth.

900
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.890
You can't see them.

901
00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:28.250
Uh,

902
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:29.090
but from close up,

903
00:26:29.091 --> 00:26:31.580
it became apparent that Jupiter has rings,

904
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:31.911
uh,

905
00:26:31.911 --> 00:26:33.170
the same way Saturn does.

906
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:34.041
But of course,

907
00:26:34.041 --> 00:26:35.990
the Saturn rings are the most spectacular.

908
00:26:35.991 --> 00:26:36.681
Here's Saturn,

909
00:26:36.681 --> 00:26:37.610
the next planet out.

910
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:38.960
You can see it too,

911
00:26:38.961 --> 00:26:43.961
has whether banded things down here and then it has these very rings scene here

912
00:26:44.941 --> 00:26:49.170
in various different from various different angles as Saturn goes through its

913
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:49.870
orbit.

914
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:50.380
Uh,

915
00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.360
and these rings we now know are made up of a,

916
00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.770
an individual little chunks of things.

917
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:56.340
Uh,

918
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:57.390
the voyager mission,

919
00:26:57.391 --> 00:27:00.870
this is obviously artificially colored so that you can see all the different

920
00:27:00.871 --> 00:27:03.750
rings and each one of those rings is made up of many,

921
00:27:03.751 --> 00:27:03.991
many,

922
00:27:03.991 --> 00:27:05.130
many little rocks.

923
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.710
Saturn to has moons.

924
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.660
This is tightened Saturn's big moon.

925
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.770
And you can see from here in this particular picture that Titan has an

926
00:27:13.771 --> 00:27:15.900
atmosphere that makes it very interesting.

927
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.490
People have the feeling that,

928
00:27:17.491 --> 00:27:17.970
uh,

929
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:18.460
uh,

930
00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:18.900
uh,

931
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.050
places where there are atmospheres are potential sources of life.

932
00:27:22.051 --> 00:27:24.510
And so people find tighten and interesting moon.

933
00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:26.490
I actually liked this one better.

934
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:26.940
Uh,

935
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:27.571
this is me.

936
00:27:27.571 --> 00:27:28.020
Muss.

937
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.340
It's adjust a rocky moon,

938
00:27:29.341 --> 00:27:31.110
but you can see it's kind of cut.

939
00:27:31.111 --> 00:27:33.900
The great grandmother of all creditors up there.

940
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:34.231
Uh,

941
00:27:34.231 --> 00:27:38.910
this thing got slammed into by some asteroid that was just barely not big enough

942
00:27:38.911 --> 00:27:40.230
to blow the whole thing apart.

943
00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:40.991
Uh,

944
00:27:40.991 --> 00:27:43.770
and but it raised this big pucker on the side of the moon,

945
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:44.760
uh,

946
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.260
moving out to the next planet,

947
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:46.740
uh,

948
00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.380
which is Uranus in ordinary light.

949
00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:51.180
You can't actually see any features.

950
00:27:51.181 --> 00:27:51.451
Again,

951
00:27:51.451 --> 00:27:52.650
you're looking at the atmosphere.

952
00:27:52.651 --> 00:27:53.484
There are clouds.

953
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.760
Uh,

954
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.740
but this picture was taken in a particular kind of red light,

955
00:27:58.741 --> 00:28:00.840
which brings out the cloud features.

956
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.943
And uh,

957
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:06.330
what you can see is that it's got a bandage structure the same as Jupiter and

958
00:28:06.331 --> 00:28:06.840
Saturn,

959
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.100
but interestingly,

960
00:28:08.101 --> 00:28:09.420
the bands are on its side.

961
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.990
One of the peculiar features of Jupiter of your anus is that it is,

962
00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:13.530
is that,

963
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:14.010
uh,

964
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:19.010
rotate sideways rather than kind of up and down a uniquely among the planet.

965
00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.960
This planet to has rings.

966
00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:23.100
It also has moons.

967
00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.530
Here's another favorite moon of mine.

968
00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.010
Uh,

969
00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:26.970
this is Miranda.

970
00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:30.390
And this looks like what happened was that it actually did get blown apart by

971
00:28:30.391 --> 00:28:31.224
some impact,

972
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:35.070
but then fell back together again and you can see that it looks like it's been

973
00:28:35.071 --> 00:28:37.650
chopped into pieces and then sort of thrown back into,

974
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.823
uh,

975
00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:41.760
together again moving out to the next planet.

976
00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:42.810
Here's Neptune.

977
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.700
Neptune again has weather.

978
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:45.180
Uh,

979
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.180
here's the big dark spot on a Neptune.

980
00:28:48.181 --> 00:28:49.800
Similar to the big red spot on,

981
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.100
uh,

982
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.020
on Jupiter.

983
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.800
This little cloud here is called scooter because it moves faster than the,

984
00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.280
uh,

985
00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:56.980
uh,

986
00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:58.710
than the rest of the weather on Neptune.

987
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:59.880
It's actually kind of a mystery.

988
00:28:59.881 --> 00:29:01.470
How come Neptune has all this weather?

989
00:29:01.471 --> 00:29:02.880
Because it's very cold out there.

990
00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:06.240
There isn't a whole lot of energy that should be in the atmosphere and nobody

991
00:29:06.241 --> 00:29:08.250
can quite figure out how this is supposed to work.

992
00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:10.080
Neptune has moons.

993
00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:10.411
Here's,

994
00:29:10.411 --> 00:29:11.670
here's Neptune's biggest moon.

995
00:29:11.671 --> 00:29:12.570
This is Triton.

996
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:17.220
You can see this sort of frontier here between two types of typography sort of

997
00:29:17.221 --> 00:29:18.060
moves around.

998
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:18.691
Uh,

999
00:29:18.691 --> 00:29:22.290
and that is thought to be due to a weather,

1000
00:29:22.291 --> 00:29:23.130
a various kinds,

1001
00:29:23.131 --> 00:29:23.731
methane,

1002
00:29:23.731 --> 00:29:24.271
snow,

1003
00:29:24.271 --> 00:29:25.230
stuff like that.

1004
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:25.861
Uh,

1005
00:29:25.861 --> 00:29:28.950
and then by now this was the last planet,

1006
00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.120
a voyager two,

1007
00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:30.840
uh,

1008
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.910
examined and then it went past them and it took,

1009
00:29:32.911 --> 00:29:34.500
this took a lovely shot.

1010
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.800
Uh,

1011
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.310
looking back at the solar system here is Neptune and Triton.

1012
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:39.060
Uh,

1013
00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.600
as,

1014
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:39.870
uh,

1015
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.430
the voyager mission moved out,

1016
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:42.971
uh,

1017
00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:43.660
into the,

1018
00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:43.930
uh,

1019
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:46.360
outer solar system beyond the large planets.

1020
00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:48.040
Now,

1021
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.010
Pluto wasn't aligned properly to take part in this.

1022
00:29:51.011 --> 00:29:51.371
This is,

1023
00:29:51.371 --> 00:29:52.570
these are pictures of Pluto.

1024
00:29:52.571 --> 00:29:54.280
This is a picture of Pluto from the ground.

1025
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.200
Here it is from the space telescope.

1026
00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:56.621
You guys,

1027
00:29:56.621 --> 00:29:57.760
you can see it's got a moon.

1028
00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.340
This is kind of all we know about Pluto at the moment.

1029
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:04.120
There is a spacecraft that is currently on route to Pluto.

1030
00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:04.930
Uh,

1031
00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:05.770
and uh,

1032
00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:07.930
when it arrives there a couple of decades from now,

1033
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.651
decades from now,

1034
00:30:08.651 --> 00:30:09.330
I guess,

1035
00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:09.550
uh,

1036
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:10.810
we'll know much war.

1037
00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:15.340
Now you may be aware that there was a little bit of fuss about Pluto over the

1038
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:15.550
summer.

1039
00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.840
Let me show you why.

1040
00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:18.971
Here it is.

1041
00:30:18.971 --> 00:30:20.650
This is what all the fuss is about.

1042
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:24.040
This is a three pictures sort of shown as a movie.

1043
00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:25.060
See this thing over here?

1044
00:30:25.061 --> 00:30:25.894
That's moving,

1045
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.120
that's moving because unlike all the other objects in this picture,

1046
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.600
uh,

1047
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.790
that thing is not a distant star.

1048
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.190
That is a planet in the outer solar system.

1049
00:30:36.191 --> 00:30:38.680
This is the one that for a while was called Xena.

1050
00:30:38.681 --> 00:30:39.900
Now it's called Eris.

1051
00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:40.380
Uh,

1052
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:40.991
and this is,

1053
00:30:40.991 --> 00:30:42.970
these are the discovery photographs of this.

1054
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:43.510
Uh,

1055
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:44.020
then,

1056
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:44.270
uh,

1057
00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.030
as,

1058
00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:46.210
as they kept taking pictures,

1059
00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:47.380
they could plot the orbit.

1060
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:47.810
Uh,

1061
00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:50.890
they determined the orbit of the thing using an equation you've already

1062
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.521
discovered.

1063
00:30:51.521 --> 00:30:53.380
They figure out how far away it is,

1064
00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:54.130
uh,

1065
00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:56.290
from how far away it is and how bright it is.

1066
00:30:56.291 --> 00:30:57.940
You can figure out how big it is.

1067
00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:01.480
And the problem that era's present is it's bigger than Pluto.

1068
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:02.350
Uh,

1069
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:02.981
and,

1070
00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:03.814
uh,

1071
00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:08.410
said there are a whole bunch of other things out there that have also been

1072
00:31:08.411 --> 00:31:09.244
discovered.

1073
00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:09.791
Uh,

1074
00:31:09.791 --> 00:31:10.630
also,

1075
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:11.920
uh,

1076
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.570
as big or bigger than Pluto.

1077
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:14.530
Here are the eight,

1078
00:31:14.531 --> 00:31:16.330
currently largest known,

1079
00:31:16.331 --> 00:31:18.370
so called Trans Neptunian objects,

1080
00:31:18.371 --> 00:31:20.530
sometimes also called [inaudible] belt objects.

1081
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:20.950
Uh,

1082
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:21.641
here's Eris,

1083
00:31:21.641 --> 00:31:22.480
here's Pluto here.

1084
00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.410
A bunch of other ones.

1085
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:26.320
They find these things like one or two of them a year now.

1086
00:31:26.321 --> 00:31:29.900
And so we can confidently expect that 20 years from now they're going to be a

1087
00:31:29.901 --> 00:31:30.820
hundred such things.

1088
00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.230
So you have the problem.

1089
00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:32.381
Oh,

1090
00:31:32.381 --> 00:31:33.040
you should.

1091
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.300
It's worth noting these things also have moons and some of them have a moon,

1092
00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.230
uh,

1093
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.680
to,

1094
00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.160
uh,

1095
00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.160
to planet ratio similar to the Earth and the moon.

1096
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:43.720
But here's the earth for scale.

1097
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:44.770
All of them,

1098
00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.180
including Pluto and Eris,

1099
00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:47.830
very much smaller than the earth.

1100
00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.080
And so you've got yourself a problem.

1101
00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.060
If you're going to count Pluto,

1102
00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.760
how do you not count these other things?

1103
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.120
And so the first suggestion was why you ought to count Pluto.

1104
00:31:58.121 --> 00:32:00.190
And you oughta count a bunch of these other things too.

1105
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:01.510
And so there was going to be,

1106
00:32:01.511 --> 00:32:01.751
you know,

1107
00:32:01.751 --> 00:32:03.610
12 planets or something like that,

1108
00:32:03.611 --> 00:32:03.691
and,

1109
00:32:03.691 --> 00:32:05.500
and presumably many more to come.

1110
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.210
And then people decided,

1111
00:32:07.211 --> 00:32:07.481
you know,

1112
00:32:07.481 --> 00:32:08.920
the heck with this whole bunch of things,

1113
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.581
uh,

1114
00:32:09.581 --> 00:32:10.780
we'll give him a different name.

1115
00:32:10.781 --> 00:32:12.280
We won't call them planets at all.

1116
00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:13.181
Uh,

1117
00:32:13.181 --> 00:32:13.601
and,

1118
00:32:13.601 --> 00:32:13.751
uh,

1119
00:32:13.751 --> 00:32:17.200
that was what was finally determined leading to all sorts of,

1120
00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:17.441
you know,

1121
00:32:17.441 --> 00:32:20.740
safe Pluto campaigns from disgruntled third graders.

1122
00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:21.843
Uh,

1123
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:22.601
who,

1124
00:32:22.601 --> 00:32:22.811
uh,

1125
00:32:22.811 --> 00:32:23.171
yes.

1126
00:32:23.171 --> 00:32:24.010
Thank you very much.

1127
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:24.670
Uh,

1128
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:25.030
who,

1129
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:25.240
uh,

1130
00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.890
were unhappy about having to re memorize all the mnemonics that,

1131
00:32:28.891 --> 00:32:29.230
uh,

1132
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:32.050
tell you the planets and the solar says actually if you include it,

1133
00:32:32.051 --> 00:32:33.160
things like cow are,

1134
00:32:33.161 --> 00:32:33.570
you're like,

1135
00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:37.000
go get yourself into trouble trying to learn them all.

1136
00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:37.840
Uh,

1137
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.673
and uh,

1138
00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.940
they're lots and lots of these things.

1139
00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.380
Okay.

1140
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:42.870
So,

1141
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:43.190
uh,

1142
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:45.590
just a little about the geography of the solar system.

1143
00:32:45.591 --> 00:32:49.190
Here's the inner solar system out to the orbit of Jupiter with the asteroids and

1144
00:32:49.191 --> 00:32:49.700
stuff.

1145
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.520
Here's the outer solar system starting with Jupiter.

1146
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.870
Here's Pluto.

1147
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:54.320
Uh,

1148
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.260
and you'll notice that Pluto really is an elliptical orbit,

1149
00:32:57.261 --> 00:32:59.150
much more elliptical than the other planets.

1150
00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.480
It also turns out it's the orbit is tipped all the other planets,

1151
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:04.640
the orbits are in the same plane as each other.

1152
00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.070
Pluto's orbit is tipped out of the plane.

1153
00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:07.480
Uh,

1154
00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.690
here's one of the,

1155
00:33:08.691 --> 00:33:10.370
these other Trans Neptunian objects.

1156
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:13.700
Here's its orbit and you can see that it goes way,

1157
00:33:13.701 --> 00:33:14.301
way out in,

1158
00:33:14.301 --> 00:33:15.500
is highly elliptical,

1159
00:33:15.501 --> 00:33:16.640
very much out of the plane.

1160
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.960
This is in general,

1161
00:33:17.961 --> 00:33:19.190
true of these,

1162
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.580
uh,

1163
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:23.540
what are now called Dwarf Planet or Trans Neptunian objects or corporate belt

1164
00:33:23.541 --> 00:33:24.330
objects.

1165
00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:24.620
Uh,

1166
00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:28.430
but it's also true that there's a further component of the solar system.

1167
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.241
Even beyond that.

1168
00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:31.740
Here's sadness orbit that again is Sedna,

1169
00:33:31.741 --> 00:33:32.151
this orbit.

1170
00:33:32.151 --> 00:33:33.860
So we've now gone up a degree in scale,

1171
00:33:33.861 --> 00:33:38.510
and then there's this whole cloud of stuff out there called the Oort cloud.

1172
00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:38.970
Uh,

1173
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:40.160
and this is,

1174
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:41.530
uh,

1175
00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:42.920
this is where the comments live.

1176
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.810
Comments are sort of ice balls.

1177
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:45.170
Uh,

1178
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.600
we can't see them individually out in New York cloud,

1179
00:33:47.601 --> 00:33:50.870
but sometimes they collide with each other and one of them falls into the inner

1180
00:33:50.871 --> 00:33:54.320
solar system and answer does it heats up?

1181
00:33:54.321 --> 00:33:55.190
It's made out of ice.

1182
00:33:55.191 --> 00:33:57.710
The ice melt gets streams backward,

1183
00:33:57.711 --> 00:33:59.780
and we get these very spectacular things,

1184
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:00.260
uh,

1185
00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.000
comments cause all kinds of mayhem.

1186
00:34:02.001 --> 00:34:02.960
They killed dinosaurs,

1187
00:34:02.961 --> 00:34:03.794
for example.

1188
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:04.550
Uh,

1189
00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:04.971
and,

1190
00:34:04.971 --> 00:34:05.200
uh,

1191
00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:05.540
uh,

1192
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:07.430
recently we've seen an example of this.

1193
00:34:07.431 --> 00:34:11.540
This is a comic called Shoemaker Levy that's broken up into a bunch of pieces.

1194
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:13.370
And in 1994,

1195
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:15.740
those pieces slammed into Jupiter.

1196
00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:16.191
Uh,

1197
00:34:16.191 --> 00:34:18.020
and here you see the various,

1198
00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:21.140
the effect of the various pieces of this comment that,

1199
00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:22.550
that hit Jupiter.

1200
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:26.630
And so a comments can be dangerous things when they land on your planet.

1201
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:27.920
Okay.

1202
00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:28.753
Uh,

1203
00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.860
this is the outer solar system.

1204
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:31.161
Again.

1205
00:34:31.161 --> 00:34:33.140
Here's the tip orbit of Pluto.

1206
00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:34.490
That's the orbit of Neptune.

1207
00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:35.870
Here's voyager one.

1208
00:34:35.871 --> 00:34:36.770
Voyager two,

1209
00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.330
traveling now outward.

1210
00:34:38.331 --> 00:34:40.550
They are escaping from the solar system,

1211
00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:41.060
uh,

1212
00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:45.230
and the very edges of the sun's influence where you might say,

1213
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.860
uh,

1214
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:46.310
the,

1215
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.730
uh,

1216
00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:47.630
the sun,

1217
00:34:47.631 --> 00:34:51.200
the solar system ends and the interstellar medium begins,

1218
00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:51.580
uh,

1219
00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.640
are indicated here.

1220
00:34:52.641 --> 00:34:54.830
Each of these things means a slightly different,

1221
00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:55.330
uh,

1222
00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:57.230
boundary to the sun's influence.

1223
00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:57.740
Uh,

1224
00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.440
but the voyagers are going to get there sometime in our lifetime.

1225
00:35:00.441 --> 00:35:04.310
So they will be the first manmade things that actually pass out of our solar

1226
00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:05.144
system.

1227
00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:05.931
Uh,

1228
00:35:05.931 --> 00:35:07.850
and that's as far as this goes.

1229
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.133
Uh,

1230
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.390
let me turn the lights back on here.

1231
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:13.303
Um,

1232
00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.713
okay,

1233
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.030
so much for the solar system.

1234
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:20.480
Now here's the important question.

1235
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.630
I just threw a whole bunch of facts at you.

1236
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.340
Fact Information.

1237
00:35:25.341 --> 00:35:26.151
Pretty pictures.

1238
00:35:26.151 --> 00:35:29.420
We have a lot of facts and information and pretty pictures.

1239
00:35:29.421 --> 00:35:33.290
The voyagers took many thousands of pictures and uh,

1240
00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:33.950
other,

1241
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:34.400
uh,

1242
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.260
and other acquired other forms of information as well.

1243
00:35:37.261 --> 00:35:38.100
They've been many other

1244
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.160
<v 0>spacecraft flying around our solar system for quite some time.</v>

1245
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.840
We know a lot of things.

1246
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.070
Here's the question.

1247
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.900
Now that you know all this stuff,

1248
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.210
what do you do with that information?

1249
00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.160
So what,

1250
00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:51.600
uh,

1251
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.600
do you do with all this solar system and fall?

1252
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:04.000
One thing you could do is write it all down and memorize it.

1253
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:04.820
Uh,

1254
00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.060
I strongly advise against that.

1255
00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:07.990
Uh,

1256
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.410
you know,

1257
00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:10.060
this is what the Internet is for.

1258
00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.690
There are a whole bunch of websites out there that'll tell you everything you

1259
00:36:13.691 --> 00:36:18.010
could possibly want to know about all of the objects and all of the planets,

1260
00:36:18.011 --> 00:36:18.431
moons,

1261
00:36:18.431 --> 00:36:19.264
everything else.

1262
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.591
Uh,

1263
00:36:19.591 --> 00:36:22.210
so that isn't actually a productive way.

1264
00:36:22.211 --> 00:36:24.070
I don't think of spending your time.

1265
00:36:24.071 --> 00:36:25.450
So what would you rather do?

1266
00:36:25.451 --> 00:36:26.140
What would one,

1267
00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:29.320
what would be a more productive way of thinking about this material?

1268
00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:29.891
Uh,

1269
00:36:29.891 --> 00:36:33.400
and now I want to step back and remind you of how science works.

1270
00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:35.440
Remember the scientific method,

1271
00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:40.000
they probably taught you something about this when you were like 11 or 12 years

1272
00:36:40.001 --> 00:36:40.540
old,

1273
00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.160
and you'll remember how this works.

1274
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.850
Uh,

1275
00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:44.290
so scientific method,

1276
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.313
<v 3>uh,</v>

1277
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.350
<v 0>so you have a hypothesis,</v>

1278
00:36:49.351 --> 00:36:51.210
which is a fancy word for a gas.

1279
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:52.140
Uh,

1280
00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:57.140
maybe you have competing hypotheses and on the basis of this hypothesis you

1281
00:36:57.541 --> 00:36:58.170
form,

1282
00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:00.600
we formulate some kind of experiment.

1283
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:05.040
A good experiments are sometimes called controlled experiments.

1284
00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.830
And on the basis of the results of the experiment,

1285
00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:11.670
you determine how much you believe the hypothesis or which hypothesis you

1286
00:37:11.671 --> 00:37:12.121
believe.

1287
00:37:12.121 --> 00:37:12.720
And then,

1288
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:12.961
you know,

1289
00:37:12.961 --> 00:37:15.870
you may modify your hypothesis or change it altogether.

1290
00:37:15.871 --> 00:37:17.970
And the men do more experiments.

1291
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:21.000
And by iterating this procedure,

1292
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.960
uh,

1293
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.740
you develop an understanding of whatever it is you're trying to think about.

1294
00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.313
<v 3>Uh,</v>

1295
00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.173
<v 0>okay.</v>

1296
00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:30.913
No,

1297
00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.630
not really.

1298
00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.730
Certainly not in astronomy.

1299
00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.520
Astronomy doesn't work this way at all.

1300
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:40.550
Think about what an experiment would be in astronomy.

1301
00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.120
Okay.

1302
00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.400
So here's a ball of gas.

1303
00:37:43.401 --> 00:37:45.830
The size of the sun made out of pure hydrogen.

1304
00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.600
Here's another ball of gas.

1305
00:37:47.601 --> 00:37:49.610
The size of the sun made out of pure helium.

1306
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:53.060
We stick them in the sky and watch them evolve for 10 billion years.

1307
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:53.870
Okay?

1308
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:54.410
No,

1309
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:56.600
you can't do experiments in astronomy.

1310
00:37:56.601 --> 00:37:57.860
It doesn't work that way at all.

1311
00:37:57.861 --> 00:38:01.040
So there has to be some other way of approaching it.

1312
00:38:01.041 --> 00:38:05.600
And the reason for this is the distronic me is not an experimental science.

1313
00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:07.430
It's an observational science.

1314
00:38:07.431 --> 00:38:09.080
This is true of many other scientists,

1315
00:38:09.081 --> 00:38:10.080
a lot of scientists,

1316
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:11.390
a lot of biology,

1317
00:38:11.391 --> 00:38:16.310
particularly environmental or ecological aspects of biology work this way.

1318
00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:18.200
All of the social sciences,

1319
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:18.530
uh,

1320
00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:21.620
you can't do controlled experiments in child development.

1321
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:22.640
Uh,

1322
00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.600
that's just ugly.

1323
00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.633
Uh,

1324
00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:25.371
and uh,

1325
00:38:25.371 --> 00:38:28.340
so these are observational,

1326
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:29.803
uh,

1327
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:32.870
sciences and this has a different methodology.

1328
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:34.460
Uh,

1329
00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:38.680
and it starts as its name would suggest with observations and uh,

1330
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:41.410
you go out and you find a bunch of things,

1331
00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:41.740
uh,

1332
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.860
whether they're butterflies or planets or whatever they are.

1333
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.700
Uh,

1334
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.760
and what do you do when you found a whole bunch of things?

1335
00:38:48.761 --> 00:38:49.571
What's the next step?

1336
00:38:49.571 --> 00:38:52.360
The next step is classification.

1337
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:56.270
You put them into categories and uh,

1338
00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.300
it's important to get this right.

1339
00:38:58.330 --> 00:38:59.290
If you're dealing with,

1340
00:38:59.291 --> 00:38:59.951
for example,

1341
00:38:59.951 --> 00:39:03.820
animals and you classify them as things that live in the ocean and things that

1342
00:39:03.821 --> 00:39:05.290
live in live on land,

1343
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:08.410
then you're going to have fish and whales in the same category,

1344
00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:13.650
and you're going to have lizards and frogs and snakes in the same category with,

1345
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:15.160
uh,

1346
00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.710
with people and bears and things like that.

1347
00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.450
And this isn't going to lead you to,

1348
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:19.950
to,

1349
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:20.140
uh,

1350
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.020
a deep understanding because you haven't got the categories right.

1351
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:25.600
And so the classification is very important.

1352
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:30.580
And what it leads to when you get it right is a useful interpretation of what,

1353
00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:31.480
uh,

1354
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.590
what is going on.

1355
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:33.180
Uh,

1356
00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.880
this is interpretation and it's just a fancy word for a good story.

1357
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:37.361
A,

1358
00:39:37.361 --> 00:39:39.490
these are the kinds of things we write down in textbooks.

1359
00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:40.120
Uh,

1360
00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:40.510
the,

1361
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.691
uh,

1362
00:39:40.691 --> 00:39:44.500
astronomer sometimes dignify this with the fancy word scenario,

1363
00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:45.280
uh,

1364
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.960
but it's basically a story.

1365
00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:47.651
Uh,

1366
00:39:47.651 --> 00:39:49.360
and on the basis of this story,

1367
00:39:49.361 --> 00:39:49.691
you say,

1368
00:39:49.691 --> 00:39:49.901
well,

1369
00:39:49.901 --> 00:39:50.740
we'd better check out,

1370
00:39:50.741 --> 00:39:52.180
see whether this story holds up.

1371
00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:52.570
Uh,

1372
00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:54.280
let's do more observations.

1373
00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:55.180
Uh,

1374
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:55.690
and,

1375
00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:56.050
uh,

1376
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:56.290
the,

1377
00:39:56.290 --> 00:40:00.760
all of these connections work in all directions.

1378
00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:01.980
And so this is actually a,

1379
00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:06.640
a better description of how an observational science has done,

1380
00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.210
uh,

1381
00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:08.530
then this kind of thing,

1382
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:09.041
uh,

1383
00:40:09.041 --> 00:40:09.640
up here.

1384
00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.390
So,

1385
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.870
uh,

1386
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:14.530
now having gone through that little piece of philosophy,

1387
00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:15.070
uh,

1388
00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:16.450
let's apply it in practice.

1389
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.970
I've just described to you some observations,

1390
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.980
some observations of the solar system.

1391
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:24.580
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take those objects that I just showed

1392
00:40:24.581 --> 00:40:26.750
you and classified or attempt to.

1393
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.850
So,

1394
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:28.120
uh,

1395
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:28.953
let us,

1396
00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:30.100
uh,

1397
00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:30.851
classify,

1398
00:40:30.851 --> 00:40:35.851
these are now going to be categories of solar system objects.

1399
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.850
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1400
00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:41.380
<v 0>So I claim,</v>

1401
00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:41.951
uh,

1402
00:40:41.951 --> 00:40:46.510
or at least it's the start of a good story that there are six categories of

1403
00:40:46.511 --> 00:40:47.770
objects in the solar system.

1404
00:40:47.771 --> 00:40:48.830
The first is the sun,

1405
00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:49.420
uh,

1406
00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.680
which I didn't actually show you,

1407
00:40:50.681 --> 00:40:55.540
which is 99% of all of the mass in the solar system and,

1408
00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:55.990
uh,

1409
00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:00.040
almost all of the energy and a and heat and so forth.

1410
00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:03.010
Then there are the inner planets,

1411
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:03.611
uh,

1412
00:41:03.611 --> 00:41:08.611
sometimes called the terrestrial planets because the earth is the a prime

1413
00:41:09.311 --> 00:41:10.270
example.

1414
00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:11.580
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1415
00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.890
<v 0>And these are rocks.</v>

1416
00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:17.010
Basically that would be silicon iron,

1417
00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:17.700
uh,

1418
00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.060
elements like that with a very thin

1419
00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.770
surface coating of ice,

1420
00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:29.080
thin coating of ice,

1421
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.120
of ice,

1422
00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:32.403
uh,

1423
00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:35.720
in some cases melted in some cases.

1424
00:41:35.721 --> 00:41:36.380
Gaseous.

1425
00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.260
What I mean by ice is not necessarily water ice,

1426
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.010
uh,

1427
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:45.010
but also things like ammonia and methane and other compounds have that kind.

1428
00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:45.560
Uh,

1429
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:46.880
this coding is very thin.

1430
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:49.490
If you had a scale model of the earth that was six feet across,

1431
00:41:49.491 --> 00:41:50.690
you put your hand up against it.

1432
00:41:50.691 --> 00:41:53.600
You wouldn't even feel that it was wet from the oceans.

1433
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.010
So not very much.

1434
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:56.300
Uh,

1435
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.370
and these have masses,

1436
00:41:58.371 --> 00:41:59.240
these things,

1437
00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:00.380
these inner planets of,

1438
00:42:00.381 --> 00:42:00.711
I dunno,

1439
00:42:00.711 --> 00:42:02.330
10 to the minus seven to 10,

1440
00:42:02.331 --> 00:42:04.700
to the minus five of the sun.

1441
00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:05.723
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1442
00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:07.081
<v 0>Uh,</v>

1443
00:42:07.081 --> 00:42:10.410
and they're in basically circular orbits.

1444
00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.010
Then you've got the asteroids,

1445
00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:16.750
which are,

1446
00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:17.080
uh,

1447
00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.040
irregular,

1448
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:21.280
very small rocks,

1449
00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:22.390
uh,

1450
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.840
in,

1451
00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.080
uh,

1452
00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.640
mostly in orbit between,

1453
00:42:24.641 --> 00:42:24.910
uh,

1454
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:28.330
between Mars and Jupiter and out beyond the asteroids.

1455
00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:28.690
Uh,

1456
00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:33.100
you've got the outer planets sometimes called the Jovian planets.

1457
00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:34.090
Uh,

1458
00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:36.730
because Jupiter is the prime example of these things.

1459
00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:39.550
And these are quite different from the inner planet.

1460
00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.070
Uh,

1461
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:42.100
they've got a lot of gas on ice.

1462
00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:43.540
Uh,

1463
00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:44.170
uh,

1464
00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:45.100
both gas,

1465
00:42:45.101 --> 00:42:48.280
which I'm defining here to be hydrogen and helium and ice,

1466
00:42:48.281 --> 00:42:49.600
which I'm defining to be,

1467
00:42:49.601 --> 00:42:50.141
as I said,

1468
00:42:50.141 --> 00:42:50.974
water,

1469
00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:51.940
ammonia,

1470
00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:53.380
methane,

1471
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.620
<v 3>yeah.</v>

1472
00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.940
<v 0>And similar compounds.</v>

1473
00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:56.571
Uh,

1474
00:42:56.571 --> 00:42:58.100
and these are more massive,

1475
00:42:58.310 --> 00:42:59.061
uh,

1476
00:42:59.061 --> 00:43:02.870
10 to the minus four to 10 to the minus three of the sun.

1477
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:03.800
Uh,

1478
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.070
they have rings many moons.

1479
00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:09.060
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1480
00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.710
<v 0>Also circular orbits</v>

1481
00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:17.050
and all of these orbits,

1482
00:43:17.051 --> 00:43:17.540
both,

1483
00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:22.540
both these planets in these planets are basically in one plane out beyond

1484
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:30.040
the Jovian planets are these Trans Neptunian objects are quite poor belt

1485
00:43:30.041 --> 00:43:30.641
objects,

1486
00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:32.200
quite per belt objects.

1487
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:35.030
This is Pluto,

1488
00:43:35.031 --> 00:43:35.864
et cetera.

1489
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.020
We don't really know what they are yet,

1490
00:43:39.021 --> 00:43:43.160
but it seems like they're probably going to be rocky just to judge from their

1491
00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.090
size and,

1492
00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:44.331
and,

1493
00:43:44.331 --> 00:43:45.260
and mass.

1494
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:46.220
Uh,

1495
00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.120
so we think they're rocky there.

1496
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.460
A low mass,

1497
00:43:49.461 --> 00:43:52.970
less than 10 to the minus seven of the mass of the sun.

1498
00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.100
And they are in elliptical,

1499
00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:59.860
you elliptical and inclined orbits

1500
00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.770
way out there.

1501
00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:06.790
And then finally in the outer region in this so called Oort cloud,

1502
00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:08.620
you have the comments,

1503
00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:13.350
which are a little snow balls,

1504
00:44:13.351 --> 00:44:14.200
balls of ice.

1505
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:16.371
Again,

1506
00:44:16.371 --> 00:44:17.870
ice in this generic sense.

1507
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:22.820
So there's the six categories that I would claim exist in the solar system.

1508
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:25.610
And here's my problem with the whole Pluto debate.

1509
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:29.810
The Pluto debate was basically about whether these guys are going to count as

1510
00:44:29.811 --> 00:44:30.644
planets,

1511
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.960
but the thing is planets is already a bad description because it contains two

1512
00:44:36.781 --> 00:44:38.370
quite different categories,

1513
00:44:38.371 --> 00:44:42.180
namely these inner terrestrial planets and the Outer Jovian planets.

1514
00:44:42.181 --> 00:44:47.000
And so it seems to me that arguing whether category five should be part of some

1515
00:44:47.001 --> 00:44:52.001
category that already contains two fundamentally different kinds of objects,

1516
00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:52.800
uh,

1517
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.050
is kind of a strange argument to be having.

1518
00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:55.680
Uh,

1519
00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:59.550
either we should split these two things off from each other or if we're going to

1520
00:44:59.551 --> 00:45:01.410
join these two kinds of categories,

1521
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:01.921
fine.

1522
00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:03.060
Bring in anything you like.

1523
00:45:03.061 --> 00:45:04.860
I don't care at the asteroids to,

1524
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:05.810
and in fact,

1525
00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:06.990
in the original proposal,

1526
00:45:06.991 --> 00:45:09.120
one of the asteroids qualified as well.

1527
00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:09.871
Uh,

1528
00:45:09.871 --> 00:45:12.270
and so it doesn't seem to me,

1529
00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:12.930
uh,

1530
00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:13.830
that this,

1531
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:14.340
uh,

1532
00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:19.340
controversy was really paying justice to an appropriate classification of the

1533
00:45:19.861 --> 00:45:21.120
things in the solar system.

1534
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:22.530
Okay.

1535
00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:24.960
So now having classified it,

1536
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:27.420
the next step is interpretation.

1537
00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:28.860
Uh,

1538
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:33.780
and I think I will leave that.

1539
00:45:33.781 --> 00:45:35.190
Let's see how we doing for time.

1540
00:45:35.191 --> 00:45:35.431
Yes.

1541
00:45:35.431 --> 00:45:36.960
I'll leave that one for next time.

1542
00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:38.610
So the question is going to be,

1543
00:45:38.611 --> 00:45:42.120
now that you have these six kinds of objects,

1544
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:47.010
what is the story you tell about how the solar system evolved and what the

1545
00:45:47.011 --> 00:45:51.240
intern does that tell you about what other kinds of planets you should see

1546
00:45:51.241 --> 00:45:52.350
around other stars?
